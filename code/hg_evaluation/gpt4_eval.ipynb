While the source paper established the efficacy of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin, subsequent studies have focused on optimizing DAPT duration, addressing perioperative challenges, and introducing new antiplatelet agents like cangrelor.

The population will include patients with recent drug-eluting stent implantation. The intervention will involve tailoring DAPT duration based on the predictive model, while the control group will follow standard DAPT guidelines. The primary outcome will be the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and secondary outcomes will include bleeding complications.
