        "Abstract":"We admitted 48 preterm neonates (600 to 1250 gm birth weight, normal 6-hour echoencephalograms) to a randomized prospective indomethacin or placebo trial for the prevention of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage. Beginning at 6 postnatal hours, indomethacin or placebo was administered intravenously every 12 hours for a total of five doses. Cardiac ultrasound studies to assess the status of the ductus arteriosus were performed at 6 postnatal hours and on day 5. Urinary output, serum electrolytes, and renal and clotting functions were monitored. No differences in birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, or ventilatory needs were noted between the two groups. Six infants given indomethacin had intraventricular hemorrhage, compared to 14 control infants (P = 0.02). The indomethacin-treated group had significant decreases in serum prostaglandin values 30 hours after the initiation of therapy. The overall incidence of patent ductus arteriosus was 82% at 6 postnatal hours; 84% of the indomethacin-treated infants experienced closure of the ductus, compared to 60% of the placebo-treated patients. Closure of the ductus was not related to incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. We speculate that indomethacin may provide some protection against neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage by acting on the cerebral microvasculature.",

        "Abstract":"To investigate the optimal timing for treatment of small premature infants, we performed a double-blind, controlled trial of indomethacin therapy on the first day of life in 104 infants weighing between 700 and 1300 gm. Infants were given indomethacin or placebo at a mean age of 15 hours. Eleven of the 56 infants given placebo developed large left-to-right shunts through a patent ductus arteriosus. In contrast, only two of the 51 infants given indomethacin developed large shunts (P less than 0.025). There were no significant differences in incidence of surgical ligation, duration of oxygen therapy, duration of endotracheal intubation, days required to regain birth weight, or incidence of complications. However, the power of the tests of significance was low because of the small number of patients. Thus, although the incidence of large left-to-right ductus shunts was decreased in the indomethacin group, morbidity was not otherwise altered for the entire group of patients, possibly because of the relatively low incidence (21%) of large shunts in the placebo group. We conclude that although treatment with indomethacin on the first day of life appears to be safe, there is little advantage to its use in centers where the incidence of large shunts through a patent ductus arteriosus is relatively low.",

        "Abstract":"To determine the efficacy of indomethacin to prevent the occurrence of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 32 preterm infants weighing 750 to 1500 g at birth who had hyaline membrane disease. By random assignment, 15 infants were given a single dose of indomethacin, 0.2 mg\/kg intravenously, 24 hours after birth. Seventeen infants composed a control group for which indomethacin was reserved as treatment for symptomatic PDA. Birth weight, gestational age, male\/female ratio, black\/white ratio, and severity of disease were similar for both groups. Only one of the 14 survivors who received prophylactic indomethacin had symptomatic PDA, compared with nine of the 16 survivors in the control group (P = 0.007). There was no difference between the groups in development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, duration of time endotracheal intubation, was required, duration in oxygen, duration to reach full feedings and regain birth weight, and duration of hospital stay. There was no difference between the two groups in incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and none developed necrotizing enterocolitis. These results indicate that the use of prophylactic indomethacin is beneficial in prevention of symptomatic PDA; the lack of differences in pulmonary sequelae or other complications may have been related to a population sample size not large enough to impart sufficient statistical power.",

        "Abstract":"One hundred twenty-two preterm infants were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PVH-IVH). Before random assignment, data on the infants were stratified according to low-weight (500 to 999 g) or high-weight (1000 to 1500 g) subgroups. Cranial sonography was used to document the absence of PVH-IVH before enrollment and the occurrence of PVH-IVH during the 7-day protocol. Indomethacin, 0.1 mg\/kg, or placebo was administered before 12 hours of age and at 24, 48, and 72 hours of age. Five patients receiving indomethacin and six receiving placebo were withdrawn before completion of the study. In the remaining 111 patients, the indomethacin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to gestational ages, maternal complications, Apgar scores, ventilatory requirements, complications of prematurity, and mortality rate. PVH-IVH developed in six of 56 infants who received indomethacin and 11 of 55 infants who received placebo (P = 0.174). Analysis of the individual strata showed that the indomethacin-treated infants in the low-weight subgroup sustained a higher mortality rate (11\/17 vs 3\/16; P = 0.008) without a reduction in the incidence of PVH-IVH. Infants in the indomethacin-treated high-weight subgroup demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PVH-IVH (2\/39 vs 8\/39; P = 0.04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups. In summary, the prophylactic administration of intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of PVH-IVH cannot be recommended for infants less than 1000 g. In preterm infants between 1000 and 1500 g birth weight, indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of PVH-IVH.",

The trial was controlled, the infants were randomized, and the investigators were unaware of the group assignments. Patients with minimal (grade I) or no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage determined by prestudy echoencephalography were randomized within two birth weight subgroups (500 to 899 and 900 to 1300 g) to receive either prophylactic indomethacin (n = 99) or an equal volume of saline-vehicle placebo (n = 100). The first dose (0.2 mg\/kg) was given within 12 hours of delivery and two subsequent doses (0.1 mg\/kg) were administered at 12 hourly intervals. Prophylactic indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of grades II to IV periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage was half as common in infants given prophylactic indomethacin as in control infants (23% v 46%, P less than .002). The reduction was manifested in both birth weight subgroups. Results of this study also confirmed a lower incidence of clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in infants who received prophylactic indomethacin in contrast to those who received placebo (11% v 42%, P less than .001). No significant differences were found between treatment and control groups in the duration of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or hospitalization or in the incidence of pneumothorax, chronic lung disease, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, or death. Early prophylactic indomethacin initiated within 12 hours of delivery is effective in reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage as well as clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in very low birth weight premature infants.",

        "Abstract":"A prospective, random selection, double-blind clinical trial was carried out to determine the efficacy of indomethacin in preventing periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH). Babies who were born in our institution, had birth weights less than or equal to 1500 gm, and had no PV-IVH or grade 1 PV-IVH were given either placebo (n = 70) or indomethacin (n = 71), 0.2 mg\/kg intravenously at 6 hours of age and 0.1 mg\/kg at 18 and 30 hours. Two major outcomes were determined: the development of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH and the development of severe PV-IVH (i.e., hemorrhages with blood filling greater than 50% of the ventricles and in some cases with associated parenchymal echodensities). Grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH occurred in 16 (23%) of the indomethacin group and 27 (39%) of the placebo group (p less than 0.03). The incidence of severe PV-IVH was 3% in the indomethacin-treated babies and 14% in the control group (p less than 0.02). The influence of other perinatal factors on the incidence of grades 2 to 4 or severe PV-IVH was determined by stepwise logistic regression. Placebo use, early grade 1 PV-IVH, lower birth weight, and higher fraction of inspired oxygen at 6 hours of life were associated with higher estimated odds of the development of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH. Placebo use, male gender, lower 5-minute Apgar score, and a large base deficit were predictive of severe PV-IVH. Estimated odds ratios of severe PV-IVH with placebo use and male gender were 11.25:1 and 9:1, respectively. Thus indomethacin prophylaxis reduced the relative risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH and severe PV-IVH, but other perinatal variables contributed significantly to the overall risk of PV-IVH.",
