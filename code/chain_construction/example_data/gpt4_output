    },
    "6. Randomized low-dose indomethacin trial for prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight neonates": {
        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is directly related to the source paper, as it tests a variation (low dose) of indomethacin for the same condition (intraventricular hemorrhage) in a similar population.",

        "relevance": 2
    },
    "10. Low-dose indomethacin therapy and extension of intraventricular hemorrhage: a multicenter randomized trial": {
        "explanation": "This paper further investigates the extension of intraventricular hemorrhage and the use of indomethacin, specifically focusing on low-dose treatment, thus depending on the foundation laid by prior studies.",
