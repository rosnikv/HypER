Whether prophylaxis with indomethacin confers any long-term benefits that outweigh the risks of drug-induced reductions in renal, intestinal, and cerebral blood flow is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSoon after they were born, we randomly assigned 1202 infants with birth weights of 500 to 999 g (extremely low birth weight) to receive either indomethacin (0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo intravenously once daily for three days. The primary outcome was a composite of death, cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, deafness, and blindness at a corrected age of 18 months. Secondary long-term outcomes were hydrocephalus necessitating the placement of a shunt, seizure disorder, and microcephaly within the same time frame. Secondary short-term outcomes were patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, ultrasonographic evidence of intracranial abnormalities, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 574 infants with data on the primary outcome who were assigned to prophylaxis with indomethacin, 271 (47 percent) died or survived with impairments, as compared with 261 of the 569 infants (46 percent) assigned to placebo (odds ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.4; P=0.61). Indomethacin reduced the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (24 percent vs. 50 percent in the placebo group; odds ratio, 0.3; P<0.001) and of severe periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage (9 percent vs. 13 percent in the placebo group; odds ratio, 0.6; P=0.02). No other outcomes were altered by the prophylactic administration of indomethacin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn extremely-low-birth-weight infants, prophylaxis with indomethacin does not improve the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months, despite the fact that it reduces the frequency of patent ductus arteriosus and severe periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage.', 'year': 2001, 'citation_count': 623

    Examples:\n\n1. Title: Indomethacin therapy on the first day of life in infants with very low birth weight. Abstract: To investigate the optimal timing for treatment of small premature infants, we performed a double-blind, controlled trial of indomethacin therapy on the first day of life in 104 infants weighing between 700 and 1300 gm. Infants were given indomethacin or placebo at a mean age of 15 hours. Eleven of the 56 infants given placebo developed large left-to-right shunts through a patent ductus arteriosus. In contrast, only two of the 51 infants given indomethacin developed large shunts (P less than 0.025). There were no significant differences in incidence of surgical ligation, duration of oxygen therapy, duration of endotracheal intubation, days required to regain birth weight, or incidence of complications. However, the power of the tests of significance was low because of the small number of patients. Thus, although the incidence of large left-to-right ductus shunts was decreased in the indomethacin group, morbidity was not otherwise altered for the entire group of patients, possibly because of the relatively low incidence (21%) of large shunts in the placebo group. We conclude that although treatment with indomethacin on the first day of life appears to be safe, there is little advantage to its use in centers where the incidence of large shunts through a patent ductus arteriosus is relatively low.; (1985)\n2. Title: Early intravenous indomethacin prolongs respiratory support in very low birth weight infants. Abstract: Infants weighing 1500 g at birth requiring either intermittent positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure by 12 hours of age were entered in a randomized double blind controlled trial to test the efficacy of early intravenous indomethacin therapy in preventing chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity. Of the 30 newborns enrolled, 15 were treated with indomethacin and 15 were treated with placebo at 12, 24 and 36 hours of age. The groups were similar for birth weight, gestational age, sex, hyaline membrane disease and intracranial hemorrhage. Infants in the placebo group were successfully weaned from intermittent positive pressure ventilation at an earlier age than infants in the indomethacin group (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity was similar in the two groups despite a reduction in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus in the indomethacin group.; (1987)\n\nExample evaluations in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    "2.

       \n\n1. Title: Perfusion Index as a Diagnostic Tool for Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infants Abstract: Background: Perfusion index (PI) could reflect peripheral flow. Preterm infants with hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) will have left-to-right shunt across PDA causing less blood flow to the lower legs. Objective: To evaluate pre- and postductal PI differences (ΔPI) in hsPDA. Methods: Preterm infants with gestational age <34 weeks were assessed for ΔPI on days 1, 3, and 7 of life with simultaneous echocardiography. Based on echocardiography, each infant was categorized into hsPDA, non-hsPDA, and no PDA. Results: Thirty infants (16 males), median age 31 weeks (interquartile range, IQR, 29-32) and weight 1,490 g (IQR 1,100-1,670) were enrolled. On days 1 and 3 of life, the ΔPI of infants with hsPDA (1.57%, IQR 0.28-2.32, n = 14, and 1.32%, IQR 0.28-1.83, n = 10) were significantly higher than those without hsPDA (0.14%, IQR -0.03 to 0.30, n = 16, and 0.08%, IQR -0.07 to 0.26, n = 20), p = 0.009 and 0.005, respectively. At all time points (days 1, 3, and 7 of life, n = 84), ΔPI >1.05% had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 66.7, 100, 100, and 86.4%, respectively, to detect hsPDA. Conclusion: The pre- and postductal PI differences were significantly related to the hemodynamic changes of PDA and might be useful to detect hemodynamically significant PDA.\n\n2. Title: Reduction of Severe Intraventricular Hemorrhage in Preterm Infants: A Quality Improvement Project. Abstract: OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this quality improvement project was to reduce the rate of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (sIVH) by 50% within 3 years for extremely preterm infants born at a children\'s teaching hospital.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multidisciplinary team developed key drivers for the development of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. Targeted interventions included the development of potentially better practice guidelines, promoting early noninvasive ventilation, consistent use of rescue antenatal betamethasone, and risk-based indomethacin prophylaxis. The outcome measure was the rate of sIVH. Process measures included the rate of intubation within 24 hours and receipt of rescue betamethasone and risk-based indomethacin prophylaxis. Common markers of morbidity were balancing measures. Data were collected from a quarterly chart review and analyzed with statistical process control charts. The preintervention period was from January 2012 to March 2016, implementation period was from April 2016 to December 2018, and sustainment period was through June 2020.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the study period, there were 268 inborn neonates born at <28 weeks\' gestation or <1000 g (127 preintervention and 141 postintervention). The rate of sIVH decreased from 14% to 1.2%, with sustained improvement over 2 and a half years. Mortality also decreased by 50% during the same time period. This was associated with adherence to process measures and no change in balancing measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA multipronged quality improvement approach to intraventricular hemorrhage prevention, including evidence-based practice guidelines, consistent receipt of rescue betamethasone and indomethacin prophylaxis, and decreasing early intubation was associated with a sustained reduction in sIVH in extremely preterm infants.\n\n3. Title: Differential effects of ibuprofen and indomethacin on cerebral oxygen kinetics in the very preterm baby Abstract: Background Ibuprofen is preferred to indomethacin for treatment of a significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm babies despite indomethacin being associated with a lower risk of intraventricular haemorrhage. This difference is thought to relate to the discrepant effects of each medication on cerebral oxygen kinetics yet the effect of ibuprofen on cerebral perfusion is uncertain. Methods Forty-eight babies < 30 weeks with a significant PDA, defined by echocardiography, were randomly assigned to either indomethacin or ibuprofen (n = 24 per group) and stratified by gestation and chronologic age. Cerebral blood flow [total internal carotid blood flow (TICF)] and oxygen physiology [oxygen delivery (modCerbDO2) and consumption (modCerbVO2)] were measured using cranial Doppler ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy, and cerebral oxygen extraction (cFTOE) calculated, immediately before and following administration. Temporal and treatment related changes were analysed. Results A fixed effect of time was seen for TICF (p = 0.03) and therefore modCerbDO2 (p = 0.046) and cFTOE (p = 0.04) for indomethacin alone. In the indomethacin group, TICF and modCerbDO2 fell from baseline to 5 and 30 min respectively (TICF p < 0.01, cDO2 p = 0.01) before increasing from 5 min to 24 h (p < 0.01) and 30 min and 24 h (p < 0.01) timepoints. cFTOE peaked at 30 min (p = 0.02) returning to baseline at 24 h. There was a parallel increase in arterial lactate. Conclusion Indomethacin significantly reduces cerebral blood flow soon after administration, resulting in a parallel increase in oxygen extraction and arterial lactate. This implies that the balance of oxygen kinetics at the time of treatment may be critical in very preterm babies with significant PDA.\n\n
