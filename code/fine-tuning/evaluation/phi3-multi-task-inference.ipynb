PAPER TITLE: Long-Term Results of Endovascular Therapy With Nitinol Stent Implantation for TASC II A/B Femoro-Popliteal Artery Lesions\\n   ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Although in clinical practice endovascular therapy (EVT) with a nitinol stent for femoro-popliteal artery (FPA) lesions has been widely applied for TASC II A/B lesions, primary patency beyond 2 years remains unknown, as do the factors associated with restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS A prospectively maintained database that included 189 limbs treated with nitinol stents for de novo TASC II A/B FPA lesions was retrospectively analyzed. The outcomes were overall primary and secondary patency during the follow-up period and predictors associated with restenosis. Primary patency overall with nitinol stents was 84%, 82%, 80%, 80% and secondary patency was 96%, 93%, 90%, 90% at 12, 24, 36, 48 months, respectively. Primary patency was not statistically different between the 2 types of nitinol stents (Luminexx vs S.M.A.R.T. Control. stent, P=0.37) during follow-up period. From the multivariate analysis, administration of cilostazol was the strongest independent factor associated with restenosis (P=0.0012). CONCLUSIONS Nitinol stent implantation for TASC II A/B FPA lesions is suitable and durable in sustaining freedom from restenosis through 4 years of follow-up.\\nYear: 2009\\n3. PAPER TITLE: Long-term Outcomes and Risk Stratification of Patency Following Nitinol Stenting in the Femoropopliteal Segment: Retrospective Multicenter Analysis\\n   ABSTRACT: Purpose To investigate the long-term outcomes of nitinol stenting in femoropopliteal lesions and to determine the factors associated with restenosis. Methods Between December 2003 and December 2009, 861 patients (603 men; mean age 72 years) underwent nitinol stenting of the femoropopliteal segment in 1017 limbs. A quarter (26%) of the patients had critical limb ischemia. Mean lesion length was 152±93 mm. Stent patency was assessed by either duplex ultrasound or angiography and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimation. The determinants of restenosis were explored with Cox proportional hazard regression analyses; the results are presented as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk stratification of primary patency was subsequently analyzed using a score based on the significant prognostic factors identified in the multivariate model. Results Stent fracture occurred in 10% (104 limbs) of the lesions. At 1, 3, and 6 years, the primary patency rates were 77%, 67%, and 63%; secondary patency rates were 91%, 87%, and 87%; freedom from femoropopliteal bypass grafting was 99%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified female gender (HR 1.899; 95% CI 1.318 to 2.737, p<0.001), ankle-brachial index <0.6 (HR 1.921; 95% CI 1.348 to 2.736, p<0.001), TASC II C/D lesion (HR 2.068; 95% CI 1.346 to 3.177, p=0.0009), stent fracture (HR 1.937; 95% CI 1.203 to 3.118, p=0.006), and the absence of cilostazol administration (HR 2.102; 95% CI 1.394 to 3.172, p<0.001) as strong independent factors associated with restenosis. After assigning a risk score based on the outcomes of the multivariate regression analysis (1 each for female gender, ABI <0.6, TASC II C/D, stent fracture, and absence of cilostazol therapy), primary patency was found to be lower in limb groups with a higher cumulative score (12-month primary patency: score 0: 93%, score 1: 80%, score 2: 73%, score 3; 47%, score 4: 0%, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusions Endovascular therapy using nitinol stents for FP lesions yielded acceptable outcomes up to 6 years. Risk stratification for patency can play an important role in estimating future occurrence of restenosis after nitinol stent implantation in FP lesions.\\nYear: 2011\\n4. PAPER TITLE: An Overview of Optimal Endovascular Strategy in Treating the Femoropopliteal Artery: Mechanical, Biological, and Procedural Factors\\n   ABSTRACT: Abstract Treatment of the femoropopliteal (FP) artery remains a challenge to the endovascular specialist. Long-term patency is low with a high rate of target lesion revascularization. The true patency rate varies considerably between studies partly because there is a lack of uniform performance criteria and reporting standards in peripheral arterial interventions. Literature review supports three principles that emerge as important components of an optimal strategy in treating the FP artery: (1) improving vessel compliance and subsequently less dissections and bailout stenting, (2) reducing smooth muscle cell proliferation, and (3) protecting outflow vessels from distal embolization. In this overview, we examine current data that support the validity of this strategy.\\nYear: 2013\\n5. PAPER TITLE: Prospective Randomized Study of Sarpogrelate Versus Clopidogrel-based Dual Antiplatelet Therapies in Patients Undergoing Femoropopliteal Arterial Endovascular Interventions: Preliminary Results\\n   ABSTRACT: Background:Sarpogrelate is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtype 2A antagonist which blocks 5-HT induced platelet aggregation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. We compared the efficacy of sarpogrelate-based dual antiplatelet therapies for the prevention of restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates comparing with that of clopidogrel after percutaneous endovascular interventions (EVIs) of femoropopliteal (FP) arterial lesions. Methods:This prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial recruited a total of 120 patients with successful EVI of FP lesions at seven centers across China between January 2011 and June 2012. Patients were randomized to receive either sarpogrelate (100 mg trice daily for 6 months, n = 63) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily for 6 months, n = 57). All patients also received oral aspirin (100 mg once daily for 12 months). Clinical follow-up was conducted up to 12 months postprocedure. Results:There was no significant difference between the two groups in basic demographic data. The restenosis rate was higher in the clopidogrel group (22.80%) than in sarpogrelate group (17.50%), but there was no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.465). The TLR rate, ipsilateral amputation rate, mortality in all-cause and bleeding rate were also similar in the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions:Aspirin plus sarpogrelate is a comparable antithrombotic regimen to aspirin plus clopidogrel after EVI of FP arterial lesions. Dual antiplatelet therapies might play an important role in preventing restenosis after successful EVI of FP lesions.\\nYear: 2015\\n6. PAPER TITLE: Antiplatelet Therapy of Cilostazol or Sarpogrelate with Aspirin and Clopidogrel after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using the Korean National Health Insurance Claim Database\\n   ABSTRACT: Background/Objectives Addition of cilostazol or sarpogrelate to the standard dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel has been implemented in patients that underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stents in Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple antiplatelet therapies. Methods This retrospective cohort study was performed using the Korean National Insurance Claim Data of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014. The study cohort population consisted of patients with ischemic heart diseases and a history of PCI. They were treated with antiplatelet therapy of aspirin, clopidogrel (AC); aspirin, clopidogrel, cilostazol (ACCi); or aspirin, clopidogrel, sarpogrelate (ACSa) during the index period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011. During the follow-up period up to December 31, 2014, the major adverse cardiac or cerebral events (MACCE) including death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, and ischemic stroke were assessed. Bleeding complications were also evaluated as adverse drug events. Results Out of 93,876 patients with PCI during the index period, 69,491 patients started dual (AC) or triple therapy (ACSa or ACCi). The clinical outcomes of comparing ACSa and ACCi therapy showed beneficial effects in the ACSa group in the prevention of subsequent cardiac or cerebral events. After Propensity score-matching between ACSa and ACCi groups, there were significant differences in MI and revascularization, with corresponding HR of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.20–0.73) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53–0.82) in ACSa vs. ACCi at 12 months, respectively. At the 24-month follow-up, the triple therapy groups (ACS or ACC) had a higher incidence of MACCE compared to the dual therapy (AC) group; ACSa vs. AC HR of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.62–1.77); ACC vs. AC HR of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.06–1.41). There was no significant difference in severe or life-threatening bleeding risk among three groups; ACSa vs. AC, HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.37–1.24), ACCi vs. AC, HR of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.77–1.09). Conclusion Sarpogrelate-containing triple antiplatelet therapy demonstrated comparable rates of MACCE prevention to the conventional dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI without significantly increasing bleeding risk during the two-year follow-up period.\\nYear: 2016\\n7. PAPER TITLE: Sarpogrelate Based Triple Antiplatelet Therapy Improved Left Ventricular Systolic Function in Acute Myocardial Infarction: Retrospective Study\\n   ABSTRACT: Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the potential benefit of a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, sarpogrelate-based triple antiplatelet therapy (TAPT) in comparison with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Materials and Methods 119 patients of STEMI were retrospectively assessed. All patients received aspirin and clopidogrel per standard of care. Among them, 53 patients received an additional loading dose of sarpogrelate and a maintenance dose for 6 months post-PCI (TAPT group), while others did not (DAPT group). Results The rates of complete ST-segment resolution at 30 minutes post-PCI and post-procedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow were not significantly different between the two groups (52.8% vs. 48.5%, p=0.200; 92.5% vs. 89.4%, p=0.080). In addition, no significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to 30-day and 12-month clinical outcomes (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, target vessel revascularization, and severe bleeding). Meanwhile, improvement in left ventricular (LV) systolic function was observed in the TAPT group [ΔLV ejection fraction (LVEF)=17.1±9.4%, p<0.001; Δglobal longitudinal strain (GLS)=−9.4±4.2% , p<0.001] at 6 months, whereas it was not in the DAPT group (ΔLVEF= 8.8±6.5%, p=0.090; ΔGLS=−4.6±3.4%, p=0.106). In multivariate analyses, TAPT was an independent predictor for LV functional recovery (odds ratio, 2.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–5.87; p=0.003). Conclusion Sarpogrelate-based TAPT improved LV systolic function at 6 months in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI.\\nYear: 2017\\n8. PAPER TITLE: Blockade of 5‐HT2 receptors with sarpogrelate uncovers 5‐HT7 receptors inhibiting the tachycardic sympathetic drive in pithed rats\\n   ABSTRACT: Our group has previously shown in pithed rats that the cardiac sympathetic drive, which produces tachycardic responses, is inhibited by 5‐HT via the activation of prejunctional 5‐HT1B/1D/5 receptors. Interestingly, when 5‐HT2 receptors are chronically blocked with sarpogrelate, the additional role of cardiac sympatho‐inhibitory 5‐HT1F receptors is unmasked. Although 5‐HT2 receptors mediate tachycardia in rats, and the chronic blockade of 5‐HT2 receptors unmasked 5‐HT7 receptors mediating cardiac vagal inhibition, the role of 5‐HT7 receptors in the modulation of the cardiac sympathetic tone remains virtually unexplored. On this basis, male Wistar rats were pretreated during 14 days with sarpogrelate (a 5‐HT2 receptor antagonist) in drinking water (30 mg/kg/day; sarpogrelate‐pretreated group) or equivalent volumes of drinking water (control group). Subsequently, the rats were pithed to produce increases in heart rate by either electrical preganglionic spinal (C7‐T1) stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic drive or iv administration of exogenous noradrenaline. The iv continuous infusion of AS‐19 (a 5‐HT7 receptor agonist; 10 µg/kg/min) (i) inhibited the tachycardic responses to sympathetic stimulation, but not those to exogenous noradrenaline only in sarpogrelate‐pretreated rats. This inhibition was completely reversed by SB258719 (a selective 5‐HT7 receptor antagonist; 1 mg/kg, iv) or glibenclamide (an ATP‐sensitive K+ channel blocker; 20 mg/kg, iv). These results suggest that chronic 5‐HT2 receptor blockade uncovers a cardiac sympatho‐inhibitory mechanism mediated by 5‐HT7 receptors, involving a hyperpolarization due to the opening of ATP‐sensitive K+ channels. Thus, these findings support the role of 5‐HT7 receptors in the modulation of the cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission.\\nYear: 2019\\n9. PAPER TITLE: Fluoxetine Treatment Decreases Cardiac Vagal Input and Alters the Serotonergic Modulation of the Parasympathetic Outflow in Diabetic Rats\\n   ABSTRACT: Comorbid diabetes and depression constitutes a major health problem, worsening associated cardiovascular diseases. Fluoxetine’s (antidepressant) role on cardiac diabetic complications remains unknown. We determined whether fluoxetine modifies cardiac vagal input and its serotonergic modulation in male Wistar diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by alloxan and maintained for 28 days. Fluoxetine was administered the last 14 days (10 mg/kg/day; p.o). Bradycardia was obtained by vagal stimulation (3, 6 and 9 Hz) or i.v. acetylcholine administrations (1, 5 and 10 μg/kg). Fluoxetine treatment diminished vagally-induced bradycardia. Administration of 5-HT originated a dual action on the bradycardia, augmenting it at low doses and diminishing it at high doses, reproduced by 5-CT (5-HT1/7 agonist). 5-CT did not alter the bradycardia induced by exogenous acetylcholine. Decrease of the vagally-induced bradycardia evoked by high doses of 5-HT and 5-CT was reproduced by L-694,247 (5-HT1D agonist) and blocked by prior administration of LY310762 (5-HT1D antagonist). Enhancement of the electrical-induced bradycardia by 5-CT (10 μg/kg) was abolished by pretreatment with SB269970 (5-HT7 receptor antagonist). Thus, oral fluoxetine treatment originates a decrease in cardiac cholinergic activity and changes 5-HT modulation of bradycardic responses in diabetes: prejunctional 5-HT7 receptors augment cholinergic-evoked bradycardic responses, whereas prejunctional 5-HT1D receptors inhibit vagally-induced bradycardia.\\nYear: 2022\\n10. PAPER TITLE: Renal Sympathetic Hyperactivity in Diabetes Is Modulated by 5-HT1D Receptor Activation via NO Pathway\\n   ABSTRACT: Renal vasculature, which is highly innervated by sympathetic fibers, contributes to cardiovascular homeostasis. This renal sympathetic outflow is inhibited by 5-HT in normoglycaemic rats. Considering that diabetes induces cardiovascular complications, we aimed to determine whether diabetic state modifies noradrenergic input at renal level and its serotonergic modulation in rats. Alloxan diabetic rats were anaesthetized (pentobarbital; 60 mg/kg i.p.) and prepared for in situ autoperfusion of the left kidney to continuously measure systemic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and renal perfusion pressure (RPP). Electrical stimulation of renal sympathetic outflow induces frequency-dependent increases (Δ) in RPP (23.9 ± 2.1, 59.5 ± 1.9, and 80.5 ± 3.5 mm Hg at 2, 4, and 6 Hz, respectively), which were higher than in normoglycaemic rats, without modifying HR or SBP. Intraarterial bolus of 5-HT and 5-CT (5-HT1/5/7 agonist) reduced electrically induced ΔRPP. Only L-694,247 (5-HT1D agonist) reproduced 5-CT inhibition on sympathetic-induced vasoconstrictions, whereas it did not modify exogenous noradrenaline-induced ΔRPP. 5-CT inhibition was exclusively abolished by i.v. bolus of LY310762 (5-HT1D antagonist). An inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, ODQ (i.v.), completely reversed the L-694,247 inhibitory effect. In conclusion, diabetes induces an enhancement in sympathetic-induced vasopressor responses at the renal level. Prejunctional 5-HT1D receptors, via the nitric oxide pathway, inhibit noradrenergic-induced vasoconstrictions in diabetic rats.\\nYear: 2023\\n',\n",
