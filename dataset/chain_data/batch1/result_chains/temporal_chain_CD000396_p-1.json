        "title": "The natural course of acute sciatica with nerve root symptoms in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of piroxicam.",
        "abstract": "To study the natural history of acute sciatica, 208 patients with obvious symptoms and signs of a lumbar radiculopathy (L5 and S1) were examined within 14 days of onset. A concomitant double-blind investigation of the effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam was performed. The results measured by visual analog scale and Roland's functional tests showed a satisfactory improvement throughout the 4 weeks of observation. The piroxicam-treated group had same results as the control group. Based on questionnaires at months 3 and 12 approximately 30% of the patients still complained about back trouble and 19.5% were out of work after 1 year. Four patients underwent surgery during this period.",

        "title": "CT changes after conservative treatment for lumbar disk herniation.",
        "abstract": "In order to assess changes occurring to lumbar disk herniations and bulges and to the disk spaces after conservative treatment, a follow-up CT was carried out of 106 pathologic disks in 92 patients at a mean interval of 14 months after the initial examination. There was a strong association between the evolution of the hernias and clinical results, with a decrease in size of the majority of hernias in successfully treated patients, whereas the others essentially remained unchanged (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of large hernias diminished as compared to the smaller ones (p < 0.0001). Diffuse disk bulges were associated with a poor outcome and never regressed. There was a lower incidence of diminution of the central hernias compared to other locations. Patients with normal disk space at the initial examination had a better outcome than those with disk space narrowing. Only occasionally was a reduction of the disk space observed at follow-up.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the changes in lumbar disk herniations after conservative treatment, which is partially dependent on the understanding of the natural course of acute radiculopathy presented in the source paper. The paper's findings on the association between the evolution of hernias and clinical results can be seen as a sub-hypothesis of the source paper's findings."

        "title": "Clinical Results after Percutaneous Automated Lumbar Nucleotomy",
        "abstract": "This study was carried out in order to assess the clinical results after percutaneous automated nucleotomy with regard to predictive factors for the outcome. Selection criteria included patients with predominance of low-back pain, diffuse posterior disk bulges and concomitant spinal stenosis who are not normally accepted for nucleotomy. In all, 142 patients were treated. The overall success rate after an average observation time of 21 months was 56%. The results were not influenced by whether a diffuse posterior bulge or a focal hernia had been treated or not (p=0.449). Spinal stenosis (p=0.043) and disk space narrowing exceeding 25% of the expected width (p=0.017) were associated with a poor outcome. By excluding these categories and patients with symptoms from more than one disk level, the success rate rose to 70%. With this selection, the results were equally good in patients with predominantly low-back pain compared to those with predominantly sciatica (p=0.490).",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the clinical results after percutaneous automated nucleotomy and discusses predictive factors for the outcome, which includes disk space narrowing. Although the paper does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it does relate to the topic of disk herniation treatment and mentions disk space narrowing, which was observed in the source paper. However, it does not directly use the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis, and the connection is more topical than methodological or result-based."

        "title": "Retropsoas positioned bowel: incidence and clinical relevance.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nOur goal was to assess the incidence of retropsoas positioned large or small bowel in the population and to examine factors predisposing to its formation.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe presence of retropsoas positioned bowel was retrospectively studied in 1,852 abdominal CT examinations of 1,055 men and 797 women, 648 younger and 1,204 older than 50 years. All examinations were considered normal or demonstrated findings that were unrelated to the position of the bowel.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRetropsoas positioned colon (RPC) was observed in 51 (2.8%) cases for the ascending and 45 (2.3%) for the descending colon. RPC appeared more frequently in younger (< 50 years) than older patients and in individuals with decreased amount of retroperitoneal fat. Retropsoas position of small bowel loops was observed in 11 (0.6%) patients, all exhibiting paucity of retroperitoneal fat.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBecause of its prevalence, retropsoas positioned bowel should be considered when performing percutaneous diskectomy or other interventional procedures in the posterior retroperitoneum.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the incidence and clinical relevance of retropsoas positioned bowel, which is related to the source paper's topic of percutaneous automated nucleotomy. The paper highlights the importance of considering retropsoas positioned bowel when performing percutaneous diskectomy or other interventional procedures in the posterior retroperitoneum, which is relevant to the source paper's findings on nucleotomy. However, the paper does not directly build upon or use the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis, so it is given a relevance score of 1."
