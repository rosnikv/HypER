        "abstract": "In a previous pilot study, we demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) appears to be feasible and safe in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and may result in an attenuated rise in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), more rapid resolution of pain and ST changes. This randomized multicenter trial was organized to further assess the safety and feasibility of this treatment in human subjects. Patients with an AMI treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) or streptokinase (STK), were randomized to treatment with HBO combined with either rTPA or STK, or rTPA or STK alone. An analysis included 112 patients, 66 of whom had inferior AMIs (p = NS). The remainder of the patients had anterior AMIs. The mean CPK at 12 and 24 h was reduced in the HBO patients by approximately 7.5% (p = NS). Time to pain relief was shorter in the HBO group. There were 2 deaths in the control and 1 in those treated with HBO. The left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) on discharge was 51.7% in the HBO group as compared to 48.4% in the controls (p = NS). The LVEF of the controls was 43.4 as compared to 47.6 for those treated, approximately 10% better (no significant difference). Treatment with HBO in combination with thrombolysis appears to be feasible and safe for patients with AMI and may result in an attenuated CPK rise, more rapid resolution of pain and improved ejection fractions. More studies are needed to assess the benefits of this treatment.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that raising myocardial O2 via diffusion of a hyperbaric oxygen solution (AO) administered through the anterior interventricular vein (AIV) will reduce infarct size by reducing reperfusion injury associated with reduced neutrophil activation. In three pilot open-chest swine experiments, myocardial tissue Po2 was monitored using an oxygen probe during coronary occlusion (Occl) and reperfusion (Rep). One control experiment had no AIV infusion; a second control received arterial blood drawn from the femoral artery infused into the AIV during Rep. In a third open-chest experiment, AO mixed with arterial blood was infused through the AIV at Rep. In controls, tissue Po2 in the risk region (RR) rose early in Rep and then fell to Occl levels, whereas in AO-treated animals, myocardial Po2 remained above baseline. The following three groups of five swine then underwent 60 min of left anterior descending coronary artery Occl and Rep: 1) arterial blood infused at Rep as controls (Con), 2) AO infused beginning 30 min after Rep (AO 30 min), and 3) AO infused immediately at Rep (AO 0 min). There were no differences among the three groups in hemodynamics or myocardial blood flow during baseline (BL) or Occl or in RR size. However, endocardial blood flow was significantly higher in RR during Rep in AO 0 min vs. control and AO 30 min (P=0.01). Both infarct size (IS) as %heart and IS as %RR were lower in AO 0 min compared with Con and AO 30 min (P <0.01 for both), and myeloperoxidase values were lower for epicardial (P <0.001), midmyocardial (P=0.03), and endocardial (P <0.001) layers in AO 0 min. AO infused into the AIV immediately at Rep diffuses into the RR and reduces IS by reducing Rep injury associated with neutrophil activation.",

        "title": "HYPERBARIC OXYGENATION APPLIED IMMEDIATELY AFTER CORONARY OCCLUSION REDUCES MYOCARDIAL NECROSIS AND ACUTE MORTALITY IN RATS",
        "abstract": "1 Because in ischaemia there is a critical lack of O2, it has been reasoned that increasing O2 delivery to the ischaemic myocardium could serve as adjunctive therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI). Accordingly, in the present study, the effect of early hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) on mortality and MI size after coronary occlusion was examined in rats. 2 After coronary occlusion, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive either HBO for 1 h in a hyperbaric chamber (100% O2 at 253 kPa; n = 106) or ambient O2 as the control (n = 111). The extent of myocardial necrosis was assessed (triphenyltetrazolium) immediately after treatment in the HBO (n = 50) and control (n = 47) groups. The remaining rats were evaluated 24 h after occlusion to enable calculation of MI size and mortality. 3 Immediately after therapy, the size of the MI was significantly greater in the control group compared with that in the HBO group (40 \u00b1 3 vs 27 \u00b1 2% of the left ventricle (LV), respectively; P < 0.001). The 24 h mortality of control rats was higher than that of HBO rats (34 vs 16%, respectively; P = 0.02). Control rats that survived 24 h had a larger MI than did HBO rats that survived 24 h (40 \u00b1 4 vs 29 \u00b1 3% of the LV, respectively; P = 0.005). Furthermore, large necrotic areas (> 40% of the LV) were more frequent in control than HBO rats (55 vs 27% of infarcted hearts, respectively; P = 0.01). There was less pulmonary congestion observed in HBO rats compared with control rats. 4 In conclusion, early therapy with HBO during the onset of an acute ischaemic event decreases the necrotic area and reduces acute mortality. These data support further investigation of HBO as an adjuvant therapy for acute MI.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo investigate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) chamber treatment in mouse models of retinal ischemia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUnilateral central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or optic nerve crush (ONC) was induced in 50 mice each, of which 30 were treated with 100% oxygen at 2 atm for 90 minutes immediately after injury and then daily for up to 14 days. Mice were euthanatized on days 1, 3, and 21 for histologic analysis, apoptosis assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction test. Findings were analyzed by injury and by treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHBO treatment reduced cell loss from 58% to 30% in the CRAO model and from 52% to 32% in the ONC model. In both models, it was associated with significantly increased cell survival in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Expression levels of the proapoptosis genes (bax, caspase-3) decreased minimally in the HBO-treated CRAO mice on day 1, but this trend was reversed on day 3. In the ONC group, levels of caspase-3, bax, and bcl-x increased on day 1 and dropped below baseline on day 3. The pattern of changes in the expression levels of the ischemia- and oxidative-stress-related genes (HO-1, SOD-1, GPX-1, NOX-2) and the effectiveness of HBO treatment varied by model. Overall, however, gene expression levels that increased in the untreated mice increased further with HBO treatment and levels that decreased, decreased further with treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHBO treatment protects injured neuronal cells from apoptosis. Response to treatment differs molecularly after ONC or CRAO. These results should prompt clinical trials of acute ischemic retinal damage.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo evaluate the effect of bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, on optic nerve edema and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in a mouse model of optic nerve crush (ONC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred C57BL/6 wild-type mice were anesthetized. Right ONC was induced in 150 mice, of which half (n = 75) received an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab immediately thereafter and half (n = 75) did not. The remaining 50 received only bevacizumab. The left eyes served as a control. Findings were analyzed by fluorescein angiography (days 0, 1, 3), histologic and immunohistochemical tests (days 1, 3, 4, 21), and quantitative real-time PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAngiography revealed a reduction in postinjury disc leakage following bevacizumab injection (days 1, 3), confirmed with IgG staining. On PCR, expression of HO-1 and SOD-1 mRNA increased following ONC and further increased with bevacizumab. VEGF gene expression decreased following bevacizumab injection without ONC, remained at baseline after ONC, and increased slightly after ONC+bevacizumab. Histologically, there was a 38% RGC loss 21 days after ONC alone, which dropped to 14% with bevacizumab treatment; it was close to 15% with bevacizumab alone. Mean (SEM) microvascular perfusion in the optic nerve 4 days after ONC was significantly higher in the bevacizumab-treated (85% \u00b1 10%) than the vehicle-treated (33% \u00b1 13%) animals.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBevacizumab treatment following ONC induction exerts a protective effect, manifested by reduced optic nerve head edema. The underlying mechanism probably involves a lesser interruption of axonal transport. Reduced expression of antioxidative and ischemic genes may contribute to RGC preservation.",

        "abstract": "The nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) signaling appears to play a key role in inhibiting neuroinflammation and preventing the activation of a proapop totic pathway, thereby promoting neural cell survival. In addition, evidence indicates that cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway is involved in the modulation of glial cell activity. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which hydrolyzes cGMP in the inactive form, 5\u02b9GMP, is present throughout the body and brain and has emerged as a potential thera peutic target for diseases related to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pro - cesses, since their inhibition leads to accumulation of cGMP. The objective of this chapter is to review current knowledge of NO/cGMP signaling pathways on neuroinflammation and the potential therapeutic use of PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) in neurological diseases. The extensive, while recent, literature on the effects of PDE-Is on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), and stroke has been reviewed. mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt) extended polyglutamine at huntingtin gene, intraneuronal events death. time, this either causes or contributes to neuroinflammation. downstream target BACE1, also leads to cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), contributing to the formation of A\u03b2 plaques. PDE5-Is induce a decrease in the activity of calpain, p25, and CDK5, with consequent decrease in protein aggregation. GSK3\u03b2 is a kinase involved in the hyperphosphorylation of Tau. In addition, through the downstream target, cathepsin B, GSK3\u03b2 leads to the formation of A\u03b2 plaques. pAkt is a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor, modulating the pathway. PDE-Is increase Akt phosphorylation and decrease GSK3\u03b2 activity and cathepsin B expression, which can contribute to control the protein aggregation. by PDE5-Is, which may be important for the control of leukocyte infiltration. It is possible that complex cross signaling is occurring, but although it has been demonstrated in inflammatory models, it has not been confirmed in preclinical studies with PDE5-Is in neurological diseases. For example, elevated levels of cGMP by NO may inhibit PDE3 activity, which leads to increased cAMP levels and PKA activation. PKA inhibits NF-\u03baB transcription activity and, subsequently, the expression of downstream MCP-1 and VCAM-1. stress, which activate the initiator pro-caspase-9. Proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, BH3- only members, activate other proapoptotic proteins, such as BAX, and antagonize antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2. Subsequently, the mitochondrial outer membrane is disrupted, and its permeability increases, resulting in cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) leakage into the cytosol. Cyt-c in the cytosol forms a complex with Apaf-1, called the apoptosome, which assists in auto-activation of initiator pro-caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.",

        "title": "Evidence Supporting the Hypothesis That Inflammation-Induced Vasospasm Is Involved in the Pathogenesis of Acquired Sensorineural Hearing Loss",
        "abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss is mainly acquired and affects an estimated 1.3 billion humans worldwide. It is related to aging, noise, infection, ototoxic drugs, and genetic defects. It is essential to identify reversible and preventable causes to be able to reduce the burden of this disease. Inflammation is involved in most causes and leads to tissue injury through vasospasm-associated ischemia. Vasospasm is reversible. This review summarized evidence linking inflammation-induced vasospasm to several forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. The link between vasospasm and sensorineural hearing loss is directly evident in subarachnoid haemorrhage, which involves the release of vasoconstriction-inducing cytokines like interleukin-1, endothelin-1, and tumour necrosis factor. These proinflammatory cytokines can also be released in response to infection, autoimmune disease, and acute or chronically increased inflammation in the ageing organism as in presbyacusis or in noise-induced cochlear injury. Evidence of vasospasm and hearing loss has also been discovered in bacterial meningitis and brain injury. Resolution of inflammation-induced vasospasm has been associated with improvement of hearing in autoimmune diseases involving overproduction of interleukin-1 from inflammasomes. There is mainly indirect evidence for vasospasm-associated sensorineural hearing loss in most forms of systemic or injury- or infection-induced local vascular inflammation. This opens up avenues in prevention and treatment of vascular and systemic inflammation as well as vasospasm itself as a way to prevent and treat most forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Future research needs to investigate interventions antagonising vasospasm and vasospasm-inducing proinflammatory cytokines and their production in randomised controlled trials of prevention and treatment of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Prime candidates for interventions are hereby inflammasome inhibitors and vasospasm-reducing drugs like nitric oxide donors, rho-kinase inhibitors, and magnesium which have the potential to reduce sensorineural hearing loss in meningitis, exposure to noise, brain injury, arteriosclerosis, and advanced age-related and autoimmune disease-related inflammation.",

It is also unclear whether all lifestyles that contribute to dementia do so through the same intermediary steps. This article will focus on three lifestyles known to be risk factors for dementia, namely obesity, sedentary behavior, and insufficient sleep, and offer a unifying hypothesis proposing that lifestyles that negatively impact cognition do so through the same sequence of events: inflammation, small vessel disease, decline in cerebral perfusion, and brain atrophy. The hypothesis will then be tested in a recently identified risk factor for dementia, namely hearing deficit.

This study aimed to determine the association between MRI-visible PVS burden and the risk of incident dementia. Methods This study included community-dwelling Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants with available brain MRI-PVS ratings, free of stroke and dementia. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the association between MRI-visible PVS and incident dementia. PVS were rated using validated methods in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). The outcomes included all-cause dementia, Alzheimer dementia (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD). Results One thousand four hundred forty-nine participants 50 years or older (46% male) were included. Over a median follow-up period of 8.3 years, the incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD was 15.8%, 12.5%, and 2.5%, respectively. In models that adjusted for vascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease, the hazard for dementia increased steadily as PVS burden increased, rising 2-fold for those with grade II PVS (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.51\u20133.93) to 5-fold in participants with grade IV (HR 5.05, 95% CI 2.75\u20139.26) compared with grade I PVS in CSO. In the BG, hazards increased 1.6-fold (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15\u20132.27) for grade II to 2.6-fold (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.04\u20136.88) for grade IV compared with grade I PVS. The association remained significant for CSO but not for BG, after adjustment for white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), covert infarcts, and total brain volume. Similar findings were observed for AD, but VaD, limited by a small number of events, was not statistically significant. Discussion Higher burden of PVS in CSO was associated with increased risk of developing dementia, independent of vascular risk factors, total brain volume, WMHVs, and covert infarcts. This finding supports a role for PVS as a subclinical MRI marker to identify individuals in subclinical stages at high risk of developing dementia who may benefit from early intervention.",

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Perivascular spaces (PVS) are usually enlarged in small vessel disease (SVD). However, the significance of PVS patterns in different locations is uncertain. Hence, we analyzed the distribution of PVS in patients with a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI) and their correlation with clinical and imaging factors. Materials and Methods: In a cohort of 71 patients with an RSSI with complete clinical data, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), we segmented PVS in white matter (WM-PVS), basal ganglia (BG-PVS), and brainstems (BS-PVS) on 3T-MRI T2-weighted sequences, obtaining fractional volumes (%), and calculated the WM/BG-PVS ratio. We analyzed the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between PVS regional loads. We used normalized PVS measures to assess the associations with clinical and MRI-SVD features (white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), number of lacunes, and microbleeds) in univariable and multivariable linear regressions adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension. Results: In our cohort (mean age 70 years; 27% female), the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between WM-PVS/BG-PVS, WM-PVS/BS-PVS, and BG-PVS/BS-PVS were 0.67, 0.61, and 0.59 (all p < 0.001). In the adjusted models, BG-PVS were associated with lacunes (p = 0.034), WMHs (p = 0.006), and microbleeds (p = 0.017); WM-PVS with lacunes (p = 0.003); while BS-PVS showed no associations. The WM/BG-PVS ratio was associated with lacunes (p = 0.018) and the PSQI (p = 0.046). Conclusions: PVS burdens in different regions are highly correlated in patients with RSSI but with different SVD patterns. Sleep quality impairment might affect waste removal mechanisms differently in the WM and BG regions.",
