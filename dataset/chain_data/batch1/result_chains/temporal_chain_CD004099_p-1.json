        "title": "Crisis Intervention Program in Newly Diagnosed Diabetic Children",
        "abstract": "A group of 223 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, aged 7\u201324 yr, who had been under the regular care of our clinic up to 15 yr, were rated by two independent judges on a two-level scale of adjustment and maladjustment. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (N = 107) comprised those who had been under care from diagnosis of the disease and had been subjected to the special crisis intervention program offered to every family upon referral of a newly diagnosed patient. Group B (N = 116) comprised patients who were diagnosed and treated initially in a clinic that had no crisis intervention program. Significant differences between the two groups were found in respect to three of the four aspects studied, i.e., compliance, familial relationships, and sociability, with group A showing a better adjustment than group B. There was no significant difference in the fourth aspect studied, i.e., school achievement and work performance. It was found that it took three times the effort, i.e., the time invested in counseling and psychotherapeutic measures, to bring group B to a good level of adjustment than it did to achieve similar results with group A. It is suggested that the initial period after diagnosis of diabetes in a child should be considered a period of crisis, requiring special muitidisciplinary services to reduce future psychosocial maladjustments and improve compliance.",

        "abstract": "Although the role of emotional and psychosocial factors in diabetes is generally appreciated, most health care professionals, diabetic patients, and families of patients have no clear model that clarifies the nature of psychosocial variables and provides defined principles for effective treatment and preventative interventions. A multivariate clinical model for coping with predictable crises of diabetes is presented. The model is based on the constructs of crisis, coping, and social support as well as a developmental and life course perspective. The psychosocial tasks to be addressed in coping with crises, in general, as well as strategies of coping are defined and discussed. The specific predictable crises of diabetes are described with reference to the demands and sources of stress inherent in the critical situations and the associated strategies for coping with them. Special attention is given to coping with the initial diagnosis and onset of the disease, the role of health care professionals, and developmental issues in coping with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe purposes of this study were to describe how persons with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) accept their disease and what sense of coherence they have, in order to determine whether a person's acceptance of the disease is related to his or her sense of coherence. Whether acceptance of the disease and sense of coherence are related to the disease duration, complications of the disease, metabolic control and demographic data would also be determined.\n\n\nDESIGN\nOne hundred and seven, randomly selected, insulin-dependent, diabetic subjects (47 men and 60 women) participated in the study. The Acceptance of Disability Scale Modified (ADM scale), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC scale), a study-specific questionnaire and the patients records were used to collect the data.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nIDDM implies a major change in way of life. Ingrained procedures and patterns of behaviour must be adapted to the disease and its treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results of the present study show that educational level seems to be an important factor for how well a person accepts the disease and the sense of coherence. Persons with higher scores on the ADM and the SOC scales had higher levels of education. Moreover, they also had a better metabolic control. Individuals with a poor metabolic control had more disease-related complications. A significant correlation between the ADM and the SOC scores was found, indicating that persons with a high degree of acceptance of the IDDM also had a high coping capability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is important to individualize the care of subjects with IDDM and to identify the persons with low acceptance of their disease and a low sense of coherence.",

        "abstract": "The coexistence of diabetes and depression occurs frequently among young and middle-age women. Unless one is resourceful, simultaneous management of the symptoms of both conditions is especially challenging. Skills constituting resourcefulness are learned throughout life and are important for the optimal performance of daily activities. Little is known about specific factors that influence resourcefulness. In this study, contextual factors (diabetic and depressive symptoms) and cognitive factors (positive cognitions and acceptance of diabetes) were examined as antecedents of learned resourcefulness in 82 women with type 2 diabetes. Regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms and positive cognitions were significant antecedents of learned resourcefulness: Positive cognitions mediated the effects of depressive symptoms on learned resourcefulness. The findings suggest the need for interventions that focus on development of positive cognitions to better promote resourcefulness in women with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for depression.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInvestigate psychosocial barriers to self-care and the prevalence of depression among Hispanic women with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS\nOne hundred twenty-six (126) Hispanic women living in Miami-Dade, South Florida were recruited through outpatient diabetes clinics, physicians' offices, or community referrals to participate in a cross-sectional survey to assess psychosocial factors that can interfere with type 2 diabetes self-care. The survey collected information on sociodemographics, performance of self-care regimens, a diabetes care profile (support, knowledge, empowerment, and attitudes), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), health locus of control, and perceived stress, as well as other data used to evaluate diabetes status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 4 of the 126 diabetic women interviewed reported having had depression previously assessed. Mean for depression scores was 12.76 +/- 8.71. Scores on the depression inventory indicated depression in 40.6% of subjects, with 23% categorized as mildly, 11.1% moderately, and 6.3% severely depressed. Greater self-assessed depression was associated with poorer self-rated health, understanding of diabetes, and diabetes knowledge scores. Subjects classified as severely depressed had lived with diabetes for a significantly longer mean number of years than those classified as moderately, mildly, or minimally depressed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDepression had not been previously assessed by any healthcare providers seen by participants or addressed in most participants in this study. While the literature abounds with findings on the depression in diabetes and potential for improved compliance when depression is treated, this concept seems to not yet be adopted into mainstream diabetes care for our Hispanic population.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this study was to explore knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about depression among Latinos with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight 90-minute focus groups were conducted, each moderated by a bilingual, bicultural woman. Participants included 45 self-identified Latino adults with diabetes. Discussion topics included diabetes management, perceived control, emotional barriers, conceptualization of depression, and help-seeking behavior. Themes pertinent to depression and emotional health were identified using a combined deductive/inductive approach and an iterative process of consensus coding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants' mean age was 40 years, 44% were male, and most were born in Mexico. The mean time with diabetes was 6.5 years. The primary theme identified was the bidirectional relationship between emotional health and diabetes. Diagnosis of diabetes led to feelings of hopelessness and upset, while difficulty with diabetes management led to feelings of anxiety and depression. Participants felt that being \"stressed out\" or sad directly affected their blood sugar. Participants described factors that influence the relationship between emotions and diabetes, including family and societal stressors, and they reported little discussion of depression with providers. Depression and emotional health are closely associated with diabetes in the minds of these Latino adults. It is important to ask patients with diabetes about their emotional health, to screen for depression, and to elicit preferences about treatment when indicated.",

Promotoras and community members from a community-based project requested their university partner to help promotores address depression observed in their clients with diabetes. Methods Data collection included reviewing existing educational materials and conducting focus groups. Promotoras piloted the first version of SONRISA in a 1-day workshop. Results Four curricula from community agencies were reviewed, and 49 individuals participated in eight focus groups. Promotora feedback during the workshop informed the revision of SONRISA. The community-based participatory approach produced a highly relevant and culturally appropriate toolbox for general use by promotores and their clients. SONRISA provides training material to address depression and diabetes, educational material for clients, and approaches to prevent work-related emotional burnout. Conclusion SONRISA offers an innovative, integrated approach to training promotores to address depression among their clients with chronic illnesses. It is culturally appropriate and adaptable to other populations.",

        "title": "12-Month Outcomes of Community Engagement Versus Technical Assistance to Implement Depression Collaborative Care",
        "abstract": "Depression and depressive symptoms are main causes of disability in the United States (1, 2), where racial disparities persist in access to and quality and outcomes of care (39). Depression collaborative care provided in primary care settings can improve quality and outcomes of care for depressed adults while reducing outcome disparities by race (1018), but safety-net primary care settings generally have limited capacity for full implementation of collaborative care (1921). Encouraging safety-net clinics to collaborate with other key agencies (for example, social services or faith-based organizations) using community engagement (2226) may support successful implementation of depression collaborative care across underresourced communities. Community Partners in Care (CPIC) was designed to compare the effects of 2 depression collaborative care implementation approaches: 1) community engagement and planning (CEP), which supports collaborative planning and implementation across myriad community programs, and 2) more traditional resources for services (RS) models, which rely on time-limited expert technical assistance for collaborative care to individual programs (2729). Earlier studies concluded that at 6 months, compared with RS, CEP reduced the probability of poor mental healthrelated quality of life (MHRQL) among depressed clients, increased their physical activity, and reduced risk factors for homelessness (2830). Moreover, CEP reduced behavioral health hospitalizations and specialty medication visits among visitors to mental health specialists while increasing use of primary care, faith-based, and park-based services for depression among such clients. To our knowledge, CPIC is the first randomized U.S. study of the added value of CEP beyond more traditional expert assistance to individual programs and the first depression collaborative care study to span the health care and social community sectors. We examined the effects of CEP over RS on poor MHRQL and services use at 6 and 12 months, as well as changes in outcomes from baseline to 6 months and baseline to 12 months. We hypothesized that compared with RS, CEP would decrease the proportion of clients with poor MHRQL at 12 months. Methods Study Design Community Partners in Care is a group-level randomized comparative effectiveness trial comparing CEP with RS. Both interventions were designed to provide extensive depression collaborative care training to mental health, medical, and community-based agencies. The RS model provided preset, time-limited training to individual agencies, whereas CEP encouraged these diverse agencies to develop a strategy and training plan to jointly provide care for depression (Table 1 in Data Supplement 4). The interventions and study methods are described elsewhere (2831). Data Supplement 4. Data Supplement The study and CEP intervention were guided by community-partnered participatory research principles (3235), a community-based participatory research variant (36, 37) promoting equal authority among community and academic partners (Data Supplement 1). The study council, co-led by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); RAND Corporation; Healthy African American Families II; Behavioral Health Services; and QueensCare Health and Faith Partnership supported workgroups and community forums for study input (2731, 38, 39). Data Supplement 1. Community Partners in Care: 6-Month Client Outcomes Setting The study took place in 2 Los Angeles County communities: South Los Angeles and Hollywood-Metro. These communities have high rates of poverty and avoidable hospitalizations and low rates of insurance (4042). We hosted community meetings to identify community-based settings that support vulnerable depressed populations, with the aim of oversampling from these settings, which included mental health, primary care, public health, substance abuse, and social services; faith-based programs; parks; senior centers; hair salons; and exercise clubs. South Los Angeles partners emphasized inclusion of large samples of substance abuse clients and African American persons, whereas Hollywood-Metro emphasized homeless clients and seniors. Participants and Randomization Programs We began by identifying a pool of relevant agencies and organizations through county program lists and nominations from community partners. We then contacted each to assess interest, eligibility, and enrollment. This process resulted in a pool of 60 potentially eligible agencies with 194 programs. Programs were eligible if they served 15 or more clients per week, had 1 or more staff members, and did not focus exclusively on psychotic disorders or home services. A total of 133 of these 194 programs were potentially eligible. Within each community, programs or clusters of smaller programs were paired on the basis of location, service sector, size, population served, services provided, and funding streams; 2 larger agencies were their own single stratum. Within pairs, one program or cluster was randomly assigned to CEP and the other to RS (43). A statistician uninvolved with recruitment supported council members in producing seed numbers for randomization (44). The 133 programs were randomly assigned to the interventions (65 to RS and 68 to CEP) (Figure). After randomization, RAND staff who were blinded to assignment conducted site visits to finalize enrollment; 20 programs were determined ineligible, 18 declined participation, and 95 programs from 50 consenting agencies were enrolled (46 in RS and 49 in CEP) (Figure). Figure. Study flow diagram. Five programs (2 in the RS group and 3 in the CEP group) had no clients with data for outcome analysis. CEP = community engagement and planning; RS = resources for services. Administrators were informed of intervention status by letter. Participating and nonparticipating agencies were similar in terms of clients' age, sex, and race; population density; and client income by ZIP code (each P> 0.10), as determined by analysis of census tract data. Clients To achieve a 6-month follow-up sample of 780 depressed clients, we planned to enroll 557 to 600 clients per intervention (assuming 65% to 70% retention). We powered the study to identify a detectable effect size ranging from 0.20 to 0.22 and a percentage point difference between groups ranging from 9.98 to 10.91, assuming 80% power with a 2-sided value of 0.05 and an intraclass correlation coefficient assumed to range from 0.00 to 0.02 (43, 45, 46). Within programs, clients were screened in waiting rooms (approached consecutively) or at events (approached randomly) from March to November 2010. Allocating 2 to 3 days per program, RAND staff who were blinded to intervention status approached 4649 adults (aged 18 years) allocating 2 to 3 days per program; of these, 4440 (95.5%) agreed to screening. Eligibility was limited to clients who provided contact information and had at least mild depressive symptoms, as indicated by a score of 10 or greater on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (47). Of 4440 persons screened, 1322 (29.8%) were eligible; 1246 (94.3%) of eligible persons enrolled, a high rate for such studies (11, 14, 16). Between April 2010 and January 2011, 981 clients (79% of those enrolled) completed a baseline telephone survey conducted by RAND survey staff who were blinded to intervention. Of 1093 participants approached for 6-month telephone follow-up surveys between November 2010 and August 2011, 759 (70%) participated. Of 974 participants approached for 12-month telephone follow-up surveys between May 2011 and March 2012, 733 (75%) participated. Data Supplement 2 shows the survey questions. We did not attempt to contact 272 participants because their survey response at baseline (n= 153) or 6 months (n= 119) was final refusal, ill, incarcerated, unable to contact, or dead. Data Supplement 2. CPIC Client Baseline Questionnaire Our analytic sample comprises 1018 individuals (77% of eligible; 82% of enrolled) who completed 1 or more surveys at baseline, 6 months, or 12 months (Figure). Characteristics of persons who completed the 12-month survey differed from those did not complete it by intervention: The RS group had significantly higher nonresponse rates among men, clients recruited from substance abuse programs, and those with no health insurance. In the CEP group, responders were more likely to have lower family income and to be African American (Tables B2 to B4 in Data Supplement 3). Data Supplement 3. Supplementary Technical Appendix Interventions The compared interventions, CEP and RS, were designed to expose a range of health care and social community agencies to the same depression collaborative care toolkits. Between December 2009 and July 2011, CEP supported program administrators to work as councils: one in Hollywood-Metro and another in South Los Angeles. Each council met biweekly over 5 months to adapt depression care toolkits and trainings to each community. In addition, each council developed plans for a coordinated services network across health care and social community programs to support depressed adults. Planning was co-led by community and academic council members following community-partnered participatory research principles (for example, shared authority and 2-way knowledge exchange) (39) (Table 1 in Data Supplement 4). In RS, technical assistance was offered to assigned programs for the depression care toolkits by using a train-the-trainer model. Between December 2009 and July 2010, training was conducted through 10 webinars plus site visits to primary care for each community (39). Trainers included a nurse care manager, a cognitive-behavioral therapist who was a licensed psychologist, 3 board-certified psychiatrists for medication management, and community service administrators to support participation and cultural competence. The CPIC Council modified depression collaborative care toolkits (48) that supported clinician assessment, medication",

Methods: This study analyzed clients living above (n = 268) and below (n = 750) the federal-poverty level and, among the poor, 3 nonoverlapping subgroups: justice-involved (n = 158), homeless and not justice-involved (n = 298), and other poor (n = 294). Matched programs (n = 93) from health and community sectors were randomly assigned to community engagement and planning (CEP) or resources for services (RS). Primary outcomes were poor mental health\u2013related quality of life and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores, whereas community-prioritized and utilization outcomes were secondary. Effects were scrutinized using false discovery rate\u2013adjusted P values to account for multiple comparisons. Results: In the impoverished group, CEP and RS clients of participating study programs did not differ in primary outcomes, but CEP more than RS improved mental wellness among the depressed poor (unadjusted P = .004) while providing suggestive evidence for other secondary outcomes. Within the poor subgroups, evidence favoring CEP was only suggestive but was strongest among justice-involved clients. Conclusions: A coalition approach to improving outcomes for low-income clients with depression, particularly those involved in the justice system, may offer additional benefits over standard technical assistance programs.",

        "title": "Outcomes of two quality improvement implementation interventions for depression services in adults with substance use problems",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Comorbid depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) are associated with poor health and social outcomes disproportionately affecting under-resourced communities. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that a coalition approach to collaborative care (CC) for depression would improve outcomes of hazardous drinking and behavioral health hospitalizations, relative to technical assistance, for individuals with comorbid substance use problems. Substance use problems were defined by meeting criteria for DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence, hazardous drinking by AUDIT-C, or treatment in a SUD program within the prior 6 months. Methods: Two depression CC implementation approaches were compared: Resources for Services (RS) provided expert technical support for CC toolkits to individual programs. Community engagement and planning (CEP) supported multi-sector coalitions in collaborating in planning, adapting, implementing and monitoring CC toolkits. One thousand eighteen individuals with depression (PHQ-8 \u226510) enrolled. Regression analyses estimated intervention effects in participants with comorbid substance use problems (n = 588, 281 females, 307 males). Substance use problems were defined by meeting criteria for DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence, hazardous drinking by AUDIT-C, or treatment in a SUD program within the prior 6 months. Results: There were no significant baseline differences by intervention status among participants with depression and substance use problems. Intervention effects on primary outcomes including depression were not significant at 6 months. Compared to RS, CEP significantly reduced alcohol consumption (CEP = 1.6, RS = 2.1, p = .038), probability of behavioral health hospitalizations (OR = 0.50, p = .036), and use of specialty mental health visits (IRR = 0.52, p = .027), while increasing use of faith-based depression services (IRR = 3.4, p = .001). Conclusions: Given feasibility and possible benefits, CEP should be considered a promising approach to implementing depression CC with potential benefits to adults with comorbid substance use problems.",

        "title": "The Association Between Depression and Substance Use Among Primary Care Patients With Comorbid Medical and Behavioral Health Conditions",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The scope of primary care increasingly encompasses patient behavioral health problems, manifest typically through depression screening and treatment. Although substance use is highly comorbid with depression, it is not commonly identified and addressed in the primary care context. This study aimed to examine the association between the likelihood of substance use disorder and increased depression severity, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, among a sample of 2409 patients from 41 geographically dispersed and diverse primary care clinics across the US. Methods: This is secondary analysis of data obtained from a multi-site parent study of integrated behavioral health in primary care, among patients with both chronic medical and behavioral health conditions. Patient reported outcome surveys were gathered from patients at 3 time points. The primary care practices were blind to which of their patients completed surveys. Included were standardized measures of depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire\u20149) [PHQ-9] and substance use disorder likelihood (Global Appraisal of Individual Needs\u2014Short Screener [GSS]). Results: Four percent of the study population screened positive for substance use disorder. PHQ-9 scores indicated depression among 43% of all patients. There was a significant association between the likelihood of substance use disorder and depression initially, at a 9-month follow-up, and over time. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, and other patient and contextual characteristics. Conclusions: The findings suggest that substance use disorder is associated with depression severity cross-sectionally and over time. Primary care clinics and health systems might consider implementing substance use screening in addition to the more common screening strategies for depression. Especially for patients with severe depression or those who do not respond to frontline depression treatments, the undermining presence of a substance use disorder should be explored.",
