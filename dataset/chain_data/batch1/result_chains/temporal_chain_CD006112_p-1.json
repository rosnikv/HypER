        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on inspiratory muscle function (IMF), diaphragm thickness, lung function, physical work capacity (PWC), and psychosocial status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwenty-nine adult patients with CF were randomly assigned to three groups. Two groups were required to complete an 8-week program of IMT in which the training intensity was set at either 80% of maximal effort (group 1; 9 patients) or 20% of maximal effort (group 2; 10 patients). A third group of patients did not participate in any form of training and acted as a control group (group 3; 10 patients).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nIn all patients, baseline and postintervention measures of IMF were determined by maximal inspiratory pressure (Pimax), and sustained Pimax (SPimax); pulmonary function, body composition, and physical activity status were also determined. In addition, diaphragm thickness was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) [TDIcont], and the diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) was calculated (TR = thickness during Pimax at FRC/mean thickness at FRC). Subjects also completed an incremental cycle ergometer test to exhaustion and two symptom-related questionnaires, prior to and following training.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing training, significant increases in Pimax and SPimax (p < 0.05), TDIcont (p < 0.05), TR (p < 0.05), vital capacity (p < 0.05), TLC (p < 0.05), and PWC (p < 0.05) were identified, and decreases in anxiety scores (p < 0.05) and depression scores (p < 0.01) were noted in group 1 patients compared to group 3 patients. Group 2 patients significantly improved Pimax and SPimax (both p < 0.05) only with respect to group 3 patients. No significant differences were observed in group 3 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn 8-week program of high-intensity IMT resulted in significant benefits for CF patients, which included increased IMF and thickness of the diaphragm (during contraction), improved lung volumes, increased PWC, and improved psychosocial status.",

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine whether high-intensity IMT resulted in changes in ventilatory function and exercise capacity in subjects who were healthy.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nTwenty subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe training group completed an 8-week program of IMT set at 80% of maximal effort. The control group did not participate in any form of training. Baseline and posttraining measures of body composition, pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle function (including maximal and sustained maximal inspiratory pressures [MIP and SMIP]), relaxed and contracted diaphragm thickness and thickening ratio (Tdi.rel, Tdi.cont, and TR), and exercise capacity were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe training group demonstrated significant increases in MIP, SMIP, Tdi.cont, TR, VC, total lung capacity, and exercise capacity compared with the control group, which demonstrated no change from baseline measurements at 8 weeks.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nThe findings of this study suggest that high-intensity IMT results in increased contracted diaphragm thickness and increased lung volumes and exercise capacity in people who are healthy.",

        "title": "Respiratory muscle training improves swimming endurance at depth.",
        "abstract": "Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has been shown to improve divers swimming endurance at 4 feet of depth; however, its effectiveness at greater depths, where gas density and the work of breathing are substantially elevated has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of resistance respiratory muscle training (RRMT) on respiratory function and swimming endurance at 55 feet of depth (270.5 kPa). Nine male subjects (25.9 +/- 6.8 years) performed RRMT for 30 min/day, 5 d/ wk, for 4 wks. Pre- and Post RRMT, subjects swam against a pre-determined load (70% VO2 max) until exhausted. As indices of respiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures were measured before and immediately following the swims pre- and post-RRMT. These measurements showed that ventilation was significantly lower during the swims and, at comparable swim duration, that the respiratory muscles were considerably less fatigued following RRMT. The reduced ventilation was due to a lower breathing frequency following RRMT. The ventilatory changes following RRMT coincided with significantly increased swimming time to exhaustion (approximately 60%, 31.3 +/- 11.6 vs. 49.9 +/- 16.0 min, pre- vs. post-RRMT, p < 0.05). These results suggest respiratory muscle fatigue limits swimming endurance at depth as well as at the surface and RRMT improves performance.",

        "title": "Effects of hyperoxia on ventilation and pulmonary hemodynamics during immersed prone exercise at 4.7 ATA: possible implications for immersion pulmonary edema.",
        "abstract": "Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) can occur in otherwise healthy swimmers and divers, likely because of stress failure of pulmonary capillaries secondary to increased pulmonary vascular pressures. Prior studies have revealed progressive increase in ventilation [minute ventilation (Ve)] during prolonged immersed exercise. We hypothesized that this increase occurs because of development of metabolic acidosis with concomitant rise in mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and that hyperoxia attenuates this increase. Ten subjects were studied at rest and during 16 min of exercise submersed at 1 atm absolute (ATA) breathing air and at 4.7 ATA in normoxia and hyperoxia [inspired P(O(2)) (Pi(O(2))) 1.75 ATA]. Ve increased from early (E, 6th minute) to late (L, 16th minute) exercise at 1 ATA (64.1 +/- 8.6 to 71.7 +/- 10.9 l/min BTPS; P < 0.001), with no change in arterial pH or Pco(2). MPAP decreased from E to L at 1 ATA (26.7 +/- 5.8 to 22.7 +/- 5.2 mmHg; P = 0.003). Ve and MPAP did not change from E to L at 4.7 ATA. Hyperoxia reduced Ve (62.6 +/- 10.5 to 53.1 +/- 6.1 l/min BTPS; P < 0.0001) and MPAP (29.7 +/- 7.4 to 25.1 +/- 5.7 mmHg, P = 0.002). Variability in MPAP among subjects was wide (range 14.1-42.1 mmHg during surface and depth exercise). Alveolar-arterial Po(2) difference increased from E to L in normoxia, consistent with increased lung water. We conclude that increased Ve at 1 ATA is not due to acidosis and is more consistent with respiratory muscle fatigue and that progressive pulmonary vascular hypertension does not occur during prolonged immersed exercise. Wide variation in MPAP among healthy subjects is consistent with variable individual susceptibility to IPE.",

        "title": "Risk factors for immersion pulmonary edema: hyperoxia does not attenuate pulmonary hypertension associated with cold water-immersed prone exercise at 4.7 ATA.",
        "abstract": "Hyperoxia has been shown to attenuate the increase in pulmonary artery (PA) pressure associated with immersed exercise in thermoneutral water, which could serve as a possible preventive strategy for the development of immersion pulmonary edema (IPE). We tested the hypothesis that the same is true during exercise in cold water. Six healthy volunteers instrumented with arterial and PA catheters were studied during two 16-min exercise trials during prone immersion in cold water (19.9-20.9\u00b0C) in normoxia [0.21 atmospheres absolute (ATA)] and hyperoxia (1.75 ATA) at 4.7 ATA. Heart rate (HR), Fick cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), central venous pressure (CVP), arterial and venous blood gases, and ventilatory parameters were measured both early (E, 5-6 min) and late (L, 15-16 min) in exercise. During exercise at an average oxygen consumption rate (Vo(2)) of 2.38 l/min, [corrected] CO, CVP, and pulmonary vascular resistance were not affected by inspired (Vo(2)) [corrected] or exercise duration. Minute ventilation (Ve), alveolar ventilation (Va), and ventilation frequency (f) were significantly lower in hyperoxia compared with normoxia (mean \u00b1 SD: Ve 58.8 \u00b1 8.0 vs. 65.1 \u00b1 9.2, P = 0.003; Va 40.2 \u00b1 5.4 vs. 44.2 \u00b1 9.0, P = 0.01; f 25.4 \u00b1 5.4 vs. 27.2 \u00b1 4.2, P = 0.04). Mixed venous pH was lower in hyperoxia compared with normoxia (7.17 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 7.20 \u00b1 0.07), and this result was significant early in exercise (P = 0.002). There was no difference in mean PAP (MPAP: 28.28 \u00b1 8.1 and 29.09 \u00b1 14.3 mmHg) or PAWP (18.0 \u00b1 7.6 and 18.7 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg) between normoxia and hyperoxia, respectively. PAWP decreased from early to late exercise in hyperoxia (P = 0.002). These results suggest that the increase in pulmonary vascular pressures associated with cold water immersion is not attenuated with hyperoxia.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nImmersion pulmonary edema (IPE) occurs in swimmers (especially triathletes) and scuba divers. Its pathophysiology and risk factors are incompletely understood. This study was designed to establish the prevalence of preexisting comorbidities in individuals who experience IPE.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom 2008 to May 2010, individuals who had experienced IPE were identified via recruitment for a physiological study. Past medical history and subject characteristics were compared with those available in the current body of literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, 36 subjects were identified (mean age = 50.11 \u00b1 10.8 yr), of whom 72.2% had one or more significant medical conditions at the time of IPE incident (e.g., hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias or structural abnormality or dysfunction, asthma, diabetes mellitus, overweight or obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism). Forty-five articles were included, containing 292 cases of IPE, of which 24.0% had identifiable cardiopulmonary risk factors. Within the recreational population, cases with identifiable risk factors comprised 44.9%. Mean age was 47.8 \u00b1 11.3 yr in recreational divers/swimmers and 23.3 \u00b1 6.4 yr in military divers/swimmers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCardiopulmonary disease may be a common predisposing factor in IPE in the recreational swimming/diving population, whereas pulmonary hypertension due to extreme exertion may be more important in military cases. Individuals with past history of IPE in our case series had a greater proportion of comorbidities compared to published cases. The role of underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction may be underestimated, especially in older swimmers and divers. We conclude that an episode of IPE should prompt the evaluation of cardiac and pulmonary function.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSwimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs during swimming or scuba diving, often in young individuals with no predisposing conditions, and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressures are higher in SIPE-susceptible individuals during submerged exercise than in the general population and are reduced by sildenafil.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTen study subjects with a history of SIPE (mean age, 41.6 years) and 20 control subjects (mean age, 36.2 years) were instrumented with radial artery and pulmonary artery catheters and performed moderate cycle ergometer exercise for 6 to 7 minutes while submersed in 20\u00b0C water. SIPE-susceptible subjects repeated the exercise 150 minutes after oral administration of 50 mg sildenafil. Work rate and mean arterial pressure during exercise were similar in controls and SIPE-susceptible subjects. Average o2 and cardiac output in controls and SIPE-susceptible subjects were: o2 2.42 L\u00b7min(-1) versus 1.95 L\u00b7min(-1), P=0.2; and cardiac output 17.9 L\u00b7min(-1) versus 13.8 L\u00b7min(-1), P=0.01. Accounting for differences in cardiac output between groups, mean pulmonary artery pressure at cardiac output=13.8 L\u00b7min(-1) was 22.5 mm Hg in controls versus 34.0 mm Hg in SIPE-susceptible subjects (P=0.004), and the corresponding pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 11.0 mm Hg versus 18.8 mm Hg (P=0.028). After sildenafil, there were no statistically significant differences in mean pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure between SIPE-susceptible subjects and controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese observations confirm that SIPE is a form of hemodynamic pulmonary edema. The reduction in pulmonary vascular pressures after sildenafil with no adverse effect on exercise hemodynamics suggests that it may be useful in SIPE prevention.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nURL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "abstract": "Swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs during swimming and scuba diving, usually in cold water, in susceptible healthy individuals, especially military recruits and triathletes. We have previously demonstrated that pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and PA wedge pressure are higher during immersed exercise in SIPE-susceptible individuals versus controls, confirming that SIPE is a form of hemodynamic pulmonary edema. Oral sildenafil 50 mg 1 h before immersed exercise reduced PA pressure and PA wedge pressure, suggesting that sildenafil may prevent SIPE. We present a case of a 46-yr-old female ultratriathlete with a history of at least five SIPE episodes. During a study of an exercise submerged in 20\u00b0C water, physiological parameters before and after sildenafil 50 mg orally were as follows: O2 consumption 1.75, 1.76 L\u00b7min; HR 129, 135 bpm; arterial pressure 189/88 (mean 121.5), 172/85 (mean 114.3) mm Hg; mean PA pressure 35.3, 28.8 mm Hg; and PA wedge pressure 25.3, 19.7 mm Hg.

Objectives To investigate the effect of intense exercise and associated exposure to air pollution on the airway barrier in adolescent elite athletes compared with healthy controls and to study exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in this population. Methods Early-career elite athletes attending \u2018Flemish-Elite-Sports-Schools\u2019 (12\u201318 years) of 4 different sport disciplines (n=90) and control subjects (n=25) were recruited. Presence of EIB was tested by the eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) test. Markers at mRNA and protein level; RNA-sequencing; carbon load in airway macrophages were studied on induced sputum samples. Results 444 genes were differentially expressed in sputum from athletes compared with controls, which were related to inflammation and epithelial cell damage and sputum samples of athletes contained significantly more carbon loaded airway macrophages compared with controls (24%, 95% CI 20% to 36%, p<0.0004). Athletes had significantly higher substance P (13.3 pg/mL, 95% CI 2.0 to 19.2) and calprotectin (1237 ng/mL, 95% CI 531 to 2490) levels as well as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels compared with controls (p<0.05). The incidence of EIB in athletes was 9%. The maximal fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%) after EVH test in athletes was significantly associated with prior PM10 and PM2.5 exposure.

The evaluation consisted of spirometry, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea test (EVH) to evaluate for EIB, FeNO, skin prick testing, blood sampling (serum markers of epithelial damage and mast cell activation), and questionnaires (AQUA\u00a9, ACT, ACQ, and exposure and symptom-related questions).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf all athletes, 22% tested positive for EIB (n\u2009=\u200972), 14% reported a previous asthma diagnosis and 40% were atopic. Eighty percent of EIB+ athletes did not use any inhalation therapy. EIB+ athletes were significantly younger, had decreased FEV1/FVC (%), and increased post-EVH-reversibility (%) post-salbutamol compared with EIB- athletes. Furthermore, EIB was significantly associated with previous asthma diagnosis and atopy. The best predictors for a positive EVH test were AQUA\u00a9 score\u2009\u2265\u20096 (sensitivity of 78%, p\u2009=\u2009.0171) and wheezing during exercise (specificity of 82%, p\u2009=\u2009.0002).
