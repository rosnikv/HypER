        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nPregnant women who are positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies [TPOAb(+)] are prone to develop postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) and permanent hypothyroidism. Selenium (Se) decreases thyroid inflammatory activity in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe examined whether Se supplementation, during and after pregnancy, influences the thyroidal autoimmune pattern and function.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Department of Endocrinology.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA total of 2143 euthyroid pregnant women participated in the study; 7.9% were TPOAb(+).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nDuring pregnancy and the postpartum period, 77 TPOAb(+) women received selenomethionine 200 microg/d (group S1), 74 TPOAb(+) women received placebo (group S0), and 81 TPOAb(-) age-matched women were the control group (group C).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe measured the prevalence of PPTD and hypothyroidism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPPTD and permanent hypothyroidism were significantly lower in group S1 compared with S0 (28.6 vs. 48.6%, P<0.01; and 11.7 vs. 20.3%, P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSe supplementation during pregnancy and in the postpartum period reduced thyroid inflammatory activity and the incidence of hypothyroidism.",

        "title": "Thyroid Autoimmunity and Environment",
        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) are the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, the former account for about 70-80% of liability to develop AITDs. However, at least 20-30% is contributed by environmental factors, which include certainly smoking (at least for Graves' disease and orbitopathy), probably stress, iodine and selenium intake, several drugs, irradiation, pollutants, viral and bacterial infections, allergy, pregnancy, and post-partum. Evidence for the intervention of these factors is often limited, and the mechanisms whereby environmental factors may concur to the onset of AITDs are in many instances unclear. Nevertheless, gene-environment interaction seems a fundamental process for the occurrence of AITDs.",

        "title": "Selenium supplementation in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a systematic review and a meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEvidence suggests that selenium (Se) supplementation could be useful as an adjunctive therapy to levothyroxine (LT\u2084) in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). To summarize evidence regarding its effect on thyroid autoantibodies' titers, demands in LT\u2084 replacement therapy, ultrasonographic thyroid morphology, and mood in patients with HT under LT\u2084 treatment, a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant literature were performed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic review of prospective studies involving patients with HT under LT\u2084 treatment and meta-analysis of studies on randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded trials were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients with HT assigned to Se supplementation for 3 months demonstrated significantly lower thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOab) titers (four studies, random effects weighted mean difference: \u2212271.09, 95% confidence interval: \u2212421.98 to \u2212120.19, p< 10\u207b\u2074) and a significantly higher chance of reporting an improvement in well-being and/or mood (three studies, random effects risk ratio: 2.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.21-6.47, p= 0.016) when compared with controls. Demands in LT\u2084 replacement therapy and ultrasonographic thyroid morphology were found either unaltered or underreported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOn the basis of the best available evidence, Se supplementation is associated with a significant decrease in TPOab titers at 3 months and with improvement in mood and/or general well-being. Evidence suggests a different pattern of response to Se supplementation in HT relative to baseline TPOab titers, and this, if confirmed, could be used to identify which patients would benefit most from treatment. An improvement in thyroid function and morphology should be demonstrated before Se routine supplementation can be recommended in the treatment of HT.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nNo previous study determined monocyte- and lymphocyte-suppressing effects of levothyroxine and selenomethionine and assessed whether their coadministration is superior to treatment with only one of these drugs.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to compare the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION\nWe conducted a randomized clinical trial involving a group of 170 ambulatory euthyroid women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 41 matched healthy subjects. Participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 6-month treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. One hundred sixty-five patients completed the study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMonocyte and lymphocyte release of proinflammatory cytokines and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control subjects, monocytes and lymphocytes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients released greater amounts of all cytokines studied. Levothyroxine reduced monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, whereas selenomethionine inhibited lymphocyte release of IL-2, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma CRP levels. The decrease in cytokine release and in plasma CRP levels was strongest when both drugs were given together.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite affecting different types of inflammatory cells, levothyroxine and selenomethionine exhibit a similar systemic antiinflammatory effect in euthyroid females with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This action, which correlates with a reduction in thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, may be associated with clinical benefits in the prevention and management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly in subjects receiving both agents.",

        "title": "Haemostatic effects of levothyroxine and selenomethionine in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis",
        "abstract": "Summary The aim of this prospective study was to investigate for the first time whether levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, affect coagulation and fibrinolysis in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients with normal thyroid function tests. A group of 155 ambulatory women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, of whom 149 completed the study, were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to six months of treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. The control group included 39 matched healthy women. The prothrombin time ratio, the activated partial thromboplastin time, and plasma levels/activities of fibrinogen, factor VII, von Willebrand factor, factor X and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were assessed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment. Compared with the healthy subjects, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients exhibited higher plasma levels/activities of all of the parameters studied, as well as were characterised by the abnormal prothrombin time ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time. All these haemostatic disturbances were reduced or normalised by levothyroxine + selenomethionine treatment, while the effect of levothyroxine or selenomethionine was limited to fibrinogen and PAI-1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that euthyroid women with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis are characterised by abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. Levothyroxine and selenomethionine, especially if administered together, produce a beneficial effect on haemostasis in euthyroid patients with this disorder. Note: This study was in part a sub-study of another trial (ACTRN 12611000238976), which assessed the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release in Hashimoto\u201cs thyroiditis patients.

We herein report a case of AVWS associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subcutaneous mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. An IgG autoantibody against von Willebrand factor (VWF) was detected. The antibody bound to VWF but did not inhibit VWF activity. Rapid clearance of VWF seemed to be the cause of AVWS in the present case. VWF-containing concentrates stopped the bleeding. Even if such a complication is rare, for AVWS patients, prompt recognition of the underlying mechanism can save lives.",

        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), including Graves\u2019 Disease and Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis), are the most common organ-specific autoimmune disorders, occurring mostly in middle-aged women. AITDs are often associated with other autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo or systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), but there have been only few reports of AITDs concurring with CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasias), a limited form of scleroderma. Furthermore, these disorders have been associated with lymphoid malignancies, but only rarely with other cancers such as lung or breast. We report the case of a 59 year-old female patient who presented at the Endocrinology clinic for vertigo, dysphoria and fatigue. Clinical examination and serologic determinations revealed the diagnosis of an overlap syndrome between euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis and CREST syndrome. Further investigations led to the detection of an incipient gastric adenocarcinoma which was promptly treated with total gastrectomy.",
