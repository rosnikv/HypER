        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To compare the clinical effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection, standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and simple analgesics for the early treatment of lateral epicondylitis in primary care. Design: Multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Setting: 23 general practices in North Staffordshire and South Cheshire. Participants: 164 patients aged 18-70 years presenting with a new episode of lateral epicondylitis. Interventions: Local injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone plus lignocaine, naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two weeks, or placebo tablets. All participants received a standard advice sheet and co-codamol as required. Main outcome measures: Participants' global assessment of improvement (five point scale) at four weeks. Pain, function, and \u201cmain complaint\u201d measured on 10 point Likert scales at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Results: Over 2 years, 53 subjects were randomised to injection, 53 to naproxen, and 58 to placebo. Prognostic variables were similar between groups at baseline. At 4 weeks, 48 patients (92%) in the injection group were completely better or improved compared with 30 (57%) in the naproxen group (P<0.001) and 28 (50%) in the placebo group (P<0.001). At 12 months, 43 patients (84%) in the injection group had pain scores \u22643 compared with 45 (85%) in the naproxen group and 44 (82%) in the placebo group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Early local corticosteroid injection is effective for lateral epicondylitis. Outcome at one year was good in all groups, and effective early treatment does not seem to influence this. Key messages Most lateral epicondylitis is managed by general practitioners, but optimum treatment is unclear This large pragmatic randomised trial showed that corticosteroid injection was significantly better than non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or placebo tablets at four weeks A two week course of a standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory was no better than placebo A few patients who respond well initially to injection relapse by six months. Long term outcome was good, irrespective of initial treatment allocation",

        "abstract": "Lateral epicondylitis is the most common affliction of the elbow. It occurs in middle-aged individuals and is self-limiting in the majority of cases. The etiology of the condition is not completely understood. Based on clinical, histologic, and imaging data, the tendinous origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis is the most likely site of pathology. A variety of procedures have been described to treat epicondylitis. Most commonly, the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon origin is debrided with either open or arthroscopic methods. Both techniques require a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the extensor tendon origin at the humeral epicondyle. Improvement is reported in the majority of cases treated surgically, although residual symptoms persist in a substantial number of patients.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe treatment of tendinosis of elbow can be challenging, yet rewarding. Nevertheless, for the patients who failed conservative management and develop persistent recalcitrant symptoms, surgical intervention should be considered. The hypothesis of this study is iliac bone marrow plasma injection after arthroscopic debridement of degenerative tissue will bring along biological cure. Thus, it will not only reduce pain but also improve function in patients with resistant elbow tendonitis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTwenty-four patients (26 elbows) with significant persistent pain for a mean of 15 months, despite of standard rehabilitation protocol and a variety of other nonsurgical modalities were treated arthroscopically. We applied autologous iliac bone marrow plasma injection following arthroscopic debridement. This material is produced by centrifugation of iliac bone marrow blood at 1,800 rpm for 20 to 30 minutes. Patients were allowed full range of motion (ROM) exercise after 2 to 3 days. Cytokine analyses for this injective material were done. Outcome was rated by postoperative sonography, visual analog pain scores (VAS) and Mayo elbow performance scores (MEPS) at 8 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Informed consent had been obtained from the subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Chosun University Hospital, Korea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll patients in this study noted improvement both in their VAS and MEPS. No complication occurred in any patient. Evidence of tendon healing was observed in postoperative sonographic examination. Predominant cytokines of this study were interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and RANTES.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBiologic treatments in orthopaedics are just beginning to evolve. In the present investigation, the injection of iliac bone marrow plasma after arthroscopic debridement in severe elbow tendinosis demonstrated early recovery of daily activities and clear improvement.",

        "abstract": "Acute soft-tissue lesions and chronic overuse injuries in the sports medicine field are very frequent and in most cases, difficult to treat. Tissue repair in musculoskeletal lesions is often too slow and sometimes incomplete for a given athlete. The fastest, most complete recovery is of primary importance, and keeping the delay until return-to- field as brief as possible, a priority. Many bioactive proteins and growth factors amongst others influence healing processes. Administration of Platelet Rich Plasma enables the production, from the patient\u2019s own blood, of natural, high concentrations of autologous growth factors. Basic research and animal studies are promising, but evidence- based studies examining the treatment of human musculoskeletal lesions by Platelet Rich Plasma are still lacking. Nevertheless, such treatment is increasingly used in sports medicine clinical practice and much is expected of growth factor injections. The aim of this non exhaustive review is to analyze the existing literature published in the fields of sports medicine. The results of this analysis do not permit us to recommend the systematic and generalized use of Platelet Rich Plasma injections in the management of sport injuries. Nevertheless, a few promising results have to be mentioned, but high-quality studies are needed to provide scientific evidence about these injections\u2019 effectiveness.",

Surgical osteosynthesis, with multiple lag screws and a neutralization plate, was performed for anatomical reconstruction. Despite a good gait condition, delayed bone consolidation and a bone gap were evident on follow up radiographic evaluations. Due to delayed healing, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was injected on the surface of the tibia. Increased bone consolidation was evident on radiographs one month after the PRP injection. Progressive filling of both the fracture lines and bone gap continued during the six-month follow up. Clinical outcome was excellent. Autologous PRP should be considered as a practical adjuvant therapy in bone healing process in donkeys.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) accelerates wound healing, as it is an excellent source of growth factors. PRP was separated from whole human blood by centrifugation. PRP powder and wafers were prepared by lyophilization, with the wafers prepared using sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na CMC). The PRP wafers showed porous structures, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and the ability of the wafer to absorb exudates and thus promote wound healing was tested with the hydration capacity test. The platelet count was tested and indicated that the presence of PRP in the wafers had no effect on the platelet count. An antimicrobial activity test was carried out, showing that PRP had antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with lyophilized PRP powder and PRP-free wafers, PRP wafers showed the highest percent of wound size reduction on induced wounds in rats. Histopathological examination of rat skin showed that the PRP wafers achieved the shortest healing time, followed by the lyophilized PRP powder and finally the PRP-free wafers. The present study revealed that PRP can be formulated as a wafer, which is a promising pharmaceutical delivery system that can be used for enhanced wound-healing activity and improved the ease of application compared to lyophilized PRP powder.",

        "abstract": "The complex biology of platelets and their involvement in tissue repair and inflammation have inspired the development of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapies for a broad array of medical needs. However, clinical advances are hampered by the fact that PRP products, doses and treatment protocols are far from being standardized. Freeze-drying PRP (FD-PRP) preserves platelet function, cytokine concentration and functionality, and has been proposed as a consistent method for product standardization and fabrication of an off-the-shelf product with improved stability and readiness for future uses. Here, we present the current state of experimental and clinical FD-PRP research in the different medical areas in which PRP has potential to meet prevailing medical needs. A systematic search, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, showed that research is mostly focused on wound healing, i.e., developing combination products for ulcer management. Injectable hydrogels are investigated for lumbar fusion and knee conditions. In dentistry, combination products permit slow kinetics of growth factor release and functionalized membranes for guided bone regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Background: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has gained popularity in craniofacial surgery, as it provides an excellent reservoir of autologous growth factors (GFs) that are essential for bone regeneration. However, the low elastic modulus, short-term clinical application, poor storage potential and limitations in emergency therapy use restrict its more widespread clinical application. This study fabricates lyophilised PRF (Ly-PRF), evaluates its physical and biological properties, and explores its application for craniofacial tissue engineering purposes. Material and methods: A lyophilisation method was applied, and the outcome was evaluated and compared with traditionally prepared PRF. We investigated how lyophilisation affected PRF\u2019s physical characteristics and biological properties by determining: (1) the physical and morphological architecture of Ly-PRF using SEM, and (2) the kinetic release of PDGF-AB using ELISA. Results: Ly-PRF exhibited a dense and homogeneous interconnected 3D fibrin network. Moreover, clusters of morphologically consistent cells of platelets and leukocytes were apparent within Ly-PRF, along with evidence of PDGF-AB release in accordance with previously reports. Conclusions: The protocol established in this study for Ly-PRF preparation demonstrated versatility, and provides a biomaterial with growth factor release for potential use as a craniofacial bioscaffold.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) induces more migration and proliferation of fibroblasts compared with standard PRF, but it being freshly prepared prior to it being applied is necessary. To preserve its biological function, lyophilization, a freeze-drying method, has been developed to improve the stability and storage potential of PRF. This study aimed to determine the effect of lyophilized A-PRF on growth factor release and cell biological activity compared to fresh A-PRF. The results of the present study demonstrated that both formulations of canine A-PRF matrices, the fresh and lyophilized forms, were able to release various growth factors, promoting better wound regeneration than in instances without the A-PRF matrices. Lyophilization in canine A-PRF can mostly preserve the similar release of growth factors, and consequently has similar biological activities to a fresh preparation. Interestingly, lyophilized canine A-PRF demonstrated the tendency of larger releases of certain growth factors, including the significantly larger accumulated release of a growth factor named vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA). Based on these findings, it became clear that the lyophilization process can preserve growth factor release as well as the biological activity of canine A-PRF matrices, in addition to encouraging the use of canine lyophilized A-PRF as a biological material for promoting wound healing. Abstract Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) induces more proliferation and migration of fibroblasts compared with standard PRF, but it being freshly prepared prior to it being applied is necessary. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of lyophilized A-PRF on growth factor release and cell biological activity. Blood samples were collected from six dogs and processed for fresh and lyophilized A-PRF. The growth factors released included transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and the fibroblast proliferation as well as wound closure enhancement of both products were compared. The results showed that TGF-\u03b21, PDGF-BB, and VEGFA were continually released from lyophilized A-PRF for over 72 h. Lyophilized A-PRF released significantly more accumulated VEGEA and a tendency to release more TGF-\u03b21 at 72 h as well as VEGFA at 24 h and 72 h than fresh A-PRF. Moreover, lyophilized A-PRF increased fibroblast proliferation and induced a significantly faster wound closure than the control, while no significant difference between fresh and lyophilized A-PRF was found. In conclusion, the lyophilization of canine A-PRF can preserve the release of growth factors and has similar biological activities to a fresh preparation. This encourages the substitution of lyophilized A-PRF instead of fresh A-PRF in regenerative treatments in which the stability of the product is concerned.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Bacterial infections can often lead to complications in wound healing. The overuse of antimicrobial drugs can cause antimicrobial resistance, making it necessary to find alternative therapeutic options for wound care. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has been used for tissue regeneration, but until now, its application for antimicrobial activity has been limited to periodontal pathogens. In this study, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial effects of canine PRF (cPRF) against bacteria from the clinical wound of a dog and to investigate the mechanism of its antibacterial activity, which involves the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results showed that cPRF had a significant antimicrobial effect against Escherichia coli between 4 and 24 h, resulting from the release of ROS. Based on these findings, cPRF, a rich source of growth factors that accelerate the wound healing process, could be used as a biological material for wound infection treatment, benefiting veterinary medicine. Abstract Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), which has been shown to promote wound and bone regeneration, has demonstrated antimicrobial properties against periodontal pathogens. However, in veterinary medicine, no study has determined the antimicrobial effects of canine platelet-rich fibrin (cPRF). Therefore, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial effect of cPRF against E. coli and S. pseudintermedius found in dogs\u2019 wounds and against the standard strain S. aureus. Additionally, the mechanism of the existing antibacterial activity of cPRF, which involves the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), was tested. Blood samples from six dogs were processed for cPRF. The antimicrobial properties of three groups (growth control, cPRF, and drug control) were evaluated at 0.5, 4, 8, and 24 h using a time\u2013kill assay. The killing mechanisms involving ROS were evaluated using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to suppress ROS production in PRF (PRF-SR). Subsequently, tests for antimicrobial properties and ROS generation were compared to those of the growth control and cPRF groups. The results showed that cPRF had significant antimicrobial properties against E. coli but no antimicrobial properties against S. pseudintermedius. After the ROS suppression, PRF-SR did not show an antimicrobial property against E. coli. Moreover, cPRF-treated bacteria exhibited significantly greater intracellular ROS than PRF-SR. In conclusion, canine PRF showed an antimicrobial effect against E. coli, and its antibacterial mechanism was related to releasing ROS.",
