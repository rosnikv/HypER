        "title": "Historical HbA1c Values May Explain the Type 2 Diabetes Legacy Effect: UKPDS 88",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Type 2 diabetes all-cause mortality (ACM) and myocardial infarction (MI) glycemic legacy effects have not been explained. We examined their relationships with prior individual HbA1c values and explored the potential impact of instituting earlier, compared with delayed, glucose-lowering therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty-year ACM and MI hazard functions were estimated from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in 3,802 UK Prospective Diabetes Study participants. Impact of HbA1c values over time was analyzed by weighting them according to their influence on downstream ACM and MI risks. RESULTS Hazard ratios for a one percentage unit higher HbA1c for ACM were 1.08 (95% CI 1.07\u20131.09), 1.18 (1.15\u20131.21), and 1.36 (1.30\u20131.42) at 5, 10, and 20 years, respectively, and for MI was 1.13 (1.11\u20131.15) at 5 years, increasing to 1.31 (1.25\u20131.36) at 20 years. Imposing a one percentage unit lower HbA1c from diagnosis generated an 18.8% (95% CI 21.1\u201316.0) ACM risk reduction 10\u201315 years later, whereas delaying this reduction until 10 years after diagnosis showed a sevenfold lower 2.7% (3.1\u20132.3) risk reduction. Corresponding MI risk reductions were 19.7% (22.4\u201316.5) when lowering HbA1c at diagnosis, and threefold lower 6.5% (7.4\u20135.3%) when imposed 10 years later. CONCLUSIONS The glycemic legacy effects seen in type 2 diabetes are explained largely by historical HbA1c values having a greater impact than recent values on clinical outcomes. Early detection of diabetes and intensive glucose control from the time of diagnosis is essential to maximize reduction of the long-term risk of glycemic complications.",

        "title": "Associations Between Mean HbA1c, HbA1c Variability, and Both Mortality and Macrovascular Complications in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A Registry-Based Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Background We investigate the association between mean HbA1c, HbA1c variability, and all-cause mortality and diabetes-related macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using patients present in the Singapore Health Services diabetes registry (SDR) during 2013 to 2014. We assessed mean HbA1c using three models: a baseline mean HbA1c for 2013\u201314, the mean across the whole follow-up period, and a time-varying yearly updated mean. We assessed HbA1c variability at baseline using the patient\u2019s HbA1c variability score (HVS) for 2013\u201314. The association between mean HbA1c, HVS, and 6 outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results We included 43,837\u201353,934 individuals in the analysis; 99.3% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The data showed a J-shaped distribution in adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality, ischemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, and ischemic stroke, with an increased risk of developing these outcomes at HbA1c <6% (42 mmol/mol) and \u22658% (64 mmol/mol). With the addition of HVS, the J-shaped distribution was maintained for the above outcomes, but HRs were greater at HbA1c <6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and reduced at HbA1c \u22658.0% (64 mmol/mol) when compared to models without HVS. The risk for all outcomes increased substantially with increasing glycaemic variability. Conclusion Both low (<6.0% [42 mmol/mol]) and high (\u22658.0% [64 mmol/mol]) levels of glycaemic control are associated with increased all-cause mortality and diabetes-related macrovascular complications. Glycaemic variability is independently associated with increased risk for these outcomes. Therefore, patients with stable glycaemic level of 6\u20138% (42\u201364mmol/mol) are at lowest risk of all-cause mortality and diabetes-related macrovascular complications.",

        "title": "Potential Impact of Metabolic Syndrome Control on Cardiovascular Risk in Elderly Patients with Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study",
        "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS), a complex pathology with features like abnormal body fat distribution, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia, contributes to higher cardiovascular (CV) risk. A cross-sectional study including 87 individuals assessed CV risk score in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and MS in Algarve, Portugal. The 10-year CV risk score was estimated using the ADVANCE risk score calculator. The reductions in CV risk score were estimated by adjusting the data inputted on the online tool to achieve systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130 or <120 mmHg, and LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dL Beyond waist circumference, the mean number of clinical features of MS was 3.14 \u00b1 0.84, without significant sex differences. The mean CV risk score was 22.5% (CI: 20.3\u201324.7). Sex-specific analysis showed higher risk score in males (24.2%, CI: 21.3\u201327.0) vs. females (19.7%, CI: 16.2\u201323.3; p = 0.028). Hypothetical risk score reductions show that lowering SBP to <130 mmHg could significantly lower the risk score by an average of 9.2% (CI: 7.7\u201310.7), whereas 34.5% of the participants would be out of the diagnostic criteria for MS. When comparing each potential intervention with current risk score, all interventions significantly reduce the 10-year CV risk score. The study highlights the potential of blood pressure control in reducing CV risk score and the importance of multifaceted risk score reduction strategies.",
