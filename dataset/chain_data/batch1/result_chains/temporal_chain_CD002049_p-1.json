        "title": "Soft-laser therapy of rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "The effect of soft-laser therapy on rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated in 17 patients with symmetrical involvement of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index. Nine treatments with a He-Ne laser, 6 J/cm2, were given on the one hand with a sham irradiation of the other. The study was double-blind. The laser therapy gave some pain relief, but no difference in morning stiffness or joint performance was obtained. It is concluded that the laser therapy is of limited value in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "30 patients with supraspinatus or bicipital tendonitis were randomly allocated to active infrared laser therapy at 904 nm three times weekly for 2 weeks, dummy laser or drug treatment for 2 weeks. Objectively maximum active extension, flexion and abduction of the shoulder, and subjectively pain stiffness movement and function were measured at 0 and 2 weeks. Significant improvement of active over dummy laser was noted for all seven assessments. Active laser therapy produced significant improvement over drug therapy for all three objective measures and pain. Naproxen sodium significantly improved only movement and function compared to dummy laser. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of laser therapy in tendonitis of the shoulder.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage-like U-937 cells were exposed in vitro to noncoherent 660 nm wavelength light produced by a superluminous diode at a power density of 120 mW/cm2 over a range of energy densities from 2.4 - 9.6 J/cm2. Twelve hours after irradiation, the medium in which the macrophages had been growing and which contained growth factors secreted by them was added to 3T3 fibroblasts, also growing in vitro, and its effect on fibroblast proliferation assessed. It was found that by 96 h after addition of the macrophage-conditioned medium there was a statistically significant increase in fibroblast proliferation in the cells exposed to supernatants from the experimental compared with the sham-irradiated macrophages. The most effective energy density was found to be 7.2 J/cm2 and the least effective 9.6 J/cm2.",

        "title": "THE DIRECT EFFECT OF 860 nm LIGHT ON CELL PROLIFERATION AND ON SUCCINIC DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY OF HUMAN FIBROBLASTS INVITRO",
        "abstract": "Human forearm fibroblasts were irradiated, in vitro, using a Microlaser Medical Pen Unit (Johnson and Johnson) with a wavelength of 860 nm, and an average power output of 50 mW. The irradiation distance and times were adjusted to give energy densities of 2 J/cm2 and 16 J/cm2 respectively. The control unit was adjusted to give a continuous waveform. Fibroblast proliferation and succinic dehydrogenase activity were assessed every 24 hrs over a five day period. The results obtained suggest a relationship between fibroblast proliferation and succinic dehydrogenase activity. At the lower energy density (2 J/cm2), succinic dehydrogenase levels rise with fibroblast proliferation. However, at an energy density of 16 J/cm2, the succinic dehydrogenase levels and fibroblast proliferation appear to be inhibited. These findings agree with previously reported data.",

        "title": "EFFECTS OF LOW LEVEL LASER IRRADIATION (LLLI) WITH 904nm PULSED DIODE LASER ON OSTEOBLASTS: A CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH THE RAT OSTEOBLAST MODEL",
        "abstract": "Although it has been reported that low level laser irradiation (LLLI) appears to stimulate bone formation, little is known in detail about its possible role in osteoblast function. The present study examines the effect of LLLI on the function of rat calvarial osteoblast cells (ROB) and rat osteoblast cell lines (ROS 17/2.8) in terms of cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and calcified nodule formation. To determine the effects of LLLI on the osteoblast cell function, the ROB and ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured and were treated with LLLI. An unirradiated group served as the control. LLLI irradiated cells demonstrated a slight increase in proliferation and slight decrease in the number of dead cells compared with the control,, but the differences were not statistically significant. LLLI increased the ALP activity in culture of ROBs and ROS 17/2.8 cells with a statistically significant difference (ANOVA and multiple comparison tests) compared with the unirradiated controls (p \u2039 0.0001 in both groups). LLLI irradiated cells also showed a statistically significantly greater increase in bone nodule formation for both ROBs (p = 0.0421) and ROS 17/28 cells (p = 0.0119) using an unpaired t-test. These results offer the possibility that LLLI could promote osteoblast-modulated bone formation by stimulating osteoblast function in addition to bone mineralization.",

        "title": "Low-level laser therapy stimulates bone-implant interaction: an experimental study in rabbits.",
        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) with a gallium-aluminium-arsenide (GaAlAs) diode laser device on titanium implant healing and attachment in bone. This study was performed as an animal trial of 8 weeks duration with a blinded, placebo-controlled design. Two coin-shaped titanium implants with a diameter of 6.25 mm and a height of 1.95 mm were implanted into cortical bone in each proximal tibia of twelve New Zealand white female rabbits (n=48). The animals were randomly divided into irradiated and control groups. The LLLT was used immediately after surgery and carried out daily for 10 consecutive days. The animals were killed after 8 weeks of healing. The mechanical strength of the attachment between the bone and 44 titanium implants was evaluated using a tensile pullout test. Histomorphometrical analysis of the four implants left in place from four rabbits was then performed. Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis was applied for analyses of calcium and phosphorus on the implant test surface after the tensile test. The mean tensile forces, measured in Newton, of the irradiated implants and controls were 14.35 (SD+/-4.98) and 10.27 (SD+/-4.38), respectively, suggesting a gain in functional attachment at 8 weeks following LLLT (P=0.013). The histomorphometrical evaluation suggested that the irradiated group had more bone-to-implant contact than the controls. The weight percentages of calcium and phosphorus were significantly higher in the irradiated group when compared to the controls (P=0.037) and (P=0.034), respectively, suggesting that bone maturation processed faster in irradiated bone. These findings suggest that LLLT might have a favourable effect on healing and attachment of titanium implants.",

        "explanation": "This paper is relevant to the source paper because it also explores the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on bone, specifically on titanium implant healing and attachment in rabbits. The source paper examined the effect of LLLI on osteoblast function in rats, and this paper builds upon that concept by investigating LLLT's effect on bone-implant interaction. Therefore, the key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper."

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on attachment and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) cultured on titanium implant material. HGF were exposed to gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser at dosages of 1.5 or 3 J/cm(2) and then cultured on commercially pure titanium discs. Cell profile areas were measured after 1, 3 and 24 h, using scanning electron microscopy and an automatic image analyzer. The results were expressed as percentage of attachment. In order to investigate the effect of LLLT on cellular growth after 8 and 10 days, HGF were cultured on titanium discs for 24 h and then exposed to laser irradiation on 3 consecutive days. Colony-forming efficiency (CFE) and clonal growth rates (CGR) were measured. Cell viability was determined by Hoechst and prodidium iodide staining. Non-lased cultures served as controls. Morphologically, the cells spread well on all titanium surfaces, indicating good attachment by both irradiated and non-irradiated cells. Fibroblasts exposed to laser irradiation had significantly higher percentages of cell attachment than the non-exposed cells (P<0.05). CFE and CGR were also enhanced for the irradiated cells (P<0.05). Cell viability was high (>90%) in the irradiated and control groups, without significant differences. It is concluded that in vitro LLLT enhances the attachment and proliferation of HGF on titanium implant material.",
