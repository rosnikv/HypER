In this randomized controlled trial, hip BMD was measured in postmenopausal women after a 24\u2010week whole body vibration (WBV) training program. Vibration training significantly increased BMD of the hip. These findings suggest that WBV training might be useful in the prevention of osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Deconditioning is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The physiology of vascular adaptation to deconditioning has not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of bed rest deconditioning on vascular dimension and function of leg conduit arteries. In addition, the effectiveness of resistive vibration exercise as a countermeasure for vascular deconditioning during bed rest was evaluated. Sixteen healthy men were randomly assigned to bed rest (BR-Ctrl) or to bed rest with resistive vibration exercise (BR-RVE). Before and after 25 and 52 days of strict horizontal bed rest, arterial diameter, blood flow, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation were measured by echo Doppler ultrasound. In the BR-Ctrl group, the diameter of the common femoral artery decreased by 13 +/- 3% after 25 and 17 +/- 1% after 52 days of bed rest (P < 0.001). In the BR-RVE group this decrease in diameter was significantly attenuated (5 +/- 2% after 25 days and 6 +/- 2% after 52 days, P < 0.01 vs. BR-Ctrl). Baseline blood flow did not change after bed rest in either group. After 52 days of bed rest, FMD and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation of the superficial femoral artery were increased in both groups, possibly by increased nitric oxide sensitivity. In conclusion, bed rest deconditioning is accompanied by a reduction in the diameter of the conduit arteries and by an increased reactivity to nitric oxide. Resistive vibration exercise effectively attenuates the diameter decrease of leg conduit arteries after bed rest.",

        "abstract": "Sedentary behavior has deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, including reduced endothelial functions. A 2-mo bed rest study in healthy women [women international space simulation for exploration (WISE) 2005 program] presented a unique opportunity to analyze the specific effects of prolonged inactivity without other vascular risk factors on the endothelium. We investigated endothelial properties before and after 56 days of bed rest in 8 subjects who performed no exercise (control group: No-EX) and in 8 subjects who regularly performed treadmill exercise in a lower body negative pressure chamber as well as resistance exercise (countermeasure group, EX). A functional evaluation of the microcirculation in the skin was assessed with laser Doppler. We studied endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation using iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively. We also measured circulating endothelial cells (CECs), an index of endothelial damage. In the No-EX group, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly reduced (35.4 +/- 4.8% vs. 24.1 +/- 3.8%, P < 0.05) by bed rest with a significant increase in the number of CECs (3.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 10.6 +/- 2.7 ml(-1), P < 0.05). In the EX group, endothelium-dependent vasodilation and number of CECs were preserved. Our study shows that in humans prolonged bed rest causes impairment of endothelium-dependent function at the microcirculatory level, along with an increase in circulating endothelial cells. Microcirculatory endothelial dysfunction might participate in cardiovascular deconditioning, as well as in several bed rest-induced pathologies. We therefore conclude that the endothelium should be a target for countermeasures during periods of prolonged deconditioning.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nExercise prescriptions for spaceflight include aerobic and resistive countermeasures, yet few studies have evaluated their combined effects on exercise responses after real or simulated microgravity. We hypothesized that upright aerobic capacity (VO2pk) is protected during a 60-d bed rest (BR) in which intermittent (40%-80% pre-BR VO2pk) aerobic exercise (supine treadmill exercise against lower body negative pressure) was performed 2-4 d x wk(-1) and resistive exercise (inertial flywheel exercises) was performed 2-3 d x wk(-1). Further, we hypothesized that ingestion of an amino acid supplement that was shown previously to counteract muscle atrophy, would reduce the decline in VO2pk in nonexercising subjects during BR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-four healthy women (8 nonexercise controls (CON), 8 exercisers (EX), and 8 nonexercisers with nutritional supplementation (NUT)) underwent a 20-d ambulatory baseline period, 60 d of 6 degrees head-down tilt BR, and 21 d of ambulatory recovery. VO2pk was measured pre-BR and on the third day of recovery from BR (R3).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the EX group, VO2pk (mean +/- SE) was not different from pre-BR (-3.3 +/- 1.2%) on R3, although it decreased significantly in the CON (-21.2 +/- 2.1%) and NUT (-25.6 +/- 1.6%) groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results indicate that alternating aerobic and resistive exercise on most days during prolonged microgravity simulated by BR is sufficient to preserve or allow quick recovery of upright aerobic capacity in women but that a nutritional supplementation alone is not effective.",

        "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that prolonged physical deconditioning affects the coupling of left ventricular depolarization to its ejection (the pre\u2010ejection period, PEPi) and that this effect is minimized by exercise countermeasures. Following assignment to non\u2010exercise (Control) and exercise groups (Exercise), 14 females performed 56 days of continuous head\u2010down tilt bed rest. Measurements of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and stroke volume (Doppler ultrasound) during supine rest were obtained at baseline prior to (Pre) and after (Post) the head\u2010down tilt bed rest (HDBR) period. Compared with Pre, the PEPi was increased following head\u2010down tilt bed rest (main effect, P < 0.005). This effect was most dominant in the Control group [Pre = 0.038 \u00b1 0.06 s (s.d.) versus Post = 0.054 \u00b1 0.011 s; P < 0.001]. In the Exercise group, PEPi was 0.032 \u00b1 0.005 s Pre and 0.038 \u00b1 0.018 s Post; P= 0.08. Neither the QRS interval nor cardiac afterload was modified by head\u2010down tilt bed rest in Control or Exercise groups. Low\u2010dose isoprenaline infusion reversed the head\u2010down tilt bed rest\u2010induced delay in the PEPi. These results suggest that head\u2010down tilt bed rest leads to a delayed onset of systolic ejection following left ventricular depolarization in a manner that is affected little by the exercise countermeasure but is related to \u03b2\u2010adrenergic pathways. The delayed onset of systole following head\u2010down tilt bed rest appears to be related to mechanism(s) affecting contraction of the left ventricle rather than its depolarization.",

        "abstract": "Mild lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) has been utilized to selectively unload cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, but there is evidence that arterial baroreceptors can be transiently unloaded after the onset of mild LBNP. In this paper, a black box mathematical model for the prediction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variability from multiple inputs (systolic blood pressure, R-R interval duration, and central venous pressure) was applied to interpret the dynamics of blood pressure maintenance under the challenge of LBNP and in long-duration, head-down bed rest (HDBR). Hemodynamic recordings from seven participants in the WISE (Women's International Space Simulation for Exploration) Study collected during an experiment of incremental LBNP (-10 mmHg, -20 mmHg, -30 mmHg) were analyzed before and on day 50 of a 60-day-long HDBR campaign. Autoregressive spectral analysis focused on low-frequency (LF, ~0.1 Hz) oscillations of DBP, which are related to fluctuations in vascular resistance due to sympathetic and baroreflex regulation of vasomotor tone. The arterial baroreflex-related component explained 49 \u00b1 13% of LF variability of DBP in spontaneous conditions, and 89 \u00b1 9% (P < 0.05) on day 50 of HDBR, while the cardiopulmonary baroreflex component explained 17 \u00b1 9% and 12 \u00b1 4%, respectively. The arterial baroreflex-related variability was significantly increased in bed rest also for LBNP equal to -20 and -30 mmHg. The proposed technique provided a model interpretation of the proportional effect of arterial baroreflex vs. cardiopulmonary baroreflex-mediated components of blood pressure control and showed that arterial baroreflex was the main player in the mediation of DBP variability. Data during bed rest suggested that cardiopulmonary baroreflex-related effects are blunted and that blood pressure maintenance in the presence of an orthostatic stimulus relies mostly on arterial control.",

        "abstract": "Prolonged bed rest has significant negative impacts on the human body, particularly on the cardiovascular system. To overcome adverse effects and enhance functional recovery in bedridden patients, the goal is to mobilize patients as early as possible while controlling and stabilizing their cardiovascular system. In this paper, we used a robotic tilt table that allows early mobilization by modulating body inclination and automated leg movement to control the cardiovascular variables heart rate (HR) or systolic or diastolic blood pressures (sBP, dBP). The design and use of a control system is often done with a simulation model of a plant, but the time-variant and nonlinear nature of the cardiovascular system and subject-specific responses to external stimuli makes the modeling and identification challenging. Instead, we implemented an intelligent self-learning fuzzy controller that does not need any prior knowledge about the plant. The controller modulates the body inclination in order to adjust the cardiovascular parameters, with leg movement considered as a perturbing factor to the controller. The controller performance was evaluated in six healthy subjects. Measured mean values of HR, sBP, and dBP differed from desired reference values by 1.11 beats/min, 5.10 mmHg, and 2.69 mmHg, respectively. With this new control strategy, HR and dBP could be successfully controlled within medically tolerable ranges (deviations <; 2.5 beats/min and <; 5 mmHg from desired values, respectively). The control of sBP was less accurate; the results suggest that simultaneous control of multiple input stimuli rather than only adaptive automatic change of the tilt table angle might improve the controllability.",

        "title": "Distinctive Steady-State Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Responses to Passive Robotic Leg Exercise during Head-Up Tilt: A Pilot Study in Neurological Patients",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Robot-assisted tilt table therapy was proposed for early rehabilitation and mobilization of patients after diseases such as stroke. A robot-assisted tilt table with integrated passive robotic leg exercise (PE) mechanism has the potential to prevent orthostatic hypotension usually provoked by verticalization. In a previous study with rather young healthy subjects [average age: 25.1 \u00b1 2.6 years (standard deviation)], we found that PE effect on the cardiovascular system depends on the verticalization angle of the robot-assisted tilt table. In the current study, we investigated in an older population of neurological patients (a) whether they show the same PE effects as younger healthy population on the cardiovascular system at different tilt angles, (b) whether changing the PE frequency (i.e., stepping speed) influences the PE effect on the cardiovascular system, (c) whether PE could prevent orthostatic hypotension, and finally, (d) whether PE effect is consistent from day to day. Methods: Heart rate (HR), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (sBP, dBP) in response to PE at two different tilt angles (\u03b1 = 20\u00b0, 60\u00b0) with three different PE frequencies (i.e., 0, 24, and 48 steps per minute) of 10 neurological patients [average age: 68.4 \u00b1 13.5 years (standard deviation)] were measured on 2 consecutive days. Linear mixed models were used to develop statistical models and analyze the repeated measurements. Results: The models show that: PE significantly increased sBP and dBP but had no significant effect on HR. (a) Similar to healthy subjects the effect of PE on sBP was dependent on the tilt angle with higher tilt angles resulting in a higher increase. Head-up tilting alone significantly increased HR and dBP but resulted in a non-significant drop in sBP. PE, in general, had a more additive effect on increasing BP. (b) The effect of PE was not influenced by its speed. (c) Neither during head-up tilt alone nor in combination with PE did participants experience orthostatic hypotension. (d) The measurement day was not a statistically significant factor regarding the effects of verticalization and PE on the cardiovascular response. Conclusion: We provide evidence that PE can increase steady-state values of sBP and dBP in neurological patients during head-up tilt. Similar to healthy subjects the effect on sBP depends on the verticalization angle of the robot-assisted tilt table. PE might have the potential to prevent orthostatic hypotension, but as the amount of drop in BP in response to head-up tilting was not leading to orthostatic hypotension in our patients, we could neither conclude nor reject such a preventive compensatory effect. Furthermore, we found that changing the PE speed does not influence the steady-state cardiovascular response.",
