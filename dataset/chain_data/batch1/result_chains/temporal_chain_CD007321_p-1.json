        "abstract": "S-adenosylmethionine is a relatively new anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and anti-depressant effects. Efficacy of 800 mg orally administered s-adenosylmethionine daily versus placebo for six weeks was investigated in 44 patients with primary fibromyalgia in double-blind settings. Tender point score, isokinetic muscle strength, disease activity, subjective symptoms (visual analog scale), mood parameters and side effects were evaluated. Improvements were seen for clinical disease activity (P = 0.04), pain experienced during the last week (P = 0.002), fatigue (P = 0.02), morning stiffness (P = 0.03) and mood evaluated by Face Scale (P = 0.006) in the actively treated group compared to placebo. The tender point score, isokinetic muscle strength, mood evaluated by Beck Depression Inventory and side effects did not differ in the two treatment groups. S-adenosylmethionine has some beneficial effects on primary fibromyalgia and could be an important option in the treatment hereof.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To determine if a combination of biochemical variables [e.g., plasma amino acids and catecholamines] would better classify patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS] and pain-free normal controls than a single variable alone. Methods. Plasma amino acids and catecholamines as well as urinary catecholamines were analyzed in 29 patients with FMS and 30 painfree normal controls who were clinically and psychologically evaluated. Discriminant analysis was used to select a number of biochemical variables which in combination would best classify the study subjects. Results. A combination of 7 variables [plasma histidine, methionine, tryptophan, norepinephrine, isoleucine and leucine, and urinary dopamine] provided the optimum sensitivity of 86%. Pain, fatigue, poor sleep and number of tender points, but not anxiety, depression or mental stress, significantly [P < 0.001] correlated with the discriminant scores. Conclusion. A combination of biochemical variables better classifies patients with FMS and nor...",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Blood investigations (n = 60) have been performed on several groups of female fibromyalgia (FM) patients who ranged in number from 20-to-25, and several groups of matched female controls who ranged in number from 19-to-20. Glycolysis, mitochon-drial respiratory chain, and antioxidant status parameters were assessed in plasma, erythrocytes, and leucocytes. Erythrocyte-transketolase and leucocyte-pyruvate dehydrogenase affinity for their coenzyme, as well as nitric oxide, citrulline and thiols were significantly (P < 0.01) decreased. Protein carbonyles were significantly (P < 0.01) increased. Less significant abnormalities (P < 0.05) were observed in erythrocyte-ATP, leucocyte-NAD, lactate production, lacticodehy-drogenase muscular isoenzymes, catalase, glutathione, taurine (decreased) and erythrocyte-transketolase activity coefficient, pyruvate or acyl carnitine/free carnitine ratio (increased). Mitochondrial respiratory chain was unchanged. Our findings are in line with investigations with nuclea...",

        "title": "Female fibromyalgia patients: lower resting metabolic rates than matched healthy controls.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany features of fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism are virtually the same, and thyroid hormone treatment trials have reduced or eliminated fibromyalgia symptoms. These findings led the authors to test the hypothesis that fibromyalgia patients are hypometabolic compared to matched controls.\n\n\nMATERIAL/METHODS\nResting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry and body composition by bioelectrical impedance for 15 fibromyalgia patients and 15 healthy matched controls. Measured resting metabolic rate (mRMR) was compared to percentages of predicted RMR (pRMR) by fat-free weight (FFW) (Sterling-Passmore: SP) and by sex, age, height, and weight (Harris-Benedict: HB).\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients had a lower mRMR (4,306.31+/-1077.66 kJ vs 5,411.59+/-695.95 kJ, p=0.0028) and lower percentages of pRMRs (SP: -28.42+/-15.82% vs -6.83+/-12.55%, p<0.0001. HB: -29.20+/-17.43% vs -9.13+/-9.51%, p=0.0008). Whereas FFW, age, weight, and body mass index (BMI) best accounted for variability in controls' RMRs, age and fat weight (FW) did for patients. In the patient group, TSH level accounted for 28% of the variance in pain distribution, and free T3 (FT3) accounted for 30% of the variance in pressure-pain threshold.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients had lower mRMR and percentages of pRMRs. The lower RMRs were not due to calorie restriction or low FFW. Patients' normal FFW argues against low physical activity as the mechanism. TSH, FT4, and FT3 levels did not correlate with RMRs in either group. This does not rule out inadequate thyroid hormone regulation because studies show these laboratory values do not reliably predict RMR.",

        "title": "Metabolic Failure as the Cause of Fibromyalgia Syndrome: Exploring the John C. Lowe Thesis",
        "abstract": "[16] Results. Comparing the questionnaire answers of the 27 FMS patients with the statistics from hypothyroid patients, the frequencies of symptoms fit a pattern of untreated hypothyroidism. The Van Vincent BE-T-A test showed an acidosis of mesenchymal tissues, such as connective tissues and lymphatic and blood vessels. The acidosis can be explained by a lack of thyroid hormone effect at the cellular level, leading to an increase in parenchymal anaerobic metabolism, in which biological processes proceed in the absence of oxygen. Conclusion. The results of questionnaire analysis, use of the Van Vincent BE-T-A testing, and the author\u2019s clinical experience are consistent with the Lowe thesis that metabolic failure underlies FMS. The cause of the failure is plausibly explained by deficiencies of thyroid hormones or reduced cellular effects of the hormones. There are two natural solutions to this problem: (1) increase the amount of thyroid hormones available to the tissues, and (2) normalize the cellular effects of thyroid hormones by removing whatever hinders their normal effects.",
