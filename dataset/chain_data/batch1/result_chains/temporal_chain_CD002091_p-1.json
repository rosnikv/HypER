        "abstract": "A cooperative clinical investigation was undertaken in 17 Veterans Administration Hospitals to determine the effects of long-term therapy with conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) in prevention of recurrent cerebral infarction or death due to atherosclerotic vascular disease. To date, 582 men with cerebral infarction have been assigned on a random basis to either the treatment or control groups and observed for periods as long as 34 months. Initial treatment consisted of 1.25 mg. of Premarin daily and was increased to 2.5 mg. after the first year. Estrogenic therapy failed to reduce the incidence of either cerebral or myocardial infarction developing during the period of follow-up observation. There was likewise no significant change in the mortality rate following onset of therapy. Of the 63 deaths in the study, 34 occurred in patients receiving treatment and 29 among those receiving the placebo preparation. Approximately 40 per cent of patients developed mild side reactions to the estrogenic agent, usually consisting of breast tenderness or enlargement, or both. These preliminary observations failed to demonstrate that treatment with conjugated equine estrogenic hormones in small and moderate dosages for an average period of 16.7 months had any value in lowering the recurrence of cerebral infarction or reducing the mortality rate subsequent to this disorder.",

        "title": "Estrogenic Therapy in Men With Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease: Effect on Recurrent Cerebral Infarction and Survival Final Report Of The Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Of Atherosclerosis, Neurology Section",
        "abstract": "A cooperative clinical investigation was undertaken in 15 Veterans Administration Hospitals to determine whether long-term therapy with conjugated equine estrogens prevented recurrent cerebral infarction or death due to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Follow-up observations were made for periods up to five years in 572 men with cerebral infarction who were assigned on a random basis to placebo or to treatment with 1.25 to 2.5 mg of Premarin daily. Estrogen administration failed to reduce the incidence of cerebral infarction, transient cerebral ischemia or death due to vascular disease. Although use of hormones was associated with an overall higher death rate, this excess mortality was due largely to cancer and various other diseases and could not be attributed directly to the medication. Occurrences of and deaths from myocardial infarction were less in treated than control patients, but vascular disorders, such as pulmonary embolism, mesenteric thrombosis and heart failure were more frequent in the former group. This study failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect in men with cerebral infarction from estrogens given in moderate amounts for as long as five years. There was, on the other hand, no evidence to support current reports that prolonged estrogen use in these dosages produced an increased mortality from thromboembolism.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it builds upon the initial investigation of estrogenic therapy in men with cerebral infarction and presents a final report with extended follow-up observations."
