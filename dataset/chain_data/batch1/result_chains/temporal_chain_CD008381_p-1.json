        "title": "Effects of Nortriptyline on Depression and Glycemic Control in Diabetes: Results of a Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Objective Depression is a prevalent and chronic condition in diabetes and is associated with poor glucose regulation and poor compliance with diabetes treatment. This investigation evaluated the effects of nortriptyline on depression and glycemic control to see whether depression in diabetes is treatable and whether restoring mental health contributes to improved medical outcome. Method: Sixty-eight diabetic patients with poor glycemic control, 28 of whom had active major depression (DSM-IIIR), completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 8 weeks of treatment with nortriptyline targeted to therapeutic plasma levels (50-150 ng/ml). Depression improvement was determined with the Beck Depression Inventory; glucose control was measured by glycated hemoglobin levels. Compliance behavior was assessed using medication dispensing devices and glucometers equipped with electronic memory. Results: The reduction in depression symptoms was significantly greater in depressed patients treated with nortriptyline compared with those receiving placebo (-10.2 vs -5.8, p =.03). Nortriptyline was not statistically superior to placebo in reducing glycated hemoglobin of the depressed subjects (p =.5). However, path analysis indicated that the direct effect of nortriptyline was to worsen glycemic control whereas depression improvement had an independent beneficial effect on glycated hemoglobin. These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to weight change (r = -0.21, p =.31) or depression improvement to compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p =.97). Conclusions: Major depression in diabetic patients can be effectively treated with nortriptyline at the expense of a direct hyperglycemic effect. Path analysis demonstrated a treatment-independent effect of depression improvement on glycemic control, suggesting that a more ideal antidepressant agent may both restore mental health and improve medical outcome.",

        "abstract": "It has been reported that depression and diabetes mellitus often occur together, and insulin resistance has been observed in patients with depression. For further understanding of the relationship of depression to insulin resistance, three patients with depression were given the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) with minimal model analysis before and after antidepressant treatment. Depressive patients showed decreased glucose tolerance, enhanced insulin secretion, and diminished insulin sensitively during OGTT and FSIGT. These abnormalities were resolved after their recovery from depression without changes in body weight or diet.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the relationship between depression and insulin resistance, which is a key finding of the source paper. The paper uses the minimal model analysis to study the changes in insulin resistance in patients with depression, which is a more in-depth exploration of the topic."

        "title": "Acute effect of different antidepressants on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats.",
        "abstract": "Diabetic patients have a 20% higher risk of depression than the general population. Treatment with antidepressant drugs can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with hypoglycemic agents. The treatment of depression in diabetic patients must take into account variations of glycemic levels at different times and a comparison of the available antidepressant agents is important. In the present study we evaluated the interference of antidepressants with blood glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic rats. In a first experiment, male adult Wistar rats were fasted for 12 h. Imipramine (5 mg/kg), moclobemide (30 mg/kg), clonazepam (0.25 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) sertraline (30 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered. After 30 min, fasting glycemia was measured. An oral glucose overload of 1 ml of a 50% glucose solution was given to rats and blood glucose was determined after 30, 60 and 90 min. Imipramine and clonazepam did not change fasting or overload glycemia. Fluoxetine and moclobemide increased blood glucose at different times after the glucose overload. Sertraline neutralized the increase of glycemia induced by oral glucose overload. In the second experiment, non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fasted, and the same procedures were followed for estimation of glucose tolerance 30 min after glucose overload. Again, sertraline neutralized the increase in glycemia after glucose overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. These data raise the question of whether sertraline is the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individuals, because of its antihyperglycemic effects. Clonazepam would be useful in cases with potential risk of hypoglycemia.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the effect of antidepressants on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats, which is related to the topic of insulin resistance in depression. However, it does not directly build upon or use the findings of the source paper as a sub-hypothesis. The connection is indirect, as both papers discuss the relationship between depression and glucose metabolism."

        "title": "Lack of hypo/hyperglycemic effects of Reboxetine in diabetic and non\u2010diabetic rats",
        "abstract": "Depression occurs frequently with diabetes affecting the quality of life. All major classes of antidepressants have been shown to have a direct pharmacologic effect on metabolic function, which further worsens glycemic control. There were no reports of effects of reboxetine on glucose and insulin levels. We observed that 21\u2003days administration of reboxetine (2.5\u2003mg/kg, i.p.) in streptozotocin (55\u2003mg/kg, i.p.) induced diabetic and non\u2010diabetic rats produced no significant alteration in glucose levels in diabetic and non\u2010diabetic rats. Serum insulin levels were also not significantly changed by reboxetine (2.5\u2003mg/kg, i.p.). Selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake by reboxetine has been suggested to be responsible for lack of effects on glucose and insulin levels.",

        "title": "Gut Microbiome Alteration after Reboxetine Administration in Type-1 Diabetic Rats",
        "abstract": "Antidepressants are drugs commonly used in clinical settings. However, there are very limited studies on the effects of these drugs on the gut microbiota. Herein, we evaluated the effect of reboxetine (RBX), a selective norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor (NRI), on gut microbiota in both diabetic and non-diabetic rats. This is the first report of relation between reboxetine use and the gut microbiota to our knowledge. In this study, type-1 diabetes induced by using streptozotocin (STZ) and RBX was administered to diabetic rats and healthy controls for 14 days. At the end of the treatment, stool samples were collected. Following DNA extraction, amplicon libraries for the V3-V4 region were prepared and sequenced with the Illumina Miseq platform. QIIME was used for preprocessing and analysis of the data. As a result, RBX had a significant effect on gut microbiota structure and composition in diabetic and healthy rats. For example, RBX exposure had a pronounced microbial signature in both groups, with a low Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and low Lactobacillus levels. While another abundance phylum after exposure to RBX was Proteabacteria, other notable taxa in the diabetic group included Flavobacterium, Desulfovibrionaceae, Helicobacteriaceae, Campylobacterales, and Pasteurellacae when compared to the untreated group.",
