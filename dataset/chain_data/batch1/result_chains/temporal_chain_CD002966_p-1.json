        "title": "Efficacy of metformin in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The Multicenter Metformin Study Group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSulfonylurea drugs have been the only oral therapy available for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in the United States. Recently, however, metformin has been approved for the treatment of NIDDM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed two large, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled studies in which metformin or another treatment was given for 29 weeks to moderately obese patients with NIDDM whose diabetes was inadequately controlled by diet (protocol 1: metformin vs. placebo; 289 patients), or diet plus glyburide (protocol 2: metformin and glyburide vs. metformin vs. glyburide; 632 patients). To determine efficacy we measured plasma glucose (while the patients were fasting and after the oral administration of glucose), lactate, lipids, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin before, during, and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn protocol 1, at the end of the study the 143 patients in the metformin group, as compared with the 146 patients in the placebo group, had lower mean (+/- SE) fasting plasma glucose concentrations (189 +/- 5 vs. 244 +/- 6 mg per deciliter [10.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.6 +/- 0.2 percent, P < 0.001). In protocol 2, the 213 patients given metformin and glyburide, as compared with the 210 patients treated with glyburide alone, had lower mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations (187 +/- 4 vs. 261 +/- 4 mg per deciliter [10.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.7 +/- 0.1 percent, P < 0.001). The effect of metformin alone was similar to that of glyburide alone. Eighteen percent of the patients given metformin and glyburide had symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia, as compared with 3 percent in the glyburide group and 2 percent in the metformin group. In both protocols the patients given metformin had statistically significant decreases in plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, whereas the values in the respective control groups did not change. There were no significant changes in fasting plasma lactate concentrations in any of the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea are well tolerated and improve glycemic control and lipid concentrations in patients with NIDDM whose diabetes is poorly controlled with diet or sulfonylurea therapy alone.",

        "title": "Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and modes of action of therapeutic interventions.",
        "abstract": "At least 90% of the 12 to 15 million persons with diabetes mellitus in the United States, half of whose condition remains undiagnosed, have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance, a reversible metabolic state associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular complications. Thus, at the time of diagnosis, long-term complications have developed in almost one fourth of patients. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes requires genetic (most likely polygenic) and acquired factors, and its pathogenesis involves an interplay of progressive insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. The ideal treatment of type 2 diabetes should reverse insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in most treated patients and prevent, delay, or reverse long-term complications. Current strategies are aimed at amelioration of insulin resistance (diet, exercise, weight loss, and metformin and troglitazone therapy), augmentation of insulin supply (sulfonylurea and insulin therapy), or limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia (acarbose therapy). Future therapies probably will target (1) insulin resistance, using a multifaceted approach; (2) hepatic glucose production, using gluconeogenesis inhibitors; (3) excess nonesterified fatty acid production, using lipolysis inhibitors; and (4) fat oxidation, using carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II inhibitors. Attempts also could be made to stimulate energy expenditure and increase nonoxidative glucose disposal by means of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. One promising strategy is an attack on multiple pathophysiological processes by combining antidiabetic agents with disparate mechanisms of action. Thus, we now have unprecedented resources for drug therapy for diabetes, with great opportunity for innovative combinations. It is hoped that these expanded choices will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient management of type 2 diabetes and prevention of its long-term complications.",

        "title": "Effects of Metformin in Patients with Poorly Controlled, Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is more prevalent among persons and populations in which obesity or a family history of the disease is present. Modification of dietary habits and subsequent weight loss (important steps in the management of both obesity and diabetes) improve glycemic control. However, glycemic goals are usually not achieved by dietary restriction alone, andpharmacologic intervention is often necessary. Until 1995, sulfonylurea compounds were the only oral antihyperglycemic agents available in the United States for initial drug therapy for type 2 diabetes (1-3). These agents have a high rate of secondary failure (1-3), however, and the addition of other oral agents or insulin is often necessary. Because many persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight and insulin resistant, high doses of insulin are often required to achieve adequate glycemic control. However, insulin therapy is associated with weight gain, which could somewhat vitiate the expected improvement in glycemic control. It is now common to combine therapeutic agents that have complementary mechanisms of action, such as sulfonylurea compounds and insulin (1-5). With the development of new oral medications-such as biguanides, -glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones-that have different modes of action designed to improve diabetes control, combination therapy has become even more common (1-6). Metformin, a biguanide, has been approved in the United States for use alone or in combination with sulfonylurea compounds since 1995.Its main mechanisms of action are to decrease hepatic glucose output (3, 7-12) and improve peripheral insulin sensitivity (1-3, 7, 8). The use of metformin alone or in combination with sulfonylurea compounds has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2diabetes (1, 2, 10, 12). Blood lipid abnormalities, particularly hypertriglyceridemia, have also improved with metformin use (1-3, 7, 10, 12-14), and weight loss has been reported in many persons (1-3, 7, 10, 15, 16).Some physicians recommend metformin as the first drug of choice in the treatment of obese patients with type 2 diabetes (9, 17); this recommendation has been supported by the recent findings of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (16, 18). Metformin-insulin therapy has been used successfully in Europe (13), but few reports of this potentially useful combination have been published. The probable clinical importance of the combination of metformin and insulin includes improvements in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity and avoidance of the weight gain that often accompanies improved glycemic control. We evaluated the effect of metformin on glycemic control and exogenous insulin requirements when given in combination with insulin topatients with type 2 diabetes that was poorly controlled by insulin alone. Methods Patients Study patients were required to meet the following criteria: type 2 diabetes diagnosed after 30 years of age and treated for at least 2 years with at least 50 units of insulin per day, age at enrollment younger than 70 years, and a hemoglobin A1c level 8.0%. We excluded pregnant women; women trying to become pregnant; patients with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 132.6 mmol/L (1.5mg/dL) or hepatic enzyme levels greater than twice the upper limit of normal; and patients with medical conditions that could promote lactic acidosis, such as renal or hepatic disease, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All patients provided written informed consent before study entrance. The institutional review board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas approved the study protocol. Follow-up Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive metformin or placebo in addition to their current insulin therapy. Glycemic control, insulin dose requirements, study drug tolerance, body weight, and blood pressure changes were assessed at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24. Evaluation of Other Study End Points Body weight and blood pressure were measured at every office visit. Patients were weighed while wearing street clothes, and blood pressure was measured when the patient was in a sitting position. Complete medical histories, physical examinations, fasting lipid and lipoprotein profiles, C-peptide concentrations, and serum chemistries were determined at the beginning and end of the study. Intervention Metformin was administered as 500-mg tablets. Metformin and placebo tablets had a similar appearance, thereby preventing identification of the tablets by the investigators or the patients. During the first 2 weeks of the study, patients were instructed to ingest one tablet of the study drug with breakfast and one tablet with supper in addition to their current insulin therapy. At week 2, the dosage of the study drug was increased to 1500 mg/d(one tablet three times daily with meals). At week 4, the dosage of the study drug was increased to 2000 mg/d, and the insulin dose was adjusted accordingly. At week 8, the dosage was increased to the maximum dose of 2500 mg/d (five tablets per day). Compliance was assessed by pill count, which was performed at each office visit. During the titration phase, drug tolerance was assessed at every visit. Hypoglycemic episodes and such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and anorexia were also assessed at each visit. The dose of the study drug was adjusted when necessary to prevent adverse effects. The patients continued to receive the maximum tolerated dosage from weeks 8 to 24. Assessment of Glycemic Control and Insulin Dose Adjustments The goal of therapy was to achieve normoglycemia in the absence of serious hypoglycemia. The patients were asked to perform blood glucose monitoring at least twice per day (before breakfast and before supper) and as necessary (that is, when symptoms of hypoglycemia occurred). Postprandial blood glucose monitoring was not done. Daily self-monitoring records and fasting plasma glucose concentrations were reviewed at every visit. A patient-directed insulin dose algorithm was not used. At every visit, the insulin dose was adjusted in amount or frequency depending on the patient's monitoring results, meal schedule, daily schedule, and reported symptoms of hypoglycemia. The insulin dose was decreased if the fasting plasma glucose concentrations were consistently 5.55 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or if the patient reported symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentrations 2.78 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]). All changes in insulin dose were made by study personnel. Hemoglobin A1c levels were measured by using high-pressure liquid chromatography at baseline and at weeks 8, 16, and 24. Levels within the range of persons without diabetes ( 5.6%) were the goal for both groups. Diet Dietary counseling was offered to every patient at screening and at subsequent visits as needed. General guidelines regarding portion sizes from all food groups were given without calculated caloric plans. Changes in daily caloric intake were assessed through review of a 3-day food record at baseline and at the end of the study. Patients were encouraged to maintain baseline levels of physical activity throughout the study. Analytical Determinations Plasma glucose concentrations were determined by using an automated glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyser 2, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California). C-peptide concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay using polyclonal antisera. Fasting lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were assessed by using standard laboratory methods. Statistical Analysis The efficacy analysis included all patients who met inclusion criteria and had a baseline hemoglobin A1c measurement and at least one postbaseline hemoglobin A1c measurement. Baseline characteristics and incidences of various events between groups were examined by using contingency-table analysis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Paired t-tests with 95% CIs were used to compare baseline and posttreatment body weight, fasting plasma glucose concentrations, hemoglobin A1c concentrations, daily insulin dose, fasting C-peptide level, fasting lipid profile, and daily caloric intake within and between groups. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the incidence of side effects between groups. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted by using SPSS software, version 9.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). All results are reported as the mean SD. Skewed data are shown as the mean SD (median [minimum,maximum]). Role of the Funding Source Funding for this study was provided in part by a grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The study protocol was developed and implemented by the authors. Other than a preliminary statistical evaluation, the analysis and reporting were done by the authors independently of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Dr. Raskin is a member of the Bristol-Myers Squibb speaker's bureau. Results Baseline Patient Characteristics Fifty-four patients gave informed consent and were randomly assigned to receive placebo or metformin. Forty-three patients (21 assigned to receive metformin and 22 assigned to receive placebo) met the entrance criteria and were followed for the entire 24 weeks. Baseline characteristics of the study patients are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Both groups were comparable in age, body weight, sex, ethnicity, duration of diabetes, duration of insulin therapy, daily insulin dose, mean hemoglobin A1c levels, and all of the analyzed study variables.

        "abstract": "The U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that intensive glucose control with insulin or sulfonylureas markedly reduces the risk of microvascular complications (1). For myocardial infarction, the reduction in risk (16% for a 0.9% decrease in HbA1c) was of borderline significance but corresponded closely to epidemiological predictions (14% decrease for a 1% drop in HbA1c) (2). These data demonstrated that neither insulin nor sulfonylureas, despite causing hyperinsulinemia and weight gain, have adverse effects on cardiovascular outcome. Glycemic control deteriorated continuously, however, even in intensively treated patients in the UKPDS (1).\n\nIn the UKPDS, the worsening of glycemic control has been attributed to the natural course of type 2 diabetes and lack of efficacy of current antihyperglycemic therapies (1). Insulin therapy consisted of a single injection of ultralente or isophane insulin. If the daily dose exceeded 14 U, regular insulin was added and home-glucose monitoring was encouraged (1). Combination therapy regimens with insulin and oral agents were not used. We now know that 14 U of long-acting insulin is insufficient to control fasting glycemia in most type 2 diabetic patients (3). Since 1977, when the UKPDS was started, several studies have tried to define the optimal insulin treatment regimen for type 2 diabetic patients. These studies are the focus of this review and include studies comparing insulin alone to combination therapy with insulin and sulfonylureas (subject to meta-analyses in 1991 and 1992) (4,5) and more recent trials using metformin, glitazones, or acarbose in insulin combination therapy regimens. They do not contain data on cardiovascular end points but only on surrogate markers of risk of micro- and macrovascular complications, mostly data on glycemia, body weight, insulin doses, lipids, and in a few studies, also accurate data on the frequency of hypoglycemias.\n\nAccording to a Medline search (1966\u20132000), \u2026",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTo study the effect on body weight and glycaemic control of two insulin treatment regimens in patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate failure to oral hypoglycaemic agents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixteen patients treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents (6 men and 10 women) were included in this open-label, randomized, parallel group study. Their age was 62 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) years (range 44-79 years), body weight 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.6 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2). The patients were switched to insulin treatment with bedtime NPH insulin combined with daytime sulphonylurea (combination group) or twice daily injections of a premixed combination of regular human and NPH insulin (insulin twice daily group) with measurements as given below before and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHbA(1c) was lowered from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 7.0 +/- 0.2% in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.05) and from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 6.8 +/- 0.5% in the combination group (p<0.03; ns between treatment groups). Body weight increased from 71.7 +/- 4.0 kg to 77.6 +/- 4.4 kg in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.001) and from 70.8 +/- 4.6 kg to 72.7 +/- 5.1 kg in the combination group (ns; p<0.02 between groups).

        "abstract": "Insulin resistance in muscle and liver and \u03b2-cell failure represent the core pathophysiologic defects in type 2 diabetes. It now is recognized that the \u03b2-cell failure occurs much earlier and is more severe than previously thought. Subjects in the upper tertile of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are maximally/near-maximally insulin resistant and have lost over 80% of their \u03b2-cell function. In addition to the muscle, liver, and \u03b2-cell (triumvirate), the fat cell (accelerated lipolysis), gastrointestinal tract (incretin deficiency/resistance), \u03b1-cell (hyperglucagonemia), kidney (increased glucose reabsorption), and brain (insulin resistance) all play important roles in the development of glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetic individuals. Collectively, these eight players comprise the ominous octet and dictate that: 1 ) multiple drugs used in combination will be required to correct the multiple pathophysiological defects, 2 ) treatment should be based upon reversal of known pathogenic abnormalities and not simply on reducing the A1C, and 3 ) therapy must be started early to prevent/slow the progressive \u03b2-cell failure that already is well established in IGT subjects. A treatment paradigm shift is recommended in which combination therapy is initiated with diet/exercise, metformin (which improves insulin sensitivity and has antiatherogenic effects), a thiazolidinedione (TZD) (which improves insulin sensitivity, preserves \u03b2-cell function, and exerts antiatherogenic effects), and exenatide (which preserves \u03b2-cell function and promotes weight loss). Sulfonylureas are not recommended because, after an initial improvement in glycemic control, they are associated with a progressive rise in A1C and progressive loss of \u03b2-cell function.\n\nThe natural history of type 2 diabetes has been well described in multiple populations (1\u201316) (rev. in (17,18).

        "abstract": "The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires practitioners to periodically evaluate patients and intensify glucose-lowering treatment once glycemic targets are not attained. With guidelines moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach toward setting patient-centered goals and allowing flexibility in choosing a second-/third-line drug from the growing number of U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved glucose-lowering agents, keen personalized management in T2D has become a challenge for health care providers in daily practice. Among the newer generation of glucose-lowering drug classes, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), which enhance urinary glucose excretion to lower hyperglycemia, have made an imposing entrance to the T2D treatment armamentarium. Given their unique insulin-independent mode of action and their favorable efficacy\u2013to\u2013adverse event profile and given their marked benefits on cardiovascular-renal outcome in moderate-to-high risk T2D patients, which led to updates of guidelines and product monographs, the role of this drug class in multidrug regimes is promising. However, despite many speculations based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, physiological reasoning, and potential synergism, the effects of these agents in terms of glycemic and pleiotropic efficacy when combined with other glucose-lowering drug classes are largely understudied. In this perspective, we review the currently emerging evidence, discuss prevailing hypotheses, and elaborate on necessary future studies to clarify the potential risks and benefits of using an SGLT2i in dual combination with metformin and triple combination with a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, or other glucose-lowering agent that is recommended by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (i.e., a sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin) to treat patients with T2D.",

        "title": "Combination Therapy with an SGLT2 Inhibitor as Initial Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background: Guidelines differ with regard to indications for initial combination pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes. Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of (i) sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor combination therapy in treatment-na\u00efve type 2 diabetes adults; (ii) initial high and low dose SGLT2 inhibitor combination therapy. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of initial SGLT2 combination therapy. Mean difference (MD) for changes from baseline (HbA1c, weight, blood pressure) after 24\u201326 weeks of treatment and relative risks (RR, safety) were calculated using a random-effects model. Risk of bias and quality of evidence was assessed. Results: In 4 RCTs (n = 3749) there was moderate quality evidence that SGLT2 inhibitor/metformin combination therapy resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c (MD (95% CI); \u22120.55% (\u22120.67, \u22120.43)) and weight (\u22122.00 kg (\u22122.34, \u22121.66)) compared with metformin monotherapy, and a greater reduction in HbA1c (\u22120.59% (\u22120.72, \u22120.46)) and weight (\u22120.57 kg (\u22120.89, \u22120.25)) compared with SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy. The high dose SGLT2 inhibitor/metformin combination resulted in a similar HbA1c but greater weight reduction; \u22120.47 kg (\u22120.88, \u22120.06) than the low dose combination therapy. The RR of genital infection with combination therapy was 2.22 (95% CI 1.33, 3.72) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.50, 0.96) compared with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy, respectively. The RR of diarrhoea was 2.23 (95% CI 1.46, 3.40) with combination therapy compared with SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy. Conclusions: Initial SGLT2 inhibitor/metformin combination therapy has glycaemic and weight benefits compared with either agent alone and appears relatively safe. High dose SGLT2 inhibitor/metformin combination therapy appears to have modest weight, but no glycaemic benefits compared with the low dose combination therapy.",

        "title": "Cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin and sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
        "abstract": "Background: Diabetes mellitus is a serious threat to global health and among the top 10 causes of death, with nearly half a billion people living with it worldwide. Treating patients with diabetes tend to become more challenging due to the nature of the disease. The role and benefits of combination therapies for the management of type 2 diabetes are well-documented, while the comparative safety and efficacy among the different combination options have not been elucidated. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the comparative cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin and sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method: We searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 August 2019 and without restriction in the year of publication. We included randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes who were on metformin- sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or metformin-sulphonylureas combination therapy at least for a year. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hypoglycemia, and changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Random effect model was carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between the two combination therapies. Results: Of 3,190 citations, we included nine trials involving 10,974 participants. The pooled analysis showed no significance difference in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.52, 1.67]), serious adverse events (RR=0.96, 95% CI [0.79, 1.17]) and adverse events (RR=1.00, 95% CI [0.99, 1.02]) between the two, but in hypoglycemia (RR= 0.13, 95% CI [0.10, 0.17], P<0.00001). Participants taking metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (MD= -0.10, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.03] %, body weight (MD= -4.57, 95% CI [-4.74, -4.39] kg, systolic blood pressure (MD=-4.77, 95% CI [-5.39, -4.16] mmHg, p<0.00001), diastolic blood pressure (MD=-2.07, 95% CI [-2.74, -1.40] mmHg, and fasting plasma glucose (MD= -0.55, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.41] mmol/L, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: A combination therapy of metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors is a safe and efficacious alternative to combination therapy of metformin and sulphonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular comorbidity. However, there remains a need for additional long-term randomized controlled trials as available studies are very limited and heterogeneous.
