        "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia and lipid peroxidation play complementary role in atherosclerosis. Artichoke leaf extract (ALE) is rich in natural antioxidants and has a cholesterol\u2010reducing effect. However, there is no study investigating the effect of ALE on lipid levels and lipid peroxidation in experimental hypercholesterolemic conditions. Rats were fed on 4% (w/w) cholesterol and 1% (w/w) cholic acid supplemented diet for 1 month. ALE (1.5\u2009g/kg/day) was given by gavage during the last 2 weeks. Serum lipid composition, malondialdehyde (MDA) and diene conjugate (DC) levels and plasma antioxidant activity (AOA) were measured. In addition, endogenous DC and copper\u2010induced MDA levels were determined in apo B\u2010containing lipoproteins (LDL+VLDL fraction). Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and the ratio of cholesterol to HDL\u2010cholesterol decreased due to ALE treatment in rats fed on HC diet. Significant decreases in serum MDA and DC levels and increases in plasma AOA were detected in serum in ALE\u2010treated hypercholesterolemic rats. Endogenous DC and copper\u2010induced MDA levels were also lower in LDL+VLDL fraction due to ALE\u2010treatment in hypercholesterolemic rats. Our results indicate that ALE may be useful for the prevention of hypercholesterolemia\u2010induced pro\u2010oxidant state in LDL+VLDL fraction and the reduction of increased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

        "title": "Lipid-lowering effect of artichoke on liver phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and plasma lipids in hyperlipidemic rats",
        "abstract": "Artichoke ( Cynara scolymus L.) is full of natural antioxidants and has a lipid-lowering effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of artichoke on the liver phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP), plasma lipid levels, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and plasma antioxidant in hyperlipidemic rats. Male rats were fed by standard pellet diet (Group 1), standard diet supplemented with 10% artichoke (Group 2), lipogenic diet (containing sunflower oil, cholesterol and ethanol) plus 10% artichoke (Group 3) and only lipogenic diet (Group 4). On day 60 of the experiment, liver PAP activity, liver triglyceride (TG), plasma lipids, plasma MDA, and plasma antioxidant levels were measured. PAP activity, liver TG, the ratio of total cholesterol (TC) to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, plasma TC and TG levels were significantly decreased due to artichoke treatment in Groups 2 and 3 compared to Groups 1 and 4, respectively. Significant reduction in plasma MDA and significant elevation in plasma antioxidant power observed in Groups 2 and 3 compared to Groups 1 and 4, respectively. The results clearly indicated that artichoke can be useful for the reduction of PAP activity and liver TG. Also, artichoke has beneficial effects in the controlling of hyperlipidemia, abnormalities in lipid profiles and oxidative stress in hyperlipidemic regimes.",

        "title": "The effect of sesame oil on the liver phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and serum lipoproteins in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.",
        "abstract": "Background and Aim: Nowadays, the effect of medicinal plants on the reduction of the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis has been confirmed. Liver phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) is a key regulatory enzyme in the glycerolipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sesame oil on liver PAP activity, liver triglyceride, liver cholesterol and serum lipoprotein levels in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Material and Methods: In this experimental study 27 New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n=9). Group1 (control) was fed with standard diet. Group II (hypercholesterolemic group) animals received hypercholesterolemic diet (1) without treatment. Group III was fed with hypercholesterolemic diet (1) plus sesame oil (5). After two months, liver PAP activity, liver triglyceride and cholesterol content, serum lipoproteins and malondialdehyde, and antioxidant capacity were measured. One way ANOVA was used for analysis of the mean values of the variables and for pair-wise comparison of the groups we used Tukey's test. Results: Group III had a significant decrease (P< 0.05) in the liver PAP activity compared to group II. In group II, consumption of the enriched cholesterol diet led to a significant elevation (P< 0.05) in serum lipoproteins compared to group I (control). Also, sesame oil in group III decreased the serum lipoproteins, liver triglyceride, and liver cholesterol in comparison to group II (p<0.05). However, a significant elevation (P< 0.05) in serum antioxidant capacity and a significant reduction in malondialdehyde level occurred in group III compared to group II (P<0.05). Conclusion: Sesame oil can be effective in reducing risk factors of cardiovascular diseases by decreasing serum lipids through making desirable alterations in serum lipoproteins. Also addition of sesame oil to hypercholesterolemic diets can reduce the liver PAP activity resulting in reduced liver triglyceride synthesis, which can decrease the risk of development of fatty liver in hypercholesterolemic diets.",
