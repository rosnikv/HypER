        "title": "Topical NSAIDs for musculoskeletal conditions. A review of the literature.",
        "abstract": "In recent years a growing number of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have become available. This has been prompted in large part by the high incidence of serious gastrointestinal adverse events associated with the use of systemic NSAIDs, and the premise that minimisation of plasma concentrations of active drug may result in fewer systemic adverse effects. Evidence in humans and animals with topical NSAIDs demonstrates lower plasma concentrations than with systemically administered drugs, while those in soft tissues are still of a magnitude considered consistent with exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. In joints, however, the evidence is less strong, and there is still dispute whether in this case the drug reaches the joint predominantly via the transcutaneous or systemic route. There has been a sufficient number of studies of soft tissue conditions to demonstrate the superiority of topical NSAIDs over placebo and to suggest equivalent efficacy in comparison with some oral NSAIDs. For arthropathies, however, the literature is more sparse. Although several studies claim a benefit for topical NSAIDs against placebo, the results are less conclusive and further study is required. Trials of topical agents against intra-articular corticosteroids and rubefacients are either lacking or inconclusive. The adverse event profile of topical agents is reasonable: minor cutaneous effects occur in up to 2% of patients but tend to be self-limiting. Gastrointestinal events appear from the existing literature to be infrequent and minor, although long term studies are required. Bronchospasm and renal impairment have been reported and may be more frequent in patients who have experienced these effects with oral agents. The initial costs of topical agents tend to be higher than those of oral agents but a cost-effectiveness analysis suggests an overall benefit: this issue requires further clarification.",

        "title": "Oral versus topical NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases: a comparison.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and are responsible for approximately one-quarter of all adverse drug reaction reports. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for patients with rheumatic disease--a population at increased risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Topical administration of NSAIDs offers the advantage of local, enhanced drug delivery to affected tissues with a reduced incidence of systemic adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease and GI haemorrhage. NSAIDs administered topically penetrate slowly and in small quantities into the systemic circulation; bioavailability and maximal plasma NSAID concentration after topical application are generally less than 5 and 15%, respectively, compared with equivalent oral administration. Product formulation may have a dramatic impact, not only on absorption rates but also on penetration depth. Compared with oral administration, topical application leads to relatively high NSAID concentrations in the dermis. Concentrations achieved in the muscle tissue below the site of application are variable, but are at least equivalent to that obtained with oral administration. NSAIDs applied topically do reach the synovial fluid, but the extent and mechanism (topical penetration versus distribution via the systemic circulation) remain to be determined. In addition, marked interindividual variability was noted in all studies; percutaneous absorption may be strongly influenced by individual skin properties. In general, interpretation of clinical studies measuring efficacy of topical NSAIDs in rheumatic disease states is difficult because of a remarkably high placebo response rate, use of rescue paracetamol (acetaminophen), and significant variability in percutaneous absorption and response rates between patients. Overall efficacy rates attributable to topical NSAIDs in patients with rheumatic disorders ranged from 18 to 92% of treated patients. Topically applied NSAIDs have a superior safety profile to oral formulations. Adverse effects secondary to topical NSAID application occur in approximately 10 to 15% of patients and are primarily cutaneous in nature (rash and pruritus at site of application). GI adverse drug reactions are rare with topically applied NSAIDs, compared with a 15% incidence reported for oral NSAIDs. Available clinical studies suggest, but do not document, equivalent efficacy of topical over oral NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases.",

        "title": "Synthesis and properties of a naproxen polymeric prodrug",
        "abstract": "A water\u2010soluble polymeric prodrug containing a naproxen moiety was synthesized. The carboxylic groups of naproxen were condensed with the hydroxyl groups of 2\u2010hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to produce a drug\u2010linked monomer, denoted HN. The polymeric prodrug was prepared by copolymerization of HN with methacrylic acid. The molar percentage of HN in the polymeric prodrug was 26 mol%, as determined by 1H NMR. To investigate the pertinence of this polymeric prodrug, the hydrolysis was studied in\u2010vitro with or without esterase or lipase. The kinetics of enzymatic catalysis was calculated from a Lineweaver\u2010Burk plot. The anti\u2010inflammatory activity was evaluated using the carrageenan\u2010induced oedema test. The polymeric prodrug released a major fraction of the free naproxen and a significant fraction of the hydroxyethyl ester derived\u2010naproxen. The maximum hydrolysis rate Vmax, and the Michaelis constant Km were calculated to be 2.16 times 10\u22125 equiv. mol L\u22121 min\u22121 and 5.11 times 10\u22122 equiv. mol L\u22121. The maximum anti\u2010inflammatory inhibition of free naproxen appeared at 2 h and quickly decreased thereafter. In contrast, the polymeric prodrug showed a maximum at around 2\u223c3 h and then slowly decreased. This indicates that the polymeric prodrug displays greater potency than free naproxen in the inhibition of acute inflammatory processes over long periods.",

        "title": "Synthesis, biological evaluation and kinetic studies of glyceride prodrugs of diclofenac.",
        "abstract": "The prodrugs (glyceride derivatives) 3a and 3b of diclofenac were prepared by reacting 1, 2, 3-trihydroxy propane-1,3-dipalmitate/stearate with the acid chloride of diclofenac as potential prodrugs to reduce the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with them. These prodrugs were evaluated for their ulcerogenicity, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. It was found that the prodrugs were significantly less irritating to the gastric mucosa as indicated by severity index of 0.86, 0.78 compared to 1.6 of diclofenac. The prodrugs 3a and 3b showed better anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity than the parent drugs. The hydrolysis of prodrugs 3a and 3b were studied at pH 3, 4, 5 and 7.4. The HPLC analysis showed that the prodrugs were resistant to hydrolysis at pH 3, 4 and 5 indicating that they did not hydrolyze in acidic environment, whereas at pH 7.4 the prodrugs readily released the parent drug in significant quantities. The plasma levels of diclofenac were also analyzed by HPLC in rats after single oral dose of the prodrugs. The results indicated that the parent drugs were readily released. The concentration of diclofenac during the study was found higher in animals treated with prodrugs 3a and 3b compared with animals treated with diclofenac. The concentration of diclofenac was found to be 38.59, 33.6 and 30.36 microg/ml in animals treated with prodrugs 3a, 3b and diclofenac respectively. In conclusion, all these studies indicated that the glyceride prodrugs of diclofenac might be considered as potential biolabile prodrugs of diclofenac.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Three concentrations (mg ml\u22121) of extracts of the medicinal plants Xysmalobium undulatum (XU) roots (0.125, 0.25, 0.50), leaves of Helichrysum caespititum (HC) (0.00625, 0.0125, 0.025) and ascorbic acid (AA) (0.125, 0.25, 0.50) were assessed for cytotoxicity (CT), genotoxicity (GT) and modulation of cyclophosphamide- and EMS-induced GT using the Allium cepa assay following 24 h treatment. CP (1.00 mg ml\u22121) and EMS (0.0375 mg ml\u22121) were not cytotoxic but genotoxic. CT was measured by the mitotic index (MI). GT was the number of aberrant cells per 100 mitotic cells. The MI and GT of test groups were compared with the negative control group using t-test. The modulatory effect (ME), calculated as (B \u2013 C) \u2013 (A \u2013 C)/(A \u2013 C) gave the number of times of the mutagen-induced GT by which the GT of the mutagen was reduced (anti-GT) or increased (synergism). One or more concentrations of AA, XU and HC and their mixtures with CP or EMS were cytotoxic and genotoxic. Mixtures of AA, XU and HC with CP were significantly more genotoxic than CP alone which indicated a synergistic interaction. Mixtures of AA with EMS were significantly more genotoxic than EMS alone. Mixtures of XU with EMS were less genotoxic than EMS, but not significantly, which made XU mildly anti-genotoxic to EMS GT. Mixtures of lower concentrations of HC with EMS were more genotoxic than EMS alone but not significantly. The most common aberrations among dividing cells were sticky chromosomes, c-metaphase, anaphase and telophase bridges, chromosome fragment and multipolar anaphase and telophase.",

        "title": "An evaluation for the standardization of the Allium cepa test as cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assay",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT A general report on the use of the Allium test as cytotoxicological and genotoxicological assay is proposed, with particular emphasis about the standardization of the test in several common applications. The intraspecific variation in Allium cepa has been overlooked, as in most investigations no mention is made about origin and denomination of the onion cultivar used. A standardization of the used material would allow a better generalization of the results, since we cannot be sure that all cultivars would give the same response. A more frequent use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation is proposed. Even if relatively time consuming and not available in all laboratories, it may help to better understand the mechanism of cytotoxicity, since many morphological characters may appear similar but be arisen from different processes observable only with TEM. About statistical testing, tests other than chi-squared may be used in case of a lower amount of data. The most commonly used statistical tests are the parametric tests ANOVA and Student\u2019s t, and the non-parametric tests Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Mann\u2013Whitney U, for analysis of variance. Tests should be used also to assess the minimal sample dimension for obtaining significance, since data collection (microscope observation) appears to be one of the main bottle necks of the test. Also the use of the Allium test for testing liposomes and other nanovectors for drug delivery is proposed, in order to assess the cytotoxicity of these types of medium and the possible increase in cytotoxicity of the associated drug.",

        "abstract": "Introduction To explore the ethnobiological wisdom of the tribals of three western districts of West Bengal, India against poisonous and non-poisonous bites and stings, a quantitative approach was adopted. These age-old yet unexplored knowledge can be utilized in finding lead-molecules against poisonous and non-poisonous animal-bites. Further, an evidence-based approach is needed to assess the venom-neutralization ability of plants by experimental studies. Materials and methods During 2008\u20132009 and 2012\u20132017, 11 ethnomedicinal surveys were carried out to explore the use of medicinal flora and fauna via conducting open semi-structured interviews with 47 traditional healers (THs) or informants. The retrieved dataset was statistically evaluated using seven quantitative-indexes: use-value (UV), informants'-consensus-factor (ICF), fidelity-level (FL), relative-importance (RI), cultural importance-index (CI), index of agreement on remedies (IAR) and cultural agreement-index (CAI). Anti-phospholipaseA2 (PLA2) properties of selected plant extracts were also examined. In addition, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the water extract of the plants showing high FL as well as significant PLA2 inhibitory potential were investigated using Allium cepa root tip assay. Results A total of 41 traditional-formulations (TFs) containing 40 plant species (of 39 genera from 28 families) and 3 animal species were prescribed by the THs. Fabaceae exhibited most number of medicinal plants. Piper nigrum (1.78) and Apis cerana indica and Crossopriza lyoni (both 0.21) exhibited the highest UV among the plants and the animals respectively. Stinging of centipede and dog/cat/hyena bite displayed highest ICF (1.00 each). Among the plants, the maximum RI (0.91) and CI (4.98) values were observed for Aristolochia indica. IAR (1.00) was recorded maximum for Achyranthes aspera, Gloriosa superba, Lycopodium cernuum, Smilax zeylanica and Streblus asper. Maximum CAI value was noted for Piper nigrum (5.5096). Among the animals, Apis cerana indica (0.31) and Crossopriza lyoni (1.52) displayed the highest RI and CI values respectively. Crossopriza lyoni (0.99) and Apis cerana indica (1.3871) exhibited maximum IAR and CAI values respectively. Plants showing higher FL exhibited higher anti-PLA2 activity via selective inhibition of human-group PLA2. In addition, Allium cepa root tip assay has indicated the safety and/or toxicity of the plant parts prescribed by the THs. Root water extracts of Aristolochia indica and Gloriosa superba exhibited significant genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Conclusions Three western districts of West Bengal is the natural abode for many tribal and non-tribal communities. A noteworthy correlation was established between the plants used against poisonous-bites and their anti-PLA2 activity. A few plant parts used by the THs also exhibited high toxicity. Such alternative medical practices serve as the only option in these underprivileged and backward areas during medical-exigencies.",

Snake venom antiserum is the only approved and effective treatment available, but for selected snake species only. The requirement of trained staff for administration and serum reactions make the therapy complicated. In tropical countries where snakebite incidence is high and healthcare facilities are limited, mortality and morbidities associated with snake envenomation are proportionately high. Traditional compilations of medical practitioners\u2019 personal journals have wealth of plant-based snake venom antidotes. Relatively, very few plants or their extractives have been scientifically investigated for neutralization of snake venom or its components. None of these investigations presents enough evidence to initiate clinical testing of the agents. This review focuses on curating Indian traditional snake envenomation therapies, identifying plants involved and finding relevant evidence across modern literature to neutralize snake venom components. Traditional formulations, their method of preparation and dosing have been discussed along with the investigational approach in modern research and their possible outcomes.
