        "abstract": "Context\nPioglitazone reduces cardiovascular risk in nondiabetic patients after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) but is associated with increased risk for bone fracture.\n\n\nObjective\nTo characterize fractures associated with pioglitazone by location, mechanism, severity, timing, and sex.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Patients\nPatients were 3876 nondiabetic participants in the Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke trial randomized to pioglitazone or placebo and followed for a median of 4.8 years. Fractures were identified through quarterly interviews.\n\n\nResults\nAt 5 years, the increment in fracture risk between pioglitazone and placebo groups was 4.9% [13.6% vs 8.8%; hazard ratio (HR), 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 1.89). In each group, \u223c80% of fractures were low energy (i.e., resulted from fall) and 45% were serious (i.e., required surgery or hospitalization). For serious fractures most likely to be related to pioglitazone (low energy, nonpathological), the risk increment was 1.6% (4.7% vs 3.1%; HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.09). Increased risk for any fracture was observed in men (9.4% vs 5.2%; HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.48) and women (14.9% vs 11.6%; HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.78; interaction P = 0.13).\n\n\nConclusions\nFractures affected 8.8% of placebo-treated patients within 5 years after an ischemic stroke or TIA. Pioglitazone increased the absolute fracture risk by 1.6% to 4.9% and the relative risk by 47% to 60%, depending on fracture classification. Our analysis suggests that treatments to improve bone health and prevent falls may help optimize the risk/benefit ratio for pioglitazone.",

        "abstract": "Importance There is growing recognition that patients may respond differently to therapy and that the average treatment effect from a clinical trial may not apply equally to all candidates for a therapy. Objective To determine whether, among patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and insulin resistance, those at higher risk for future stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) derive more benefit from the insulin-sensitizing drug pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with patients at lower risk. Design, Setting, and Participants A secondary analysis was conducted of the Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone for secondary prevention. Patients were enrolled from 179 research sites in 7 countries from February 7, 2005, to January 15, 2013, and were followed up for a mean of 4.1 years through the study\u2019s end on July 28, 2015. Eligible participants had a qualifying ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 180 days of entry and insulin resistance without type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Interventions Pioglitazone or matching placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures A Cox proportional hazards regression model was created using baseline features to stratify patients above or below the median risk for stroke or MI within 5 years. Within each stratum, the efficacy of pioglitazone for preventing stroke or MI was calculated. Safety outcomes were death, heart failure, weight gain, and bone fracture. Results Among 3876 participants (1338 women and 2538 men; mean [SD] age, 63 [11] years), the 5-year risk for stroke or MI was 6.0% in the pioglitazone group among patients at lower baseline risk compared with 7.9% in the placebo group (absolute risk difference, \u20131.9% [95% CI, \u20134.4% to 0.6%]). Among patients at higher risk, the risk was 14.7% in the pioglitazone group vs 19.6% for placebo (absolute risk difference, \u20134.9% [95% CI, \u20138.6% to 1.2%]). Hazard ratios were similar for patients below or above the median risk (0.77 vs 0.75; P\u2009=\u2009.92). Pioglitazone increased weight less among patients at higher risk but increased the risk for fracture more. Conclusions and Relevance After an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients at higher risk for stroke or MI derive a greater absolute benefit from pioglitazone compared with patients at lower risk. However, the risk for fracture is also higher. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00091949",

        "title": "Personalized evidence based medicine: predictive approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects",
        "abstract": "Abstract The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of \u201creference class forecasting\u201d: implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of \u201csimilar\u201d patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to \u201cpredictive\u201d heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on \u201crisk modeling\u201d (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on \u201ceffect modeling\u201d (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "The Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity (PATH) Statement",
        "abstract": "Heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) refers to the nonrandom variation in the magnitude or direction of a treatment effect across levels of a covariate, as measured on a selected scale, against a clinical outcome. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), HTE is typically examined through a subgroup analysis that contrasts effects in groups of patients defined \"1 variable at a time\" (for example, male vs. female or old vs. young). The authors of this statement present guidance on an alternative approach to HTE analysis, \"predictive HTE analysis.\" The goal of predictive HTE analysis is to provide patient-centered estimates of outcome risks with versus without the intervention, taking into account all relevant patient attributes simultaneously. The PATH (Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity) Statement was developed using a multidisciplinary technical expert panel, targeted literature reviews, simulations to characterize potential problems with predictive approaches, and a deliberative process engaging the expert panel. The authors distinguish 2 categories of predictive HTE approaches: a \"risk-modeling\" approach, wherein a multivariable model predicts the risk for an outcome and is applied to disaggregate patients within RCTs to define risk-based variation in benefit, and an \"effect-modeling\" approach, wherein a model is developed on RCT data by incorporating a term for treatment assignment and interactions between treatment and baseline covariates. Both approaches can be used to predict differential absolute treatment effects, the most relevant scale for clinical decision making. The authors developed 4 sets of guidance: criteria to determine when risk-modeling approaches are likely to identify clinically important HTE, methodological aspects of risk-modeling methods, considerations for translation to clinical practice, and considerations and caveats in the use of effect-modeling approaches. The PATH Statement, together with its explanation and elaboration document, may guide future analyses and reporting of RCTs.",

        "abstract": "Importance\nPatent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated strokes comprise approximately 10% of ischemic strokes in adults aged 18 to 60 years. While device closure decreases stroke recurrence risk overall, the best treatment for any individual is often unclear.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect of PFO closure on stroke recurrence based on previously developed scoring systems.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nInvestigators for the Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation (SCOPE) Consortium pooled individual patient data from all 6 randomized clinical trials that compared PFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone in patients with PFO-associated stroke, and included a total of 3740 participants. The trials were conducted worldwide from 2000 to 2017.\n\n\nExposures\nPFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone. Subgroup analyses used the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Score (a 10-point scoring system in which higher scores reflect younger age and the absence of vascular risk factors) and the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) Classification System, which combines the RoPE Score with high-risk PFO features (either an atrial septal aneurysm or a large-sized shunt) to classify patients into 3 categories of causal relatedness: unlikely, possible, and probable.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nIschemic stroke.\n\n\nResults\nOver a median follow-up of 57 months (IQR, 24-64), 121 outcomes occurred in 3740 patients. The annualized incidence of stroke with medical therapy was 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) and with device closure was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]). The subgroup analyses showed statistically significant interaction effects. Patients with low vs high RoPE Score had HRs of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.00) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.11-0.42), respectively (P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02).

The 2-year absolute risk reduction was -0.7% (95% CI, -4.0% to 2.6%), 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.6%), and 2.1% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively. Device-associated adverse events were generally higher among patients classified as unlikely; the absolute risk increases in atrial fibrillation beyond day 45 after randomization with a device were 4.41% (95% CI, 1.02% to 7.80%), 1.53% (95% CI, 0.33% to 2.72%), and 0.65% (95% CI, -0.41% to 1.71%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nAmong patients aged 18 to 60 years with PFO-associated stroke, risk reduction for recurrent stroke with device closure varied across groups classified by their probabilities that the stroke was causally related to the PFO.

        "abstract": "Background: The main randomized trials evaluating patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure after a presumed PFO-associated stroke excluded patients older than 60 years. We aimed to evaluate the early- and long-term clinical outcomes of transcatheter PFO closure in older (>60 years) patients with a cryptogenic ischemic event. Methods: This is a multicenter study including consecutive patients older than 60 years (mean age, 67\u00b15 years) who had a PFO closure following a presumed PFO-related ischemic event. Patients \u226460 years old (mean age, 44\u00b110 years) served as the control group. The primary end point was the occurrence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral embolism over the follow-up period. New-onset atrial fibrillation was a secondary end point. Results: A total of 388 and 883 patients >60 and \u226460 years old were included, respectively. Procedural success rate was high (99.9%), and procedural-related complications low (<2%) in both groups. After a median follow-up of 3 (1\u20138) years, older patients exhibited an incidence of stroke/transient ischemic attack/peripheral embolism of 1.6 events per 100 patient-years (stroke: 0.6 events per 100 patient-years), lower than that expected according to the risk of paradoxical embolism score (observed-to-expected ratio, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.11\u20130.91]). However, the event rate in older patients was higher than that observed in their younger counterparts (incidence rate ratio, 4.7 [95% CI, 2.36\u20139.8]). De novo atrial fibrillation after the procedure was more frequent in older patients (2.66 per 100 patient-years versus 0.49 per 100 patient-years, P<0.001). Conclusions: In patients older than 60 years with a presumed PFO-related ischemic event, PFO closure was safe and associated with a relatively low incidence of recurrent ischemic events after a median follow-up of 3 years compared with historical cohorts of patients who did not undergo PFO closure. However, a higher risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events was observed in older patients compared to their younger counterparts. Randomized trials are warranted in this population.",

        "title": "Cerebrovascular Events in Older Patients With Patent Foramen Ovale: Current Status and Future Perspectives",
        "abstract": "Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure, along with medical therapy, has emerged as the therapeutic gold standard in younger (<60-year-old) patients with a PFO-related stroke for preventing recurrent events. However, PFO management guidelines lack definite recommendations for older (>60 years) patients with a PFO-related cerebrovascular event, a complex group of patients who were mostly excluded from PFO closure clinical trials. Nevertheless, several studies have shown a higher prevalence of PFO among older patients with cryptogenic stroke, and its presence has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent events. Furthermore, older patients exhibit a higher prevalence of high-risk PFO anatomical features, present inherent age-related risk factors that might increase the risk of paradoxical embolism through a PFO, and have a higher incidence of ischemic events after a PFO-related event. Additionally, observational studies have shown the safety and preliminary efficacy of PFO closure in older PFO-related stroke patients. Yet, higher rates of recurrent cerebrovascular events and new-onset atrial fibrillation were observed in some studies among older patients compared to their younger counterparts. After careful case-by-case evaluation, including the assessment of hidden potential cardioembolic sources of a cryptogenic stroke other than PFO, transcatheter PFO closure might be a safe and effective therapeutic option for preventing recurrent thromboembolic events in patients >60 years with a high-risk PFO-associated stroke. Ongoing trials will provide important insights into the role of PFO closure in the elderly population.",

A dedicated database compiled baseline, procedural, and follow-up data. Competing risk and adjusted outcome predictor analyses were conducted.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 689 patients were included (median age 65 years, 41.2% female, mean Risk of Paradoxical Embolism [RoPE] score 4.5). The procedural success rate was 99.4%. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range 1-5) years, 66 patients (9.6%) had died.
