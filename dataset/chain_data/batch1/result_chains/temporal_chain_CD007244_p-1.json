        "title": "Randomized trial of black cohosh for the treatment of hot flashes among women with a history of breast cancer.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nMost breast cancer survivors experience hot flashes; many use complementary or alternative remedies for these symptoms. We undertook a randomized clinical trial of black cohosh, a widely used herbal remedy for menopausal symptoms, among breast cancer patients.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients diagnosed with breast cancer who had completed their primary treatment were randomly assigned to black cohosh or placebo, stratified on tamoxifen use. At enrollment, patients completed a questionnaire about demographic factors and menopausal symptoms. Before starting to take the pills and at 30 and 60 days, they completed a 4-day hot flash diary. At the final visit, they completed another menopausal symptom questionnaire. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were measured in a subset of patients at the first and final visits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 85 patients (59 on tamoxifen, 26 not on tamoxifen) enrolled in the study, 42 were assigned to treatment and 43 were assigned to placebo; 69 completed all three hot flash diaries. Both treatment and placebo groups reported declines in number and intensity of hot flashes; the differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Both groups also reported improvements in menopausal symptoms that were, for the most part, not significantly different. Changes in blood levels of FSH and LH also did not differ in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBlack cohosh was not significantly more efficacious than placebo against most menopausal symptoms, including number and intensity of hot flashes. Our study illustrates the feasibility and value of standard clinical trial methodology in assessing the efficacy and safety of herbal agents.",

        "title": "Effect of soy phytoestrogens on hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nVasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, in breast cancer survivors are often worsened by chemotherapy and tamoxifen, and/or the discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at diagnosis. This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a soy beverage containing phytoestrogens as a treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in postmenopausal women with moderate hot flashes who were previously treated for early-stage breast cancer. Women were stratified for tamoxifen use and randomized to a soy beverage (n = 59) containing 90 mg of isoflavones or to a placebo rice beverage (n = 64). Women recorded the number and severity of hot flashes daily with a daily menopause diary for 4 weeks at baseline and for 12 weeks while consuming 500 mL of a soy or placebo beverage.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hot flashes or hot flash scores. However, presumably because of a strong placebo effect, both groups had significant reductions in hot flashes. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by both groups but occurred with greater frequency and severity with soy. The mean serum genistein concentration at 6 weeks was significantly higher in women who consumed soy (0.61 +/- 0.43 micromol/L) compared with placebo (0.43 +/- 0.37 micromol/L) (P =.02). Overall acceptability and compliance were high and similar in both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe soy beverage did not alleviate hot flashes in women with breast cancer any more than did a placebo. Future research into other compounds is recommended to identify safe and effective therapies for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES\nTo present state-of-the-art information about the risks and benefits of soy isoflavones for breast cancer survivors.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nPublished research articles, pertinent articles and books, and computerized databases.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nSome epidemiologic data suggest that soy isoflavones play an important role in preventing breast cancer in Asian women and promoting women's health in a variety of ways. However, the use of soy isoflavones in women with breast cancer is controversial. Risks and benefits exist regarding the use of soy isoflavones by breast cancer survivors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of soy isoflavones to promote health in breast cancer survivors remains controversial because of scant scientific data.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nNurses should not only provide updated information to the public but also interpret research results carefully. More clinical trials need to be conducted on a longitudinal basis with the enrollment of breast cancer survivors.",

        "title": "Content composition and antioxidant activity of isoflavones in commercial and homemade soymilk and tofu",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isoflavones, found in soymilk and tofu, are one of the phytochemicals in soy-based products that may promote good health. Homemade tofu and various homemade soymilk samples were made using different soaking, grinding, and cooking methods. The homemade samples were compared to commercial tofu and soymilk for total isoflavone content and composition as well as their antioxidant capacity. All samples were freeze-dried and extracted with a 58% acetonitrile solution which was subsequently used to determine the isoflavone content by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The antioxidant activity of extracts was determined using a modified 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) method and total antioxidant capacity was reported as ascorbic acid equivalents. \n \n \n \nRESULTS: The total isoflavone, aglycone, and antioxidant levels were significantly higher in homemade soymilk and tofu (1571 \u00b5g) than in commercial samples. Homemade soymilk made by the extended boiling method yielded the highest total isoflavone (2567 \u00b5g) and glucoside (1525 \u00b5g) content. A strong positive correlation was observed between the total isoflavone, aglycone conjugates, and genistein series concentration and antioxidant capacity of soymilk. \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION: Increased moist heating time yielded the highest concentration of total isoflavones as well as aglycone conjugates and the genistein series. Increasing the duration of boiling can increase the isoflavone content of both homemade and commercial soymilk and tofu. Copyright \u00a9 2007 Society of Chemical Industry",

        "title": "Effects of the beta-glycosidase reaction on bio-conversion of isoflavones and quality during tofu processing.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIsoflavones are the most common group of phytoestrogens which are present in significantly large amounts in soybean and soy products such as tofu. Isoflavones occur naturally in glycoside forms having lower bioavailability than their aglycone forms. beta-Glycosidase acts as a bio-catalyst for the conversion of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones, raising the bioavailability of isoflavones; therefore, it can be used to improve the quality of tofu. We need to establish process conditions for the optimal outcome of the enzyme reaction in tofu.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBy using the beta-glycosidase (0.02% w/v) reaction at 55 degrees C for 30 min, a maximum 84.5% conversion of isoflavone glycoside to isoflavone aglycone was obtained. The enzyme reaction caused no significant effects on the sensory acceptability of soft tofu. The hardness of enzyme-treated hard tofu increased with the coagulant amount whereas prolonged heating resulted in decrease of hardness. Incorporation of enzyme reaction before the coagulation process during soft tofu processing provided a sufficient bio-conversion of isoflavones at optimal conditions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nbeta-Glycosidase can be effectively used for the bioconversion of isoflavones in soft tofu manufacturing process at optimal reaction conditions before the onset of coagulation process.",

        "title": "Enhanced Estrogenic Activity of Soybean Isoflavones by Coadministration of Liuwei Dihuang Pills in Ovariectomized Rats",
        "abstract": "Soybean isoflavones are beneficial for treating hormone\u2010related diseases. Simultaneous consumption of soybean isoflavones and Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) is effective for treating perimenopausal period syndrome. However, why the combination of isoflavones and LWPs is more effective than ingestion of each component alone remains unknown. Here, we show that enhanced estrogenic activities would appear when the ovariectomized rats were fed with a soybean diet in combination of LWPs treatment. Our further studies explored enhancements of Lactobacillus (19\u2010fold) and Bifidobacterium (12\u2010fold) contents in the intestine of rat and 1.84\u2010fold higher intestinal \u03b2\u2010glucosidase activity in LWPs treatment group compared with the control group. As a result, steady\u2010state concentrations of genistein (1.20\u2010fold), daidzein (1.36\u2010fold), and equol (1.43\u2010fold) in serum were significantly elevated in the combination group compared with the soybean alone group. The results present the first evidence of the mechanism of enhanced estrogenic activity of dietary soybean isoflavones in combination with LWPs. Our study indicates that alterations of gut bacteria after LWPs treatment play a key role in the enhanced estrogenic effect of dietary soybean, suggesting a direct relationship between dietary soybean, LWPs, and gut flora.

        "title": "Research on the Mechanism of Liuwei Dihuang Decoction for Osteoporosis Based on Systematic Biological Strategies",
        "abstract": "Background Osteoporosis is an important health problem worldwide. Liuwei Dihuang Decoction (LDD) and its main ingredients may have a good clinical effect on osteoporosis. Meanwhile, its mechanism for treating osteoporosis needs to be further revealed in order to provide a basis for future drug development. Methods A systematic biological methodology was utilized to construct and analyze the LDD-osteoporosis network. After that, the human transcription data of LDD intervention in patients with osteoporosis and protein arrays data of LDD intervention in osteoporosis rats were collected. The human transcription data analysis, protein arrays data analysis, and molecular docking were performed to validate the findings of the prediction network (LDD-osteoporosis PPI network). Finally, animal experiments were conducted to verify the prediction results of systematic pharmacology. Results (1) LDD-osteoporosis PPI network shows the potential compounds, potential targets (such as ALB, IGF1, SRC, and ESR1), clusters, biological processes (such as positive regulation of calmodulin 1-monooxygenase activity, estrogen metabolism, and endothelial cell proliferation), and signaling and Reactome pathways (such as JAK-STAT signaling pathway, osteoclast differentiation, and degradation of the extracellular matrix) of LDD intervention in osteoporosis. (2) Human transcriptomics data and protein arrays data validated the findings of the LDD-osteoporosis PPI network. (3) The animal experiments showed that LDD can improve bone mineral density (BMD), increase serum estradiol (E2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and upregulate Wnt3a and \u03b2-catenin mRNA expression (P < 0.05). (4) Molecular docking results showed that alisol A, dioscin, loganin, oleanolic acid, pachymic acid, and ursolic acid may stably bind to JAK2, ESR1, and CTNNB1. Conclusion LDD may have a therapeutic effect on osteoporosis through regulating the targets (such as ALB, IGF1, SRC, and ESR1), biological processes (such as positive regulation of calmodulin 1-monooxygenase activity, estrogen metabolism, and endothelial cell proliferation), and pathways (such as JAK-STAT signaling pathway, osteoclast differentiation, and degradation of the extracellular matrix) found in this research.",
