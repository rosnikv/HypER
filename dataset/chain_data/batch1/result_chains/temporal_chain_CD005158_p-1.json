        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite current treatments, patients who have acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation have high rates of major vascular events. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel when given with aspirin in such patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 12,562 patients who had presented within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms to receive clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, followed by 75 mg once daily) (6259 patients) or placebo (6303 patients) in addition to aspirin for 3 to 12 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe first primary outcome--a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--occurred in 9.3 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 11.4 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk with clopidogrel as compared with placebo, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). The second primary outcome--the first primary outcome or refractory ischemia--occurred in 16.5 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 18.8 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94; P<0.001). The percentages of patients with in-hospital refractory or severe ischemia, heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also significantly lower with clopidogrel. There were significantly more patients with major bleeding in the clopidogrel group than in the placebo group (3.7 percent vs. 2.7 percent; relative risk, 1.38; P=0.001), but there were not significantly more patients with episodes of life-threatening bleeding (2.2 percent [corrected] vs. 1.8 percent; P=0.13) or hemorrhagic strokes (0.1 percent vs. 0.1 percent).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has beneficial effects in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. However, the risk of major bleeding is increased among patients treated with clopidogrel.",

        "title": "Duration of dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "AIMS\nDual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) is a cornerstone in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but the optimal treatment duration is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of DAPT duration with clopidogrel and aspirin on the recurrence of ischaemic events and bleeding in a large, unselected ACS population.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe performed a prospective, observational cohort study of patients in Sweden (n = 56 440) admitted for ACS, with prescribed DAPT and hospitalized between January 2006 and July 2010. Patients were obtained from the SWEDEHEART register and data were merged with registers from the National Board of Health and Welfare. Depending on dispensed clopidogrel tablets, patients were divided into groups based on DAPT duration with clopidogrel and aspirin (3 months: 84-100 clopidogrel tablets (t); >3 months: >100 t; 6 months: 168-200 t; >6 months: >200 t). For the combined primary endpoint, defined as all-cause death, stroke, or re-infarction, only patients with an uneventful first 3-month period (no death, stroke, re-infarction, bleeding, stent thrombosis, or revascularization) were included. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 45 events per 1000 person-years in the >3 months DAPT group compared with 65 events per 1000 person-years in the 3 months DAPT group [adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI (0.75; 0.95)]. Bleeding was more common in the >3 months treatment group (adjusted HR 1.56, 95% CI (1.18; 2.07), but the number of events was small. For >6 vs. 6 months DAPT, the adjusted HR for the combined endpoint was 0.75 with 95% CI (0.59; 0.95).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this contemporary, large real-life ACS population, DAPT for more than 3 months compared with a shorter duration was associated with a lower risk of death, stroke, or re-infarction.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov (NCT01623700).",

        "title": "Are at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy needed for all patients with drug-eluting stents? Not all patients with drug-eluting stents need at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy.",
        "abstract": "Drs Becker and Helmy eloquently discuss the putative mechanisms of benefit of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stents and conclude that not all patients are candidates for such an intervention. While I agree with many of their arguments, I believe that 2 counterpoints need to be highlighted. First, both the DAPT study (HR=0.59; CI, 0.45\u20130.78; P <0.001), as well as the PEGASUS- TIMI-54 study (HR=0.83; CI, 0.72\u20130.95; P =0.005) report a significant reduction in non-stent thrombosis-related myocardial infarction. This is true secondary prevention. Second, while 2 trends may coexist in the same cohort, there is no clear evidence that they are related. Are the patients with severe bleeding the ones dying? The incidence of fatal bleeding was similar, and extremely low, in the short versus long DAPT groups in the DAPT study. Even accounting for bleeding-related deaths in DAPT explains only half of the non-cardiovascular deaths observed in the study. Moreover, studies randomizing patients immediately after PCI are very different from those enrolling patients free of events at 6\u201312 months. Finally, the impetus to treat for longer duration patients stented after an acute coronary syndrome may be greater than for those undergoing elective revascularization. While there is no doubt that dogmatic statements such as \u201call patients after [drug-eluting stents]\u2026\u201d are difficult to defend beyond their utility as a point for debate, we need to better understand the risks and benefits of prolonged DAPT and their effect in specific subgroups before potentially writing off a beneficial paradigm.",

        "title": "Organ transplantation and drug eluting stents: Perioperative challenges",
        "abstract": "Patients listed for organ transplant frequently have severe coronary artery disease (CAD), which may be treated with drug eluting stents (DES). Everolimus and zotarolimus eluting stents are commonly used. Newer generation biolimus and novolimus eluting biodegradable stents are becoming increasingly popular. Patients undergoing transplant surgery soon after the placement of DES are at increased risk of stent thrombosis (ST) in the perioperative period. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor is instated post stenting to decrease the incident of ST. Cangrelor has recently been approved by Food and Drug Administration and can be used as a bridging antiplatelet drug. The risk of ischemia vs bleeding must be considered when discontinuing or continuing DAPT for surgery. Though living donor transplant surgery is an elective procedure and can be optimally timed, cadaveric organ availability is unpredictable, therefore, discontinuation of antiplatelet medication cannot be optimally timed. The type of stent and timing of transplant surgery can be of utmost importance. Many platelet function point of care tests such as Light Transmittance Aggregrometry, Thromboelastography Platelet Mapping, VerifyNow, Multiple Electrode Aggregrometry are used to assess bleeding risk and guide perioperative platelet transfusion. Response to allogenic platelet transfusion to control severe intraoperative bleeding may differ with the antiplatelet drug. In stent thrombosis is an emergency where management with either a drug eluting balloon or a DES has shown superior outcomes. Post-transplant complications often involved stenosis of an important vessel that may need revascularization. DES are now used for endovascular interventions for transplant orthotropic heart CAD, hepatic artery stenosis post liver transplantation, transplant renal artery stenosis following kidney transplantation, etc. Several antiproliferative drugs used in the DES are inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin. Thus they are used for post-transplant immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection in recipients with heart, liver, lung and kidney transplantation. This article describes in detail the various perioperative challenges encountered in organ transplantation surgery and patients with drug eluting stents.",

        "abstract": "Current guidelines emphasize the need for at least 6\u201312 months of oral dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor following drug\u2010eluting coronary artery stent implantation. In patients with recently implanted coronary artery stents who require urgent cardiac or noncardiac surgery, the benefits of maintaining oral dual antiplatelet therapy must be carefully weighed against the risks of excessive bleeding, and current practice is largely guided by individual surgeon preferences. When the effects of a second oral antiplatelet agent are undesirable during the perioperative period, the use of a short\u2010acting intravenous antiplatelet agent as \u201cbridge\u201d therapy that can be discontinued shortly before surgery is associated with a reduced occurrence of adverse clinical events in patients with recently implanted coronary stents requiring urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Cangrelor is an intravenous adenosine triphosphate analog P2Y12 receptor antagonist with a short plasma half\u2010life that has been used off label in patients with recent coronary stents as a bridge to invasive procedures with excessive bleeding risk. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to demonstrate the safe and effective use of cangrelor as a bridge to left ventricular assist device implantation in a patient with a recently implanted drug\u2010eluting coronary artery stent who developed acute thrombocytopenia following reexposure to tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.",

        "title": "Perioperative Antiplatelet Bridging With Cangrelor: A Cohort Study and Narrative Review",
        "abstract": "Background: In patients who received a cardiac stent, practice guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). However, an urgent procedure may be required necessitating interruption of DAPT. Intravenous cangrelor was previously shown to be an alternative due its short-half life and quick onset/offset. Objective: To determine the safety and effectiveness of cangrelor bridging for patients undergoing invasive procedures in a veteran population. Methods: Retrospective cohort of patients from Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center and the VA North Texas Health Care Systems who underwent perioperative cangrelor bridging. The primary outcome was the incidence of bleeding using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria. The secondary outcome was a composite of nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), mortality, and unplanned revascularization within 30 days. A narrative review was also performed to summarize cangrelor bridging for noncardiac invasive procedure. Results: There were 41 patients that met the eligibility criteria. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (57.5%) men with a median age of 70 years. The median duration on cangrelor bridging was 2.6 days with 11 and 30 patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac invasive procedures, respectively. Nine patients (22%) had a bleeding event of which 8 were minor. One was severe due to significant iliopsoas hematoma following drain placement. All bleeding events occurred postoperatively except for 2 perioperative events that occurred during orthopedic procedures. Ischemic events up to 30 days occurred in 3 patients (7.3%) which consisted of 1 (2.4%) nonfatal MI requiring revascularization and 2 (4.9%) deaths, 1 of which was sudden cardiac. Conclusion and Relevance: This study suggests that cangrelor bridging may be a reasonable alternative to holding oral P2Y12 inhibitors in patients requiring interruption of antiplatelet therapy for an urgent surgery/invasive procedure.",

        "abstract": "Cangrelor is a rapid-acting, intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor that can be used in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention who require mechanical circulatory support or as a bridge to procedure. We retrospectively reviewed adult patients who received platelet function testing (PFT) with the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay while on cangrelor from March 2021 through November 2022. All patients were initiated on 0.75 mcg/kg/min of cangrelor with P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values collected 12\u201324\u2005h after initiation. Cangrelor doses were adjusted per protocol to maintain PRU values of 85\u2013208. A total of 42 patients were included. Thirty-eight patients (90.5%) required temporary mechanical circulatory support while on cangrelor, and 4 patients (9.5%) received cangrelor as a bridge to procedure. The median cangrelor maintenance dose was 0.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.375\u20130.75) mcg/kg/min, and the median time in therapeutic range with a PRU value between 85 and 208 was 66.6% (IQR: 39.6%-100%). No patients experienced stent thrombosis. A composite major adverse cardiovascular event occurred in 4 patients (9.5%), and major bleeding occurred in 16 patients (38.1%). Compared to empiric cangrelor dosing of 0.75 mcg/kg/min, PFT-guided cangrelor dose adjustment was associated with a median drug cost savings of $1605.60 (IQR: $0-4281.56).
