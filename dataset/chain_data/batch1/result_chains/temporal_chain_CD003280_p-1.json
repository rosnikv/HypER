        "abstract": "We describe here the reliability and validity of methods to quantify involuntary muscle torque induced by non-invasive nerve stimulation. A rigid apparatus was used to hold the subject's limb in a predetermined position and confine movement to a specific direction (i.e. ankle dorsiflexion or thumb adduction). An incorporated strain gauge was used to measure isometric torque, and all data were recorded by a data acquisition program. The innervating nerves were stimulated by surface electrodes, using either single stimuli to generate a twitch, or short trains of stimuli to produce tetanic contraction of the individual muscle under study. The average peak tetanic torque generated by the dorsiflexor muscles in healthy control was 20.4 +/- 3.8 Nm and varied by 3.7% with repeated testing. The mean torque generated by the adductor pollicis muscle in controls was 1.5 +/- 0.4 Nm and varied by 4.6% with repeated testing. In patient populations significant changes in activated torque were readily quantified, and the effects of treatment can be easily assessed. Furthermore, several specific parameters of recorded isometric contractions were measured; e.g. time between stimulus and torque onset, peak rate of torque development, time to peak torque, half-relaxation time, and others (none of which are measurable when using voluntary contraction of muscle). Compared to current assessment methods, monitoring muscle torque generated by nerve stimulation improves objectivity, reliability, and quantitative capabilities. The presented method has significant potential both in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders and determining treatment efficacy.",

        "title": "Reproducibility of contractile properties of the human paralysed and non-paralysed quadriceps muscle.",
        "abstract": "This study assessed the reproducibility of electrically evoked, isometric quadriceps contractile properties in eight people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and eight able-bodied (AB) individuals. Over all, the pooled coefficients of variation (CVps) in the SCI group were significantly lower (ranging from 0.03 to 0.15) than in the AB group (ranging from 0.08 to 0.21) (P<0.05). Furthermore, in all subjects, the variability of force production increased as stimulation frequency decreased (P<0.01). In subjects with SCI, variables of contractile speed are clearly less reproducible than tetanic tension or resistance to fatigue. Contractile properties of quadriceps muscles of SCI subjects were significantly different from that of AB subjects. Muscles of people with SCI were less fatigue resistant (P<0.05) and produced force-frequency relationships that were shifted to the left, compared with AB controls (P<.01). In addition, fusion of force responses resulting from 10 Hz stimulation was reduced (P<.05) and speed of contraction (but not relaxation) was increased (P<0.05), indicating an increased contractile speed in paralysed muscles compared with non-paralysed muscles. These results correspond with an expected predominance of fast glycolytic muscle fibres in paralysed muscles. It is concluded that quadriceps dynamometry is a useful technique to study muscle function in non-paralysed as well as in paralysed muscles. Furthermore, these techniques can be reliably used, for example, to assess therapeutic interventions on paralysed muscles provided that expected differences in relative tetanic tension and fatigue resistance are larger than approximately 5% and differences in contractile speed are larger than approximately 15%.",

        "abstract": "The effects of a complete spinal cord transection (ST) on the mechanical properties of the rat soleus were assessed 3 and 6 mo post-ST and compared with age-matched controls. Maximal tetanic force was reduced by approximately 44 and approximately 25% at 3 and 6 mo post-ST, respectively. Similarly, maximum twitch force was reduced by approximately 29% in 3-mo and approximately 17% in 6-mo ST rats. ST resulted in faster twitch properties as evidenced by shorter time to peak tension (approximately 45%) and half-relaxation time (approximately 55%) at both time points. Maximum shortening velocity was significantly increased in ST rats whether measured by extrapolation from the force-velocity curve (approximately twofold at both time points) or by slack-test measurements (over twofold at both time points). A significant reduction in fatigue resistance of the soleus was observed at 3 (approximately 25%) and 6 mo (approximately 45%) post-ST. For the majority of the speed-related properties, no significant differences were detected between 3- and 6-mo ST rats. However, the fatigue resistance of the soleus was significantly lower in 6- vs. 3-mo ST rats. These data suggest that, between 3 and 6 mo post-ST, force-related properties tended to recover, speed-related properties plateaued, and fatigue-related properties continued to decline. Thus some specific functional properties of the rat soleus related to contractile force, speed, and fatigue adapted independently after ST.",

        "abstract": "Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) typically experience body weight loss, motor function deficits, and a general decline of physical fitness. Animal models with these characteristics can serve to study the detailed adaptive changes following SCI. In the present study, we report the use of an adult paraplegic mouse model to study SCI-induced changes. We characterized the early effects of complete thoracic spinal cord transection on (1) whole body weight, (2) forelimb and hindlimb weight and volume, and (3) contractile properties of hindlimb extensor muscle. Drastic changes were found at 7 days post-spinal cord transection. These included a 24% loss in whole body weight accompanied by a large decrease of weight and volume in the forelimbs and the hindlimbs. We also observed in the soleus muscle, a 32% decrease in mass and maximal tetanic tension (Po) as well as a 21% and 48% increase in time-to-peak tension (TPT) and half-relaxation time (1/2 RT) respectively. After 28 days, all of the changes remained, except for 1/2 RT and TPT which nearly returned to control levels. Altogether, the results reveal that large changes in body weight, limb size and musculoskeletal properties occur within only one week after complete spinal cord transection. The use of paraplegic mouse models may provide new therapeutic approaches to restore motor and locomotor functions after SCI.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with the development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limbs and, hence, with rapidly increasing risks of cardiovascular and pulmonary complications soon after trauma. However, specific mechanisms underlying DVT formation following SCI are poorly understood. Here, we studied in mice, employing in vivo confocal microscopy, changes in deep vein size over 4 weeks after spinal cord transection (Tx). Changing levels of biochemical markers that may be associated with DVT formation were also examined. The results showed decreased concentrations of cholesterols, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but not of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and platelets. Concentrations of creatinine, bilirubin, glucose, albumin, total protein and uric acid did not significantly change. In turn, the femoral and saphenous veins underwent a large increase (>1.5-fold) in diameter throughout the entire period studied. Overall, this study reveals that a profound change in deep vein size and, an unsuspected decrease in triglyceride and LDL levels, occur as early as at one week post-Tx in mice. This indicates, given the well-documented risk of DVT formation soon after SCI, that deep vein enlargement, but not lipoprotein level changes, may constitute an early event contributing to venous stasis and thrombi formation in paralyzed individuals.",

        "abstract": "Background Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Data on the risks during rehabilitation are inconsistent, and thromboprophylactic strategies are heterogeneous. We aimed to evaluate the thrombotic risk and bleeding events of SCI patients during rehabilitation. Methods We retrospectively collected hospital record data of 263 consecutive SCI patients admitted at a rehabilitation clinic. 78 patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) at the primary center, without acute trauma or lower extremity paresis, less than one month rehabilitation, or reasons for long-term therapeutic anticoagulation, were excluded. All patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis throughout rehabilitation. Primary endpoint was objectively diagnosed VTE; secondary endpoint was bleeding. Results Of 185 patients, 162 (88%) were men; mean age was 47.8 years. 94 patients were tetraplegic, 91 paraplegic. During a mean (\u00b1SD) time of 5.1\u00b12.1 months, VTE was diagnosed in 8 patients. After excluding five patients with VTE detected within 2 days after admission, the probability of developing VTE after 6 months of rehabilitation was 2% (95% CI 0\u20134.4%). Only high D-Dimer upon admission was associated with risk of VTE (adjusted HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4\u20134.1). Of 24 bleedings, 14 (64%) occurred at the heparin injection site. Two patients had major bleeding and five had clinically relevant non major bleeding. Conclusion SCI patients are at risk of VTE and bleeding during rehabilitation. Strategies need to be developed to identify these patients in order to initiate adequate anticoagulation.

        "abstract": "Objective Current guidelines recommend initiation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis within 72 hours of spinal cord injury (SCI). This study investigated the safety and efficacy of chemoprophylaxis within 24 hours of surgery for SCI. Methods A retrospective review of 97 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for acute traumatic SCI at a single level 1 trauma center from 2013\u20132018 was performed. VTE/postoperative bleeding rates during hospitalization, demographics, medical/surgical complications, drain output, length of stay, and disposition were obtained. Chi\u2013square with odds ratios (ORs), 1-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression were performed to establish significant differences between groups. Results Seventy\u2013nine patients were included, 49 received chemoprophylaxis within 24 hours and 20 within 24\u201372 hours. Cohort characteristics included an average age of 51.8 years, 77.2% male, 62.0% cervical, and 35.4% thoracic SCIs.

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury patients are at high risk of VTE. Early initiation of prophylaxis is associate with lower VTE rates. Delayed initiation of prophylaxis, heparin, and missed doses are associated with increased risk of VTE and represent targets for quality improvement measures. INTRODUCTION Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (VTEppx) is frequently delayed in patients with SCI because of concerns for bleeding risk. Here, we hypothesized that delaying VTEppx until >48 hours would be associated with increased risk of thrombotic events. METHODS This is a secondary analysis of the 2018 to 2020 prospective, observational, cohort Consortium of Leaders in the Study of Traumatic Thromboembolism (CLOTT) study of patients aged 18 to 40 years, at 17 US level 1 trauma centers. Patients admitted for >48 hours with documented SCI were evaluated. Timing of initiation of VTEppx, rates of thrombotic events (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]), and missed VTEppx doses were analyzed. The primary outcome was VTE (DVT + PE). RESULTS There were 343 patients with SCI. The mean \u00b1 SD age was 29.0 \u00b1 6.6 years, 77.3% were male, and 78.7% sustained blunt mechanism. Thrombotic events occurred in 33 patients (9.6%): 30 DVTs (8.7%) and 3 PEs (0.9%). Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis started at \u226424 hours in 21.3% of patients and 49.3% at \u226448 hours. The rate of VTE for patients started on VTEppx \u226448 hours was 7.1% versus 12.1% if started after 48 hours (p = 0.119). After adjusting for differences in risk factors between cohorts, starting \u226448 hours was independently associated with fewer VTEs (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.101\u20130.978; p = 0.044). Unfractionated heparin was associated with a VTE rate of 21.0% versus 7.5% in those receiving enoxaparin as prophylaxis (p = 0.003). Missed doses of VTEppx were common (29.7%) and associated with increased thrombotic events, although this was not significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Rates of thrombotic events in patients with SCI are high. Prompt initiation of VTEppx with enoxaparin and efforts aimed at avoiding missed doses are critical to limit thrombotic events in these high-risk patients.

Among treatment options, including pelvic angioembolization (PA), preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP), and pelvic open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), PPP has been postulated as a VTE risk factor. We aimed to characterize the risk of VTE among pelvic fracture patients receiving PPP, PA or ORIF.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used observational data from a 17-site Consortium of Leaders in the Study of Traumatic Thromboembolism (CLOTT) study group, a US level I trauma center collaborative working to identify factors associated with posttraumatic VTE, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary thrombosis. The CLOTT criteria included age 18 to 40 years with at least one independent VTE risk factor. We compared outcomes of PPP, PA, and pelvic ORIF to reference of no pelvic intervention. Our primary outcome was VTE. A competing risk analysis was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 1,387 pelvic fracture patients, VTE incidence was 5.6%. The ORIF patients were most likely to develop VTE (24.7%), while VTE incidence for PPP was 9.0% and 2.6% for PA. After multivariate, risk-competing analysis, none of the three treatment interventions for pelvic fractures were significantly associated with VTE. Initiation of VTE prophylaxis in the first 24 hours of admission independently halved VTE incidence (hazard ratio, 0.55; confidence interval, 0.33-0.91).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPelvic fracture interventions do not appear to be independent risk factors for VTE in our study.
