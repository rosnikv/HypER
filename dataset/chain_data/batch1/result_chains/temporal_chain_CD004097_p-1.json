        "title": "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Weight Reduction and Exercise for Diabetes Management in Older African-American Subjects",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate a weight loss and exercise program designed to improve diabetes management in older African-Americans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Overweight African-Americans (n = 64) ages 55\u201379 years with NIDDM were randomized to either an intervention (12 weekly group sessions, 1 individual session, and 6 biweekly group sessions) or usual care (1 class and 2 informational mailings). Clinical and behavioral variables were assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS Significant net differences in the intervention versus usual care were observed for weight (\u22122.0 kg, P = 0.006), physical activity, and dietary intake of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and nutrition knowledge at 3 months (all P < 0.05) and for weight at 6 months (\u22122.4 kg; P = 0.006) and mean HbA1c values at 3 and 6 months (respectively, \u22121.6 and \u22122.4%, both P < 0.01). After the adjustment for changes in weight and activity, the intervention participants were \u223c twice as likely to have a one unit decrease in HbA1c value as those in usual care. Blood pressure increase sin usual care participants resulted in net differences (intervention minus control) at 3 and 6 months of \u22123.3 (P = 0.09) and \u22124.0 (P = 0.05) mmHg diastolic, respectively, and \u22128.4 (P = 0.06) and \u22125.9 (P > 0.10) mmHg systolic, respectively. Blood lipid profiles improved more in intervention than usual care participants, but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS The intervention program was effective in improving glycemic and blood pressure control. The decrease in HbA1c values was generally independent of the relatively modest changes in dietary intake, weight, and activity and may reflect indirect program effects on other aspects of self-care.",

        "abstract": "Coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and cognitive disorders become more prevalent as people age. Besides delaying the onset of many of these conditions, regular exercise may improve function and delay disability and morbidity in those who have them. Further, exercise may work synergistically with medication to combat the effects of some chronic diseases. Special adaptations for older patients include lower-intensity exercise (eg, fewer repetitions), low-impact exercise (cycling, exercise while sitting), and modified equipment (smaller weights, special shoes, loose clothing). Unresolved issues include development of optimal strategies for motivating older patients to begin and maintain exercise programs.",

        "abstract": "This article describes the development and implementation of an Interprofessional Falls Prevention Program (IFPP) designed for community\u2010dwelling seniors. The program was a collaborative pilot research study conducted in a retirement home and an outpatient hospital setting. The pilot was successful and was positioned into a permanent falls prevention program. The IFPP aimed at improving physical function and balance and reducing the fear of falling in seniors with a history of falls. The pilot study included an interprofessional falls assessment followed by a 12\u2010week program of once\u2010weekly group education and exercise sessions, 3\u2010 and 6\u2010month follow\u2010up visits, and individual counseling. To measure program effectiveness, the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up and Go Test, the Falls Efficacy Scale, and the Morse Fall Risk Scale were used at baseline, upon program completion, and at 3\u2010 and 6\u2010month follow\u2010up. Process measures were also collected, including patient satisfaction. Persistent improvements were found in participants' balance, strength, functional mobility, and fear of falling. Patient satisfaction with the program was high. Challenges faced in program implementation are also highlighted.",

        "title": "Implementing and Disseminating a Falls Prevention Program in At-Risk Older Adults Living in a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community-Supportive Services Program",
        "abstract": "IntroductionAnnually, nearly 30% of Americans over the age of 65 (one in three) fall and subsequently require medical treatment. In the population over the age of 80, the rate of falling increases to 50% (1). In 2005, of 433.000 older adults admitted to the hospital, about 16.000 died due to falls. Falls have become the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the sixth leading cause of death (2). Furthermore, falls are the most common reason given by family members who seek nursing home placement for older adults, and have significant effects on the quality of life (2, 3).According to 2008 census estimates, the population over the age of 65 accounted for roughly 36 million or 12% of the population (4). The population over the age of 65 years, in the United States, is expected to be 71 million in the year 2030, accounting for approximately 20% of the US population (5). Hence, the number of elderly individuals requiring services to meet their changing needs will increase dramatically. Frail older adults often do not qualify for government subsidized long term care but cannot afford private pay assisted living. In addition, a 2008 American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) survey indicates that 89 % of older Americans want to remain at home and in their community for as long as possible (6). Many, however, have not planned for management in their homes as their health deteriorates. Over the past two decades a new model of care has emerged that has the potential to revolutionize services for older adults living in the community. This new paradigm recognizes the considerable strengths of the older adult, as well as their inevitably changing needs. It also recognizes older adult's overwhelming preference to remain in the home and in the neighborhoods they have lived in for years and it acknowledges the importance of community for successful aging. This new model is Supportive Service Programs (SSPs) based in Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORC). A NORC-SSP is a partnership that unites housing entities, health and social service providers, government and philanthropic organizations to locate a range of coordinated health care, social services and group activities, on site, that promote independence and healthy aging. One of the primary features of a NORC-SSP is the multidisciplinary approach to providing care, wherein nursing and social work staff provide the resident with a reliable source of information, referral, and chronic care management. Given the infrastructure of the NORC-SSP, as well as the trusting relationship that develops between the NORC resident and the nursing and social work staff, the United Hospital Fund (UHF), in collaboration with the New York Community Trust (NYCT), established the Deepdale CARES (Community Action Reach out to Elder Service) NORC Health Care Linkage Project. The goal of this project was to develop and strengthen effective linkages between NORC-SSPs and key healthcare providers serving their communities. An analysis of North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System (NSLIJ) emergency room admissions of older adults from the previous year within this community revealed that 80% were due to trauma as a result of falls. In the quest to promote healthy aging and independence in older adults, a falls prevention program, in collaboration with physicians and community healthcare providers would be implemented and disseminated to at-risk seniors.Despite the growing literature documenting prevention and best practices that have proven successful in well-controlled research, few of these interventions are consistently implemented in applied settings and as such, these gaps have been documented (2, 7-9). A systematic review and meta- analysis was performed to assess the relative effectiveness of various interventions to prevent falls in older adults. These interventions consisted of exercise programs, environmental modifications, as well as educational presentations (10). \u2026",

        "abstract": "As an alternative to ageing at home in the community, naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs) have great potential to facilitate ageing in place; however, they have not attracted much research attention. This study conducts an overview of NORCs, aiming to examine the previous research in a comprehensive manner in order to explore how NORCs impact ageing in place, with the goal of guiding future research. The research presented here employs the content analysis method to review prior NORC-related studies and categorise research themes and findings following top-down coding principles. A total of 49 articles were selected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and the results show that the \u201csocial environment\u201d, which was the most discussed topic (n = 24), provides the necessary mental support and physical motivation for older adults to live actively in NORCs, and that NORCs play a positive role in preserving public resources and promoting individual health. The limitations of this study include the fact that there is little public information on NORC programs and the subjective classification of themes, among others. This study acts as a foundation for future research on NORCs, which serve as a perfect model for healthy ageing in place.",

        "abstract": "Most older individuals prefer to age in place during their later years; however, achieving this aspiration presents significant challenges. Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) represent a potential option for promoting healthy aging, both from the perspective of meeting seniors\u2019 real needs and cost-effectiveness. This article aims to analyze the distribution of NORCs in Australia and compares census data from 2011 to 2021 to understand the overall distribution patterns and changes across the nation, by providing a localized analysis of the hotspot distribution of NORCs in eight Greater Capital Cities. The study employs methods of geovisualization, Global Moran\u2019s I, and Getis-Ord Gi* analysis to examine the spatial correlations and clustering effects of NORCs. The results indicate that NORCs are rapidly growing in Australia, with their distribution primarily influenced by sea change and urbanization. Understanding the trends in NORC distribution can assist the government in developing effective and localized policies and interventions to help older Australians to better age in place.",
