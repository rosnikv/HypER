        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn primary biliary cirrhosis the hepatic lesions may result, at least in part, from the intracellular accumulation of potentially toxic endogenous bile acids. Preliminary work suggests that the administration of ursodiol (also called ursodeoxycholic acid), a hydrophilic bile acid without hepatotoxicity, leads to improvement in the condition of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a two-year, multicenter, double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of ursodiol with that of placebo. Patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis were randomly assigned to receive either ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (n = 73) or placebo (n = 73). Treatment failure was defined as a doubling of bilirubin levels to more than 70 mumol per liter or the occurrence of a severe complication (ascites or variceal bleeding) or an adverse reaction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment failed in 6 patients in the ursodiol group, as compared with 13 in the placebo group (P less than 0.01 by Cox regression model). A single patient in each group withdrew because of minor adverse effects. After two years of treatment, the proportion of patients with clinically overt disease decreased only in the ursodiol group (P less than 0.02). The patients treated with ursodiol had significant improvements in serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, and IgM (all P less than 0.001); the antimitochondrial-antibody titer (P less than 0.01); and the Mayo risk score (P less than 0.001). Follow-up analysis of 95 liver-biopsy specimens showed a significant improvement in the mean histologic score (P less than 0.002) and in all the characteristic histologic features except fibrosis only in the group given ursodiol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUrsodiol is a safe and effective treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis.",

        "abstract": "One hundred fifty\u2010one patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) grouped into four strata based on entry serum bilirubin (<2 mg/dL vs. 2 mg/dL or greater) and liver histology (stages I, II vs. stages III, IV\u2013Ludwig criteria) were randomized within each stratum to ursodiol or placebo given in a single dose of 10 to 12 mg/kg at bedtime for 2 years. Placebo\u2010 (n = 74) and ursodiol\u2010treated (n = 77) patients were well matched at baseline for demographic and prognostic factors. Ursodiol induced major improvements in biochemical tests of the liver in strata 1 and 2 (entry bilirubin <2), but had less effect on laboratory tests in patients with entry serum bilirubin of \u2a7e2 (strata 3 and 4). Histology was favorably affected by ursodiol in patients in strata 1 and 2 but not in strata 3 and 4. Ursodiol enrichment in fasting bile obtained at the conclusion of the trial was approximately 40% and comparable in all strata. Thus, differences in ursodiol enrichment of the bile acid pool do not explain better responses of laboratory tests and histology found in patients with less advanced PBC. Patients treated with ursodiol tended to develop a treatment failure less frequently than those who received placebo, particularly in strata 1 and 2 (ursodiol 42%, placebo 60%, P = .078). Development of severe symptoms (fatigue/pruritus) and doubling of serum bilirubin were reduced significantly in ursodiol\u2010treated patients. Major complications of liver disease, progression to liver transplantation or death, occurred in 10.5% and 76.6%, respectively, in patients who had an entry serum bilirubin of <2 or \u2a7e2 mg/dL. The incidence of these complications was comparable in ursodiol\u2010 and placebo\u2010treated patients. Treatment failure occurred sooner in placebo than in ursodiol\u2010treated patients in strata 1 and 2 but at the same rate in similarly treated patients in strata 3 and 4. Patients with advanced disease are unlikely to benefit from ursodiol. Trials longer than 2 years will likely be needed to determine whether ursodiol reduces major complications of liver disease in patients with milder disease. (Hepatology 1995;22:759\u2013766.)",

        "title": "Ursodiol for Hepatobiliary Disorders",
        "abstract": "Table. SI Units and Drugs Ursodeoxycholate is a naturally occurring dihydroxy bile salt that comprises approximately 1% of the total bile salt pool in humans [1-3]. It is the 7 -epimer (Figure 1) of chenodeoxycholate, one of the major endogenous bile salts. Although oral administration of either ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) or chenodiol (chenodeoxycholic acid) desaturates bile and contributes to the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, ursodiol is better tolerated and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that ursodiol may be an effective therapy in various chronic liver diseases, especially cholestatic disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis. Figure 1. Biochemical structure of bile acids. left right We describe the pharmacology of ursodiol, explain the rationale for its use in the treatment of patients with cholesterol gallstones and chronic liver diseases, and describe the results obtained in clinical trials of ursodiol therapy. Pharmacology Oral administration of ursodiol (Actigall; Summit Pharmaceuticals, Summit, New Jersey) leads to enrichment of bile in a dose-dependent manner such that, at pharmacologic doses (10 to 15 mg/kg per day), it becomes the predominant biliary bile acid. About 30% to 60% of an oral dose of ursodiol is absorbed, although the percentage absorbed decreases with increasing dose [4, 5]. The proportion of ursodiol in bile plateaus at doses exceeding 10 to 12 mg/kg per day because of epimerization to chenodeoxycholic acid and because ursodiol does not inhibit hepatic synthesis of the primary bile salts [6]. Ursodiol is absorbed along the length of the jejunum and ileum by nonionic passive diffusion and is absorbed in the ileum by active transport mechanisms [4, 7]. Colonic absorption is also substantial and may account for as much as 20% of an ingested dose [8]. Even in patients who have had ileal resections, high oral doses (4 g/d) of ursodiol can increase the biliary concentration of ursodiol tenfold [9]. Once absorbed, ursodiol is efficiently taken up by the liver with first-pass clearance of more than 60% of the absorbed dose [2]. Therefore, in the absence of cholestasis or substantial liver disease, minimal levels of ursodiol appear in plasma [10]. In the liver, ursodiol is conjugated with either glycine or taurine and is rapidly secreted into bile. Peak bile concentrations of ursodiol are seen 1 to 3 hours after an oral dose [4]. Ursodiol excreted from the biliary tract is resorbed through the enterohepatic circulation or is metabolized to insoluble bile salts that are excreted in the feces. The biological half-life of ursodiol is 3.5 to 5.8 days in humans [2]. With discontinuation of the drug, serum and bile levels decline exponentially [10]. Other medications, such as cholestyramine, colestipol, charcoal, sucralfate, and antacids may impair the absorption of ursodiol, thereby decreasing its bioavailability. Cholesterol Gallstones Formation of Cholesterol Gallstones The pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones involves the failure to maintain cholesterol in solution in the bile [11-16]. Biliary cholesterol is normally solubilized by micelles and unilamellar cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles [11-15]. A prerequisite for the formation of cholesterol gallstones is bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol. In addition to supersaturation, an excess of nucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors or both lead to nucleation of solid cholesterol crystals [11-13, 17-19]. Gallbladder mucin, free calcium ions, and gallbladder stasis may also contribute to cholesterol crystal nucleation and stone growth [11-13, 15-17]. Bile Salt Therapy for Gallstones Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gallstones. For patients at high operative risk and for patients who wish to avoid surgery for personal reasons, the most widely used of the nonsurgical treatments is the bile salt ursodiol. Chenodiol (Chenix; Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Marietta, Georgia) was the first bile salt reported to dissolve gallstones [11, 20-22]. It was extensively evaluated in the 1970s, particularly in the National Cooperative Gallstone Study [23] in which more than 900 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, low-dose chenodiol (375 mg/d), or high-dose chenodiol (750 mg/d) for up to 2 years [23]. In the high-dose group, 13.5% complete dissolution was noted, less than the 20% to 40% complete dissolution other investigators [24] achieved with higher doses. The major drawbacks of chenodiol are the dose-related side effects of diarrhea and an increase in serum aminotransferase levels. Chenodiol was not widely prescribed in the United States, and with the introduction of ursodiol in the late 1980s, it is now rarely used as monotherapy. Ursodiol has also been studied as a gallstone dissolution agent [2, 3]. Its safety and ease of administration have made ursodiol the most common therapeutic alternative to cholecystectomy [21, 22, 25]. Ursodiol is also used after shock-wave lithotripsy to dissolve residual stone fragments in the gallbladder [22, 26, 27]. Ursodiol dissolves gallstones by solubilizing cholesterol from the stone surface. Ursodiol results in the conversion of supersaturated bile to unsaturated bile [21]. This desaturation of bile enhances the transport capacity of bile for cholesterol. Ursodiol results in biliary desaturation through several mechanisms, most of which are incompletely understood [21]. Despite somewhat conflicting results, decreased intestinal absorption of cholesterol probably occurs during ursodiol administration [2, 3]. This could be related to less effective micelle formation or to less efficient intestinal absorption from liquid crystals. Ursodiol may also decrease hepatic cholesterol synthesis by decreasing the activity of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis [21]. Lastly, there is little, if any, negative feedback inhibition of hepatic bile salt synthesis by ursodiol, such that cholesterol continues to be converted to bile salts [21, 28]. In addition to biliary desaturation, ursodiol also has the unique property of promoting the formation of a liquid crystal mesophase of phospholipid plus cholesterol [21, 29]. Such liquid crystals can form even in the presence of bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol, which probably accounts for the observation that ursodiol may dissolve gallstones in the presence of supersaturated bile. Proper patient selection is critical for optimizing gallstone dissolution with ursodiol. As already noted, cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gallstones. Patients with mild or infrequent episodes of biliary pain are the most appropriate candidates for ursodiol treatment. Asymptomatic patients with gallstones are not suitable candidates for therapy [30-32]. Ursodiol should not be used in the management of patients with acute gallstone complications, such as acute cholecystitis, bile duct obstruction, cholangitis, or gallstone pancreatitis. Candidates for ursodiol therapy must have radiolucent gallstones and a patent cystic duct [22]. Although dissolution with ursodiol may occur in patients with nonvisualization of the gallbladder as determined by oral cholecystographic techniques, such instances have involved small numbers of patients and have not clearly defined the cause for nonvisualization. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder during the course of ursodiol therapy is, however, associated with a very low dissolution rate [22]. After the initiation of ursodiol therapy in patients with gallstones, the proportion of total biliary bile salts comprised by ursodiol increases within 1 to 2 weeks from 1% to a maximum of approximately 60% [21]. Although doses as low as 3 to 5 mg/kg per day have resulted in gallstone dissolution, the optimal dose is 8 to 10 mg/kg per day. Doses exceeding 10 mg/kg per day do not result in increased dissolution rates [2, 6, 21, 33-36]. Interestingly, with ursodiol therapy, symptoms such as pain, nausea, bloating, and vomiting may improve in some patients before actual gallstone dissolution [37-41]. The decrease in symptoms may be attributed to changes in gallbladder dimensions and to a resultant decrease in the likelihood of gallstones becoming impacted in the cystic duct [42]. Ursodiol leads to a reversible, dose-dependent increase in gallbladder volume within 2 days of starting treatment [42-44]. In addition, ursodiol therapy results in a decrease in gallbladder mucin, perhaps decreasing bile viscosity and improving bile flow [45]. The overall success rate for ursodiol in dissolving gallstones up to 20 mm in diameter ranges from 30% to 50% [2, 6, 33-36]. A meta-analysis of randomized trials with ursodiol [46] found that the dissolution rate was 37% for patients treated with ursodiol at doses of more than 7 mg/kg per day or of more than 500 mg/d for at least 6 months. The mean rate of decrease in gallstone diameter during oral bile salt therapy is 1.0 mm/mo, whereas the median rate is 0.7 mm/mo [47]. The diameter of the stones is a more important determinant of dissolution than is the number of stones; the size of the largest stone is rate-limiting [2, 6, 33-36]. In the meta-analysis by May and colleagues [46], dissolution with ursodiol was observed in 48.5% of patients with stones smaller than 10 mm and in 28.8% of those with larger stones. Factors other than gallstone size have been shown to affect the success of dissolution therapy. Stone buoyancy on oral cholecystography is highly correlated with successful dissolution [33, 35]. About 15% of gallstones are buoyant using oral cholecystographic techniques, and dissolution rates of up to 70% have been achieved with these types of stones [36]. Only cholesterol stones are buoyant, and these stones have a substantially lower content of calcium salts than do nonfloating cholesterol stones [48, 4",

        "abstract": "Bile acids, which are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, are important in the production of bile flow, excretion of cholesterol, and intestinal digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Increases and/or alterations in concentrations of bile acids in serum are specific and sensitive indicators of hepatobiliary disorders. Synthesis of bile acids in hepatocytes involves steps in endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Other important hepatocellular processes involving bile acids include active uptake by the basolateral membrane, intracellular transport, P-450-mediated conjugations and hydroxylations, and canalicular secretion. Hydrophobic bile acids produce hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In experimental and epidemiologic studies, some of these forms have been identified as causative agents in the development of colon and liver (experimental only) cancer. Conversely, several hydrophilic forms, primarily ursodeoxycholic acid, have demonstrated cytoprotective properties in a variety of clinical and experimental hepatobiliary diseases and disorders. Because bile acids can have dramatically different properties and effects, determination of mechanisms of action of these compounds has become an active area of research. Primary isolated hepatocytes provide an opportunity to investigate bile acid-related functions and effects in well-designed, carefully controlled studies. Short-term cultures have been used to study a variety of issues related to bile acids, including cytotoxicity, synthesis, and hepatocellular processing. With these systems, however, many functions of mature hepatocytes, including those pertaining to bile acids, can be lost when cultures are maintained for more than several days. Recent developments in culture techniques permit long-term maintenance of functionally stable, differentiated cells. Pertaining to bile acid research, these systems remain to be fully characterized but, in appropriate situations, they should provide important alternatives to in vivo studies and short-term in vitro assays.",

        "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in the development of a hepatocyte bioreactor for the treatment of acute hepatic failure; however, little is known about the effect of hepatocyte byproducts on the viability of the cells in the bioreactor environment. We investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of bile on the growth and viability of the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 and on the cytochrome P-450 content and dependent mixed function oxidase (MFO) activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Our purpose was to determine whether or not it would be necessary to pretreat the plasma from patients with acute liver failure to remove elevated bile concentrations which might be toxic to the hepatocytes in an artificial liver device. Bile was found to inhibit Hep G2 cell growth at concentrations as low as 0.1% and to decrease viability at concentrations above 0.5%. The cytochrome P-450 and GSH contents and the activities of the MFO system and of GST were decreased in the primary cultures of hepatocytes following 24 h treatment with concentrations of bile at and above 0.5%. The MFO activities associated with different cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes decreased to different extents in the presence of bile with the O-dealkylation of pentoxyresorufin being more labile than that of ethoxyresorufin. Our data indicate that elevated bile concentrations are cytotoxic to liver cells, and it may be necessary to pretreat patient plasma to decrease its bile content to protect the cells during the clinical operation of a hepatocyte bioreactor device.",

        "abstract": "Liver failure resulting from different causes and its concomitant complications represent difficult-to-treat conditions with high mortality rates, despite improved therapeutic modalities in intensive care medicine. The accumulation of albumin-bound metabolites that are normally cleared by the liver, such as bilirubin and bile acids, contributes substantially to the development of multiorgan dysfunction in these clinical situations. The molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) represents a cell-free, extracorporeal, liver assistance method for the selective removal of albumin-bound substances. Moreover, it enables the removal of excess water and water-soluble substances via an inbuilt dialysis step. Since 1993, >400 patients have been treated in 53 centers in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Diseases treated with MARS included acute exacerbation of chronic hepatic failure, hepatorenal syndrome, acute hepatic failure, and primary nonfunction/poor function after liver transplantation and major liver resection. Treatments were well tolerated. No severe adverse events were observed. Six- to 8-h MARS treatments resulted in significant (P < 0.05) removal of bilirubin, bile acids, tryptophan, short- and middle-chain fatty acids, aromatic amino acids, and ammonia. Clearance rates for strongly albumin-bound substances were between 10 and 60 ml/min. The removal of albumin-bound toxins resulted in decreases in hepatic encephalopathy, increases in mean arterial pressure, and improvements in kidney and liver function. In the first randomized clinical trial of the MARS method for treatment of the hepatorenal syndrome, significant prolongation of survival was observed for the MARS-treated group. It is concluded that the MARS method can contribute to the treatment of critically ill patients with liver failure and different underlying diseases.",

However, its indication, efficacy and capability to induce liver regeneration remain unclear. The aim of our pilot study in children was to analyse the impact of MARS on markers of detoxification and regeneration. Methods: In children with fulminant Wilson's disease and bridged with MARSmini for liver transplantation, we analyzed toxic metabolites (bile acids, bilirubin, lactate, ammonia, tryptophan and copper), regulators of the inflammatory cascade [nitrate, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), methionine, cystine and hyaluronic acid] and hepatic growth factors [hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1] from blood, albumin circuit and haemodialysate from four applications. Results: In all four applications, transfer of toxic metabolites (6/6) and inflammatory mediators (6/6), but also of hepatic growth factors (9/10), into the albumin circuit of MARS was consistently detected. Corresponding blood levels were decreased for 3/6 metabolites, 3/6 inflammatory mediators and 1/10 growth factors and increased for 1/10 growth factors. Bridging for liver transplantation was successful with MARS. Conclusions: In our prospective study, substantial extraction of albumin-bound and water-soluble candidate substances was detected with variable effect on respective blood levels.

        "abstract": "Efficient repopulation by transplanted hepatocytes in the severely injured liver is essential for their clinical application in the treatment of acute hepatic failure. We studied here whether and how the transplanted hepatocytes are able to efficiently repopulate the toxin-induced acute injured liver. Male dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient F344 rats were randomized to receive retrorsine plus D-galactosamine (R+D-gal) treatment or D-galactosamine-alone (D-gal) to induce acute hepatic injury, and retrorsine-alone. In these models, retrorsine was used to inhibit the proliferation of endogenous hepatocytes while D-galactosamine induced acute hepatocyte damage. Wild-type hepatocytes (1 \u00d7 107/ml) were transplanted intraportally 24 h after D-galactosamine or saline injection. The kinetics of proliferation and repopulation of transplanted cells and the kinetics of cytokine response, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2) expression were analyzed. We observed that early entry of transplanted hepatocytes into the hepatic plates and massive repopulation of the liver by transplanted hepatocytes occurred in acute hepatic injury induced by R+D-gal treatment but not by D-gal-alone or retrorsine-alone. The expressions of transforming growth factor-\u03b1 and hepatocyte growth factor genes in the R+D-gal injured liver were significantly upregulated and prolonged up to 4 weeks after hepatocyte transplantation. The expression kinetics were parallel with the efficient proliferation and repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. HSC was activated rapidly, markedly, and prolongedly up to 4 weeks after hepatocyte transplantation, when the expression of HGF gene and repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes were reduced afterward. Furthermore, the expression kinetics of MMP2 and its specific distribution in the host areas surrounding the expanding clusters of transplanted hepatocytes are consistent with those of activated HSC. Impaired hepatocyte regeneration after acute severe hepatic injury may initiate serial compensatory repair mechanisms that facilitate the extensive repopulation by transplanted hepatocytes that enter early the hepatic plates.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in hepatocyte regeneration after acute severe hepatic injury, which is related to the source paper's finding of increased serum HGF levels in children with acute liver failure. The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the mechanism of HGF in hepatocyte regeneration."

        "title": "Hepatocyte Transplantation and the Differentiation Fate of Host Oval Cells in Acute Severe Hepatic Injury",
        "abstract": "Oval cells and hepatocytes rarely proliferate simultaneously. This study aimed to determine the impacts of hepatocyte transplantation on the response and fate of oval cells that are activated to proliferate in acute severe hepatic injury. Retrorsine + D-galactosamine (R+D-gal) treatment was used to induce acute hepatic injury and to elicit extensive activation of oval cells in male dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient F344 rats. These rats were then randomized to receive wild-type hepatocyte transplantation or vehicle intraportally. The kinetics of oval cell response and their differentiation fate were analyzed. Results showed that oval cells were activated early and differentiated into hepatocytes in R+D-gal-treated rats without hepatocyte transplantation. With hepatocyte transplantation, the oval cells were recruited later and continued to proliferate in parallel with the massive proliferation of transplanted hepatocytes. They formed ductules and differentiated into biliary cells. When hepatocytes were transplanted at the day when oval cells were at their peak response, the numerous activated oval cells ceased to differentiate into hepatocytes and remained in ductular form. The ductular oval cells were capable of differentiating into hepatocytes again when the donor hepatocytes were inhibited to proliferate. We conclude that hepatocyte transplantation changes the mechanism of liver reconstitution and affects the differentiation fate of host oval cells in acute severe hepatic injury.",

        "title": "Repopulation of Human Origin Hepatocyte Progenitor-Like Cell Line, THLE-5b, in the SCID Mouse Liver under p21-Mediated Cell Growth-Arresting Conditions",
        "abstract": "The in vivo repopulation of hepatocytes depends on donor cell growth potential and recipient conditioning. We herein demonstrate the successful cell transplantation of a human hepatocyte cell line, THLE-5b, into the SCID mouse liver by means of a rather mild conditioning using a 55% hepatectomy and p21 transfection. Adult human liver-derived cells, THLE-5b, are SV40 T antigen-immortalized epithelial cells. A phenotypic examination of THLE-5b showed they expressed hepatic stem cell markers such as EpCAM, OCT3/4, and Thy-1, thus indicating the immature nature of the cells. A three-dimensional aggregate culture of THLE-5b showed a higher expression level of liver-specific genes such as albumin, \u03b11-antitrypsin, and CYP3A4, thus suggesting that THLE-5b possess the capability to differentiate into hepatocytes. In a cell transplantation experiment, the cell cycle regulator p21 was transfected with adenoviral vector into the SCID mouse liver. On the next day, 8 \u00d7 105 cells of GFP-transfected THLE-5b were injected intrasplenically, together with the intraperitoneal administration of anti-asialo GM1 antibodies. The following day, a partial hepatectomy was performed. The GFP-THLE-5b cells were observed to have migrated and become integrated into the liver parenchyma 14 days after transplantation. The present protocol is thus considered to be a novel experimental model to elucidate the mechanism of hepatocyte repopulation and to develop efficient stem cell therapy in the liver.",

However, the focus of this paper is on the use of a human hepatocyte cell line and the role of p21 in cell growth-arresting conditions. The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it builds upon the concept of hepatocyte transplantation and repopulation."
