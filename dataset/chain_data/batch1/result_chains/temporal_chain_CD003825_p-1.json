        "abstract": "The enantiomers of indacrinone (I), an investigational loop diuretic, have different pharmacologic activity. The (\u2013) enantiomer is natriuretic, and the (+) enantiomer is uricosuric. To determine the antihypertensive effects and an isouricemic ratio of indacrinone enantiomers, 37 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) between 90 and 104 mm Hg, after a 4\u2010week placebo washout, randomly received one of the ratios of I enantiomers, namely \u22122.5/ + 80 mg (A), \u22125/ + 80 mg (B), \u221210/ + 80 mg (C) or placebo (P), once daily for 12 weeks in a double\u2010blind, parallel study. The mean reductions (baseline\u2010end of treatment) in BP of 23/8, 20/10 and 25/10 mm Hg with treatments A, B and C respectively were greater (p < 0.01) than that on P (0/3). Initially, serum uric acid decreased with treatments A and B but not with C. Mean changes in serum uric acid were \u22120.3, \u22120.4, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/dl respectively with treatments A, B, C and P. The ratio of \u221210/+ 80 mg produced least variation in serum uric acid. Reduction in serum K+ and Cl\u2212 appeared to be dose related to (\u2013) enantiomer. No serious adverse effects were reported. A 1:9 ratio of I enantiomers intended for wide\u2010scale use as a diuretic also showed good antihypertensive activity, a favorable uric acid profile and absence of hepatic toxicity in 14 patients.",

        "title": "Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics for primary hypertension.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAntihypertensive drugs from the thiazide diuretic drug class have been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Loop diuretics are indicated and used to treat hypertension, but a systematic review of their blood pressure-lowering efficacy or effectiveness in terms of reducing cardiovascular mortality or morbidity from randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence has not been conducted.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the dose-related decrease in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or both, as well as adverse events leading to participant withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids profile) due to loop diuretics versus placebo control in the treatment of people with primary hypertension.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 9), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 27 October 2014.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of at least three weeks duration comparing loop diuretic with a placebo in people with primary hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg at baseline.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We used weighted mean difference and a fixed effects model to combine continuous outcome data. We analysed the drop outs due to adverse effects using relative risk ratio.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nNine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mmHg/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2.8) mmHg. Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference.We performed additional searches in 2012 and 2014, which found no additional trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nBased on the limited number of published RCTs, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg, which is likely an overestimate. We graded the quality of evidence for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimates as \"low\" due to the high risk of bias of included studies and the high likelihood of publication bias. We found no clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class. The dose-ranging effects of loop diuretics could not be evaluated. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.",

        "explanation": "This paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis, which includes a study on the indacrinone enantiomer (-2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg). However, it does not build upon the findings of the source paper or use them as a sub-hypothesis, but rather includes them in a broader review of loop diuretics."

While it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it does utilize the same class of drugs (loop diuretics) and could be considered partially dependent on the understanding of loop diuretics established in the source paper."

        "abstract": "\nFurosemide is a drug that has not only a renal effect, but also a vascular one, resulting in decreased left atrial and ventricularfilling pressure accompanied by an increase in venous compliance, all of this with significant effects on central cardiac hemodynamics.In dialysis patients, it is still unclear the efficiency of furosemide, a diuretic drug that inhibits the Na+, K+, 2CL\ufffd cotransporter in the renal tubular system. Also, furosemide need to be used at much higher doses because of its pharmacokinetic changes in the context of impaired renal clearance.The aim of our study was to investigate whether furosemide induces changes in cardiovascular hemodynamics in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, using standard echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI).We foundcorrelations between furosemide useand improved cardiac parameters, assessed by multiple echocardiographic variables, and we consider that furosemide has complementary effects in dialysis patients with residual diuresis.\n",
