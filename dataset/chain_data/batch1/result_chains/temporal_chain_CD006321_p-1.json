        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe effects of parenteral growth hormone, glutamine supplementation, and a high carbohydrate-low fat (HCLF) diet on gut adaptation in short-bowel syndrome are unclear. The aim of this study was to compare effects of this treatment regimen and placebo in patients with short-bowel syndrome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 8 patients with short-bowel syndrome (average small bowel length, 71 cm; mean duration, 12.9 years) was performed. Active treatment was growth hormone (0.14 mg.kg-1.day-1), oral glutamine (0.63 g.kg-1.day-1), and the HCLF diet for 21 days. The weight, basal metabolic rate, nutrient and electrolyte balance, serum insulin-like growth factor I levels, D-xylose absorption, morphology and DNA proliferation of small intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal transit were evaluated. Treatments were compared by paired t test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActive treatment transiently increased body weight, significantly but modestly increased the absorption of sodium and potassium, and decreased gastric emptying. The assimilation of macronutrients, stool volumes, and morphometry of small bowel mucosa were not statistically different in the two treatment arms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough treatment with growth hormone, glutamine, and HCLF diet for 3 weeks resulted in modest improvements in electrolyte absorption and delayed gastric emptying, there were no improvements in small bowel morphology, stool losses, or macronutrient absorption.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether treatment with a potent protease-resistant analog of human glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) might augment the adaptive response to massive intestinal resection, rats were divided into resected, which had 75% of the midjejunoileum removed, sham-resected, and nonsurgical groups. Within each group, animals were assigned to 21 days of treatment with the drug (0.1 \u03bcg/g of the GLP-2 analog in phosphate-buffered saline) or vehicle alone subcutaneously twice daily. Food intake; weight gain; jejunal and ileal diameters, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt depths, and villus heights; mucosal sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter, and micrograms of DNA per centimeter; andd-xylose absorption were measured. There was a significant increase in diameter, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt-villus height, sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter and micrograms of DNA per centimeter in both the jejunum and ileum in response to resection and a significant additive response to the GLP-2 analog in the jejunum but not in the ileum. The ratio of milligrams of protein per centimeter to micrograms of DNA per centimeter of mucosa was not different among groups, consistent with hyperplasia.d-Xylose absorption was significantly reduced in response to resection; however, the GLP-2 analog enhanced the absorptive capacity in control animals and restored the absorptive capacity in resected animals. Thus the GLP-2 analog induces mucosal hyperplasia and enhances the rate and magnitude of the proximal intestinal adaptive response to massive resection.",

        "abstract": "We wished to determine whether exogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 infusion stimulates intestinal growth in parenterally fed immature pigs. Piglets (106-108 days gestation) were given parenteral nutrient infusion (TPN), TPN + human GLP-2 (25 nmol. kg(-1). day(-1)), or sow's milk enterally (ENT) for 6 days. Intestinal protein synthesis was then measured in vivo after a bolus dose of [1-(13)C]phenylalanine, and degradation was calculated from the difference between protein accretion and synthesis. Crypt cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured in situ by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Intestinal protein and DNA accretion rates and villus heights were similar in GLP-2 and ENT pigs, and both were higher (P < 0.05) than in TPN pigs. GLP-2 decreased fractional protein degradation rate, whereas ENT increased fractional protein synthesis rate compared with TPN pigs. Percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in GLP-2 and ENT groups was 48 and 64% lower, respectively, than in TPN group (P < 0.05). However, ENT, but not GLP-2, increased percentage of BrdU-positive crypt cells above that in TPN piglets. We conclude that GLP-2 increases intestinal growth in premature, TPN-fed pigs by decreasing proteolysis and apoptosis, whereas enteral nutrition acts via increased protein synthesis and cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Exogenous glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) mimics the stimulatory effect of enteral nutrition on intestinal mucosal growth in preterm neonatal pigs. Little is known about its effects on small intestinal function. In this study, we investigated whether the trophic actions of GLP-2 and enteral nutrition are paralleled by effects on small intestinal function. Cesarean-delivered piglets (92% of gestation) were given either a parenteral nutrient infusion [total parenteral nutrition (TPN), n = 7], TPN + human GLP-2 (25 nmol/kg/d, n = 8), or enteral nutrition (ENT, n = 6) for 6 d. Gene expression (mRNA) and activities of lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), maltase-glucoamylase (MGA), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), aminopeptidase N (ApN), and A (ApA) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured. Both GLP-2 and enteral nutrition increased mucosal weight (+30\u201340%, p < 0.05) relative to TPN. GLP-2 stimulated jejunal MGA and SI mRNA abundance and activity levels but did not change LPH in parenterally fed pigs (p < 0.05). Enteral nutrition decreased jejunal LPH and MGA mRNA abundance and activity and increased ileal ApN, ApA, and DPP IV activities relative to TPN (p < 0.05). We conclude that GLP-2 and enteral nutrition exert different effects on intestinal enzyme function despite similar effects on intestinal growth. In addition, the effects of GLP-2 on intestinal function in these parenterally fed, premature neonatal pigs differed from those previously reported for similarly fed term neonates.",

        "abstract": "Intestinal function depends on the presence of luminal nutrients and is altered during starvation and refeeding. Amino acids are essential for enterocytes, but the luminal supply is compromised with changes in dietary intake. To test the hypothesis that during periods of restricted luminal nutrient availability mucosal cells undergo adaptations aimed toward preserving amino acid supply, the expression of amino acid and peptide transporter mRNAs was quantified in rats with no oral intake, whose nutritional status was maintained with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The role of the intestinotrophic hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) was investigated in the adaptive responses. Rats were administered TPN with or without exogenous GLP-2. Amino acid and peptide transporter mRNAs in small intestine mucosa were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Compared with orally fed rats, removal of luminal nutrition increased the expression of ASCT1, SAT2, and GLYT1 mRNAs in the duodenum and of ASCT2, EAAC1, NBAT, and PepT1 mRNAs in the ileum. CAT1, PAT1, and SN2 mRNA abundances were unaffected. GLP-2 reversed these effects. Three subgroups of transporters were identified by regional differences in response to TPN. This may reflect differing roles for substrates of transporters located apically and basally and along the proximal-distal axis of the intestine. The importance of maintaining amino acid supply for intestinal mucosal cells is illustrated.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Parenteral nutrition is a critically important intervention for children with intestinal dysfunctions. However, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with no enteral feeding is associated with small intestine atrophy and malabsorption, which complicate the transition to enteral nutrition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the intestinotrophic peptide glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which reduces TPN-associated atrophy and maintains nutrient absorption in adult rats, for preventing nutrient malabsorption in neonates receiving TPN. Methods: Term pigs obtained by cesarean delivery received from birth TPN alone (TPN; n = 7) or TPN with GLP-2 (25 nmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121; GLP-2; n = 8) or were fed sow milk enterally (n = 7). The small intestine was removed on postnatal day 6 to measure morphological responses and absorption of glucose, leucine, lysine and proline by intact tissues and brush border membrane vesicles and to quantify the abundances of mRNA and protein for enterocyte glucose transporters (SGLT-1 and GLUT2). Results: Relative to TPN alone, administration of GLP-2 resulted in small intestines that were larger (P < 0.01), had greater abundances of mRNA and protein for SGLT-1, but not for GLUT2, and had higher capacities to absorb nutrients (P < 0.01). Moreover, the intestines of GLP-2 pigs were comparable in size and absorptive capacities with those of pigs fed sow milk enterally. Conclusions: Providing GLP-2 to neonates receiving TPN prevents small intestine atrophy, results in small intestine absorptive capacities that are comparable to when nutrients are provided enterally and may accelerate the transition from TPN to enteral nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Luminal nutrients stimulate structural and functional regeneration in the intestine through mechanisms thought to involve insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). We investigated the relationship between IGF-I and GLP-2 responses and mucosal growth in rats fasted for 48 h and then refed for 2 or 4 days by continuous intravenous or intragastric infusion or ad libitum feeding. Fasting induced significant decreases in body weight, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and bioactive GLP-2, jejunal mucosal cellularity (mass, protein, DNA, and villus height), IGF-I mRNA, and ileal proglucagon mRNA. Plasma IGF-I concentration was restored to fed levels with 2 days of ad libitum refeeding but not with 4 days of intravenous or intragastric refeeding. Administration of an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-2 (rat GLP-2 3-33) during ad libitum refeeding partially attenuated mucosal growth and prevented the increase in plasma IGF-I to fed levels; however, plasma GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA were restored to fed levels. Intragastric refeeding restored intestinal cellularity and functional capacity (sucrase activity and sodium-glucose transporter-1 expression) to fed levels, whereas intravenous refeeding had no effect. Intestinal regeneration after 4 days of intragastric or 2 days of ad libitum refeeding was positively associated with increases in plasma concentrations of GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA.

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Obese and diabetic mice display enhanced intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxaemia that participate in the occurrence of metabolic disorders. Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of organic (selenium-enriched yeast) vs inorganic (sodium selenite) selenium source on fecal end-fermentation products and gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. Alpha and beta diversity of the gut bacterial community were affected by age but not by gender or selenium source. The relative abundance of taxa was differently affected by age, and the DNA concentration of all selected bacterial groups increased with age, although total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate, propionate, caproate and lactate concentrations decreased. Organic selenium was associated with a higher concentration of total VFA, propionate and butyrate, a higher number of DNA copies of Lactobacillus, and a trend to lower DNA copies of Escherichia coli. Effects on fecal microbiome during growth differed with selenium source. Females had higher fecal end-fermentation products related to protein degradation, whereas males had higher DNA concentration of Bifidobacterium. Organic selenium might be beneficial over inorganic for dog food supplementation due to the positive modulation of the gut microbiome observed in puppies.",

        "abstract": "Selenium (Se) deficiency is a widespread and seasonally chronic phenomenon observed in Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) traditionally grazed on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau (QTP). Effects of the dietary addition of Se-enriched yeast (SeY) on the bacterial community in sheep rumen and rumen fermentation were evaluated with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the rumen prokaryotic community. Twenty-four yearling Tibetan rams [initial average body weight (BW) of 31.0 \u00b1 0.64 kg] were randomly divided into four treatment groups, namely, control (CK), low Se (L), medium Se (M), and high Se (H). Each group comprised six rams and was fed a basic diet of fresh forage cut from the alpine meadow, to which SeY was added at prescribed dose rates. This feed trial was conducted for over 35 days. On the final day, rumen fluid was collected using a transesophageal sampler for analyzing rumen pH, NH3-N content, volatile fatty acid (VFA) level, and the rumen microbial community. Our analyses showed that NH3-N, total VFA, and propionate concentrations in the M group were significantly higher than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Both the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and the analysis of similarities revealed that the bacterial population structure of rumen differed among the four groups. The predominant rumen bacterial phyla were found to be Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the three dominant genera in all the samples across all treatments were Christensenellaceae R7 group, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Prevotella 1. The relative abundances of Prevotella 1, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcus 2, Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group, Carnobacterium, and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium were found to differ significantly among the four treatment groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, Tax4fun metagenome estimation revealed that gene functions and metabolic pathways associated with carbohydrate and other amino acids were overexpressed in the rumen microbiota of SeY-supplemented sheep. To conclude, SeY significantly affects the abundance of rumen bacteria and ultimately affects the rumen microbial fermentation.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Due to climate change, heat waves occur more often, and the annual average temperature increases, which may contribute to the negative effects of heat stress in pigs. This study explored ways to help growing\u2013finishing pigs cope with heat stress during hot weather. Two groups of pigs were given different diets\u2014one standard and one enriched with specific feed additives. The pigs\u2019 respiration rates, rectal and skin temperatures, performances, and meat qualities were monitored. During a heat wave, the group with the enriched diet did not need as much drinking water compared to the standard diet group. Both groups, without distinguishing between dietary treatments, showed increased respiration rates and skin temperatures during higher heat loads. The findings suggest that the enriched diet may help reduce the need to increase daily water intake during hot periods. Furthermore, this study highlighted the sensitivity of the parameter of respiration rate in pigs suffering from (mild) heat stress. Abstract Heat stress in pigs negatively affects welfare, health, and performance. Osmoprotectants and antioxidants may alleviate oxidative damage during hot periods. We investigated whether an additive-enriched feed can reduce negative effects in pigs during summer conditions. Sixty growing\u2013finishing pigs were allocated into two groups: the control (CF) and summer feed (SF) group. The CF group contained 0.4 mg/kg inorganic selenium and 100 ppm vitamin E, while the SF group contained 0.3 mg/kg inorganic selenium, 0.1 mg/kg selenomethionine, 200 ppm vitamins E and C, and 0.2% betaine. Feed was offered ad libitum. Respiration rate, rectal and skin temperature, behaviour, and weight gain were assessed weekly. Daily measurements of these parameters were performed during a 3-day heat wave (temperature humidity index (THI) \u2265 75) and during an artificial heating period. Individual average daily water intake (ADWI) and feed intake were measured using RFID systems. The ADWI of the SF group did not change during heat load while it increased for the CF group. Independent of dietary treatment, increases in \u2206THI or the THI were accompanied by significant increases in both respiration rate and skin temperature. In conclusion, the SF may induce a reduced need to increase ADWI during hot periods. In addition, mainly skin temperatures and especially respiration rates revealed the sensitivity of pigs to heat stress.",
