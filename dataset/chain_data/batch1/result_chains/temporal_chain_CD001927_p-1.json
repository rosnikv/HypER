        "title": "Fixed minidose warfarin and aspirin alone and in combination vs adjusted-dose warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite the efficacy of warfarin sodium therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, many physicians hesitate to prescribe it to elderly patients because of the risk for bleeding complications and because of inconvenience for the patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation Study was a randomized, controlled trial examining the following therapies: warfarin sodium, 1.25 mg/d; warfarin sodium, 1.25 mg/d, plus aspirin, 300 mg/d; and aspirin, 300 mg/d. These were compared with adjusted-dose warfarin therapy (international normalized ratio of prothrombin time [INR], 2.0-3.0). Stroke or a systemic thromboembolic event was the primary outcome event. Transient ischemic attack, acute myocardial infarction, and death were secondary events. Data were handled as survival data, and risk factors were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. The trial was scheduled for 6 years from May 1, 1993, but due to scientific evidence of inefficiency of low-intensity warfarin plus aspirin therapy from another study, our trial was prematurely terminated on October 2, 1996.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 677 patients (median age, 74 years). The cumulative primary event rate after 1 year was 5.8% in patients receiving minidose warfarin; 7.2%, warfarin plus aspirin; 3.6%, aspirin; and 2.8%, adjusted-dose warfarin (P = .67). After 3 years, no difference among the groups was seen. Major bleeding events were rare.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough the difference was insignificant, adjusted-dose warfarin seemed superior to minidose warfarin and to warfarin plus aspirin after 1 year of treatment. The results do not justify a change in the current recommendation of adjusted-dose warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.",

        "title": "Antithrombotic Therapy To Prevent Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation",
        "abstract": "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is an important independent risk factor for stroke. Since 1989, 16 published clinical trials have conducted 36 separate randomized comparisons of antithrombotic agents in approximately 10 000 participants with atrial fibrillation (1-17). Previously published meta-analyses and pooled analyses of individual patient data (18-20) have considered, in various combinations, the first 6 clinical trials to be published. We present a meta-analysis of all currently available trials to further characterize the comparative efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Methods Randomized trials testing long-term (>3 months) use of antithrombotic agents in patients with atrial fibrillation were sought by a computerized search of the OVID/MEDLINE databases (from 1966 to 1999, not restricted by language) and by inquiries to the Cochrane Collaboration Stroke Review Group and Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration. Studies of atrial fibrillation associated with prosthetic cardiac valves or mitral stenosis were not considered; trials reporting results for subgroups of participants with atrial fibrillation among other participants without atrial fibrillation were included (14, 16). Double-blind and nonblinded trials were included, and sensitivity analysis was used to compare pooled results, as appropriate. We excluded one randomized trial in which results for participants with atrial fibrillation (approximately half of all participants) were not reported separately (21). We have anecdotal knowledge of two additional trials that are ongoing or have not been published (Table 1). Table 1. Randomized Clinical Trials for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Two reviewers independently extracted data from published sources on the number of patients treated, total follow-up exposure, and the occurrence of five outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis: all stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and major extracranial bleeding. The criteria for each of these outcomes were those used in each individual trial; major deviations are noted in footnotes to the tables. Intracranial hemorrhage included spontaneous and traumatic subdural hematomas. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were not considered. The percentage of participants who underwent neuroimaging or autopsy to reliably distinguish between ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke varied, and this percentage was not always reported. Therefore, all stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic) was chosen as the primary outcome. Effects of antithrombotic therapy on combinations of events (for example, stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) and effects of age and sex were not consistently reported and are not considered here. Intention-to-treat results were used for the main analyses, but only results noted during treatment were available for one small trial that tested antiplatelet agents (14). Primary prevention refers to patients without previous stroke or TIA; secondary prevention refers to patients with previous stroke or TIA. Detailed consideration of the design and execution of individual trials can be found in our systematic reviews prepared for the Cochrane Collaboration Stroke Review Group (16, 22). The authors participated in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) I, II, and III clinical trials (1987 to 1999), which were funded by the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke. Meta-analyses of the results of the trials are presented as relative risk reductions and absolute risk reductions for treatment groups compared with control groups. To estimate the relative risk reduction, the combined odds ratio was computed by using the modified Mantel-Haenszel (Peto) method (23), and the estimate was then subtracted from 1. For a study in which no events were observed for a specific outcome and treatment, 0.5 was added to the empty cell. The absolute risk reduction is a weighted estimate of the difference in annualized event rates (24). Before we estimated risk reduction, we tested the assumption of the statistical homogeneity of the treatment effect (across trials and within a specific scenario) by using the QL statistic for the relative odds scale (24) or the QW statistic with unequal weights for the absolute risk scale (24). Lack of homogeneity across trials precluded estimation of the treatment effect, as noted. Homogeneity was assessed for all meta-analyses of relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction; the exact P value was reported for all main analyses and for analyses in which the P value was less than 0.2. Estimates of relative risk reduction in individual trials were computed by subtracting the estimated odds ratio from 1. We estimated absolute risk reductions in individual trials by calculating the absolute difference in annualized event rates (events per person-years of observation). A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant; all tests and CIs are two-sided. Calculations were done by using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois) and EGRET software (Cytel Software Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts). Results Sixteen randomized trials published between 1989 and 1999 included 9874 participants with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with 2239 participants assigned to placebo (Table 1) (1-16). Total reported exposure was about 16 400 person-years (mean follow-up, 1.7 years). Fourteen trials included only participants with atrial fibrillation (1-13, 15); 2 trials included participants with atrial fibrillation in larger trials of secondary stroke prevention (14, 16). Warfarin was used exclusively in 10 trials testing oral anticoagulant agents; other derivatives of coumarin were also used in 2 additional trials (9, 15). Adjusted-Dose Warfarin Compared with Placebo In six trials involving 2900 patients with a total of 186 strokes, anticoagulation with oral vitamin K antagonists was compared with placebo (in five trials [1, 3, 7-9]) or control (in one trial [6]) (Table 2). The mean age of participants at study entry was 69 years (approximately 20% of participants were>75 years of age). Twenty-nine percent of participants were women, 45% had hypertension, and 20% had previous stroke or TIA. The target range for the international normalized ratio (INR) varied (Table 2); the mean achieved INR ranged from 2.0 to 2.6 in the five primary prevention trials and was 2.9 in the single secondary prevention trial. Mean duration of follow-up ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 years (overall average, 1.6 years per participant). The rate of stroke among participants who were not assigned to receive anticoagulation averaged 4.6% per year for primary prevention and 12.3% per year for secondary prevention. Four of these six trials were stopped at an interim analysis because of treatment efficacy (1, 3, 6, 8). Table 2. Adjusted-Dose Warfarin Compared with Placebo Meta-analysis showed that therapy with adjusted-dose warfarin reduced the relative risk for stroke by 62% (95% CI, 48% to 72%). This effect was statistically significant in four individual trials (3, 6, 8, 9) (Figure). The pooled result of primary prevention trials (59% reduction) was similar to that from the secondary prevention trial (68% reduction); results from the two double-blind trials (58% reduction) (7, 8) and the four open-label trials (63% reduction) (1, 3, 6, 9) were also similar. Warfarin was associated with similar relative risk reductions in disabling stroke (59%) and nondisabling stroke (61%). The absolute risk reduction for all stroke was 2.7% per year (number needed to treat [NNT] for 1 year to prevent one stroke, 37) for primary prevention and 8.4% per year (NNT, 12) for secondary prevention. Figure. Effects on all stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) of therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation. Top. Middle. Bottom. When only ischemic strokes were considered, treatment with adjusted-dose warfarin was associated with a 65% (CI, 52% to 74%) relative risk reduction. Twice as many intracranial hemorrhages were identified in participants who were assigned to receive warfarin (six compared with three), but the difference was not statistically significant. The rate of intracranial hemorrhage averaged 0.3% per year during anticoagulation and was 0.1% per year with placebo. The rate of major extracranial hemorrhage averaged 0.6% per year in patients who received placebo. The relative risk for major extracranial hemorrhage was 2.4 (CI, 1.2 to 4.6; absolute risk increase, 0.3% per year) for participants who received warfarin (excluding one trial in which almost half of the control group took aspirin [6]). All-cause mortality decreased in participants who received warfarin (relative risk reduction, 26% [CI, 4% to 43%]; P>0.2 for homogeneity; absolute risk reduction, 1.6% per year). Antiplatelet Therapy Compared with Placebo Six trials compared antiplatelet therapy with placebo (1, 3, 9, 13, 14, 16). In these trials, 3337 participants experienced a total of 376 strokes while being randomly assigned to receive antiplatelet therapy or placebo (Table 3). In five trials (1, 3, 9, 14, 16), assignment was double-blind. Approximately 90% of total follow-up exposure during antiplatelet therapy was with aspirin alone. Aspirin dosage ranged from 25 mg twice daily to 1300 mg/d. On the basis of available data from the three largest trials (1, 3, 9), the mean age of participants was 70 years (about 33% of participants were>age 75 years). Thirty-eight percent of participants were women, 46% had hypertension, and 40% had previous stroke or TIA. Mean duration of follow-up in these trials ranged from 1.2 to 4 years (overall average, 1.5 years per participant). The average rate of stroke among participants assigned to placebo was 5.2% per year for primary prevention and 12.9% per year for secondary prevention. Table 3.

        "abstract": "Context Patients who have atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased risk of stroke, but their absolute rate of stroke depends on age and comorbid conditions. Objective To assess the predictive value of classification schemes that estimate stroke risk in patients with AF. Design, setting, and patients Two existing classification schemes were combined into a new stroke-risk scheme, the CHADS( 2) index, and all 3 classification schemes were validated. The CHADS( 2) was formed by assigning 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes mellitus and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Data from peer review organizations representing 7 states were used to assemble a National Registry of AF (NRAF) consisting of 1733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had nonrheumatic AF and were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge. Main outcome measure Hospitalization for ischemic stroke, determined by Medicare claims data. Results During 2121 patient-years of follow-up, 94 patients were readmitted to the hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100 patient-years). As indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5, the 2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better than chance: c of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.71) for the scheme developed by the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) and c of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.76) for the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III scheme. However, with a c statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84), the CHADS( 2) index was the most accurate predictor of stroke. The stroke rate per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7) for each 1-point increase in the CHADS( 2) score: 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) for a score of 0; 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95% CI, 3.1-5.1) for 2; 5.9 (95% CI, 4.6-7.3) for 3; 8.5 (95% CI, 6.3-11.1) for 4; 12.5 (95% CI, 8.2-17.5) for 5; and 18.2 (95% CI, 10.5-27.4) for 6. Conclusion The 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke risk index, CHADS( 2), can quantify risk of stroke for patients who have AF and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.",

        "title": "Improved risk stratification of patients with atrial fibrillation: an integrated GARFIELD-AF tool for the prediction of mortality, stroke and bleed in patients with and without anticoagulation",
        "abstract": "Objectives To provide an accurate, web-based tool for stratifying patients with atrial fibrillation to facilitate decisions on the potential benefits/risks of anticoagulation, based on mortality, stroke and bleeding risks. Design The new tool was developed, using stepwise regression, for all and then applied to lower risk patients. C-statistics were compared with CHA2DS2-VASc using 30-fold cross-validation to control for overfitting. External validation was undertaken in an independent dataset, Outcome Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF). Participants Data from 39 898 patients enrolled in the prospective GARFIELD-AF registry provided the basis for deriving and validating an integrated risk tool to predict stroke risk, mortality and bleeding risk. Results The discriminatory value of the GARFIELD-AF risk model was superior to CHA2DS2-VASc for patients with or without anticoagulation. C-statistics (95%\u2009CI) for all-cause mortality, ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism and haemorrhagic stroke/major bleeding (treated patients) were: 0.77 (0.76 to 0.78), 0.69 (0.67 to 0.71) and 0.66 (0.62 to 0.69), respectively, for the GARFIELD-AF risk models, and 0.66 (0.64\u20130.67), 0.64 (0.61\u20130.66) and 0.64 (0.61\u20130.68), respectively, for CHA2DS2-VASc (or HAS-BLED for bleeding). In very low to low risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc 0 or 1 (men) and 1 or 2 (women)), the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED (for bleeding) scores offered weak discriminatory value for mortality, stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding. C-statistics for the GARFIELD-AF risk tool were 0.69 (0.64 to 0.75), 0.65 (0.56 to 0.73) and 0.60 (0.47 to 0.73) for each end point, respectively, versus 0.50 (0.45 to 0.55), 0.59 (0.50 to 0.67) and 0.55 (0.53 to 0.56) for CHA2DS2-VASc (or HAS-BLED for bleeding). Upon validation in the ORBIT-AF population, C-statistics showed that the GARFIELD-AF risk tool was effective for predicting 1-year all-cause mortality using the full and simplified model for all-cause mortality: C-statistics 0.75 (0.73 to 0.77) and 0.75 (0.73 to 0.77), respectively, and for predicting for any stroke or systemic embolism over 1\u2009year, C-statistics 0.68 (0.62 to 0.74). Conclusions Performance of the GARFIELD-AF risk tool was superior to CHA2DS2-VASc in predicting stroke and mortality and superior to HAS-BLED for bleeding, overall and in lower risk patients. The GARFIELD-AF tool has the potential for incorporation in routine electronic systems, and for the first time, permits simultaneous evaluation of ischaemic stroke, mortality and bleeding risks.

        "abstract": "Abstract Aims Most clinical risk stratification models are based on measurement at a single time-point rather than serial measurements. Artificial intelligence (AI) is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets. Using data from Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field (GARFIELD)-AF registry, a new AI model was developed for predicting clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients up to 1\u2009year based on sequential measures of prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within 30\u2009days of enrolment. Methods and results Patients with newly diagnosed AF who were treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and had at least three measurements of PT-INR taken over the first 30\u2009days after prescription were analysed. The AI model was constructed with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using PT-INR measurements within days 0\u201330 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31\u2013365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1\u20133; n\u2009=\u20093185). Accuracy of the AI model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4\u20135; n\u2009=\u20091523). The model\u2019s c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/SE, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively. Conclusions Using serial PT-INR values collected within 1\u2009month after starting VKA, the new AI model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12\u2009months thereafter. Serial PT-INR values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes.",

        "title": "How machine learning is impacting research in atrial fibrillation: implications for risk prediction and future management",
        "abstract": "Abstract There has been an exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) publications aimed at advancing our understanding of atrial fibrillation (AF), which has been mainly driven by the confluence of two factors: the advances in deep neural networks (DeepNNs) and the availability of large, open access databases. It is observed that most of the attention has centred on applying ML for dvsetecting AF, particularly using electrocardiograms (ECGs) as the main data modality. Nearly a third of them used DeepNNs to minimize or eliminate the need for transforming the ECGs to extract features prior to ML modelling; however, we did not observe a significant advantage in following this approach. We also found a fraction of studies using other data modalities, and others centred in aims, such as risk prediction, AF management, and others. From the clinical perspective, AI/ML can help expand the utility of AF detection and risk prediction, especially for patients with additional comorbidities. The use of AI/ML for detection and risk prediction into applications and smart mobile health (mHealth) technology would enable \u2018real time\u2019 dynamic assessments. AI/ML could also adapt to treatment changes over time, as well as incident risk factors. Incorporation of a dynamic AI/ML model into mHealth technology would facilitate \u2018real time\u2019 assessment of stroke risk, facilitating mitigation of modifiable risk factors (e.g. blood pressure control). Overall, this would lead to an improvement in clinical care for patients with AF.",

        "title": "Automatic screening of patients with atrial fibrillation from 24-h Holter recording using deep learning",
        "abstract": "Abstract Aims As the demand for atrial fibrillation (AF) screening increases, clinicians spend a significant amount of time identifying AF signals from massive amounts of data obtained during long-term dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. The identification of AF signals is subjective and depends on the experience of clinicians. However, experienced cardiologists are scarce. This study aimed to apply a deep learning-based algorithm to fully automate primary screening of patients with AF using 24-h Holter monitoring. Methods and results A deep learning model was developed to automatically detect AF episodes using RR intervals and was trained and evaluated on 23 621 (2297 AF and 21 324 non-AF) 24-h Holter recordings from 23 452 patients. Based on the AF episode detection results, patients with AF were automatically identified using the criterion of at least one AF episode lasting 6 min or longer. Performance was assessed on an independent real-world hospital-scenario test set (19 227 recordings) and a community-scenario test set (1299 recordings). For the two test sets, the model obtained high performance for the identification of patients with AF (sensitivity: 0.995 and 1.000; specificity: 0.985 and 0.997, respectively). Moreover, it obtained good and consistent performance (sensitivity: 1.000; specificity: 0.972) for an external public data set. Conclusion Using the criterion of at least one AF episode of 6 min or longer, the deep learning model can fully automatically screen patients for AF with high accuracy from long-term Holter monitoring data. This method may serve as a powerful and cost-effective tool for primary screening for AF.",

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia that requires accurate diagnosis and management, especially in long-term cardiac monitoring (LTCM) scenarios. Although ECG signal morphology can vary between patients and over time, traditional deep learning models often focus on generalized classification, potentially overlooking patient-specific differences. In this study, we developed a patient-adaptive beat-wise temporal transformer model aimed at enhancing AF classification performance using data from LTCM devices. The model introduces a symbolic token representing the ideal ECG morphology of a patient, enabling the transformer to effectively reference patient-specific information and capture temporal variations in ECG morphology. To evaluate the model\u2019s classification performance, we trained it on public databases and tested it on patch datasets. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.987, precision of 0.965, sensitivity of 0.979, specificity of 0.99, and an F1 score of 0.982 on the Patch A dataset. On the Patch B dataset, it attained an accuracy of 0.953, precision of 0.91, sensitivity of 0.971, specificity of 0.942, and an F1 score of 0.951. We anticipate that the proposed approach will be particularly beneficial for monitoring AF in real-world clinical settings, especially in LTCM scenarios.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it aims to improve atrial fibrillation classification performance in continuous long-term cardiac monitoring, a task that the source paper also addressed using deep learning. The proposed patient-adaptive beat-wise temporal transformer model can be seen as a sub-hypothesis, exploring new approaches to enhance AF classification performance."
