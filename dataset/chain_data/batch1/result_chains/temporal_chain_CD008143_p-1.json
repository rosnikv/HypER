        "abstract": "The University Group Diabetes Program is a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of various hypoglycemic agents on vascular complications in patients with asymptomatic adult-onset diabetes. Mortality and blood glucose levels were determined as well as certain nonfatal events for patients assigned to diet alone or to either of two insulin treatment regimens. Lower levels of blood glucose with mean values close to normoglycemia were achieved in the treatment group in which the insulin dosage was adjusted to achieve normoglycemia compared with the levels achieved in patients treated with diet alone or with a fixed dose of insulin. In spite of differences in blood glucose levels among the treatment groups, there were only minor differences in the occurrence of fatal or nonfatal events.",

        "title": "The Memphis and Atlanta Continuing Care Programs for Diabetes. II. Comparative Analyses of Demographic Characteristics, Treatment Methods, and Outcomes over a 9\u201310-year Follow-up Period",
        "abstract": "A total of 1467 black patients (911 in Atlanta, 556 in Memphis) were selected (1969\u201370) and followed longitudinally and prospectively until death (404 patients) or through 31 December 1979, when 676 were alive and active and 387 were lost to follow-up. The women/men ratio in each cohort was 4.7/1. Women had more excess body wt than men at maximum weight and at time of diagnosis. At selection, the Atlanta cohort was older (60.2 vs 56.8 yr), had diabetes longer (7.5 vs 5.2 yr), and had a higher initial mean random plasma glucose (MRPG) level (217 vs 195 mg/dl) than the Memphis cohort. The Atlanta cohort was on sulfonylurea/phenformin therapy, which was discontinued at entry. After 9\u201310 yr follow-up, the MRPG level was not significantly different from the initial level in either cohort, and the Atlanta cohort level was still significantly higher (221 vs 185 mg/dl). Mean weight loss after 9\u201310 yr follow-up was significantly greater in Atlanta (17.7 vs 6.8 lb). Those under good control in 1979, as indicated by random plasma glucose (RPG) of <150 mg/dl, lost more weight (means: Atlanta, 23 lb; Memphis, 8.7 lb) than those under poor control in 1979 (RPG > 300 mg/dl; means: Atlanta, 14.7 lb; Memphis, 1.3 lb). In the pooled alive and active cohorts (1979), 29.1% were under good control (RPG <150 mg/dl); 52.9%, fair control (RPG = 150\u2013300 mg/dl); and 18.0%, poor control (RPG > 300 mg/dl). Of the 639 alive and active patients, paired plasma glucose levels were < 200 mg/dl in 207 patients in 1969\u201370 and < 200 mg/dl in 322 in 1979.In 1979, 70 more patients on diet alone and 50 more on diet plus insulin had levels of <200 mg/dl, but five fewer on sulfonylurea/phenformin had <200 mg/dl. Observed/expected mortalities in the two cohorts were almost identical. Nine-year life table survival rates were related primarily to age at entry (73%) and secondarily to duration of diabetes (15%). The men/women death ratio for the cohorts was 1.58/1 (Atlanta, 1.54/1; Memphis, 1.66/1). Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were highest for those on insulin therapy (Atlanta, 1.62; Memphis, 1.78), intermediate for those on sulfonylurea /phenformin therapy (Memphis, 1.52), and lowest for those on diet therapy alone (Atlanta, 1.33; Memphis, 1.06). In Memphis, SMR for sulfonylureas was 1.50, for phenformin 1.56, and for sulfonylurea plus phenformin 1.56 (for all oral agent therapy, 1.52). Differences in SMR in the three groups in Memphis were not significant (P = 0.082). Mortality outcomes revealed by SMR appeared to relate to perceived severity of diabetes in each cohort and clinical assessment of effectiveness of each mode of therapy. This appeared to reflect differences in therapeutic strategy in that 70.9% in Atlanta and 25% in Memphis were treated with diet alone, 29.1% in Atlanta and 25% in Memphis were treated with diet and insulin, and 50.4% in Memphis were treated with diet and sulfonylurea/phenformin. Since therapy was not randomly assigned at inception, and since patients were not routinely continued on one mode of therapy for the duration of the study, it was not possible to calculate prospectively and longitudinally the relative risks of mortality for each therapeutic modality.",

        "title": "Glycemic Control and Complications in Type II Diabetes: Design of a feasibility trial",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine, after 1 yr of follow-up in type II diabetes patients, whether a statistically and clinically significant difference can be achieved in HbA1c between a standard therapy group and an intensively treated group, while maintaining HbA1c levels in both groups within ranges acceptable in regular community practice. Secondary objectives include assessment of patient adherence to protocol, side effects, and accuracy of data collection. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This is a prospective, randomized, controlled VA CS conducted with 151 patients at five VAMCs. Patients are males, age 40\u201369 yr, treated at entry with a maximum dose of sulfonylurea or with insulin, exhibiting an HbA1c level > 3 SDs above the normal mean (5.05 + 3 \u00d7 0.50 = > 6.55%). Standard control is achieved with insulin and intensive control with a step-up regimen including insulin alone or insulin/glipizide combinations. Education and management of cardiovascular risk factors are handled similarly in both groups. Primary macrovascular end points are nonfatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, amputation, and cardiovascular death. Primary microvascular end points are appearance and progression of retinopathy, documented by centrally read seven-field-stereo fundus photographs. Other measured indicators include resting and ambulatory ECGs, ventricular function (MUGA scan), serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels, plasma fibrinogen, nonsymptomatic peripheral vasculopathy, neuroautonomic status by heart-beat variation on Valsalva maneuver, and microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS This study may be the basis for a long-term trial, involving 1400 patients, to assess the long-term effects of metabolic control on macro- and microvascular end points.",

        "title": "Glycemic Control and Complications in Type II Diabetes",
        "abstract": "I n our opinion. the objectives of both he feasibility tnal and the study that is intended to ensue from it. as presented by Dr. Abraira et al. (VA CS Group) ( I). are highly relevant. If it is possible to achieve and maintain a statistically significant difference in HbA 1 between two otherwise comparable groups\u2014within the acceptable range of glycemic values. that is\u2014we can finally address the ultimate question of what target level of glycemic control can best he strived for in type II diabetes. In I989. our research group the Hoom Study) planned a very similar feasibility study. which is currently in the recniitment phase. lust as the VA CS Group. we also had concerns about the difference in intensity of care between the two treatment arms. possibly leading to a different degree of unintended effects in both arms during follow-up. which cannot always he measured precisely nor attributed to the level of glycemic control. If. during follow-up. a difference in both HbA\u201e and. e.g.. lipid levels or blood pressure should develop. we would not be able to ascertain whether the changes in these other risk factors would be attributable to glycemic level alone or partly to unintended differences in, e.g., dietary habits or physical fitness. So, if the main aim is to investigate the effect of glycemic control per se on macrovascular end points. it is necessary to make sure that any difference between the two groups after follow-up is attributable to the difference in level of glycemic control alone. As it is not feasible to mask determinant categories for both diabetes care professionals and patients. we are convinced that this problem cannot be fully overcome. The second problem to be addressed arises from the comparison of a well-defined intensive treatment strategy with a less-defined standard treatment that could change over time (not only in the course of the feasibility study. but also during an ensuing long-term trial). If a significant difference is established at one year, this does not guarantee maintenance of the difference over a longer period of time. For this to occur. a firm grip on both treatment arms is required. On one hand. it is pivotal to prevent so-called contamination. as it reduces the differences between the level of glycemic control in the groups: one may expect that the results of the standard treatment gradually come closer to those of the intensive treatment. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that glycemic control during standard treatment would not be good enough to reach even acceptable levels. In this latter case. the real question\u2014which level of glycemic control is necessary to prevent complications\u2014cannot be answered. Both scenarios illustrate the necessity of having strict control over both arms of the study. As a consequence of our view concerning these two potential problems. we have chosen a study design that differs from that of the VA CS Group on the following points: All participating type Il diabetic patients are treated by their own general practitioner according to the same standardized step-up regimen, in collaboration with a diabetes educator and our research center. where facilities for education and consultation are provided. After baseline measurements, patients are randomly assigned to two (equally intensive) treatment groups: the only contrast between these groups being the target values of glycemic control. which are a fasting capillary blood glucose level 5_6 mM or a fasting glucose 58 mNI (rounded numbers) for the intensive and standard groups. respectively. Participating general practitioners are asked to implement the next treatment step if the target has not been reached yet. and to refrain from taking any steps as soon as the assigned target values are reached. In theory. this design creates two equally well-defined, intensively treated groups. with the only difference being the glycemic values, both within the acceptable range. In conclusion, we think it is essential in studies like these to ensure that the degree of attention and education provided to the patients in the compared groups is fully similar, in order to provide a clear answer to an extremely important question.",
