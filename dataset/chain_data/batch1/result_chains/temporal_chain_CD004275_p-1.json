        "title": "Persistent acid reflux and symptoms in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitor therapy",
        "abstract": "Objectives To assess both acid gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) suppression in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) and the predictive value of symptoms. Design A prospective study of patients with Barrett's epithelium (> 3 cm, containing specialized intestinal metaplasia). Patients and methods Forty-five patients with Barrett's epithelium were recruited. Therapy was adjusted to omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Oesophageal manometry and 24 h pH studies were performed on treatment. Heartburn score was calculated before and after PPI dose adjustment. In patients with persisting acid reflux, omeprazole dose was increased to 20 mg three times daily and pH studies repeated. Adequacy of GOR suppression, assessed by pH monitoring, was related to heartburn score (0\u20133). Results Twenty of the 45 patients were symptomatic (mean score 1.9) on pre-study treatment (mainly omeprazole < 20 mg once daily); on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, only six patients remained symptomatic (mean score 1.6). Ten patients (22%) had persisting GOR on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (median % total time with pH < 4 was 8%). Abnormal nocturnal reflux was found in nine and abnormal daytime reflux in only four patients. Heartburn persisted in three of these 10 patients (30%). Those remaining symptomatic had more daytime acid reflux than the asymptomatic patients with persistent reflux (median percentage daytime at pH < 4 was 13.6% vs 0.6%, respectively; P < 0.01). By increasing the omeprazole dose to 20 mg three times daily, only three of the 10 had persistent acid reflux. Conclusions Persistent acid reflux on PPI therapy is common in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. Although nocturnal acid reflux is the most common finding, symptoms tended to occur in those with abnormal daytime reflux. Symptom resolution does not guarantee acid reflux control.",

        "title": "Acid Suppression and Chemoprevention in Barrett\u2019s Oesophagus",
        "abstract": "Barrett\u2019s oesophagus is a pre-malignant condition affecting 1% of the population in the West. Even though most patients with Barrett\u2019s will not develop oesophageal cancer, the incidence of adenocarcinoma is 0.45\u20131%, conferring a 40-fold increased risk compared with the general population. The risk rises to 40\u201350% within 5 years for those with high grade dysplasia. Currently, the only strategies available to diminish adenocarcinoma rates are surveillance endoscopy, endoscopic thermal or photodynamic ablation or tissue resection. The latter options are reserved for those who already have dysplasia. 10\u201350% of patients undergoing oesophagectomy for high grade dysplasia have been shown to have adenocarcinoma. Therefore approaches are needed to be that either remove or prevent stimuli propelling patients down the dysplasia-adenocarcinoma pathway. Both gastric acid and bile acids have been reported as potential insults involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett\u2019s oesophagus. This is thought to be mediated by a range of molecules including cyclo-oxygenase-2, c-myc and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Proton pump inhibitors not only suppress acid but also bile reflux, although symptom control is a poor guide as to adequacy of acid suppression. There is some evidence that proton pump inhibitors cause partial regression in Barrett\u2019s oesophagus length, although the data is contradictory. Proton pump inhibitors have also been shown to increase cell differentiation and apoptosis, reduce proliferation and COX-2 levels, with the supposition that this may diminish cancer risk. However this role in decreasing cancer risk has not yet been evaluated. The use of NSAIDS and aspirin, most likely via inhibition of COX-2 and other inflammatory pathways, is associated with a reduction of adenocarcinoma rates. Both PPIs and NSAIDs/Aspirin may therefore be potential chemopreventative agents but further studies are required to appraise their use.",

        "title": "Role of chemoprophylaxis with either NSAIDs or statins in patients with Barrett's esophagus.",
        "abstract": "The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a poor prognosis neoplasia, has risen dramatically in recent decades. Barrett's esophagus represents the best-known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma development. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs through cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and prostaglandin metabolism regulation could control cell proliferation, increase cell apoptosis and regulate the expression of growth and angiogenic factors. Statins can achieve equivalent effects through prenylation and subsequently control of cellular signaling cascades. At present, epidemiological studies are small and underpowered. Their data could not justify either medication as a chemo-preventive agent. Population based studies have shown a 43% reduction of the odds of developing an esophageal adenocarcinoma, leaving out or stating a 25% reduction in patients consuming non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a 50% reduction in those patients consuming aspirin. They have also stated a 19% reduction of esophageal cancer incidence when statins have been used. Observational studies have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could reduce the adenocarcinoma incidence in patients with Barrett's esophagus by 41%, while statins could reduce the risk by 43%. The cancer preventive effect has been enhanced in those patients taking a combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins (a 74% decrease). Observational data are equivocal concerning the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug subclasses. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs clearly have substantial potential for toxicity, while statins are rather safe drugs. In conclusion, both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins are promising chemopreventive agents and deserve further exploration with interventional studies. In the meanwhile, their use is justified only in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leads to the accumulation of bile-induced reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in esophageal tissues, causing inflammation and DNA damage. The progression sequence from healthy esophagus to GERD and eventually cancer is associated with a microbiome shift. Lactobacillus species are commensal organisms known for their probiotic and antioxidant characteristics in the healthy esophagus. This prompted us to investigate how Lactobacilli survive in a bile-rich environment during GERD, and to identify their interaction with the bile-injured esophageal cells. To model human reflux conditions, we exposed three Lactobacillus species (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum) to bile. All species were tolerant to bile possibly enabling them to colonize the esophageal epithelium under GERD conditions. Next, we assessed the antioxidant potential of Lactobacilli and role in bile injury repair: we measured bile-induced DNA damage using the ROS marker 8-oxo guanine and COMET assay. Lactobacillus addition after bile injury accelerated repair of bile-induced DNA damage through recruitment of pH2AX/RAD51 and reduced NF\u03baB-associated inflammation in esophageal cells. This study demonstrated anti-genotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of Lactobacilli, making them of significant interest in the prevention of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with GERD.",

        "abstract": "General Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women, with increasing incidence worldwide. Specific Background: Recent research has focused on the role of epigenetic changes in DNA damage, repair mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic effects of probiotics. Probiotics have shown promise in promoting tissue regeneration and DNA repair. Knowledge Gap: However, the precise impact of probiotics on DNA repair in cancer cells, specifically breast cancer cells, remains underexplored. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on DNA damage repair in AMJ13 Iraqi breast cancer cells and assess the cytotoxic effects of probiotics on these cells. Results: Using the comet assay, we found significant increases in DNA damage repair in AMJ13 cells treated with Lactobacillus plantarum (T1) and a combination of eight probiotic strains (T2). Exposure to T1 for 48 hours resulted in significant increases in tail DNA (P\u22640.001), head DNA (P\u22640.001), and tail moment (P<0.001), while T2 showed similar significant increases at 72 hours (P<0.05). Image analysis further supported the DNA repair potential of probiotics, as indicated by a small tail curve for treated cells. Novelty: This study provides novel insights into the therapeutic potential of probiotics in breast cancer treatment by demonstrating their capacity to enhance DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. Implications: The findings suggest that probiotic therapy may be a promising adjunct treatment in breast cancer, offering a new avenue for cancer management through the enhancement of DNA repair and reduction of DNA damage. \nHighlights: \n\u00a0 \n \nProbiotics significantly repaired DNA damage in breast cancer cells. \nT1 and T2 enhanced DNA repair within 48-72 hours. \nProbiotics offer potential as breast cancer adjunct therapy. \n \n\u00a0 \nKeywords: Breast cancer, probiotics, DNA repair, AMJ13 cells, cytotoxicity",
