        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) compared with placebo in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis 24 week, double bind, randomized, placebo controlled trial compared the response between MTX 7.5 mg/week or placebo in patients with active AS. The primary outcome measure was a composite index of improvement in 5 of the following scales: severity of morning stiffness, physical well being, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire for Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), and physician and patient global assessment of disease activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen patients received MTX and 18 placebo. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 24 weeks, 53% of patients in the MTX group had a treatment response, compared with 17% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). We observed significant improvements with MTX in physical well being (p = 0.009), BASDAI (p = 0.02), BASFI (p = 0.02), physician global assessment (p < 0.001), patient global assessment (p = 0.03), and HAQ-S (p = 0.02). In the adjusted analysis only MTX determined the improvement in the primary outcome. At the end of the trial, one patient with MTX withdrew due to a lack of compliance, and one with placebo due to a lack of efficacy. We did not observe significant differences in rates of side effects between the 2 groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMTX is safe and effective for patients with AS. Longterm studies are needed to evaluate the permanence of its benefit.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the potential therapeutic effect of methotrexate 20 mg given weekly as subcutaneous injections to 20 patients with ankylosing spondylitis refractory to non-steriodal antirheumatic drugs. Patients and methods: 20 patients with ankylosing spondylitis, a mean Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of 5.6 (range 4\u20139.3) and predominantly axial manifestations were treated with weekly 15 mg methotrexate subcutaneously for 4 weeks, which was then increased to 20 mg subcutaneously for the next 12 weeks. Clinical outcome assessments included, among others, BASDAI score physical function, spinal mobility, patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 global assessment (visual analogue scale), peripheral joint assessment, quality of life (Short Form 36) and C reactive protein. The primary end point of the study was a 20% improvement on the ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS 20) scale. Results: Using an intention-to-treat analysis, ASAS 20 was achieved in only 25% of patients. An ASAS 40 response was achieved in 10% of patients, and no patient reached an ASAS 70 response or the ASAS criteria for partial remission. For the mean BASDAI score, no change was observed between baseline and week 16 (baseline 5.6 v week 16, 5.6). No improvement was observed in any of the clinical parameters or C reactive protein, except a small but non-significant decrease in the number of swollen joints. Conclusions: In this open study, methotrexate did not show any benefit for axial manifestations in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis beyond the expected placebo response.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the short-term efficacy and safety of MTX in combination with infliximab compared with infliximab and placebo in the treatment of AS using MRI to monitor its effect.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThirty-eight subjects with active AS were randomized to receive MTX (MTX group) or placebo (placebo group) for 22 weeks. Both groups received infliximab for three infusions of 5 mg/kg at week 16, 18 and 22 and were followed up until week 30. MRI changes in the spine were assessed before and after infusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at week 16 was 5.4% in the MTX group vs 15.8% in the placebo group (P = 0.17). In the MTX group, 5.4, 31.6, 52.6 and 63.2% of patients vs 15.8, 21.1, 57.9 and 68.4% patients in the placebo group achieved ASAS20 at week 16, 18, 22, 30, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups at any time points. Likewise, the secondary outcome showed no significant differences between the two groups. MRI changes in 31 subjects showed an overall improvement of 36.4% but the changes were not significant between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination MTX with infliximab is as safe and as effective as infliximab monotherapy in the treatment of AS with a significant improvement in ASAS20 and in the different core sets in assessment. MRI improvements were also seen. However, there was no additional clinical or MRI improvement with the addition of MTX to infliximab in AS.",

        "title": "Anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy with infliximab in spondyloarthritides",
        "abstract": "For patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), medical therapy with TNF-blockers such as infliximab is increasingly considered the standard of care. This is especially true for patients who continue to have symptoms of active inflammation despite medication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at the maximum possible dose. Insufficient control of disease activity as indicated by pain, stiffness and decrease of function is the most common clinical reason for starting anti-TNF therapy. The most recent follow-up data show that anti-TNF therapy with infliximab is clinically efficacious and safe, not only on a short- but also on a long-term basis in AS. Furthermore, there is evidence that infliximab also works in other spondyloarthritides (SpA) such as SpA associated with psoriasis, undifferentiated (early axial) SpA and in SpA associated with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Its benefit has even been reported in cases of reactive SpA. Withdrawal of long-term therapy in AS patients usually leads to flares and relapses after several weeks to months, but single cases of lasting remission have been reported. Only limited data are available regarding the optimal dosage of infliximab in SpA. In clinical practice, selected patients might not need doses of infliximab higher than 3 mg/kg but most patients will need doses of 5 mg/kg. A definite influence on radiographic progression after long-term continuous treatment with infliximab compared with conventional therapy has not been proven so far. This is in contrast to function and mobility, which even slightly improve over time in the patients who are still on therapy after 5 or more years (slightly over 50% of the initially treated patients in clinical trials). Antibody formation may lead to loss of efficacy (secondary nonresponse). Serious adverse events on anti-TNF therapy have remained rare as these can be largely prevented by appropriate screening. The large benefits of anti-TNF therapy in AS seem to outweigh the few shortcomings of this treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To compare ASAS (Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis Response Criteria), 20 response patterns between anti-TNF biological agents in patients with ankylosing spondylitis by means of a mixed treatment comparison of different randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of biological therapies. Methods: A systematic review of literature was performed to identify a number of similarly designed double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis patients, conducted over an 18-year period. The end-point of interest was ASAS20 response criteria at 24 weeks. Results were analyzed simultaneously using Bayesian mixed treatment comparison techniques. Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) of ASAS20 response and associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The probability of being the best treatment was also reported. Results: Three RCTs were selected for data extraction and further analysis. By mean of MTC, all anti-TNF agents demonstrated to be more efficacious in inducing an ASAS20 response than placebo. Infliximab shows a 72% probability of being the best treatment of all. Adalimumab and etanercept show probabilities of 13% and 15%, respectively. No differences were observed when comparing directly an anti-TNF-\u03b1 agent against another. When compared with placebo, Infliximab increases the probability of response by \u223c7-times (OR\u2009=\u20096.8), Adalimumab by \u223c4-times (OR\u2009=\u20094.4), and Etanercept by 5-times (OR\u2009=\u20094.9). Differences in trials procedures, the use of a fixed-effect model, and the small number of trials included represent limitations of this study Conclusions: Even if the mixed treatment comparisons between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept did not show a statistically signi\ufb01cant difference, this analysis suggests that infliximab, compared to placebo, is expected to provide the highest rate of ASAS20 response in SA patients naive to biologic treatments.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate drug retention rates for various TNF inhibitors (TNFis) commonly prescribed to Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics registry (KOBIO; December 2012\u2013June 2016). Discontinuation was defined as switching or stopping the biologic agent. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and Cox's proportional hazard models were used for further analysis. The reasons for discontinuation of TNFis were also assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify possible predictors of discontinuation. Data from 1,005 patients with AS were analyzed with a median follow-up period of 14 months. Seventy-six percent of patients were first-line biologic users. Discontinuation of TNFis occurred in 24.2% (switching in 9.6%) of patients during follow-up. An estimate of the drug failure showed that the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for golimumab compared to etanercept was 0.441 (95% confidence interval: 0.277\u20130.703, p < 0.001). Reasons for discontinuation included lack of efficacy (32.6%), adverse events (23.6%), clinical improvement (11.2%), and others (32.6%). Predictors of discontinuation using a multivariate analysis were a shorter disease duration (HR: 0.973, p = 0.044) and being negative for HLA-B27 (HR: 1.623, p = 0.0093). In conclusion, few Korean patients with AS switched to other TNFis during their treatment. The drug retention rate for golimumab was higher than for other agents.",

Objectives To evaluate the utility of an innovative approach for early identification of patient profiles associated with long-term persistence of golimumab, a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) under real-world conditions. Design Retrospective non-interventional database analysis. Methods Kaplan-Meier curves of golimumab retention over 8 years from the BIOBADASER registry, overall and by indication, were analysed using a novel approach (a two-phase decay model) to identify the point at which the golimumab retention curve shifted from rapid (indicating high golimumab discontinuation rate) to slow decay (low discontinuation rate). Factors associated with golimumab retention at these time points were identified using Cox regression, and retention rates for different patient profiles were calculated. Results 885 patients were included. The golimumab retention curve shifted from rapid to slow decay at month 10 for the overall population (retention rate: 73.4%), at month 24 for RA patients (retention: 45.0%), and at month 8 for SpA, including axial SpA and PsA (81.6%). Factors associated with golimumab discontinuation at these early points were, overall, similar to those previously identified at year 8 (RA diagnosis, golimumab as second- or third-line of biological therapy, disease activity over the median and treatment with corticosteroids at golimumab initiation, advanced age [in RA], and female gender [in SpA]). Conclusion With this novel approach, the factors associated with long-term retention were identified in the initial period of rapid discontinuation of golimumab.",
