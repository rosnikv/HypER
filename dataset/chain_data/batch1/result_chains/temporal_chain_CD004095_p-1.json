        "abstract": "1. A prospective randomized study of two dietary regimens has been started in newly-diagnosed diabetics to determine their effect on circulating metabolites and on diabetic complications. 2. During the first year of treatment the fasting plasma glucose concentrations on both the low-carbohydrate diet and the high-carbohydrate, modified-fat (MF) diet showed a similar decrease. 3. Plasma cholesterol showed a sustained decrease only in patients recommended a MF diet. Transient changes in plasma triglyceride concentrations occurred in patients on both dietary regimens. 4. Increased plasma cholesterol levels are associated with atheromatous disease which is common in diabetics in Europe and North America. A MF diet may therefore have an advantage in that it lowers the plasma cholesterol as well as being effective in lowering the plasma glucose.",

        "title": "Dietary Patterns and Dietary Recommendations Achievement From Latin American College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the diet quality of different dietary patterns among college students from Latin American countries, including vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study was conducted including a non- probabilistic sample of university students from 10 countries. University students were invited to participate in the study through social network platforms. Participants were self-reported to have followed a specific dietary pattern; either the Prudent diet, Western diet, Ovo-dairy-vegetarian diet, Fish-vegetarian diet, Strict vegetarian diet (vegan) or other. The last three patterns (vegetarians and vegans) were grouped as following a plant-based diet. A self-assessment survey was used to evaluate healthy eating habits using a questionnaire with values between 1 (do not consume) and 5 (consume) for a total of 9\u201345 points (higher values represent better eating habits). Unhealthy habits were assessed with nine questions. A total of 4,809 students filled out the questionnaire, and the majority of them were females (73.7%). A high percentage have been in lockdown for more than 5 months and were in lockdown when the survey was released. 74.3% were self-reported to follow a prudent diet, while 11.4% reported following a western dietary pattern and 8.8% a plant-based diet. When compliance with healthy and unhealthy dietary habits was analyzed, although all groups had low compliance, the plant-based diet group (56.09 \u00b1 6.11) performed better than the Western diet group (48.03 \u00b1 5.99). The total diet quality score was significantly higher for plant-based diet followers, who also tended to better achieve the recommendations than omnivorous students, especially the ones following a western diet. These results present evidence that young adults such as college-aged students have unhealthy dietary habits. However, the ones who follow a plant-based diet such as vegetarians and vegans exhibit better scores and healthier dietary conducts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significant impact on people\u2019s behaviour and lifestyles. Limited research has been conducted on the impact of COVID-19 on Malaysian university students\u2019 lifestyle modifications. This study aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on dietary intake, sleeping patterns and physical activity levels among Malaysian university students. Methods A total of 261 university students were recruited. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data were collected. Dietary intake was assessed using PLifeCOVID-19 questionnaire, sleep quality was assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI) while physical activity level was assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Forms (IPAQ-SF). SPSS was used to perform statistical analysis. Results 30.7% of the participants adhered to the unhealthy dietary pattern, 48.7% had poor quality of sleep and 59.4% engaged in low physical activity levels during the pandemic. Unhealthy dietary pattern was significantly associated with a lower IPAQ category (p=0.013), and increased time spent sitting (p=0.027) during the pandemic. Participants being underweight before the pandemic (aOR=2.472, 95% CI=1.358\u20134.499), increased takeaway meal consumption (aOR=1.899, 95% CI=1.042\u20133.461), increased snacking between meals consumption (aOR=2.989, 95% CI=1.653\u20135.404) and engaged in a low level of physical activity during pandemic (aOR=1.935, 95% CI=1.028\u20133.643) were the predictors of unhealthy dietary pattern. Conclusions The university students\u2019 dietary intake, sleeping patterns, and physical activity levels were impacted in different ways during the pandemic. Strategies and interventions should be developed and implemented to improve the dietary intake and lifestyle of the students.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact on food security and nutrition, both in the short and long term. The influence on school-age children, adolescents, and young adults may be particularly significant and long-lasting.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dietary habits among school-age children, adolescents, and young adults worldwide.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nPubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched from inception to October 5, 2023.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nWe included observational studies published in English that reported dietary quality scores and dietary intake quantities during and before the COVID-19 pandemic among school-age children, adolescents, and young adults. We included a total of 22 cohort studies and 20 cross-sectional studies of high or moderate quality.\n\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nWe conducted a meta-analysis, expressing dietary quality scores and dietary intake quantities as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For studies with low heterogeneity, we used a fixed-effects model; otherwise, we applied a random-effects model. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was employed by 2 reviewers independently to evaluate methodological quality. The analysis indicated that, overall, juice intake increased (SMD\u2009=\u20090.12, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.20), while alcohol consumption reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.28, 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.08). However, the age-stratified results varied. Among school-age children, intake of fruit, dairy products, sugar, and juice increased. Adolescents showed an increase in meal frequency and vegetable intake. Young adults showed reduced carbohydrate and alcohol intakes, while protein and dairy product intakes increased, based on limited included studies.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDietary changes in school-age children from before to during the pandemic were mixed, while dietary behavior changes in adolescents and young adults tended to be more positive. Considering the lasting effects of negative dietary behaviors, attention should be given to addressing the increased sugar and juice intakes. It is also crucial that caregivers and researchers monitor whether positive dietary behaviors will rebound after returning to normal study and life.\n\n\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION\nPROSPERO registration no. CRD42023420923.",
