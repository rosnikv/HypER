Another possibility would be that aspirin was acting as a hapten, forming an antigen when combined with serum proteins. We have no clear evidence against this, but we would have to assume that at least one in five patients who suffered from chronic urticaria would also have such an allergy to aspirin. That aspirin in some way renders the skin in these patients more sensitive to histamine is suggested by the present report that intradermal histamine weals were larger after aspirin in these patients. In this connexion it is interesting that Juhlin and Rune (1962) have reported that the threshold to 48/80, a known histamine liberator, is lowered in acute urticaria. It has been stated in the past that aspirin sensitivity is specific to acetylsalicylic acid and does not extend to related compounds. In the present investigations similar reactions were obtained in most patients from sodium salicylatt and phenyl salicylate, and it would seem likely that it is the salicylic acid radical which is responsible for aspirin reactivity.",

        "title": "Interaction of aspirin with nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs in rats",
        "abstract": "SIR,-Clinical evaluation of new anti-arthritic drugs is difficult because of the unpredictable course of arthritis. It is even more difficult if an analgesic drug, such as a salicylate which also has anti-inflammatory activity (Smith & Smith, 1966), is administered at the same time. The difficulty in assessing the antiinflammatory activity of a nonsteroidal drug, while a mild analgesic (usually a salicylate) is permitted ad libitum, is reflected in some of the reports on the antiarthritic activity of indomethacin. While numerous investigators have reported indomethacin to be active against arthritis, Mainland (1967) and Donnelly, Lloyd & Campbell (1967) concluded that indomethacin was approximately as effective as placebo. Of the reports in which indomethacin was found to be active, only a few stated whether salicylates were permitted. In three of these, indomethacin was compared side-by-side with a salicylate (Pinals & Frank, 1967 ; Gaspardy, Gaspardy & others, 1966; Pitkeathly, Banerjee & others, 1966); in two other reports salicylates were gradually withdrawn in some cases (Rothermich, 1966; Englund, 1966); and in one study, free intake of aspirin was allowed (Smyth, 1965). Does the intake of salicylates mask the anti-inflammatory activity of antiinflammatory agents? In an attempt to answer this, two anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin and phenylbutazone, have been administered alone or in a combination with aspirin to rats in which oedema in the foot had been induced by carrageenan according to a slightly modified method of Winter, Risley & Nuss (1 962). Male Sprague-Dawley rats from A and E Farms, Altamont, N.Y., 125 g, were fasted overnight and indomethacin (Merck), 1.56 and 6.25 mg/kg, and phenylbutazone (Geigy), 25 and 100 mg/kg, were administered by stomach tube as suspensions in 1% gum tragacanth, 2 m1/100 g. Aspirin (Monsanto) was administered similarly at 100 mg/kg alone and at 100 mg/kg in combinations with each of the above doses of indomethacin or phenylbutazone. Control rats received only the gum tragacanth vehicle. Each single and combined dose was examined in duplicate experiments. One hr after administration of the drugs, 0.05 ml of 0.75% carrageenan (Viscarin standard) suspension was injected into the plantar tissue of the right hind foot of each rat. Three hr later, all rats were killed with chloroform and both feet were cut off at the tibio-talar joint, and weighed. The oedema was determined from the difference between weights of injected and non-injected feet, and the percent inhibition of oedema was calculated for each group. The significance of difference between the medicated groups and the control groups, and between the groups that received combined drugs and single drugs were calculated according to the t-test. The doses of all compounds were selected so that, in the event of additive inhibition of oedema, the maximal inhibition due to combined medication would not be expected to be greater than the limits of attainable inhibition in this test system. Table 1 shows that aspirin, 100 mg/kg, or indomethacin or phenylbutazone at two doses each resulted in significant (P I O . 0 1 ) inhibition of oedema in all experiments. The degree of inhibition by indomethacin or phenylbutazone was dose-related. Combined administration of aspirin with indomethacin resulted in inhibition of oedema that was not significantly different from that obtained with the same doses of either compound alone. Combined administration of aspirin with phenylbutazone resulted in slightly",

        "abstract": "ASPIRIN IS A WEAK ACID BOUND TO THE ALBUMIN MOLEcule in the serum. This statement regarding some simple properties of aspirin explains the basis of a number of potential interactions involving salicylates. Few, however, have been documented, possibly indicating that adverse effects arise only occasionally or, if there is an interaction, it either is of little concern to the physician or the reaction is considered an extension of the pathology rather than a reaction to the drugs. Of interest primarily as a toxological matter is the fact that salicylates are weak acids and the degree of ionization and lipid solubility may be markedly affected by urinary pH. Forced diuresis with alkalinizing solutions will enhance salicylate excretion. l e Perhaps related to change in urinary pH is the report that administration of a constant dose of salicylate during tapering of corticosteroid dose resulted in a significant increase in blood salicylate levels in four patients, but simultaneous administration of corticosteroid and salicylate resulted in a blood salicylate level lower than expected.

        "abstract": "Summary: The protein binding of salicylate in normal human serum has been measured by equilibrium dialysis and an isotope method. Addition of indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone and warfarin in concentrations of 10 mg/100 ml displace a significant amount of salicylate bound to albumin. By the same technique salicylate was found to increase the concentration of free warfarin and phenylbutazone. At concentrations of drugs achieved clinic-ally there is an increase in free salicylate of between 6 and 10% with ibuprofen and up to 20% with phenylbutazone. Although this is a static in vitro study and therefore not directly applicable in vivo it is suggested that there is a need for the potential enhancement of therapeutic and toxic effects of anti-inflammatory drug combinations to be more widely appreciated.",

        "abstract": "Only some of the areas of drug interactions of relevance to those treating rheumatic diseases have been mentioned and there are still enormous gaps in our knowledge. It is likely that some potential areas of danger have been over-emphasised, being based on speculation rather than real data or purely animal experiments using non-clinical doses of drugs. We are learning how certain drugs can stimulate or inhibit the metabolism of other drugs through effects on liver enzymes systems. For example, the metabolism of corticosteroids is induced by phenylbutazone (and also by phenobarbital and phenytoin). The patient with active rheumatoid arthritis with a low serum albumin would be unusually susceptible to changes induced by combinations of highly protein-bound anti-inflammatory drugs. Finally, although drug interactions are responsible for adverse effects it has been suggested that a more frequent cause of therapeutic failure is not drug interactions but the increase in the number of drug defaulters when more than one drug is prescribed.",
