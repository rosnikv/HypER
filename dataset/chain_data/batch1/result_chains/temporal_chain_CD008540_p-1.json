        "title": "Impact of Metabolic Control of Diabetes During Pregnancy on Neonatal Hypocalcemia: A Randomized Study",
        "abstract": "Objective: To test the hypothesis that strict control of diabetes during pregnancy can reduce the risk for neonatal hypocalcemia in infants of diabetic mothers. Methods: One hundred thirty\u2010seven pregnant women with insulin\u2010dependent diabetes enrolled before 9 weeks' gestation were randomized to one of two treatment groups. In 68 subjects, the goals were fasting blood glucose level less than 4.44 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) and 1.5\u2010hour postprandial blood glucose level less than 6.66 mmol/L (120 mg/dL) (strict control), whereas in 69 the goals were fasting blood glucose level less than 5.55 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and 1.5\u2010hour postprandial glucose level less than 7.77 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) (customary control). Results: Infants in the strict control group had a significantly lower rate of hypocalcemia (mean calcium less than 8.0 mg/dL in term infants and less than 7.0 mg/dL in preterm infants) than infants in the customary control group (17.6 versus 31.9%; P < .05). Using logistic regression analysis and after adjusting for the effects of gestational age, asphyxia, and White class on hypocalcemia, the difference between groups remained significant. The lowest infant serum calcium concentration correlated significantly with maternal glycohemoglobin A1 concentration at delivery (P = .03), gestational age (P = .0001), and the lowest serum magnesium concentration (P = .0001). Conclusion: Strict management of diabetes in pregnancy is associated with a reduction in the rate of neonatal hypocalcemia. (Obstet Gynecol 1994;83:918\u201022)",

        "title": "Pathogenesis of Fetal Hypomineralization in Diabetic Rats: Evidence for Delayed Bone Maturation",
        "abstract": "There is some evidence that fetuses of diabetic rats (FDR) are hypomineralized. To explore the pathogenic role of decreased maternal duodenal Ca absorption, fetal hypotrophy, and decreased placental calbindin-D9K, respectively, spontaneously diabetic rats fed a 1.0% Ca diet were compared with diabetic rats treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] (15 ng/100 g) during week 3 of pregnancy, which restored duodenal calbindin-D9K concentrations to normal; with nondiabetic rats semistarved during week 3, which resulted in similar fetal hypertrophy; and with nondiabetic rats fed high cation diets (1.5% Ca-1.5% Sr and 1.5% Ca-3.5% Sr) during week 3, the latter of which repressed duodenal and placental calbindin-D9K toward concentrations measured in diabetic rats. In addition, fetal tibiae were studied histologically. Ca content was lower in 21.5-d-old FDR than in control fetuses. FDR had lower plasma osteocalcin (OC) levels and, on histomorphometry, increased hypertrophic cartilage width, indicating retarded bone maturation. Maternal 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment did not change Ca content and hypertrophic cartilage width in FDR. Fetuses of semistarved rats had plasma OC levels and hypertrophic cartilage width comparable to those of control fetuses. Fetuses of rats fed the 1.5% Ca-3.5% Sr diet were more severely hypomineralized than FDR but had higher plasma OC than both FDR and control fetuses, compatible with fetal Ca deficiency. Whereas diabetic placentas showed weak but homogeneous staining of calbindin-D9K in the labyrinth on immunohistology, degenerative zones were present in placentas of rats fed the 1.5% Ca-3.5% Sr diet. Thus, there is no mineralization defect in FDR caused by disturbed maternal duodenal Ca absorption or transplacental Ca transport, but a delay in bone maturation that is unexplained by their lower body weight.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the pathogenesis of fetal hypomineralization in diabetic rats, which is related to the topic of diabetes management during pregnancy, as discussed in the source paper. However, the paper does not directly build upon or depend on the findings of the source paper, which focused on the impact of metabolic control of diabetes during pregnancy on neonatal hypocalcemia. Instead, it presents a new angle on the topic, using an animal model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of fetal hypomineralization."

        "abstract": "Experimental diabetes in rats is associated with excessive electrolyte loss in the urine, which is further accentuated by pregnancy, particularly of Ca. Supplementation with essential fatty acids and antioxidants has proven bene\ufb01cial in treating several types of complications, including nephropathy. The present study investigated the e \ufb00 ect of (cid:1) -linoleic acid (GLA; 500 mg/kg per day; group DG) and ascorbate (290 mg/kg per day; group DA), alone and in combination (group DGA), as well as ascorbyl-GLA (790 mg/kg per day; group DASG), on urinary electrolyte output and skeletal composition in pregnant streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Urine was collected in metabolism cages before and throughout pregnancy. Diabetic rats (DP) increased their urine volume as compared with control (CP) throughout the experiment, reaching an output of more than 13 times that of the control group by the end of pregnancy (CP 24 (cid:1) 4, DP 316 (cid:1) 21, DG 223 (cid:1) 21, DA 221 (cid:1) 14, DASG 163 (cid:1) 17, DGA 220 (cid:1) 19 ml urine/24 h). Concomitant with increased urine volume was a reduction of urinary Na (CP 47 (cid:1) 14, DP 22 5 mmol/l), K 210 34, DP 31 1 mmol/l) and Mg (CP 14 1, DP 3\u00b78 (cid:1) 0\u00b72 mmol/l) concentration, but not of Ca concentration (CP 5\u00b74 (cid:1) 1\u00b75, DP 6\u00b73 (cid:1) 0\u00b76 mmol/l), and hence total Ca loss was relatively most severe. All the treatments reduced urine volume with no e \ufb00 ects on electrolyte concentration as compared with DP, with no signi\ufb01cant di \ufb00 erence between the treatments. A reduced bone size and bone Ca content was partially ameliorated by the diet supplementation. We have concluded that GLA and ascorbate, alone or in combination, prevent urinary electrolyte loss in pregnant rats and do so by reducing urine production.",

        "title": "Capybara Oil Improves Renal Pathophysiology and Inflammation in Obese Mice",
        "abstract": "Obesity is an inflammatory disease associated with secondary diseases such as kidney disease, which can cause lipotoxicity, inflammation and loss of organ function. Polyunsaturated fatty acids act in the production of lipid mediators and have anti-inflammatory characteristics. In this work, the objective was to evaluate renal histopathology in obese mice and the effects of treatment with capybara oil (CO) (5000 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks). Parameters such as body mass, lipid profile, systolic blood pressure, urinary creatinine and protein excretion, structure and ultrastructure of the renal cortex, fibrosis, tissue inflammation and oxidative stress were analyzed. CO treatment in obese mice showed improvement in the lipid profile and reduction in systolic blood pressure levels, in addition to beneficial remodeling of the renal cortex. Our data demonstrated that CO decreased inflammation, oxidative stress and renal fibrosis, as evidenced by quantifying the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, CAT, SOD, \u03b1-SMA and TGF-\u03b2. Although treatment with CO did not show improvement in renal function, ultrastructural analysis showed that the treatment was effective in restoring podocytes and pedicels, with restructuring of the glomerular filtration barrier. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that treatment with CO is effective in reducing kidney damage, being considered a promising treatment for obesity.",

        "title": "Beneficial Effects of Capybara Oil Supplementation on Steatosis and Liver Apoptosis in Obese Mice",
        "abstract": "Obesity is a complex chronic disease characterized by excess body fat (adipose) that is harmful to health and has been a major global health problem. It may be associated with several diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are lipid mediators that have anti-inflammatory characteristics and can be found in animals and plants, with capybara oil (CO) being a promising source. So, we intend to evaluate the hepatic pathophysiological alterations in C57Bl/6 mice with NAFLD, caused by obesity, and the possible beneficial effects of OC in the treatment of this disease. Eighteen 3-month-old male C57Bl/6 mice received a control or high-fat diet for 18\u2009weeks. From the 15th to the 18th week, the animals received treatment\u2014through orogastric gavage\u2014with placebo or free capybara oil (5\u2009g/kg). Parameters inherent to body mass, glucose tolerance, evaluation of liver enzymes, percentage of hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, the process of cell death with the apoptotic biomarkers (Bax, Bcl2, and Cytochrome C), and the ultrastructure of hepatocytes were analyzed. Even though the treatment with CO was not able to disassemble the effects on the physiological parameters, it proved to be beneficial in reversing the morphological and ultrastructural damage present in the hepatocytes. Thus, demonstrating that CO has beneficial effects in reducing steatosis and the apoptotic pathway, it is a promising treatment for NAFLD.",
