        "abstract": "This chapter summarizes the landmark Veterans Affairs Cooperative Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Study in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that randomized men to receive terazosin, the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) finasteride, their combination, or placebo. This study demonstrated the benefit of alpha-blocker therapy for men with BPH symptoms but did not demonstrate an added benefit of combination alpha-blocker and 5-ARI therapy.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the efficacy of terazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic-antagonist similar to doxazosin, in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the previous findings regarding alpha 1-adrenergic-antagonists, thus using the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis."
