        "title": "Renal and hemodynamic effects of intravenous fenoldopam versus nitroprusside in severe hypertension.",
        "abstract": "The renal and hemodynamic effects of intravenously administered fenoldopam mesylate, a novel dopamine-1 receptor agonist, were compared with those of sodium nitroprusside in 28 patients (18 male; 26 black, two white; average age, 49 +/- 3 years) with an average blood pressure of 219/137 mm Hg, most of whom presented with acute target organ damage. Fenoldopam and nitroprusside lowered blood pressure safely to an average pressure of 176/105 mm Hg; highly significant dose-response relations were found for the 13 patients receiving fenoldopam and the 15 receiving nitroprusside. Volume and sodium, potassium, and creatinine concentrations were measured in freely voided urine specimens both before and during intravenous therapy. In the fenoldopam-treated patients, there were significant increases in urinary flow (92 +/- 21 to 168 +/- 37 ml/hr, p less than 0.003), sodium excretion (227 +/- 73 to 335 +/- 90 mu eq/min, p less than 0.001), and creatinine clearance (70 +/- 11 to 93 +/- 13 ml/hr, p less than 0.003). In the nitroprusside-treated group, however, all these parameters decreased, but not significantly. For direct comparison of the two agents, the increments in urinary flow rate (+76 +/- 20 vs. -16 +/- 15 ml/hr, fenoldopam vs. nitroprusside), sodium excretion (+109 +/- 28 vs. -39 +/- 28 mu eq/min), and creatinine clearance (+23 +/- 6 vs. -11 +/- 7 ml/min) were significantly greater (p less than 0.001 for each) in the fenoldopam-treated group. Significant differences were also obtained when these parameters were calculated as percentage increase over baseline. Fenoldopam and nitroprusside are effective therapies for severe, accelerated, or malignant hypertension, but fenoldopam had additional salutary renal effects in these patients.",

        "title": "Cardiovascular Function During Induced Hypotension by Fenoldopam or Sodium Nitroprusside in Anesthetized Dogs",
        "abstract": "Fenoldopam, a selective dopamine1 receptor agonist, has been recommended for induced hypotension because it effectively lowers arterial blood pressure and improves renal perfusion. We examined cardiovascular functions during hypotension induced by fenoldopam or sodium nitroprusside. In eight halothane-anesthetized dogs, the left ventricle (LV) was instrumented with pressure and ultrasonic dimension transducers for the assessment of LV contractility using the analysis of the pressure-diameter relationship. Blood flow distribution was measured by radioactive microspheres. Doses of fenoldopam and nitroprusside were titrated to reduce mean arterial blood pressure to 60 mm Hg. After 40 min of hypotension, fenoldopam and nitroprusside caused similar increases in heart rate (17% \u00b1 4% vs 19% \u00b1 10%, respectively) and decreases in systemic vascular resistance (\u221224% \u00b1 5% vs-27% \u00b1 4%). Hypotension induced by fenoldopam was associated with higher LV end-diastolic pressure (4.4 \u00b1 0.6 vs 2.5 \u00b1 1.1 mm Hg) and end-systolic meridional wall stress (33.0 \u00b1 4.3 vs 17.8 \u00b1 2.1 g/cm2) when compared with nitroprusside. There were no significant changes in cardiac output and cardiac contractility as expressed by the slope (Ees) of the LV end-systolic pressure-diameter relationship, velocity of shortening of the diameter, and percentage of wall thickening of the LV. In contrast to nitroprusside, which decreased renal blood flow from 197 \u00b1 19 to 163 \u00b1 15 mL/min, renal blood flow increased during fenoldopam-induced hypotension from 187 \u00b1 20 to 239 \u00b1 18 mL/min. The increase in renal perfusion was similar in upper, middle, and lower regions of the kidney; however, it was more in the medulla compared with the cortex (37% \u00b1 17% vs 25% \u00b1 7%). Both fenoldopam and nitroprusside decreased splenic blood flow, but neither altered flow to the brain, skin, or myocardium. Muscle and hepatic arterial blood flow were significantly less with fenoldopam than with nitroprusside. Fenoldopam was associated with significantly larger increases in plasma renin activity compared with nitroprusside. The results of this study show an increase in renal blood flow during fenoldopam infusion that may be of advantage particularly when renal hypoperfusion should be avoided.",

        "abstract": "We studied the effects of hydralazine, nicardipine, nitroglycerin, and fenoldopam (a dopamine D1-agonist) on isolated human umbilical arteries (HUA) from patients classified as normotensive and with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Umbilical artery rings were contracted with the thromboxane A2 analog (U46619; 10\u22128 M) and then exposed to cumulative concentrations of fenoldopam, hydralazine, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin. Second, rings were preexposed to prazosin (10\u22125 M), phenoxybenzamine (10\u22125 M), or none, and the constriction responses to increasing doses of fenoldopam or dopamine were recorded. Nitroglycerin, hydralazine, and nicardipine produced concentration-dependent relaxation of U46619-preconstricted HUA segments from normotensive and PIH patients. Fenoldopam and dopamine induced umbilical artery constriction in both normal and PIH rings at concentrations \u226510\u22125 M and \u226510\u22123 M, respectively. Phenoxybenzamine, but not prazosin, pretreatment irreversibly abolished fenoldopam-induced contraction. In this in vitro study, nitroglycerin was the most potent vasodilator of the HUA constricted with U46619, followed by nicardipine and hydralazine. However, fenoldopam constricted HUA rings only at supratherapeutic concentrations. No significant differences of vascular responses to fenoldopam (P = 0.3534), nitroglycerin (P = 0.7416), nicardipine (P = 0.0615), and hydralazine (P = 0.5514) between rings from normotensive or hypertensive pregnant patients were shown.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHypertension is a major problem in the perioperative period of cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. The vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in modulating vascular tone by producing vasodilators as well as vasoconstrictors. Thromboxane A2 (TxA2), a prototypical vasoconstrictor produced by endothelium and platelets, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and subsequent ischaemic events. Although multiple drugs are currently available to treat perioperative hypertension, there is a paucity of data comparing these agents. Therefore, we examined the in vitro vascular effects of commonly used antihypertensive drugs on human internal mammary artery (IMA) segments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRelaxation responses to adenosine (a nucleoside), enalaprilat (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme), fenoldopam (a D1-dopamine receptor agonist), hydralazine, labetalol (an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker), nicardipine (a calcium channel blocker), nicorandil (K(+)-ATP channel opener), nitroglycerin (GTN, a nitrosovasodilator), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitrosovasodilator) were studied in IMA segments pre-contracted with the TxA2 analogue (U46619, 1.0 x 10(-8) M). Effects of labetalol were also studied in IMA segments pre-contracted with norepinephrine (1.0 x 10(-6) M). All drugs were added in a cumulative fashion (range 10(-10) to 10(-3) M).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll agents in the current study, with the exception of enalaprilat, dilated the IMA segments pre-contracted with U46619. Only GTN and SNP induced a complete (90-100%) relaxation. The order of efficacy of the in vitro relaxation was as follows: SNP, GTN, nicardipine, nicorandil, fenoldopam, hydralazine, adenosine, and labetalol. The potency was in the order of GTN, SNP, fenoldopam, nicorandil, hydralazine, adenosine, and nicardipine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVarious antihypertensive agents are effective in attenuating U46619-induced IMA vasoconstriction, but the efficacy and potency differ. The in vitro vasodilation may not be simply extrapolated to the clinical efficacy or outcome of each antihypertensive therapy; however, our data provide additional grounds for the choice of antihypertensive medication. Further clinical studies are needed to help to fully elucidate the use of different antihypertensive agents and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Levosimendan, an inotropic drug that enhances myocardial contractility through myofilment calcium sensitazion, induces peripheral vasodilation via opening ATP-dependent K+ channels. It is unknown whether this drug can be used for the treatment of perioperative vasospasm of arterial conduits used for coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: We investigated the effects of levosimendan on human internal mammary artery (IMA) specimens taken from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The rings were carefully prepared and placed between two wire hooks in organ bath chambers and then constricted submaximally with norepinephrine and thromboxane A2 analog (U46619). Nitroglycerin, milrinone, and levosimendan were separately added in a cumulative fashion and concentration response curves for relaxation were constructed. In parallel experiments, the response to levosimendan was evaluated on rings with and without functional endothelium. Levosimendan prevention of norepinephrine-induced contraction was also estimated. RESULTS: Nitroglycerin, milrinone, and levosimendan completely reversed the contraction of the IMA segments induced by U46619 and norepinephrine. Levosimendan produced a potent, concentration-dependent preventive effect on the norepinephrine-induced contraction of IMA. The responses to levosimendan were similar in preparations with or without endothelium.",

        "title": "Inoprotection: The Perioperative Role of Levosimendan",
        "abstract": "Levosimendan is emerging as a novel cardioprotective inotrope. Levosimendan augments myocardial contractility by sensitising contractile myofilaments to calcium without increasing myosin adenosine triphosphatase activity or oxygen consumption. Levosimendan activates cellular adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels, a mechanism which is postulated to protect cells from ischaemia in a manner similar to ischaemic preconditioning. Levosimendan may therefore protect the ischaemic myocardium during ischaemia-reperfusion as well as improve the contractile function of the heart. Adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channel activation by levosimendan may also be protective in other tissues, such as coronary vascular endothelium, kidney and brain. Clinical trials in patients with decompensated heart failure and myocardial ischaemia show levosimendan to improve haemodynamic performance and potentially improve survival. This paper reviews the known pharmacology of levosimendan, the clinical experience with the drug to date and the potential use of levosimendan as a cardioprotective agent during surgery.",

        "abstract": "Levosimendan is a novel inodilator agent, which enhances myocardial performance without substantial changes in oxygen consumption. The combination of positive inotropic and vasodilator effects of levosimendan relates to its Ca2+-sensitizing and K+ channel opening effects. Levosimendan is one of the best documented pharmacological agents used in the management of acute heart failure syndromes. Interest in levosimendan has recently been renewed owing to its potential in supporting cardiac function in patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiogenic or septic shock. It has been also demonstrated that levosimendan can be used as a bridge therapy for the perioperative phase of cardiac surgery. The ability of levosimendan to improve myocardial function without substantially increasing oxygen consumption may appear paradoxical but is indeed possible via improved efficacy, not only with regard to the effects on the contractile apparatus of the cardiomyocytes but also when its composite hemodynamic effects are considered. The energy balance equation, therefore, should take into account the effect of levosimendan on all energy-consuming and energy-producing paths. Moreover, levosimendan-evoked KATP channel opening may possess favorable effects on mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis conferring cardioprotection during ischemic insults.",

        "title": "Absence of mitochondrial activation during levosimendan inotropic action in perfused paced guinea pig hearts as demonstrated by modular control analysis.",
        "abstract": "Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer developed for the treatment of heart failure. It increases contractile force by enhancing the sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium. Besides this sensitizing effect, the drug has also been reported to show some inhibitory action on phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). The inotropic effects of levosimendan have been studied on guinea pig paced perfused hearts by using modular control analysis (MoCA) (Diolez P, Deschodt-Arsac V, Raffard G, Simon C, Santos PD, Thiaudiere E, Arsac L, Franconi JM. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 293: R13-R19, 2007.), an integrative approach of heart energetics using noninvasive (31)P NMR. The aim was to evaluate quantitatively the respective effects of this drug on energy supply and demand modules. Under our experimental conditions, 0.7 muM levosimendan induced a 45% increase in paced heart output associated with a 7% decrease in phosphocreatine and a negligible increase in oxygen consumption. Because MoCA allows in situ study of the internal regulations in intact beating heart energetics, it was applied to describe quantitatively by which routes levosimendan exerts its inotropic action. MoCA demonstrated the absence of any significant effect of the drug on the supply module, which is responsible for the lower increase in oxygen consumption, compared with epinephrine, which increases the ratio between myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac contraction. This result evidences that, under our conditions, a possible effect of levosimendan on PDE3 activity and/or intracellular calcium remains very low on mitochondrial activity and insignificant on integrated cardiac energetics. Thus, levosimendan inotropic effect on guinea pig heart depends almost entirely on the calcium-sensitizing properties leading to myofilament activation and the concomitant activation of energy supply by the decrease in PCr, therefore improving energetic efficiency of contraction.",

        "abstract": "Bupivacaine is a widely used anaesthetic injected locally in clinical practice for short-term neurotransmission blockade. However, persistent side effects on mitochondrial integrity have been demonstrated in muscle parts surrounding the injection site. We use the precise language of metabolic control analysis in the present study to describe in vivo consequences of bupivacaine injection on muscle energetics during contraction. We define a model system of muscle energy metabolism in rats with a sciatic nerve catheter that consists of two modules of reactions, ATP/PCr (phosphocreatine) supply and ATP/PCr demand, linked by the common intermediate PCr detected in vivo by (31)P-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Measured system variables were [PCr] (intermediate) and contraction (flux). We first applied regulation analysis to quantify acute effects of bupivacaine. After bupivacaine injection, contraction decreased by 15.7% and, concomitantly, [PCr] increased by 11.2%. The regulation analysis quantified that demand was in fact directly inhibited by bupivacaine (-21.3%), causing an increase in PCr. This increase in PCr indirectly reduced mitochondrial activity (-22.4%). Globally, the decrease in contractions was almost fully explained by inhibition of demand (-17.0%) without significant effect through energy supply. Finally we applied elasticity analysis to quantify chronic effects of bupivacaine iterative injections. The absence of a difference in elasticities obtained in treated rats when compared with healthy control rats clearly shows the absence of dysfunction in energetic control of muscle contraction energetics. The present study constitutes the first and direct evidence that bupivacaine myotoxicity is compromised by other factors during contraction in vivo, and illustrates the interest of modular approaches to appreciate simple rules governing bioenergetic systems when affected by drugs.",

This acupuncture-like effect was demonstrated when the fibres began to grow after complete fibre degradation, synchronous inflammation, myoblast and myotube formation. Neonatal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA1b) was first detected in this system. The neonatal, fast and slow SERCA isoforms displayed consequent changes with innervation and differentiation, recapitulating events in muscle development. In vivo transfection of myotubes with plasmids expressing dominant negative Ras or a calcineurin inhibitor peptide (Cain/cabin) proved that expression of the slow myosin heavy chain and the slow muscle type SERCA2a are differentially regulated. In vivo transfection of a few nuclei of myotubes with dnRas or SERCA1b shRNA stimulated fibre size growth in the whole regenerating muscle but only until the full size had been reached. Growth stimulation by Ras and SERCA1b antisense was abolished by co-transfection of Cain or with perimuscular injection of IL4 antibody.
