        "title": "Endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis.",
        "abstract": "Treatment of chronic pancreatitis has been exclusively surgical for a long time. Recently, endoscopic therapy has become widely used as a primary therapeutic option. Initially performed for drainage of pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts, endoscopic treatments were adapted to biliary and pancreatic ducts stenosis. Pancreatic sphincterotomy which allows access to pancreatic ducts was firstly reported. Secondly, endoscopic methods of stenting, dilatation, and stones extraction of the bile ducts were applied to pancreatic ducts. Nevertheless, new improvements were necessary: failures of pancreatic stone extraction justified the development of extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy; dilatation of pancreatic stenosis was improved by forage with a new device; moreover endosonography allowed guidance for celiac block, gastro-cystostomy, duodeno-cystostomy and pancreatico-gastrostomy. Although endoscopic treatments are more and more frequently accepted, indications are still debated.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the development of endoscopic therapy for chronic pancreatitis, which is related to the source paper's topic of endoscopic versus surgical drainage of the pancreatic duct in chronic pancreatitis. However, it does not directly build upon or depend on the source paper's findings."

        "title": "Application of per oral cholangiopancreatoscopy in pancreatobiliary diseases",
        "abstract": "Pancreaticobiliary ductal diseases are largely investigated by indirect imaging techniques. Therefore, the pathology of up to 30% of cases remains undetermined. Cholangiopancreatoscopy allows direct visualization of ductal abnormalities with the ability to sample tissue and deliver a number of endotherapies. The technique can be broadly categorized into either two\u2010operator or single\u2010operator systems. Both systems provide important diagnostic information in the investigation of undetermined biliary or pancreatic strictures, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia, occult ductal malignant changes in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and occult intraductal stones in patients with complex biliary stone diseases. Therapeutically, cholangiopancreatoscopy\u2010guided endotherapies provide a highly effective and safe alternative to surgery for patients with difficult extrahepatic and intrahepatic ductal stones that are not amenable to conventional endoscopic extraction by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The clinical application of cholangiopancreatoscopy, however, will be limited unless the technology is further refined to improve its durability, image quality, therapeutic capability and technical feasibility.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper, as it explores a new technique (per oral cholangiopancreatoscopy) for diagnosing and treating pancreatobiliary diseases, building on the source paper's discussion of endoscopic treatments for chronic pancreatitis."
