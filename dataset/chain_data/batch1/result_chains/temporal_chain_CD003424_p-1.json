        "title": "Effect of cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate on pancreatic replacement therapy in cystic fibrosis.",
        "abstract": "Fifteen patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency were studied during four randomised seven day treatment periods in which they received only pancreatic supplement (Pancrelipase, 27 capsules per day) or supplement plus cimetidine (20 mg/kg body weight/24 h) or sodium bicarbonate (15 g/m2/24 h) alone or in combination. Dietary intake was not fixed but was restricted to foods of known fat and nitrogen content from which daily intakes could be computed. Faecal fat and nitrogen were calculated as g/24 h and percentage of intake. Addition of either cimetidine or bicarbonate resulted in significant improvement in fat and nitrogen excretion, which was not greater with the combination of both drugs. Cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate in these doses are therefore sufficient to produce maximal improvement in digestive activity of pancreatic supplements. Fat excretion per gram of intake fell with cimetidine and bicarbonate from 12 times the normal level, to normal, in patients consuming less than 120 g fat daily. Above this intake the dose of pancreatic supplement appeared to be inadequate. Faecal nitrogen excretion increased with nitrogen intake in all four periods, but, in contrast with fat excretion, the response to cimetidine and bicarbonate was not affected by the level of intake. Dietary intake appears to be a significant factor in determining the faecal output of fat and nitrogen in patients with pancreatic insufficiency and should be considered when determining the optimum amount of pancreatic supplementation.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic lipase and colipase secretion was assessed in 64 patients with pancreatic disease, 24 of whom had steatorrhea, and in 14 control subjects. A wide range of lipase and colipase secretion was seen in patients both with and without steatorrhea. Considerable loss of pancreatic lipase and colipase secretion had to occur before steatorrhea developed, as the highest hourly secretion of lipase and colipase in this group of patients was less than 4% and less than 2%, respectively, of the lowest values recorded in normal subjects. Colipase and lipase outputs were very strongly correlated (r = 0.96) throughout the range of pancreatic function. Lipase was always unsaturated with respect to colipase, but in only a limited number of patients with relatively low pancreatic secretion was the degree of unsaturation greater than 2 standard deviations below the mean. The importance of low saturation or low colipase secretion was evident in a group of 11 patients with a narrow range of lipase secretion in a transitional zone between secretion rates associated with steatorrhea and with normal fat excretion. In this group, 7 patients were identified in whom colipase deficiency appeared to be the sole cause of steatorrhea. The correlation of colipase secretion with the level of fecal fat excretion was highly significant (p less than 0.001) and indicated that fat digestion and subsequent fat absorption depended on colipase secretion up to at least a level of 25% fecal fat excretion. Nonpancreatic factors could well govern the extent of fat absorption above this level, as colipase secretory values in this range were uniformly low.",

        "title": "Age-Related Alterations of Immunoreactive Pancreatic Cationic Trypsinogen in Sera from Cystic Fibrosis Patients with and without Pancreatic Insufficiency",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Serum immunoreactive cationic trypsinogen levels were determined in 99 control subjects and 381 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. To evaluate the status of the exocrine pancreas all CF patients had previously undergone fecal fat balance studies and/or pancreatic stimulation tests. Three hundred fourteen CF patients had fat malabsorption and/or had inadequate pancreatic enzyme secretion (pancreatic insufficiency) requiring oral pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals. Sixty-seven CF patients did not have fat malabsorption and/or had adequate enzyme secretion (pancreatic sufficiency) and were not receiving pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals. Mean serum trypsinogen in 99 control subjects was 31.4 \u00b1 14.8 \u00b5g/liter (\u00b1 2 SD) and levels did not vary with age or sex. In CF infants (< 2 yr) with pancreatic insufficiency, mean serum trypsinogen was significantly above the non-CF values (p<0.001). Ninety-one percent of the CF infants had elevated levels. Serum trypsinogen values in the pancreatic insufficient group declined steeply up to 5 years, reaching subnormal values by age 6. An equation was developed which described these age-related changes very accurately. Only six CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency had serum trypsinogen levels above the 95% confidence limits of this equation. In contrast, there was no age related decline in serum trypsinogen among the CF group with pancreatic sufficiency. Under 7 yr, serum trypsinogen failed to distinguish the two groups. In those over 7 yr of age, however, serum trypsinogen was significantly higher than the CF group with pancreatic insufficiency (p<0.001), and 93% had values within or above the control range. In conclusion, serum trypsinogen appears to be a useful screening test for CF in infancy. Between 2 and 7 yr of age this test is of little diagnostic value. After 7 yr of age, serum trypsinogen can reliably distinguish between CF patients with and without pancreatic insufficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Neonatal cystic fibrosis (CF) screening has been performed in New Zealand for a total of 7 years. This study reports the experience with this procedure in New Zealand over a 4 year period and compares it with 2 years when diagnoses of CF were suggested by clinical features only. A total of 72 infants were confirmed as having CF during 4 years of screening. Twenty\u2010eight infants were found to have CF during 2 years in which screening was not performed. There were 29 false positive diagnoses during the screening years and six false negative diagnoses. Three of the false negative diagnoses occurred because of laboratory error, but three occurred because either the first or second measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) was normal. Faecal chymotrypsin was measured in samples from 434 infants at the time of the second IRT and assisted with the diagnosis for one infant which might otherwise have been missed. Only 42.5% of infants were asymptomatic at the time of the confirmatory sweat test. Significant morbidity and mortality was associated with meconium ileus which occurred in 24% of infants with CF. Improved ascertainment of cases of CF has occurred since screening began. Further follow\u2010up is required to determine other benefits of newborn screening.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the effectiveness of a two tier neonatal screening strategy for cystic fibrosis, which combines estimation of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by direct gene analysis in dried blood spot samples collected at age 5 days. DESIGN--Prospective study of two tier screening strategy. The first tier of testing immunoreactive trypsinogen concentration was measured in dried blood spot samples from neonates aged 4-5 days. In the second tier direct gene analysis to detect cystic fibrosis mutations deltaF508 and deltaI506 was performed in those blood spot samples which produced the highest 1% of immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Direct gene analysis was also performed on blood spot samples from infants with suspected or confirmed meconium ileus, regardless of the immunoreactive trypsinogen value. SETTING--The South Australian Neonatal Screening Programme, operating from the department of chemical pathology at Adelaide Children's Hospital. Subjects--All 12,056 neonates born in South Australia between December 1989 and June 1990. No selection criteria were applied. INTERVENTIONS--All infants found to have two recognised cystic fibrosis mutations on direct gene analysis were referred directly for clinical management, and those with one recognised cystic fibrosis mutation were recalled for a sweat test; their families were given genetic counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Direct or exclusion of cystic fibrosis by sweat testing of neonates identified as being at high risk of cystic fibrosis on screening and of those at minimum risk but whose subsequent clinical history raised suspicion about the disease. RESULTS--Of the 12,056 infants screened, 11,907 (98.8%) were reported as \"cystic fibrosis not indicated\" on the basis of low immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Of the 148 (1.23%) infants with raised immunoreactive trypsinogen values and one (0.008%) with meconium ileus, 132 (1.09%) were reported as cystic fibrosis not indicated, four (0.033%) were identified as having cystic fibrosis, and 13 (0.108%) were recalled for sweat testing after direct gene analysis for the presence of the deltaF508 and deltaI506 cystic fibrosis mutations. No cases of affected infants are known to have been missed to date. CONCLUSION--The strategy of measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by direct gene analysis is a highly specific neonatal screen for cystic fibrosis, requiring only 2.8 families to be contacted for every case of cystic fibrosis diagnosed.",

        "abstract": "A method to detect the main cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation delta F508 from dried blood spots, whole blood, or saliva using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) is described. Samples are treated by boiling in mild alkaline solution, after which two allele-specific PCR reactions are performed. Allele-specific primers and a common biotinylated primer are used in the amplification reactions. To detect the PCR product, an europium-labeled oligonucleotide, complementary to the biotinylated strand of the PCR product, is used in a solution hybridization. Hybridization is done in streptavidin-coated microtitration wells, making the detection easy to perform. After a washing step, the bound label is detected using a time-resolved fluorometer. To analyze function of the assay, 20 dried blood spot samples were tested. PCR amplification of the deletion region combined with gel retardation assay was used as a control method. In the initial testing, 2 samples giving discrepant results in the two assays were found. In addition, 17 samples from known CF patients together with 6 normal control samples were analyzed. Among these patient samples, 10 homozygotes and 6 carriers for mutation delta F508 were found.",

        "abstract": "A novel technique for screening point mutations has been developed for diagnosis of familial defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 (FDB). In FDB, an amino acid exchange occurs at position 3500 in apoB-100 due to a point mutation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the appropriate region of the apoB gene, and the PCR products were hybridized in solution with europium-labeled oligonucleotides, complementary to either the wildtype or the mutant genome. The presence or absence of the apoB-3500 mutation was monitored by time-resolved fluorescence of the europium chelate. The method allows a larger number of samples to be processed simultaneously, and the detection system displays a high level of sensitivity without the hazards connected to the use of radioactivity. When 127 Swedish patients, clinically diagnosed as suffering from heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, were screened for the presence of the apoB-3500 mutation, two patients, unrelated to each other, were found to be heterozygotes. These patients are the first reported cases of FDB from Sweden, and the frequency rate observed among hypercholesterolemic patients, 1.6%, is in accordance with the figures reported for several other patient population in Europe and the United States.",

        "abstract": "Familial defective apoB-100 (R3500Q) [FDB (R3500Q)] is caused by a mutation in the apoB gene (2p23.24). Almost all individuals with this disorder are of European descent, and in almost all cases the mutation is on a chromosome with a rare haplotype (194) at the apoB locus, suggesting that all FDB (R3500Q) probands are descended from a common ancestor in whom the original mutation occurred. The distribution of the mutation is consistent with an origin in Europe 6000-7000 years ago. We have estimated the amount of recombination between the apoB gene and markers on chromosome 2 in 34 FDB (R3500Q) probands in whom the mutation is on a 194 haplotype. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found between the apoB gene and marker D2S220. We have identified three YACs that contain the apoB gene and D2S220. The shortest restriction fragment common to the three YACs that contained both loci was 240 kb long. No shorter fragments with both loci were identified. On the assumption that 1000 kb corresponds to 1 cM, we deduce that the recombination distance between D2S220 and the apoB gene is about 0.24 cM. Combining this value with the linkage disequilibrium observed between the two loci in the probands, we estimate that the ancestral mutation occurred about 270 generations ago. We postulate that the original mutation occurred in the common ancestor of living FDB (R3500Q) probands, who lived in Europe about 6750 years ago. The errors in this estimate are discussed.",

        "title": "The Molecular Mechanism for the Genetic Disorder Familial Defective Apolipoprotein B100*",
        "abstract": "Familial defective apolipoprotein B100 (FDB) is a genetic disorder in which low density lipoproteins (LDL) bind defectively to the LDL receptor, resulting in hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. FDB is caused by a mutation (R3500Q) that changes the conformation of apolipoprotein (apo) B100 near the receptor-binding site. We previously showed that arginine, not simply a positive charge, at residue 3500 is essential for normal receptor binding and that the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 is necessary for mutations affecting arginine 3500 to disrupt LDL receptor binding. Thus, normal receptor binding involves an interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369 in the carboxyl tail of apoB100. W4369Y LDL and R3500Q LDL isolated from transgenic mice had identically defective LDL binding and a higher affinity for the monoclonal antibody MB47, which has an epitope flanking residue 3500. We conclude that arginine 3500 interacts with tryptophan 4369 and facilitates the conformation of apoB100 required for normal receptor binding of LDL. From our findings, we developed a model that explains how the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 interacts with the backbone of apoB100 that enwraps the LDL particle. Our model also explains how all known ligand-defective mutations in apoB100, including a newly discovered R3480W mutation in apoB100, cause defective receptor binding.",

        "abstract": "The effect of five genetic polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein B gene on parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism was assessed in 564 Danish mono- and dizygotic twins. Genotypes in apolipoprotein B T71I (ApaLI RFLP), A591V (AluI RFLP), L2712P (MvaI RFLP), R3611Q (MspI RFLP), and E4154K (EcoRI RFLP) were established using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digests. The effect of genotypes on lipid levels and on glucose, insulin, and HOMA (i.e., calculated parameters of beta-cell function and insulin resistance) was assessed by multivariate analyses of variance correcting for the effect of gender, age, glucose tolerance status, and body mass index. The effect of genotype on the risk of having impaired glucose metabolism was calculated by logistic regression analysis. Finally, linkage between allele sharing and physiological parameters was calculated by the new Haseman-Elston method. The allele frequencies of all five polymorphisms were similar to those previously reported for Caucasian populations. The L2711P (MvaI RFLP) polymorphism influenced LDL-cholesterol and LDL-to-HDL measures (p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively), while the R3611Q (MspI RFLP) polymorphism had an effect on the insulin-to-glucose ratio (p = 0.04), and E4154K (EcoRI RFLP) influenced HOMAbeta (p = 0.04). Significant interactions were observed between genotype in T71I (ApaLI RFLP), A591V (AluI RFLP), R3611Q (MspI RFLP), and E4154K (EcoRI RFLP) and glucose tolerance on lipid-related parameters (0.03 < p < 0.004), and between genotype in L2712P (MvaI RFLP) and E4154K (EcoRI RFLP) and gender on lipid and glucose-related parameters (0.02 < p < 0.003). No genotypes were significantly associated with impaired glucose tolerance measured by logistic regression. Likewise, no effect of allele sharing in the five polymorphisms was seen in the dizygotic twins. The effect of the polymorphisms on lipid and glucose parameters could be mediated through linkage to genes with known effect on glucose metabolism or through free fatty acids exerting their effect on glucose metabolism.",

Our aim was to determine whether the presence of the -516C/T polymorphism in the APOB gene promoter modifies insulin sensitivity to dietary fat. We studied fifty-nine healthy volunteers (thirty men and twenty-nine women, thirty-six homozygotes for the -516C allele (C/C) (nineteen males and seventeen females) and twenty-three heterozygotes for the -516T allele (C/T) (eleven males and twelve females)). Subjects consumed three diets during the feeding study, 4 weeks each: an SFA-rich diet (38 % fat, 20 % SFA), followed by a carbohydrate (CHO)-rich diet (30 % fat, 55 % CHO) or a MUFA-rich diet (38 % fat, 22 % MUFA) following a randomised cross-over design. For each diet, we investigated peripheral insulin sensitivity with the insulin suppression test. Male carriers of the -516T allele showed a significantly greater decrease in steady-state plasma glucose concentrations when changing from the SFA-rich diet (9.18 (sd 1.35) mmol/l) to the MUFA (6.55 (sd 0.74) mmol/l) or the CHO (6.31 (sd 0.93) mmol/l) diets than did those who were homozygous for the C allele (P = 0.040). Furthermore, C/T subjects presented higher plasma NEFA values after consumption of the SFA diet compared with the MUFA and CHO diets (P = 0.001). This effect was not observed in females (P = 0.908). Our findings show that male carriers of the -516T allele, C/T, have a significant increase in insulin resistance after consumption of all diets, but the difference is more exaggerated after the SFA diet compared with the MUFA- and CHO-rich diets.",

In the present study, we tested whether gene polymorphisms and gene scores linked to low serum carotenoid status are related to metabolic disturbance and depressive symptoms in African-American adults residing in Baltimore city, MD, using cross-sectional data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (age range 30\u201364 years, n 873\u2013994). We examined twenty-four SNP of various gene loci that were previously shown to be associated with low serum carotenoid status (SNPlcar). Gene risk scores were created: five low specific-carotenoid risk scores (LSCRS: \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lutein+zeaxanthin, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and lycopene) and one low total-carotenoid risk score (LTCRS: total carotenoids). SNPlcar, LSCRS and LTCRS were entered as predictors for a number of health outcomes. These included obesity, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III metabolic syndrome and its components, elevated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, hyperuricaemia and elevated depressive symptoms (EDS, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression score \u2265 16). Among the key findings, SNPlcar were not associated with the main outcomes after correction for multiple testing. However, an inverse association was found between the LTCRS and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) dyslipidaemia. Specifically, the \u03b1-carotene and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin LSCRS were associated with a lower odds of HDL-C dyslipidaemia. However, the \u03b2-cryptoxanthin LSCRS was linked to a higher odds of EDS, with a linear dose\u2013response relationship. In summary, gene risk scores linked to low serum carotenoids had mixed effects on HDL-C dyslipidaemia and EDS. Further studies using larger African-American population samples are needed.",

However, when the phenotypic correlations were partitioned into genetic and environmental correlations, we found marginally significant (P = 0.051) genetic correlations only between \u03b2-carotene and BMI (-0.27), WC (-0.30), and HDL cholesterol (0.31) after accounting for multiple comparisons. None of the environmental correlations were significant.Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that the serum carotenoid concentrations were under strong additive genetic influences based on variance components analyses, and that the common genetic factors may influence \u03b2-carotene and obesity and lipid traits in MA children.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the hypothesis from the source paper. Both papers investigate the relationship between serum carotenoid concentrations and various health outcomes, including obesity-related traits. The current paper explores the genetic influences on serum carotenoid concentrations and their correlation with obesity-related traits in Mexican American children, which is a different population from the source paper's focus on African-American adults. However, the underlying idea of examining the relationship between carotenoids and health outcomes is similar."

        "abstract": "Carotenoids have shown an interindividual variability that may be due to genetic factors. The only study that has reported heritability of serum \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotene has not considered the environmental component. This study aimed to estimate the contribution of both genetic and common environmental effects to the variance of carotenoid concentrations and to test whether their phenotypic correlations with cardiometabolic risk factors are explained by shared genetic and environmental effects. Plasma carotenoid concentrations (\u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids) of 48 healthy subjects were measured. Heritability estimates of carotenoid concentrations were calculated using the variance component method. Lutein and lycopene showed a significant familial effect (p = 6 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 0.0043, respectively). Maximal heritability, genetic heritability, and common environmental effect were computed for lutein (88.3%, 43.8%, and 44.5%, respectively) and lycopene (45.2%, 0%, and 45.2%, respectively). Significant phenotypic correlations between carotenoid concentrations and cardiometabolic risk factors were obtained for \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and zeaxanthin. Familial resemblances in lycopene concentrations were mainly attributable to common environmental effects, while for lutein concentrations they were attributable to genetic and common environmental effects. Common genetic and environmental factors may influence carotenoids and cardiometabolic risk factors, but further studies are needed to better understand the potential impact on disease development.",

The study's focus on estimating the contribution of both genetic and common environmental effects to the variance of carotenoid concentrations is partially dependent on the source paper's results."

        "title": "The Role of Lycopene in Chronic Lung Diseases",
        "abstract": "Lycopene, a naturally occurring non-provitamin A carotenoid pigment, is responsible for the red to pink colors in tomato, watermelon, red bell peppers, and pink guava. There are many health benefits attributed to lycopene including but not limited to its antioxidant activity. According to the American Lung Association\u2019s State of Lung Cancer, lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Other chronic lung diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are high prevalence. This chapter summarizes lycopene\u2019s protective role against lung diseases in both in vitro and in vivo studies. While it has been demonstrated that circulating lycopene can be used as a biomarker for several lung diseases, further studies are warranted to establish that. We aim to provide insights into how lycopene can remedy for lung diseases, including lung cancer.",
