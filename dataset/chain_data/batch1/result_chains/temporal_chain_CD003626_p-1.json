        "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial. Fourteen patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis documented by cholestatic serum enzyme pattern, liver histological appearance and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were included in the trial. Six patients received ursodeoxycholic acid (13 to 15 mg/kg body wt/day), and eight patients received placebo. Two patients had to be withdrawn from the study, one because of UDCA\u2010related diarrhea and the other because of worsening of the disease during placebo treatment. Patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group improved significantly during 1 yr of treatment with respect to serum levels of bilirubin (median = \u2212 50%), alkaline phosphatase (median = \u2212 67%), \u03b3\u2010glutamyltransferase (median = \u2212 53%), AST (median = \u2212 54%) and ALT (median = \u2212 36%) compared with the placebo group, but not with respect to serum levels of hydrophobic bile acids. During ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, histopathological features also improved significantly, as evaluated by multiparametric score. Expression of human leukocyte antigen class I molecules appeared to be markedly reduced on liver cells after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. We conclude that ursodeoxycholic acid is beneficial in reducing disease activity in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (HEPATOLOGY 1992;16:707\u2013714.)",

        "title": "Tauroursodeoxycholic acid stimulates hepatocellular exocytosis and mobilizes extracellular Ca++ mechanisms defective in cholestasis.",
        "abstract": "To assess the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on bile excretory function, we examined whether TUDCA modulates vesicular exocytosis in the isolated perfused liver of normal rats in the presence of high (1.9 mM) or low (0.19 mM) extracellular Ca++ and in cholestatic rats 24 h after bile duct ligation. In addition, the effects of TUDCA on Ca++ homeostasis were compared in normal and in cholestatic hepatocytes. In the isolated perfused rat liver, TUDCA (25 microM) stimulated a sustained increase in the biliary excretion of horseradish peroxidase, a marker of the vesicular pathway, in the presence of high, but not low extracellular Ca++ or in the cholestatic liver. In contrast, TUDCA stimulated bile flow to the same extent regardless of the concentration of extracellular Ca++ or the presence of cholestasis. In indo-1-loaded hepatocytes, basal cytosolic free Ca++ ([Ca++]i) levels were not different between normal and cholestatic cells. However, in cholestatic cells [Ca++]i increases induced by TUDCA (10 microM) and its 7 alpha-OH epimer taurochenodeoxycholic acid (50 microM) were reduced to 22% and 26%, respectively, compared to normal cells. The impairment of TUDCA-induced [Ca++]i increase in cholestatic cells could be mimicked by exposing normal cells to low extracellular Ca++ (21%) or to the Ca++ channel blocker NiCl2 (23%). These data indicate that (a) dihydroxy bile acid-induced Ca++ entry may be of functional importance in the regulation of hepatocellular vesicular exocytosis, and (b) this Ca++ entry mechanism across the plasma membrane is impaired in cholestatic hepatocytes. We speculate that the beneficial effect of ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic liver diseases may be related to the Ca+(+)-dependent stimulation of vesicular exocytosis by its conjugate.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nPreclinical results suggest therapeutic potential of mild hyperbilirubinemia in T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Translational data are limited, because an appropriate bilirubin formulation for parenteral human use is lacking. Considering its use in both clinical practice and medical research in the past, we explored the feasibility to reintroduce parenteral bilirubin for translational experiments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe developed a preparation method in accordance with good manufacturing practice and evaluated the parenteral applicability in healthy volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Explorative pharmacokinetic and safety data were compared to the results from a literature study on the former parenteral use of bilirubin. Bilirubin was administered intra-arterially to raise the local plasma concentration in the forearm vascular bed (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and intravenously to raise the systemic plasma concentration (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Finally, pharmacokinetic characteristics were studied following a single bolus infusion (n\u00a0=\u00a03).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring parenteral application, no side effects occurred. Adverse events mentioned during the two-week observation period were in general mild and self-limiting. Three more significant adverse events (appendicitis, asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmia and atopic eczema) were judged unrelated by independent physicians. A dose-concentration relationship appeared sufficiently predictable for both intra-arterial and intravenous administration. In line with existing knowledge, bilirubin pharmacokinetics could be described best according to a two-compartment model with a volume of distribution of 9.9 (\u00b12.0) l and a total plasma clearance of 36 (\u00b116) ml per minute.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSupported by previous reports, our data suggest that it is both feasible and safe to perform translational experiments with parenteral albumin bound bilirubin.",

        "title": "Bilirubin improves the quality and function of hypothermic preserved islets by its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effect.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIslet transplantation is a promising option for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, the current lack of practical techniques for the isolated islets preservation still hampers the advancement of life-saving islet transplantation. Islet suffers from internal or external stimuli induced oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation during preservation, which leads to disappointing outcomes regarding islet yield, survival and function. ROS overproduction is the primary cause of oxidative stress that induces islet loss and dysfunction. Thus, in this paper, we hypothesized that an endogenous antioxidant, bilirubin, that could efficiently scavenge ROS and inhibit inflammatory reactions could be beneficial for islet preservation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHerein, we studied the effect of bilirubin on the hypothermic preserved (4\u00b0C) islets, and evaluate the islets viability, insulin secretory function, oxidative stress levels, and in vivo transplantation performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBilirubin could prevent cellular damages during short-term preservation, and maintain the co-cultured islets viability and function. The protective role of bilirubin is associated with its antioxidative ability, which dramatically increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH-Px), and decreased the levels of ROS and MDA. Diabetic mice transplanted with bilirubin preserved islets were normoglycemic for 28 days, even overmatched the diabetic mouse transplanted with fresh islets. Mice receiving bilirubin co-cultured islets required the least time to achieve normoglycemia among all groups and exhibited minimum inflammatory responses during the early transplantation stage.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy utilizing bilirubin, we achieved highly viable and functional islets after hypothermic preservation to reverse diabetes in mice.",

        "title": "Bilirubin Protects Transplanted Islets by Targeting Ferroptosis",
        "abstract": "Islet transplantation is an attractive treatment for type 1 diabetic patients. However, transplanted islets suffered from considerable cell death due to inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. Ferroptosis is a programmed death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, which has been implicated in the islet loss and dysfunction. Our previous studies showed that bilirubin displayed protection effect for islets by inhibiting early inflammation and oxidative stress. However, whether bilirubin protects islets by targeting ferroptosis has not yet been elucidated. Here, the isolated islet was exposed to ferroptosis-inducing agents with or without bilirubin. Islet viability, insulin secretion, and oxidative stress levels were assessed. Subsequently, the pretreated islets were transplanted into the subrenal site of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Bilirubin could significantly attenuate ferroptosis in isolated islets, along with reduced oxidative stress, elevated GPX4 expression and upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1. Experimental data also confirmed that bilirubin could chelate iron. In vivo graft study demonstrated that euglycemia was achieved in diabetic mice receiving bilirubin-pretreated islets within 24 hours, while the control islets required at least 7 days. Bilirubin could improve islet viability and function through inhibiting ferroptosis, which could be of clinic interest to apply bilirubin into the islet transplantation system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The apoptosis of grafted islets is an urgent problem due to the high rate of islet loss soon after transplantation. MicroRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) is an essential mediator of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) during anti-apoptosis, but its effect and the underlying molecular mechanism in islet transplantation remain partially understood. Here, we found that miR-21-5p could be delivered to islet cells via BMSCs-Exo. Subsequently, we demonstrated that miR-21-5p overexpression reduced apoptosis in islets and INS-1 cells, whereas miR-21-5p inhibition enhanced apoptosis. A mechanistic analysis involving RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis was performed to determine the interaction between miR-21-5p and its target gene programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which was further verified by a dual luciferase assay. In vivo, the grafted islets overexpressing miR-21-5p showed a higher survival rate, better insulin secretion function, and a lower apoptosis rate. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that miR\u201121\u20115p from BMSCs-Exo protects against the apoptosis of grafted islets by inhibiting PDCD4 expression. Hence, miR-21-5p can be used as a cell-free therapeutic agent to minimize \u03b2-cell apoptosis at the early stage of islet transplantation.",
