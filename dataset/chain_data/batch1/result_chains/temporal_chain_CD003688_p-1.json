        "title": "Evidence suggesting that a chronic disease self-management program can improve health status while reducing hospitalization: a randomized trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness (changes in health behaviors, health status, and health service utilization) of a self-management program for chronic disease designed for use with a heterogeneous group of chronic disease patients. It also explored the differential effectiveness of the intervention for subjects with specific diseases and comorbidities.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was a six-month randomized, controlled trial at community-based sites comparing treatment subjects with wait-list control subjects. Participants were 952 patients 40 years of age or older with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of heart disease, lung disease, stroke, or arthritis. Health behaviors, health status, and health service utilization, as determined by mailed, self-administered questionnaires, were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment subjects, when compared with control subjects, demonstrated improvements at 6 months in weekly minutes of exercise, frequency of cognitive symptom management, communication with physicians, self-reported health, health distress, fatigue, disability, and social/role activities limitations. They also had fewer hospitalizations and days in the hospital. No differences were found in pain/physical discomfort, shortness of breath, or psychological well-being.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn intervention designed specifically to meet the needs of a heterogeneous group of chronic disease patients, including those with comorbid conditions, was feasible and beneficial beyond usual care in terms of improved health behaviors and health status. It also resulted in fewer hospitalizations and days of hospitalization.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nWe tested the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, behavioral theory-based community health worker intervention for improving glycemic control.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used a randomized, 6-month delayed control group design among 164 African American and Latino adult participants recruited from 2 health systems in Detroit, Michigan. Our study was guided by the principles of community-based participatory research. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was the primary outcome measure. Using an empowerment-based approach, community health workers provided participants with diabetes self-management education and regular home visits, and accompanied them to a clinic visit during the 6-month intervention period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in the intervention group had a mean HbA1c value of 8.6% at baseline, which improved to a value of 7.8% at 6 months, for an adjusted change of -0.8 percentage points (P < .01). There was no change in mean HbA1c among the control group (8.5%). Intervention participants also had significantly greater improvements in self-reported diabetes understanding compared with the control group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study contributes to the growing evidence for the effectiveness of community health workers and their role in multidisciplinary teams engaged in culturally appropriate health care delivery.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted, primary care\u2013based nurse\u2013community health worker (CHW) team intervention to support diabetes self-management on diabetes control and other biologic measures. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Two hundred sixty-eight Samoan participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited from a community health center in American Samoa and were randomly assigned by village clusters to the nurse-CHW team intervention or to a wait-list control group that received usual care. RESULTS Participants had a mean age of 55 years, 62% were female, mean years of education were 12.5 years, 41% were employed, and mean HbA1c was 9.8% at baseline. At 12 months, mean HbA1c was significantly lower among CHW participants, compared with usual care, after adjusting for confounders (b = \u22120.53; SE = 0.21; P = 0.03). The odds of making a clinically significant improvement in HbA1c of at least 0.5% in the CHW group was twice the odds in the usual care group after controlling for confounders (P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in blood pressure, weight, or waist circumference at 12 months between groups. CONCLUSIONS A culturally adapted nurse-CHW team intervention was able to significantly improve diabetes control in the U.S. Territory of American Samoa. This represents an important translation of an evidence-based model to a high-risk population and a resource-poor setting.",

        "title": "Impact of a diabetes control and management intervention on health care utilization in American Samoa",
        "abstract": "Objectives To examine the impact of a successful 12-month behavioral intervention to improve diabetes control on health care utilization in American Samoa. Methods A cluster-randomized design was used to assign 268 diabetes patients to a nurse-community health worker intervention or usual care. Hospitalizations, emergency department, and primary care physician visits were collected retrospectively for 1 year prior to, and during, the intervention to assess changes in health care utilization. The association of utilization changes with change in HbA1c during the intervention was assessed. Results Adjusted incidence rate ratios (RR) for primary care physician visits were significantly higher in the community health worker relative to the usual care group (RR\u2009=\u20091.71; 95% CI, 1.25\u20132.33). There was no main intervention effect on emergency department utilization, but visits in the prior year modified the intervention effect on emergency department visits. Increased primary care physician utilization was associated with greater decreases in HbA1c (b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.10, SE\u2009=\u20090.04, p\u2009=\u20090.01). Conclusions A culturally adapted community health worker diabetes intervention in American Samoa significantly increased primary care physician visits, and decreased emergency department visits among those with high emergency department usage in the prior year. These changes suggest important and beneficial impacts on health system utilization from the diabetes intervention in a low resource and high-risk population.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo improve the knowledge and skills of community health workers (CHWs) on an American Indian (AI) Reservation related to the management of diabetes to allow CHWs, with no prior formal diabetes education to work more effectively with individuals in the community with diabetes. Training was provided in six \"face-to-face\" sessions with the CHWs using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CHW Training Resource on Heart Disease and Stroke.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SAMPLE\nThis is a quality improvement program guided by the Model for Improvement: Plan, Do, Study, Act and using a pre-post evaluation design. Ten AI CHWs were recruited for the training.\n\n\nMEASURES\nKnowledge and attitudes, participation rates, and participant satisfaction were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKnowledge increased overall with largest changes in diabetes, depression and cholesterol. Diabetes attitudes were high and consistent with those found in caregivers who support patient-centered care. Participants reported learning, liking the class, and finding the materials helpful.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis QI program provided by a public health nurse improved CHW's knowledge of diabetes and the management of diabetes. Next steps include formalizing the Reservation's CHW training program, expanding this training to other AI Health Service areas, and measuring the impact of CHWs in the community.",

        "title": "What Is the Impact of a Context-Specific Training Program for Home-Based Carers? An Evaluation Study",
        "abstract": "Introduction: In South Africa (SA), home-based carers (HBCs) play a crucial role at the community level for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including diabetes mellitus (DM) public health care. The work of HBCs requires them to be knowledgeable about diabetes, and lack of knowledge has implications on their roles for the provision of health information and dietary advice. HBCs need to be provided with specific training to develop their knowledge and skills necessary to enable them to provide care to people with diabetes (PWD) because organizations need to benefit from a pool of well-trained HBCs. Therefore, a training program was developed to improve care for chronic conditions based on local needs. Aim: To implement and evaluate the training program for the HBCs for PWD in Ga-Dikgale village. Methods: HBCs working at Ga- Dikgale villages in four clinics\u2014namely, Dikgale, Seobi Dikgale, Sebayeng, and Makotopong\u2014participated voluntarily. Fifty-five (55) HBCs who attended the training program completed satisfaction survey tools, and furthermore, 45 HBCs completed both pre-training and post-training knowledge questionnaires. Training divided into two sessions which each lasted for two days was conducted. Satisfaction with the training, improvement of knowledge, and perceived impact on daily practice were evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Results: Quantitative results indicate that 72% had poor knowledge of pre-training and only 9% post-training. They scored more in a post-test with the following differences: Post-test (mean = 6.00, SD = 1.26); pre-test (mean = 3.31, SD = 1.77). The t-test results indicated the difference to be significant, t = \u22129.241, p = 0.000. From the qualitative results, the themes that emerged during data analysis from group discussions were HBCs\u2019 achievements from the training, challenges related to diabetes and diet, and suggestions for further training. Conclusions: A context-specific training increased diabetes knowledge among the HBCs for PWD. The results highlighted the importance of training in improving the knowledge of HBCs about the care of PWD. The improvement in diabetes knowledge among HBCs needs to be maintained and sustained to achieve major health benefits for PWD.",

        "title": "Enhancing employee performance through structured job training: Evidence from Puskesmas Pademangan, Jakarta",
        "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between job training and employee performance at the Puskesmas of Pademangan District, North Jakarta. The study aims to examine how various components of job training, including training objectives, instructors, and materials, affect employee performance. Using a quantitative approach with a descriptive method, data were collected from 192 Puskesmas employees using a structured questionnaire. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between job training and employee performance. Specifically, employees who rated their training programs as \"good\" demonstrated higher levels of job performance. Statistical analysis using the chi-square test showed that all dimensions of training (objectives, instructors, and materials) were significantly associated with improved performance. These findings support existing theories on the importance of well-structured job training in enhancing employee productivity and service quality. The study concludes that ongoing improvements in training content and delivery methods will further enhance employee performance at Puskesmas. Recommendations for Puskesmas administrators include regular evaluation of training programs and tailored development initiatives to meet specific employee needs. Future research should investigate the long-term impacts of training and explore potential moderating factors such as organizational culture and employee motivation.",
