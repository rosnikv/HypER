        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUnfractionated heparin has been found to reduce symptoms and improve healing as adjuvant therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis. The current study evaluated the efficacy and safety of unfractionated heparin in the treatment of ulcerative colitis in comparison with methylprednisolone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multicenter randomized trial with blinded endpoint evaluation was conducted in patients hospitalized for moderate or severe ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized to receive heparin as a continuous infusion or methylprednisolone (0.75-1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-five patients entered the study: 13 received methylprednisolone and 12 received heparin. By day 10, 69% of patients in the methylprednisolone group, but none in the heparin group, achieved significant improvement or remission. C-reactive protein levels significantly decreased in the methylprednisolone group but not in the heparin group. Three patients in the heparin group were withdrawn before day 10 because of an adverse event: rectal bleeding needing transfusion (2 cases) or surgery (1 case). The proportion of patients with persistent rectal bleeding at day 10 was 31% in the methylprednisolone group and 90% in the heparin group (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnfractionated heparin as monotherapy is not effective in the treatment of moderate or severe ulcerative colitis and is associated with significant bleeding complications.",

        "title": "Effect of Heparin on Tissue Binding Activity of Fibroblast Growth Factor and Heparin-Binding Epidermal Growth Factor in Experimental Colitis in Rats",
        "abstract": "There have been several reports implying a benefit for heparin therapy in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Although this effect has been attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of heparin, other mechanisms have not been excluded. Heparin is a potent modulator of receptor binding of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), that play a role in wound repair. We examined the effect of heparin on the functional levels of FGF and HB-EGF in a model of experimental colitis. Fifty-six Wistar rats were divided into four groups: group 1 was the control group, group 2 received s.c. heparin 50 units/kg/d, group 3 underwent induction of 3% iodoacetamide colitis, and group 4 underwent induction of colitis and heparin treatment. Rats were killed and evaluated for severity of colitis by macroscopic and microscopic colitis scores, area of inflammation, and myeloperoxidase levels. FGF and HB-EGF levels were functionally assessed in colonic tissue in each group. Heparin therapy resulted in significant improvement in macroscopic and microscopic features of colitis (p < 0.05), accompanied by a partial reduction in myeloperoxidase levels. FGF receptor binding activity was identical in groups 1 and 2 but increased more than 3-fold after colitis induction in group 3 (p < 0.05). Treatment with heparin caused a significant decrease in FGF concentration. Levels of HB-EGF binding activity were similar in groups 1 and 2 and decreased in group 3 (p < 0.01). Heparin caused a significant increase in HB-EGF content in group 4 (p < 0.05). Levels of growth factors are altered differently in experimental colitis. Colonic FGF binding activity increases with colitis, whereas HB-EGF binding decreases with colitis. These trends were reversed by heparin, concomitant with a clinical and pathologic improvement in colitis. We suggest that one mechanism of heparin-mediated improvement in colitis may involve tissue healing associated with changes in functional levels of colonic growth factors.",

LMWH, a dalteparin (150 U/kg, 300 U/kg), was subcutaneously administrated one hour before induction of colitis and went on once a day for 6 days. Then a half dose was given for the next 7 days. Control animals received the same volume of normal saline once a day for 14 days after treated by TNBS. Animals were sacrificed at 24 h, days 7 and 14 after induction of colitis. The colon was excised for the evaluation of macroscopic and histological findings and TNF-alpha immunohistochemical assay. Platelet surface P-selectin expression was determined by radioimmunoassay and serum IL-8 production was assayed by ELISA method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLMWH treatment in a dose of 300 U/kg for 14 days significantly improved colonic inflammation by histological examination. Serum IL-8 production in the 300 U/kg treatment group was more significantly decreased at day 14 than that at 24 h (P<0.05). However, platelet surface P-selectin expression and TNF-alpha staining in colonic tissue were not significantly different among the three groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLMWH has an anti-inflammatory effect on TNBS induced colitis in rats. The effect is possibly related to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, but not involved platelet surface P-selectin expression.",

        "abstract": "Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) have been shown to be efficient in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Parenteral heparin therapy, however, may cause hemorrhagic adverse effects. To reduce this risk, epithelial LMWH delivery in combination with a system ensuring selective drug release to the inflamed tissue was tested here. Enoxaparin loaded microspheres (MS) were administered orally to male BALB mice suffering from a pre-existing experimental colitis, whereas control groups received subcutaneous or rectal LMWH solution. Colon weight/length index and alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase activities were assessed to determine the inflammation. Tissue penetration experiments elucidated the processes involved in the proposed new therapeutic approach. Oral LMWH-MS proved to be equally efficient in mitigating experimental colitis as rectally administered LMWH solution when quantified by myeloperoxidase activity (MS, 10.2 \u00b1 1.5 U/mg tissue; rectal, 9.2 \u00b1 1.6 U/mg) and to be superior to subcutaneous LMWH (s.c., 21.6 \u00b1 5.6 U/mg; untreated colitis control, 30.0 \u00b1 3.8 U/mg). Pharmacokinetic studies found a notably low systemic availability of oral LMWH delivered from MS (<5%) indicating a low potential for adverse effects. The tissue permeability was selectively enhanced in the inflamed regions where a 9-fold higher LMWH penetration was found compared with healthy tissue. Epithelial LMWH delivery has been found a promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic approach. The use of LMWH-MS in this context offers a promising tool for IBD therapy by enhancing specifically drug availability at inflamed tissue sites while reducing the risk for systemic adverse effects to a negligibly low level.",

The various features of the different approaches allowing locally restricted drug delivery to the inflamed colon are discussed including the main physiological and pathophysiological limitations for the different systems. Conventional drug delivery systems are tightly adapted from developments for colonic delivery by oral administration triggered by release mechanisms owing to the physiological environment that these systems encounter in the colonic region. The newer developments in this context aim for an increased selectivity of drug delivery by targeting mechanisms which have a closer relation to pathophysiological particularities of the disease. Therefore, we were focused especially on new strategies for such treatment including liposomal formulations, cyclodextrins, micro- or nanoparticles, viral gene therapy approaches, and others. Effective and selective delivery even of an otherwise nonspecifically acting drug could provide new therapeutic pathways in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an exceptional scenario with regard to drug targeting, as oral administration has the potential to deliver the drug directly to the site(s) of action. Consequently, retention of the drug within the intestinal lumen and tissue, rather than systemic absorption, is frequently desirable. Areas covered: In this article, the traditional drug-delivery strategies used in IBD are briefly summarized. These include rectal dosage forms and oral systems that target the lower intestine/colon by pH-, time-, microflora-, and pressure-dependent mechanisms. Then, the article offers an updated overview of recently developed delivery systems aimed to achieve maximal drug concentrations in the inflamed intestinal tissues with minimal systemic side effects. These include antibodies, small molecules, Janus kinase inhibitors, particulate carrier systems, anti-inflammatory peptides, gene therapy, and transgenic bacteria. The various approaches are reviewed, and the challenges that still remain to be overcome are discussed. Expert opinion: The molecular revolution of the past decade profoundly influenced the treatment and management of IBD. In the coming years, this trend is expected to continue. Yet, many challenges are still ahead. A strong collaborative effort by experts from different fields is encouraged and necessary to maximize our success in IBD drug targeting.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study is to develop colon targeted drug delivery of chitosan microspheres with celecoxib as a model drug. Materials and Methods: Mucoadhesive microspheres were prepared using chitosan as a core polymer and coated with Eudragit S-100 by a solvent evaporation technique. The effect of different microsphere formulations was studied. Results: In vitro release study, core microspheres are found to show burst release in the first 1 h, whereas coated microspheres exhibit a controlled release, and thus suitable for colon target drug delivery. Through an in vivo study, we investigated the effect of the coated microspheres in rats exposed to experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in rats by rectal instillation of acetic acid. Rats experienced hemorrhagic diarrheic, body weight loss, rise in myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reduction of reduced glutathione (r-GSH) activity by cyclooxygenase (COX), after 5 days administration of acetic acid. Oral administration of coated microspheres (5 mg/kg) twice-a-day to rats after induction of colitis significantly attenuated the severity of the colonic injury. In addition, there was a significant reduction of MPO and COX levels but arises in the levels of GSH. Conclusion: Thus, the study provided the evidence that coated microspheres are beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with minimal side effects.",

The in-vitro release of the optimized formulation was 90.55\u2009\u00b1\u20092.42 in 24\u2009hr, which display controlled drug release of mesalamine at a particular region.

The statistical analysis was done by one way ANOVA and then comparison test of Bonferroni was done and p values <.05 were considered as significant. The effects of spray dried microparticles over inflamed Caco-2 cell were also evaluated by determining the concentration of IL-8. From in-vivo study it was seen that pretreatment of mesalamine with probiotic prevents DNBS (Dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) induced colitis in rats and represents protective action against ulcerative colitis because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The results give the foundation for a combination of targeted approach along with the anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic which might help to decrease the problems which are seen with the traditional cure and management of ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Mesalamine is the first-line choice of drug for ulcerative colitis management. However, due to the nontargeted delivery of mesalamine, it shows side effects. The possible impact of mesalamine can be improved by coated microparticles in combination with S. boulardii for targeted delivery to the colon with the prevention of unwanted side effects. In this work, pectin-based mesalamine and S. boulardii loaded microparticles were prepared by dehydration technique and coated by an oil-in-oil solvent evaporation method and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and zeta analysis. 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was used for the induction of colitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of coated microparticles on Caco-2 cells were assessed by the determination of interleukin (IL)-8 concentration. In addition, the impact of coated microparticles on the concentration of colonic enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), lipid peroxides, and glutathione (GSH), were also evaluated. Moreover, hematological parameters, including white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were assessed. SEM data revealed that all the prepared coated microparticles had an almost spherical shape. The X-ray powder diffraction analysis of uncoated and coated microparticles showed maximum stability without any interaction. The particle size of uncoated and coated microparticles was 9.14 and 15.61\u2009\u03bcm, respectively. The zeta potential of uncoated and coated microparticles was observed to be -26.78 and -29.36\u2009mV, respectively. The prepared coated microparticles decreased the levels of lipid peroxides, MPO, and GSH significantly in colitis. In the Caco-2 cell culture model, the concentration of IL-8 is decreased significantly. The hematological observations confirmed that the prepared formulation showed a promising decrease in the levels of WBC, CRP, and ESR in diseased animals. Animal experiments revealed that cellulose acetate phthalate coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii significantly improved the colitis disease conditions of Wistar rats. Hence, cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii could be recommended as adjuvant therapy to achieve a synergistic effect in the management of UC. Lay summary Mesalamine is the drug of choice for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), which inhibits mediators responsible for inflammation. We investigated the in vivo effects of cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine with Saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic) for their efficacy against UC. Our findings evidenced that the combination of mesalamine with S. boulardii showed a synergistic effect in the 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis model by reducing the inflammation and maintains the macroscopic features. From the observed results, it can be concluded that S. boulardii can be used to enhance the individual drug's effect in the therapeutic management of UC.",

        "abstract": "Objective Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) impairs the quality of life of diabetic patients and overburdens healthcare systems and society. It is crucial to comprehend the pathophysiology of DFU and develop effective treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus Plantarum (LP) on wound healing in DFU and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods To investigate the effects of LP on wound healing, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and used to assess cell viability, migration, and pyroptosis using CCK-8, cell scratch, and flow cytometry. The levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were measured by ELISA. The expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 p20, and GSDMD-N was detected by Western blot. Additionally, NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 was used to treat a diabetic rat model established by streptozotocin (STZ). Pearson correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between LP and NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 in ulcer tissue. Results Our data mechanistically demonstrate that AGEs activate the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway, leading to an increase in the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and ultimately promoting cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, we identified that LP inhibits the effects of AGEs by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome activity. LP facilitated wound healing in diabetic rats and resulted in decreased protein levels of NLRP3 and its downstream target caspase-1 p20. Finally, we observed a negative correlation between LP and NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 in diabetic foot skin tissue. Conclusion Our findings uncovered a novel role of LP in diabetic foot wound healing via regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting this link as a therapeutic target. In future research, it would be valuable to explore the signaling cascades involved in LP-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",
