        "title": "A controlled trial of cyclosporine in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis.",
        "abstract": "Primary biliary cirrhosis is a progressive disease of the liver characterized by the immunologic destruction of bile ducts; effective therapy is lacking. We therefore evaluated the safety and efficacy of low-dose cyclosporine in 29 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis without evidence of damage to the lobular architecture (precirrhotic disease) or portal hypertension. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cyclosporine (4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo. After one year 17 of the 19 patients assigned to cyclosporine had improvement or stability in their degree of fatigue, and 18 in their degree of pruritus. In contrast, among the 10 patients assigned to placebo, fatigue increased in 4 (P less than 0.06) and pruritus worsened in 6 (P less than 0.001). Those assigned to cyclosporine also had significant decreases in serum levels of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma globulin, and the titer of antimitochondrial antibodies. For the 20 patients who have completed two years in the study, liver biopsies (coded specimens) showed evidence of histologic progression in only 1 of 13 patients in the cyclosporine group, as compared with 5 of 7 in the placebo group (P less than 0.003). No patient has permanently discontinued cyclosporine because of side effects; however, signs of nephrotoxicity developed in 12 of 19, and 9 of 19 had increased blood pressure. We conclude that in patients with precirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine is promising and deserves further evaluation.",

        "title": "Renal Changes Associated With Cyclosporine in Recent Type I Diabetes Mellitus",
        "abstract": "The effects of cyclosporine A treatment on arterial pressure and renal function were assessed in 11 young patients with type I diabetes of short duration. Cyclosporine was started at 7.5 mg/kg/day, progressively decreased to 63 mg/kg/day at 6 months, and then continued at a lower dose (4.1 mg/kg/day) for an additional 3 months in patients in whom remission of insulin dependency was obtained (n=6). After 3 months of cyclosporine, a slight but significant increase in arterial pressure (+5.2\u00b11.5 mm Hg), a rise in renal vascular resistance (\u201420%), a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (\u201425%), and a fall in filtration fraction were observed. Such changes were sustained after 6 and eventually 9 months of therapy. The decrease in glomerular filtration rate observed during cyclosporine treatment contrasted with the lack of change in simultaneously estimated creatinine clearance; in fact, the creatinine clearance/ glomerular filtration ratio increased from 1.07\u00b10.05% to 1.33\u00b10.09% within 3 months of cyclosporine therapy, thus suggesting an enhanced tubular secretion of creatinine. Plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of kallikrein decreased significantly (\u201450%), whereas plasma aldosterone concentration remained unaltered and plasma concentration of potassium increased during cyclosporine therapy. These changes were observed in the presence of a constant urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and a constant body weight All parameters returned to pretreatment values within 3 months after cessation of cyclosporine. These results indicate that cyclosporine given for 6-9 months at a moderate dose causes a deleterious but reversible effect on arterial pressure and renal function in young diabetic patients.",

        "title": "Cyclosporin does not inhibit the tubular secretion of creatinine",
        "abstract": "Background. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin is known to impair renal function. The degree of renal dysfunction is usually estimated from the clearance of creatinine (C Cr ). Theoretically however, a fall in C Cr can be caused by a decrease of GFR, an inhibition of the tubular secretion of creatinine, or the combination of both. CsA has convincingly been shown to decrease GFR, but detailed information on the effects of CsA on tubular secretion of creatinine is lacking. Methods. We performed two studies to investigate the influence of CsA on tubular creatinine secretion. In study A we simultaneously measured C Cr and GFR (using inulin) immediately before and 4 weeks after cessation of CsA therapy in 17 renal transplant patients. In study B, the rise in serum creatinine after administration of cimetidine, which blocks the tubular secretion of creatinine, was compared in renal transplant patients treated with either CsA (in whom secretion might already be inhibited) or azathioprine. Results. Study A : After cessation of CsA there was an increase of GFR (54\u00b115 vs 63\u00b116 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ; P<0.01) and of C Cr (71\u00b121 vs 82\u00b123 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ; P<0.01), but the ratio between C Cr and GFR (a measure of the relative contribution of tubular secretion to the clearance of creatinine) did not change significantly (1.33\u00b10.21 vs 1.32\u00b10.30). Study B : In nine couples of patients matched for GFR the relative rises in serum creatinine after administration of cimetidine were 26\u00b121% and 22\u00b17% for the CsA and azathioprine treated patients respectively (NS). Conclusion. CsA does not substantially inhibit the tubular secretion of creatinine. A rise in serum creatinine after administration of CsA can thus be attributed completely to a fall in GFR.",
