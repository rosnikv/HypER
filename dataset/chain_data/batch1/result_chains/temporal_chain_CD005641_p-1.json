        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic primary closure of the common bile duct (CBD) combined with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic drainage (PTCD) and laparoscopic choledocholithotomy with T-tube placement for the treatment of CBD stones. Between January 1991 and July 2002, 50 patients with choledocholithiasis and a CBD diameter larger than or equal to 1 cm underwent laparoscopic CBD explorations. The study group consisted of 10 patients undergoing laparoscopic primary closure of the CBD combined with PTCD. The control group consisted of 40 patients undergoing laparoscopic choledocholithotomy with T-tube placement. Parameters were compared statistically. The study group showed higher female/male ratio (6/4 vs 8/32, P = 0.02), less stone numbers (1.90 \u00b1 0.88 vs 3.40 \u00b1 1.65, P = 0.0078), shorter operation time (138 \u00b1 37 minutes vs 191 \u00b1 75 minutes, P = 0.014), and shorter postoperative stays (7 \u00b1 3 days vs 10 \u00b1 3 days, P = 0.0013). It seems that laparoscopic primary closure of the CBD combined with PTCD can shorten the operation time and postoperative stays as compared with laparoscopic choledocholithotomy with T-tube placement for the treatment of CBD stones.",

        "title": "Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration with Primary Closure for Management of Choledocholithiasis: A Retrospective Analysis and Comparison with Conventional T-tube Drainage",
        "abstract": "Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) had become one of the main options for management of choledocholithiasis. This retrospective comparative study aimed to evaluate on the feasibility and advantages of primary closure versus conventional T-tube drainage of the common bile duct (CBD) after laparoscopic choledochotomy. In this retrospective analysis, 100 patients (47 men and 53 women) with choledocholithiasis who underwent primary closure of the CBD (without T-tube drainage) after LCBDE (Group A) were compared with 92 patients who underwent LCBDE with T-tube drainage (Group B). Both groups were evaluated with regard to biliary complications, hospital stay, and recurrence of stones. The mean operation time was 104.12 minutes for Group A and 108.92 minutes for Group B (P = 0.069). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in Group A than that in Group B (6.95 days and 12.05 days, respectively; P < 0.001). In Group A, bile leakage occurred in two patients on postoperative Day 2 and Day 3, respectively. In Group B, bile leakage noted in one patient after removal of the T-tube on Day 14 after operation (P = 1.000). With a median follow-up time of 40 months for both groups, stone recurrence was noted in two patients in Group A and three patients in Group B (P = 0.672). Primary closure of the CBD is safe and feasible in selected patients after laparoscopic choledochotomy. It results in shorter duration of hospital stay without the need for carrying/care of a T-tube in the postoperative period and similar stone recurrence as that of the conventional method.",

        "title": "Long-term Outcome of Primary Closure After Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration Combined With Choledochoscopy",
        "abstract": "Background: Primary closure after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is considered to be a safe alternative to T-tube drainage on the basis of the short-term outcome. However, little published data exist regarding the biliary complications at the long-term follow-up of primary closure versus T-tube drainage following LCBDE. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess the long-term outcome of primary closure after LCBDE. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of 142 consecutive patients who underwent LCBDE combined with choledochoscopy for CBD stones. After LCBDE, the choledochotomy was closed by primary closure (group P) in 91 patients (64.1%) and with T-tube drainage (group T) in 51 patients (35.9%). The data on operative outcome and long-term biliary complications were compared between the 2 groups. Results: The mean operation time was significantly shorter in group P than group T (168.9\u00b150.1 min for group P vs. 198.0\u00b159.6 min for group T, P=0.002). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in group P than in group T (8.59\u00b16.0 d for group P vs. 14.96\u00b15.4 d for group T, P=0.001). Postoperative bile leak occurred in 2 patients (2.2%) in group P and 1 patient (2.0%) in group T. With a mean follow-up of 48.8 months, the stone recurrence rate in group P and group T were 4.4% and 5.9%, respectively (P=0.722). During the follow-up period, there was no sign of biliary stricture or other biliary complications in both groups. Conclusions: The long-term follow-up data on primary closure after LCBDE indicated a low incidence of recurrent stones, and no biliary strictures. Thus, primary closure after LCBDE with choledochoscopy is considered to be a safe and effective alternative to T-tube drainage in terms of long-term outcome.",

        "title": "Comparative Study of Three Bile Duct Closure Methods Following Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration for Choledocholithiasis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere are three choledochotomy closure methods available following laparoscopic common bile duct exploration: T-tube insertion, antegrade stenting, and primary choledochorrhaphy. We reviewed the experience of 12 years at our center searching for the optimal closure technique.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed retrospectively 146 patients that underwent one of the three closure methods from February 2004 to March 2016. Hospital stay, need for readmission, incidence of early and long-term complications, and biliary leakage development and their clinical impact were determined for each technique.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHospital stay was more prolonged, and need for readmission was higher in the T-tube group. Nine patients of the T-tube group (17.3%), 5 patients (8.6%) of the antegrade stenting group, and 1 patient of the primary suture group (2.8%) developed Dindo-Clavien \u22653 complications (P\u2009=\u2009.076). The incidence of biliary leakage was 3.8%, 8.6%, and 16.7% for the T-tube group, antegrade stenting group, and primary suture group, respectively. There was no grade C biliary fistula in the primary suture group, and all grade B leaks in these patients were only due to prolonged duration. The T-tube removal caused adverse events in 21.1% of the patients, and complications directly related with stents occurred in 9.6%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAntegrade stents or T-tube insertion do not provide any added value for choledochotomy closure but are charged with specific morbidity. On the contrary, despite biliary leaks being more frequent after primary suture, they are of little clinical consequence and may be managed on an outpatient basis.",

        "title": "T-Tube Use After Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration",
        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) has been verified to be an effective technique in treating choledocholithiasis, and T-tube insertion has been widely performed after LCBDE. With growing doubts regarding the effectiveness and safety of T-tube drainage (TTD), it has been suggested to replace such with primary duct closure (PDC). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness and safety of PDC compared with TTD after LCBDE. Methods: The PubMed, Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were used to accomplish a systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials and pro-/retrospective cohort studies that compared PDC alone or PDC combined with biliary drainage stenting (PDC+BD) with TTD after LCBDE. A subgroup analysis was established to compare PDC+BD with TTD. RevMan 5.3 was used for the statistical analysis. Results: A total of 2552 patients from 26 studies were included. The pooled odds ratio supported PDC, which yielded lower postoperative overall morbidity and incidence of bile leak and bile peritonitis and shorter surgical time and postoperative hospital stay when compared with TTD. In the subgroup analysis, PDC+BD showed significantly better results in terms of postoperative overall morbidity, incidence of bile leak and bile peritonitis, surgical time, and postoperative hospital stay than did TTD. PDC and PDC+BD showed no difference in the incidence of recurrent stones and biliary stricture during the long-term follow-up period compared with TTD. Conclusion: PDC alone or PDC+BD is superior to TTD as a duct-closure method after LCBDE.",

        "abstract": "Objective Biliary duct management is of great significance after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) combined with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) in the treatment of cholecystolithiasis accompanied with common bile duct (CBD) stones. This study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of primary closure with C-tube drainage through cystic duct after LC\u2009+\u2009LCBDE. Methods Through a retrospective study, 290 patients who underwent LC\u2009+\u2009LCBDE in our hospital from January 2019 to April 2022 were enrolled and divided into 2 groups. 143 patients underwent primary closure with C-tube drainage through cystic duct (C-tube group) and the other 147 patients underwent traditional T-tube drainage (T-tube group). Personal information, perioperative examinations, surgical results, and follow-up results were collected and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences in the average age, gender, the mean of CBD diameters and the rate of comorbidities (acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, acute pancreatitis and acute cholangitis) between the two groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Hospital stay, postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the C-tube group than T-tube group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, the average time of placing and removal the drainage tubes was significantly less than those of the T-tube group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). This study also showed significant differences in the incidence of postoperative abdominal infection and soft tissue infection in the two groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications including cholangitis, bile duct stenosis, mortality in two groups. There were also no significant differences between the two groups of the recurrence of CBD stones, reoperation and readmition in 30 days during the median follow-up of 6 months. Conclusions Compared with T tube drainage, patients with C-tube drainage after LC\u2009+\u2009LCBDE with primary closure of cystic duct recovered faster and had fewer complications. C-tube drainage is a safe and feasible treatment option for patients with cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis.",
