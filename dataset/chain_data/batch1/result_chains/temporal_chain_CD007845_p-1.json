        "title": "Retrospective study on the use of bitter melon for type 2 diabetes at Dansai Crown Prince Hospital, Thailand",
        "abstract": "Background and Objective : Bitter melon\u00a0( Momordica charantia )\u00a0has been widely used as an herbal medicine for lowering blood glucose levels. To date, there have been very few clinical studies to determine the efficacy of bitter melon in diabetes patients. This study was conducted to describe the use of bitter melon in diabetes patient by evaluating the hypoglycemic effect and adverse events at \u00a0Dansai Crown Prince Hospital, Thailand. Methods: This retrospective study reviewed medical records and database of type 2 diabetes patients receiving bitter melon from January, 1999 to February, 2008. Fasting plasma glucose levels, laboratory data and adverse events were extracted from existing records. Results : Bitter melon 800-1,600 mg/day was added to the treatment regimens of 82 diabetic patients with mildly to moderately uncontrolled blood glucose levels (187.8 + 47.0 mg/dL) . Adverse events were found in few cases. The most common adverse event was hypoglycemia. The blood glucose lowering effect of bitter melon was assessable in 42 patients. After adding bitter melon to the current regimens of the patients (sulfonylureas + metformin) for at least 14 days, fasting plasma glucose was reduced by 26.9 + 40.8 mg/dL (p<0.001). Atter the addition of bitter melon, 19 patients (45.2%) achieved target therapeutic range of FPG levels. Conclusion: The retrospective study for the 8 year usage of bitter melon at Dansai Crown Prince Hospital suggested that bitter melon may be a useful adjunctive treatment to decrease blood glucose levels in patients with mildly to moderately uncontrolled diabetes.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate effect of the Momordica charantia (MC) capsules, combined with insulin hormone and a high-fiber diet on the treatment of diabetic dogs.\u00a0 Twenty-five client-owned dogs with naturally occurring diabetes mellitus were entered into the study.\u00a0 All dogs were fed with a commercially available restricted-fat high-fiber diet and received insulin subcutaneously once a day. Twenty dogs in the treatment group received 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) of MC capsules orally every 12 h with meals for two months. The other 5 dogs were in the control group and received only insulin therapy. The fasting blood glucose levels, serum fructosamine concentrations, serum chemistry profiles and complete blood counts were obtained monthly. Serial blood glucose curves were performed to adjust insulin doses for an individual\u2019s requirement monthly for 2 months. After receiving the MC capsules (200 mg/kg BW/day) for 2 months, the serum fructosamine and fasting blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower than those in the control group and those before treatment. The results obtained from complete blood count and serum chemistry profiles were not significantly different between the control and treatment groups, except for the alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP) levels. The ALP levels in the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control group throughout the study. In conclusion, the use of the MC capsule at 200 mg/kg BW/day combined with restricted-fat high-fiber diet improved glycemic control more efficiently than diabetic treatment with insulin alone. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n Key words:\u00a0Momordica charantia, serum fructosamine, diabetes mellitus, dogs.",

The study's design and outcomes are also comparable, but it focuses on canine diabetes mellitus instead."
