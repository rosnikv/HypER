        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPregnancy is a condition in which the glycemic index (GI) may be of particular relevance because maternal glucose is the main energy substrate for intrauterine growth.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim was to compare the effects of low-GI and conventional dietary strategies on pregnancy outcomes in healthy women. Compliance and acceptability were also investigated.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe subjects were assigned alternately to receive dietary counseling that encouraged either low-GI (LGI) carbohydrate foods or high-fiber, moderate-to-high GI (HGI) foods and were studied 5 times between <16 wk gestation and delivery. Of the 70 women who met the inclusion criteria, 62 completed the study (32 in the LGI and 30 in the HGI groups). Primary outcomes were measures of fetal size.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean diet GI fell significantly in the LGI group but not in the HGI group. Compared with the LGI group, women in the HGI group gave birth to infants who were heavier (3408 +/- 78 compared with 3644 +/- 90 g; P = 0.051) and had a higher birth centile (48 +/- 5 compared with 69 +/- 5; P = 0.005), a higher ponderal index (2.62 +/- 0.04 compared with 2.74 +/- 0.04; P = 0.03), and a higher prevalence of large-for-gestational age (3.1% compared with 33.3%; P = 0.01). Women in the LGI group found the diet easier to follow.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBecause birth weight and ponderal index may predict chronic disease in later life, a low-GI diet may favorably influence long-term outcomes.",

        "title": "Maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy.",
        "abstract": "In humans, the link between the maternal diet and the outcome of pregnancy is best illustrated by the classic study of wartime famine in Holland. During the famine it is likely that a low food intake reduced the glucose stream from the mother to fetus and gave rise to smaller size at birth. Maternal glucose production is also influenced by the type of carbohydrate in the diet. Even when famine and starvation are not issues, a low dietary glycemic index can alter maternal blood glucose production and the area under the glucose curve, and give rise to reductions in fetal growth and infant weight at birth. Reduced food intake in famine areas would also reduce the concentration of micronutrients in the maternal diet. Two micronutrients (iron and folate) have effects on pregnancy outcome that have been shown with some consistency in pregnant women. Emerging evidence now suggests that use of micronutrient- containing prenatal vitamins before and during pregnancy is associated with reductions in the risk of congenital defects, preterm delivery, low infant birthweight, and preeclampsia.",

        "title": "Proposal of a Mediterranean diet index for pregnant women",
        "abstract": "Numerous studies have addressed the nutritional needs of pregnant women. The nutritional status of the woman before and during gestation affects the growth of the fetus and the course of the pregnancy and influences the risk of obesity for mother and infant. The aim of this study was to propose a diet quality index for pregnancy based on a Mediterranean-type diet (MDS-P), evaluating the diet of a group of pregnant women by applying the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and evaluating their intake of micronutrients required in optimal amounts during pregnancy, such as Fe, folic acid and Ca. The data used to construct this index (MDS-P) were gathered by means of a FFQ specifically designed for pregnant women. The mean MDS of this group, was 4\u00b731 (sd 1\u00b732), considered to represent satisfactory compliance with the Mediterranean diet (range 0\u20138). The mean MDS-P (range 0\u201311), which also takes account of dietary intake or supplements of folic acid, Fe and Ca was 7\u00b753 (sd 1\u00b744), indicating a compliance of around 70 %. The present study findings suggest that the MDS-P, which evaluates the adequacy of folic acid, Fe and Ca as well as compliance with the Mediterranean diet, may represent a valid tool for the specific assessment of the diet of pregnant women living in countries in the Mediterranean area. Further studies are required to complete the validation process.",

        "title": "Immune system function, stress, exercise and nutrition profile can affect pregnancy outcome: Lessons from a Mediterranean cohort",
        "abstract": "Pregnancy is associated with major physiological and future psychosocial changes, and maternal adaptation to these changes is crucial for normal foetal development. Psychological stress in pregnancy predicts an earlier birth and lower birth weight. Pregnancy-specific stress contributes directly to preterm delivery. The importance of nutrition and exercise during pregnancy with regard to pregnancy outcome has long been acknowledged. This importance has only been further emphasized by the recent changes in food quality and availability, lifestyle changes and a new understanding of foetal programming\u2019s effects on adult outcomes. We hypothesised that for a successful pregnancy certain events at a nutritional, immune, psycho-emotional and genetic level should be tightly linked. Therefore, in this study we followed an \u2018integrative\u2019 approach to investigate how maternal stress, nutrition, pregnancy planning and exercise influence pregnancy outcome. A key finding of our study is that there was a significant reduction in the intake of alcohol, caffeine-containing and sugary drinks during pregnancy. However, passive smoking in the household remained unchanged. In terms of immune profile, a significant inverse correlation was noted between difficulty to \u2018fight\u2019 an infection and number of colds (r=\u22120.289, P=0.003) as well as the number of infections (r=\u22120.446, P<0.0001) during pregnancy. The vast majority of the pregnant women acquired a more sedentary lifestyle in the third trimester. In planned, but not in unplanned, pregnancies stress predicted infant weight, independent of age and body mass index (BMI). Notably, in mothers with negative attitudes towards the pregnancy, those with an unplanned pregnancy gave birth to infants with significantly higher weights than those with planned pregnancies. Collectively these data suggest that there is a higher order of complexity, possibly involving gene-environment interactions that work together to ensure a positive outcome for the mother as well as the foetus.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Behaviors during pregnancy including eating, exercise, cigarette smoking, and other substance use affect the health of a pregnant woman and her fetus. However, little is known about what influences pregnant women to engage in these health behaviors. Based upon relevant theory, we hypothesized that because health-promoting behaviors require continuous efforts that may depend upon a reliable, stable set of resources, intrapersonal traits, namely self-esteem and optimism, would be associated with the practice of health-promoting behaviors during pregnancy. In addition, we hypothesized that variables reactive to the more immediate context, pregnancy-specific stress and perceived control over pregnancy, would be associated with the practice of health-impairing behaviors. We distinguished health-promoting and health-impairing behaviors in a diverse sample of 165 pregnant women and investigated whether such behaviors are associated with distinct psychosocial factors. Results supported study hypotheses and provide evidence that even after controlling for maternal age, income, body mass index, and gestation, a stable, self-relevant disposition, self-esteem, is associated with the practice of health-promoting behaviors in pregnancy whereas pregnancy-specific stress, a situationally-evoked factor, is associated with the practice of health-impairing prenatal behaviors. Perceived control over pregnancy, which may reflect stable disposition and situational perceptions, was associated with health-promoting and health-impairing behaviors.",

        "title": "An Examination of Maternal Stress and Secondhand Smoke Exposure on Perinatal Smoking Status",
        "abstract": "OF DISSERTATION AN EXAMINATION OF MATERNAL STRESS AND SECONDHAND SMOKE EXPOSURE ON PERINATAL SMOKING STATUS The median prevalence of smoking among women of childbearing age in the United States is 22.4%. Of women who identify themselves as smokers in the three months prior to conception, 55% quit during pregnancy; however, 40% of those who quit relapse and return to smoking within six months after delivery. Smoking has been identified as an important means of stress management among smokers in general, and though limited to the perinatal period, pregnancy-specific stress adds to a woman\u2019s typical day-to-day stress burden. Little data exists as to the effect of SHS exposure on smoking status during pregnancy and the impact of SHS exposure on the maternal perception of stress is unknown. Due to limited evidence, a critical need exists to examine the relationships of perceived maternal stress, SHS exposure, and perinatal smoking status in order to better understand perinatal smoking behaviors. The purposes of this dissertation were to: 1) evaluate the literature examining the relationship between the variables of maternal stress, SHS exposure, and perinatal smoking status; 2) determine the reliability and validity of the Everyday Stressors Index (ESI) use in pregnant women; and 3) to investigate the impacts of maternal perception of everyday stress, and SHS exposure on perinatal smoking status. Evidence obtained from the critical review of the literature supported an association between psychosocial stress and smoking during pregnancy or postpartum. Little information regarding the role of SHS exposure on perinatal smoking status was discovered. Psychometric testing of the ESI demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability, and factor analysis yielded three factors capturing three important domains of everyday stress. SHS exposure emerged as the most significant predictor of smoking status. Persistent smokers/relapsers had the highest ESI scores, followed by quitters, and then nonsmokers. While ESI means decreased in all smoking status groups from the first to the third trimester, the magnitude of decrease was not predictive. A significant interaction effect of SHS exposure in the home and decrease in ESI score occurred in the quit group only with quitters 1.14 times more likely to experience a decrease in ESI score compared to smokers/relapsers.",
