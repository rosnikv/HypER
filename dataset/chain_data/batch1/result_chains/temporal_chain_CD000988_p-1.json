        "title": "Buflomedil in Arterial Occlusive Disease: Results of a Controlled Multicenter Study",
        "abstract": "In a double-blind, randomised multicentre study buflomedil, a vasoactive substance, was compared with placebo in the treatment of 93 patients with chronic arterial occlusive disease. After a run-in period of four weeks the patients received either buflomedil (600 mg daily) or placebo over 12 weeks. The pain-free and the total walking distances improved significantly in both groups. However, the differences in the improvement between the two groups were highly signifi cant and in favour of buflomedil: for the pain-free walking distance p<0.001 and for the total walking distance p<0.01. The results indicate that buflomedil has a beneficial effect on the symptoms and lengthens the walking distance in patients with arterial occlusive disease.",

        "title": "Multicenter Double-Blind Study of Ticlopidine in the Treatment of Intermittent Claudication and the Prevention of its Complications",
        "abstract": "In this multicenter trial 169 patients with chronic intermittent claudication due to obstructive peripheral vascular disease were randomized in a double- blind fashion into two parallel groups receiving either 250 mg ticlopidine or placebo, twice daily. At entry, the two groups (83 ticlopidine, 86 placebo) were well matched for the major clinical features apart from an excess of women in the ticlopidine group. At six months, 167 patients were alive, 2 having died of malignant disease (1 from each group). At this stage, 39 patients from the ticlo pidine group and 29 from the placebo group (p = 0.04) had increased their walking distance by more than 50% of baseline values. For the groups as a whole pain-free and total walking distance were greater in the ticlopidine group than in the placebo group (194 vs 124 meters, p = 0.03 and 236 vs 170 meters, p = 0.04, respectively). Two patients from the ticlopidine group vs 9 patients from the placebo group (p = 0.03) developed significant cardiovascular events during the study. These results indicate that ticlopidine has a beneficial effect both in the treatment of the symptoms and the prevention of vascular complica tions in patients with intermittent claudication.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the treatment of intermittent claudication using ticlopidine, which is a different approach from the source paper that focused on buflomedil in arterial occlusive disease. However, both papers deal with the treatment of similar conditions, indicating that the key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the understanding of the disease and its treatment options, which may include the findings from the source paper."

        "title": "Is It Possible to Reduce the Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Subjects Suffering from Intermittent Claudication of the Lower Limbs?",
        "abstract": "Summary This study meta-analysed randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials in patients with intermittent claudication of the lower limbs comparing ticlopidine to placebo in order to test the hypothesis that the drug, a pure antiplatelet agent, is able to reduce the incidence of thrombotic cardio-vascular events on atherosclerotic arteries in these patients. A highly significant reduction, from 9% to 3% (p ranging from 0.006 to 0.002), was observed for fatal or non-fatal cardio-vascular events in a total of 611 patients (301 with ticlopidine, 310 with placebo). The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 to 12 months. Side-effects, defined as withdrawal from study medication for any reason but death, cardio-vascular events or cancer, were 2.4 times more frequent in the ticlopidine treated patients as compared to placebo. We concluded that in this high risk population, prevention of cardio-vascular events is likely to be effective.",

        "abstract": "We conducted a controlled multicenter trial with central randomization and evaluation of events under blind conditions involving 652 patients with unstable angina. Patients were treated either with conventional therapy alone (group C) (n = 338) or with conventional therapy combined with an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. (group C + T) (n = 314). Patients were assigned randomly within 48 hours of admission and followed up for 6 months. With the \"intention-to-treat\" approach, the primary end points, vascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, were observed in 13.6% of the patients in group C and in 7.3% of the patients in group C + T, which is a reduction in risk of 46.3% (p = 0.009). Vascular mortality was 4.7% in patients in group C and 2.5% in patients in group C + T, which is a reduction in risk of 46.8% (p = 0.139). The risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was reduced by 46.1% (p = 0.039), with a frequency of 8.9% in patients in group C and 4.8% in patients in group C + T. New Q wave myocardial infarction occurred with a frequency of 6.8% in patients in group C and 3.8% in patients in group C + T, which is a reduction in risk of 44.1% (p = 0.091). Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction was 10.9% in patients in group C and 5.1% in patients in group C + T, which is a reduction in risk of 53.2% (p = 0.006). These findings confirm the importance of platelets in the pathogenesis of unstable angina and the usefulness of antiplatelet treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "Background Ticlopidine, an antiplatelet agent with a unique mechanism of action, is now available for clinical use in the United States and Canada. Summary of Comment Recently two large randomized trials demonstrated that ticlopidine can reduce the risk of subsequent stroke in patients presenting with a transient ischemic attack or stroke. One study found that ticlopidine was more effective than aspirin for stroke prevention; however, it was less well tolerated than aspirin and was associated with severe but reversible neutropenia in almost 1% of patients. Conclusions Ticlopidine is effective for both primary and secondary stroke prevention. It has a favorable risk/benefit ratio and is a particularly attractive option for patients who are unable to take aspirin.",

        "title": "Ticlopidine hydrochloride use and threatened stroke.",
        "abstract": "Ticlopidine hydrochloride is an antiplatelet agent of proven antithrombotic efficacy that in December 1991 became available for general clinical use in the United States. The relative value of ticlopidine compared with aspirin, also an effective antiplatelet agent, has become a key clinical issue. Whereas ticlopidine is somewhat more effective than aspirin for preventing stroke in certain populations, it is also more expensive and potentially toxic. We recommend its use for patients with threatened stroke who are intolerant of aspirin and for patients who have cerebral ischemic symptoms despite aspirin therapy. Patients surviving major ischemic stroke make up a third group for whom ticlopidine use may be recommended in preference to aspirin. The use of ticlopidine rather than aspirin in patients with other cerebrovascular conditions is not strongly supported by existing data. The risk-benefit-cost equation involving ticlopidine versus other antithrombotic therapies is complex, rendering a wide range of acceptable management practices. If reliable laboratory monitoring for neutropenia during the first 3 months of therapy is not feasible, ticlopidine should not be used.",
