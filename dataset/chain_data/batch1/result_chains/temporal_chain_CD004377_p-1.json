Thirty-two patients with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis and wrist involvement were evaluated. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was better than the placebo in relieving pain at rest and while gripping. In addition, grip strength, measured as power and work done, immediately improved following transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation but returned almost to initial values between assessments. No significant improvement was shown for the placebo group.",

        "title": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment outcome in long-term users.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPrevious reviewers of the literature on transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) outcome have concluded the following: (a) there are few long-term TENS follow-up studies, and (b) fewer studies have addressed the effect of long-term TENS use on outcome variables other than pain (e.g., function). DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/OUTCOME MEASURES: From a population of 2,003 chronic pain patients (CPPs) who bought a TENS device for pain management, 506 patients were randomly selected and interviewed by telephone long enough after purchase to allow at least 6 months of TENS use. The interview process used a structured \"skip\" questionnaire designed to assess the CPPs' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of TENS for a variety of outcome variables. Of the 506 CPPs interviewed, 376 (74.3%) had used their TENS device for 6 months or longer and were defined as long-term users. The responses of this group of CPPs to the telephone questionnaire were then subjected to statistical analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPaired t-tests, correlated z-tests, SS Wilks, and chi-square tests demonstrated statistically significant change or improvement (p < 0.05) that paralleled the introduction of TENS use in the following outcome variables: less pain interference with work, home, and social activities; increased activity level and pain management; decreased use of other therapies (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, chiropractic); decreased use of narcotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that TENS is associated with improvement on multiple outcome variables in addition to pain relief for CPPs who are long-term users. Also, for some CPPs, long-term TENS use continues to be effective.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nA study was conducted to assess a variety of treatment outcomes in long-term users of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) who suffer from chronic pain. Key components of the study examined the effects of long-term TENS therapy on pain-related medications and physical/occupational therapy (PT/OT) use.\n\n\nDESIGN\nFrom a population of 2,(X)3 chronic pain patients (CPPs) who acquired a TENS device (Epix XL, Empi, Inc., St. Paul, MN, U.S.A.) for pain management, a randomly selected sample of 376 patients who used TENS were interviewed by telephone by an independent research firm. The survey assessed a variety of outcome variables including changes in medication use, number of pain-related medications, and use of PT/OT prior to TENS and after a minimum 6 months of TENS treatment. The data were subjected to a paired t test analysis. A cost simulation model was then applied to the medication and PT/OT data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean duration of pain, for which TENS was prescribed, was 40 +/- 60 months. As compared with the period prior to TENS use, this long-term TENS user group reported a statistically significant reduction in the following types of pain medications: opiate analgesics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids. PT/OT use was also significantly reduced. Cost simulations of pain medications and PT/OT are presented.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term use of TENS is associated with a significant reduction in the utilization of pain medication and PT/OT. In this study population, cost simulations of medication and PT/OT indicate that with long-term TENS use, costs can be reduced up to 55% for medications and up to 69% for PT/OT. The potential for TENS associated improvement, combined with reduced medication-related complications and costs, are important points that clinicians should consider when constructing a treatment plan for chronic pain patients. Finally, cost simulation techniques provide a useful tool for assessing outcomes in pain treatment and research.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis article examines the perceived helpfulness of treatment components in comprehensive interdisciplinary pain management programs as they relate to cost.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPatient satisfaction results assessed by the Treatment Helpfulness Questionnaire (THQ) and treatment costs were compared for 309 subjects at three comprehensive interdisciplinary chronic pain management centers. All subjects completed the THQ immediately after treatment, and follow-up data were gathered 3 to 6 months after the end of treatment at two of the three centers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRatings of treatment helpfulness were not found to be related to either demographic or medical variables. Mean THQ ratings for many treatment modalities did differ significantly between centers, but subjects at all centers generally gave higher THQ ratings to psychological and educational therapies than to physical therapy and medical modalities both at posttreatment and at follow-up evaluations. More costly treatments generally did not receive higher ratings than less costly ones. THQ ratings tended to decline modestly from posttreatment to follow-up evaluations.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor the selected population of patients undergoing comprehensive interdisciplinary pain management, educational and psychological approaches received high ratings of helpfulness at a relatively low cost. Further research is needed to address whether comparative patient satisfaction data can be used at pain centers to produce improved outcomes at reduced costs.",

        "title": "A Preliminary Study of Multidimensional Pain Inventory Profile Differences in Predicting Treatment Outcome in a Heterogeneous Cohort of Patients with Chronic Pain",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective was to evaluate whether the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is effective for predicting response to interdisciplinary treatment in a heterogeneous group of patients with chronic pain. Changes in patients' profiles to a predominantly adaptive coping status after treatment also were assessed. DesignA prospective study was conducted of patients with an array of pain conditions. A standard evaluation battery, including measures of self-reported pain and disability, psychosocial functioning, helpfulness of the program, and medication use, was used for all patients before and after treatment. The MPI status of patients was evaluated and differential response to treatment was assessed. MethodsSixty-five consecutive patients with chronic pain were evaluated before and immediately after participation in an interdisciplinary pain treatment program. This heterogeneous pain-condition cohort was also differentiated on the basis of the MPI to evaluate potential differential response to treatment. ResultsResults revealed significant improvement among these patients with chronic pain when a comprehensive interdisciplinary pain-management program was administered. This improvement was seen across the variety of outcomes evaluated, including narcotic medication use. Most important, the MPI subgroup classification did not significantly predict the degree of positive treatment outcome; all subgroups improved. ConclusionsAlthough there were major differences in psychosocial functioning before treatment, the MPI was not found to significantly predict response to interdisciplinary treatment in a heterogeneous group of patients with chronic pain. Thus, a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment program may achieve its full effectiveness across a wide array of pain/disability-related outcome variables, regardless of initial MPI profile categorization.",

        "abstract": "The intersection of traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic chronic pain poses a significant challenge for the health practitioner. Effective intervention requires psychological and neuropsychological evaluation, multidisciplinary teamwork, and an understanding of a wide range of pain disorders and their relationship to traumatic brain injury. Assessment must include documentation of both current functioning and premorbid history. Pain interacts with cognitive impairment, mood and anxiety disorders, dysinhibition syndromes, and personality disorders, posing significant diagnostic dilemmas and treatment challenges. Coordinated care requires multiple, ongoing interventions from a variety of specialists. Patient involvement, focusing on internal locus of control, mediates successful treatment.",

        "title": "Subjective Quality of Life Following Traumatic Brain Injury",
        "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause impairment of functioning, that \ndisrupts critical aspects of psychosocial functioning such as work, interpersonal \nrelationships, and participation in recreational activity (Jennett, 1997; Seibert et \nal., 2002; Tate, Lulham, Broe, Strettles, & Pfaff, 1989). As such, TBI affects the \nquality of life of those who suffer its ongoing effects (Ponsford, Sloane, & Snow, \n1996; Tennant, Macdermott, & Neary, 1995). Although many TBI rehabilitation \nservices state their aims as being to optimize quality of life following injury, there \nhas been very little research in this area. Reasons for this include ambiguity in \nconceptualisation of quality of life and lack of consensus about appropriate \nmeasures. Building on recent international consensus group recommendations \n(e.g., Bullinger, 2002; National Institutes of Health [NIH], 1999), this thesis \naddressed some fundamental gaps in knowledge in the TBl/QOL field. \nThis project aimed to provide an understanding of SQOL outcome and \nultimately develop predictive models of SQOL outcome following TBI. The \nproject utilized outcome data from a large population-based sample, collected \nprospectively by the Neurotrauma Register of Tasmania. In summary, Study 1 \nidentified an appropriate measure of subjective quality of life (SQOL), Frisch's \n(1994) Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) and found it was sensitive and \nappropriate for adults with TBI. However, no research had been conducted with \nthe QOLI within the TBI population. \nStudy 2 confirmed a three-factor structure for the QOLI using both \nexploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and identified only subtle \ndifferences between the US-based normative distribution and pre-injury estimates of a sample of 470 people with TBI. Study 3 reported SQOL outcome \nover four time-points to 12 months following injury for the QOLI Total and QOLI \nFactor scores with a sample of 663 participants. Significant deterioration was \nobserved in QOLI scores at one and three months following injury, returning to \nnear pre-injury estimates by six months. Study 4 examined outcomes and \nrelationships between a large number of potential predictive variables identified \nfrom previous research with QOLI outcomes. A number of important predictive \nvariables were identified across the five domains suggested by Berger, Leven, \nPirente, Bouillon, & Neugebauer (1999). Study 5 used regression modeling to \nconfirm predictive models of SQOL outcome at one, three, six and twelve \nmonths following TBI and provided a means of identifying those at risk of poor \noutcome. \nThis fundamental TBl/SQOL research provides clinicians and researchers \nwith the structure as well as pre and post injury normative distributions of an \nappropriate measure of SQOL. The predictive models produced by this analysis \nexplained more variance than models reported in previous research, correctly \npredicting participants' SQOL outcome to within a single point in over 70% of \ncases. The predictive models will be valuable for rehabilitation clinicians who \nwish to identify people who are at risk of poorer outcome. Building on the results \nof this project, there are many avenues for further research. These include \nextending the methodology to predict SQOL outcome over two, five or more \nyears following injury, and developing effective interventions that facilitate \nrestoration of SQOL following TBI.",
