        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\n. To compare the safety and efficacy of a topical diclofenac solution versus oral diclofenac in relieving the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy equivalence trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 622 men and women with radiological evidence of primary knee OA and mild to severe symptoms were randomly assigned to treatment with a topical diclofenac solution plus placebo oral capsules, or placebo topical solution plus oral diclofenac (50 mg) capsules. Patients applied 50 drops of study solution and took 1 study capsule 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy variables were pain and physical function, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) VA 3.1 OA Index, and patient global assessment (PGA). Equivalence in the per-protocol group was based on previously defined ranges of clinically significant difference. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe difference in mean (95% CI) change scores (final minus baseline) between treatments was 13.3 mm (-8.6 to 35.2) for pain (total scale 500 mm), 71.0 mm (-2.4 to 144.5) for physical function (total scale 1700 mm), and 4.3 mm (-1.2 to 9.8) for PGA (total scale 100 mm). The CI for each efficacy variable fell within the predefined equivalence ranges (pain, +/- 75 mm; physical function, +/- 255 mm; PGA, +/- 20 mm), indicating that no clinically relevant difference was found between the 2 treatment arms. Safety analyses of patients applying topical diclofenac solution revealed some minor skin irritation at the application site--mostly skin dryness in 83/311 (27%) patients--but a significantly reduced incidence, relative to oral diclofenac, of total and severe gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. The number of patients developing abnormal liver function tests (including clinically significant elevation), hemoglobin, and creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the oral diclofenac group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nApplication of this topical diclofenac solution to the knee of patients with OA produced relief of symptoms equivalent to oral diclofenac, with minor local skin irritation, but significantly reduced incidence of diclofenac-related GI complaints and abnormal laboratory values.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac diethylamine gel, 1.16%, 4 g applied qid for 3 weeks to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with OA of the knee washed out their OA medications for at least 5 drug half-lives. Patients with adequately high baseline pain scores were randomized to apply either double-blind active or placebo gel for 3 weeks. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g/day) was supplied as rescue medication. In a diary, patients recorded compliance to dosing and use of rescue medication and assessed daily pain on movement, spontaneous pain, and pain relief. At weekly site visits, patients completed the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index Questionnaire, which includes assessment of pain, stiffness, and physical function, and assessed pain intensity \"right now.\" At the final visit, a global assessment of treatment efficacy was completed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 238 randomized patients, 237 were included in the intent to treat efficacy analysis. Treatments differed significantly for daily pain on movement at Day 5, and continued on most days through end of study. Peak differences were achieved in the second week. On the primary outcome, average pain on movement over Days 1-14, diclofenac gel was significantly superior to placebo gel. Scores for all 3 WOMAC indices for diclofenac gel treatment were significantly superior to placebo at Weeks 2 and 3. A significant difference was achieved on pain intensity \"right now\" at all 3 weeks. At the end of the study, patients rated diclofenac gel as significantly more effective in treating the pain of OA of the knee (p = 0.03) compared to placebo. There were no safety issues concerning adverse events or laboratory values.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDiclofenac gel was effective and safe for relief of symptoms of OA of the knee over 3 weeks of dosing.",

        "title": "Comparison of the Effectiveness of Pulsed and Continuous Diclofenac Phonophoresis in Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Purpose) The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of pulsed and continuous diclofenac gel phonophoresis with topical diclofenac gel treatment. (Methods) Eighty patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to 4 groups. The first group received continuous diclofenac gel phonophoresis, the second group received pulsed diclofenac gel phonophoresis, the third group received diclofenac gel with sham ultrasound, and the fourth group received acoustic gel applied with sham ultrasound. Range of knee motion, VAS pain at rest and in activity, the WOMAC Index and 20 m walking time were evaluated before the treatment, at the end of treatment and 1 month after the treatment. (Results) Improvements were found in VAS pain at rest, VAS pain in activity, WOMAC pain and physical function scores in all of the groups up to 1 month after the therapy. Both modalities of phonophoresis were shown to improve VAS pain at rest, VAS pain in activity, WOMAC pain and physical function scores compared to the other treatments. There was no significant difference in the improvements between the pulsed phonophoresis group and the continuous phonophoresis group. (Conclusion) We showed that both continuous and pulsed ultrasound diclofenac gel phonophoresis is more effective for pain and functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis than topical application of diclofenac gel, and that the effectiveness of pulsed phonophoresis and continuous phonophoresis is similar.",

        "title": "Improved Pain and Function in Knee Osteoarthritis with Dexamethasone Phonophoresis: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Background Intraarticular corticosteroid injection is an adjunct to core treatments for relief of moderate-to-severe pain in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. This randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of dexamethasone phonophoresis (DxPh) on knee OA. Patients and Methods Forty six female patients with knee OA were randomized into two equal groups. The study group received DxPh over the medial side of the knee, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and quadriceps strengthening exercises. Control group received ultrasound therapy and the same TENS and exercise program. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the pain subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pre- and posttreatment. Functional mobility was assessed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, total WOMAC, and the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC. The minimal clinically identifiable difference was used to calculate treatment effect sizes of both modalities, which was compared to intraarticular steroid injections. Results The VAS, TUG, and WOMAC scores improved with both modalities. Pain intensity improved by 50.6%\u201358.0% in the study group (VAS and pain subscale of WOMAC, respectively) compared to 17.8%\u201328.6% for the control group. Functional mobility showed a higher rate of improvement in the DxPh group compared to control (37.7 vs. 17.5% for TUG and 53.2 vs. 23.0 and 56.1 vs. 26.4% for the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC, respectively). Posttreatment results revealed statistically and clinically significant improvement in pain intensity and functional mobility in the DxPh group. Conclusion DxPh resulted in a greater improvement in pain and function in patients with knee OA than therapeutic ultrasound combined with exercise and TENS. The effect size of phonophoresis was clinically significant and higher than that reported for intraarticular steroid injection from pooled data in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common subtype of arthritis. To date, treatment of OA focuses primarily on alleviating pain and improving joint function. The lack of a vascular system within synovial joints and the rapid removal of agents due to synovial exchange hinder continuous delivery of OA drugs. However, these obstacles are being addressed by promising nanoscale drugs. Methods: We synthesize and assemble a hydrogen peroxide [H2O2, belongs to the category of active oxygen species (ROS)]-sensitive nanomicelle, which is loaded with the anti-inflammation drug dexamethasone and chondrogenic differentiation factor cartilage-derivedmor-phogeneticprotein-1. The micelle can induce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair cartilage while inhibiting joint inflammation. Results: The prepared nanoparticles were of uniform size and displayed an obvious core-shell structure. Under H2O2 stimulation, the shell layer could be removed gradually. The drug-loaded micelle effectively inhibited proliferation of activated macrophages, induced macrophage apoptosis with an anti-inflammatory effect, and caused the BMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes. Conclusion: This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for further development of a drug-loaded micelle in the healing of osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is an inflammatory and degenerative joint disease with severe effects on individuals, society, and the economy that affects millions of elderly people around the world. To date, there are no effective treatments for OA; however, there are some treatments that slow or prevent its progression. Polyfunctional nanosystems have many advantages, such as controlled release, targeted therapy and high loading rate, and have been widely used in OA treatment. Previous mechanistic studies have revealed that inflammation and ROS are interrelated, and a large number of studies have demonstrated that ROS play an important role in different types of OA development. In this review article, we summarize third-generation ROS-sensitive nanomaterials that scavenge excessive ROS from chondrocytes and osteoclasts in vivo. We only focus on polymer-based nanoparticles (NPs) and do not review the effects of drug-loaded or heavy metal NPs. Mounting evidence suggests that polyfunctional nanosystems will be a promising therapeutic strategy in OA therapy due to their unique characteristics of being sensitive to changes in the internal environment.",

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), a common and disabling degenerative joint disease, affects millions of people worldwide and imposes a considerable burden on patients and society due to its high prevalence and economic costs. The pathogenesis of OA is closely related to the progressive degradation of articular cartilage and the accompany inflammation; however, articular cartilage itself cannot heal and modulate the inflammation due to the lack of nerves, blood vessels, and lymph-vessels. Therefore, reliable and effective methods to treat OA remain highly desired. Local administration of drugs or bioactive materials by intra-articular injection of the delivery system represents a promising approach to treat OA, especially considering the prolonged joint retention, cartilage or chondrocytes targeting, and stimuli-responsive release to achieve precision OA therapy. This article summarizes and discusses the advances in the currently used delivery systems (nanoparticle, hydrogel, liposome, and microsphere) and then focuses on their applications in OA treatment from the perspective of endogenous stimulus (redox reactions, pH, enzymes, and temperature) and exogenous stimulus (near-infrared, magnetic, and ultrasound)-responsive release. Finally, the challenges and potential future directions for the development of nano-delivery systems are summarized.",
