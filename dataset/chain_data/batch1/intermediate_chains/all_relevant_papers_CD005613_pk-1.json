        "title": "A Comparison of Bedtime Insulin Glargine with Bedtime Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Insulin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: Subgroup Analysis of Patients Taking Once-Daily Insulin in a Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel Group Study",
        "abstract": "Background:Basal insulin is frequently administered once daily. This subgroup analysis of a multicenter, randomized, parallel study compared insulin glargine (Lantus Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes, evaluating only patients treated previously with once-daily NPH insulin. Methods:Patients received bedtime insulin glargine or NPH insulin, with preprandial regular insulin. One hundred patients (mean age, 57.9 years; mean glycohemoglobin, 8.4%; mean fasting blood glucose, 167 mg/dL) were treated for up to 28 weeks. Results:Patients treated with insulin glargine (n = 52) and NPH insulin (n = 48) achieved similar reductions from baseline in glycohemoglobin (\u22120.41% versus \u22120.46%) and fasting blood glucose (\u221222 mg/dL versus \u221222 mg/dL) at week 28. The proportion of patients reaching target fasting blood glucose (<120 mg/dL) at 28 weeks was 34.2% with insulin glargine and 24.4% with NPH insulin. Similar proportions of patients achieved glycohemoglobin less than 7% and less than 8% in both groups. Baseline and week-28 mean daily doses of insulin glargine (27.3 IU versus 36.4 IU) were similar to NPH insulin doses (25.5 IU versus 30.2 IU). However, significantly fewer patients reported one or more episodes of hypoglycemia with insulin glargine (46.2%) versus NPH insulin (60.4%; P < 0.05). Significantly fewer patients also reported one or more symptomatic episodes confirmed by blood glucose less than 50 mg/dL with insulin glargine (17.3%) versus NPH insulin (31.3%; P < 0.005). Conclusion:Bedtime insulin glargine is as effective as bedtime NPH insulin in improving glycemic control, with significantly less hypoglycemia.",

        "title": "Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes: role of the long\u2010acting insulin glargine analogue",
        "abstract": "Insulin glargine is a long\u2010acting insulin analogue, with a longer duration of action and a flatter time\u2010action profile compared with NPH insulin. These properties can be predicted to result in higher glucose levels during the night and lower glucose levels after dinner following bedtime injection of insulin glargine compared with an equal dose of NPH insulin injected at bedtime. In two large\u2010scale clinical trials involving either insulin\u2010na\u00efve (426 patients treated for 1 year) or previously insulin\u2010treated (518 patients treated for 28 weeks) patients with type 2 diabetes, comparing addition of once\u2010daily insulin glargine or NPH insulin to oral agents, these predictions were proven to be correct. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was reduced by 58% in insulin\u2010naive patients and by 22% in previously insulin\u2010treated patients, and dinner\u2010time glucose control was significantly better with insulin glargine than with NPH insulin once daily in the study in insulin\u2010naive patients. The \u2018treat\u2010to\u2010target study\u2019 (756 insulin\u2010naive patients treated for 24 weeks) showed that good glycaemic control can be achieved with aggressive titration of the insulin dose with either once\u2010daily insulin glargine or NPH insulin combined with oral agents (mean endpoint HbA1c was 6\u00b796% with insulin glargine and 6\u00b797% with NPH insulin); however, this was achieved with less variability and nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin glargine. These data support use of insulin glargine instead of NPH insulin for basal insulin replacement in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY Prospective intervention trials using an intensive therapy approach in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes have provided evidence that achieving tight glycemic control can impede the development and progression of microvascular complications. Treatment of type 2 diabetic patients has revolved around the use of oral agents to improve insulin secretion or tissue sensitization. As therapy turns to the inclusion of insulin \u2013 most often in combination with oral agents \u2013 the physician and patient must both be prepared for the issues regarding management of an injectable agent. The objective of this article is to review current evidence supporting the benefits of adding insulin therapy to existing oral hypoglycemic regimens of patients for whom these therapies are no longer providing adequate glycemic control. Approaches to initiating insulin therapy and adjusting treatment regimens are discussed, with a view towards making the addition or switch to insulin a simple and achievable next step in treatment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInsulin glargine (LANTUS) is a once-daily basal insulin analog with a smooth 24-h time-action profile that provides effective glycemic control with reduced hypoglycemia risk (particularly nocturnal) compared with NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. A recent \"treat-to-target\" study has shown that more patients on insulin glargine reached HbA(1c) levels < or =7.0% without confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin. We further assessed the risk for hypoglycemia in a meta-analysis of controlled trials of a similar design for insulin glargine versus once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nAll studies were 24-28 weeks long, except one 52-week study, for which interim 20-week data were used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatient demographics were similar between the insulin glargine (n = 1,142) and NPH insulin (n = 1,162) groups. The proportion of patients achieving target HbA(1c) (< or =7.0%) was similar between insulin glargine-and NPH insulin-treated patients (30.8 and 32.1%, respectively). There was a consistent significant reduction of hypoglycemia risk associated with insulin glargine, compared with NPH insulin, in terms of overall symptomatic (11%; P = 0.0006) and nocturnal (26%; P < 0.0001) hypoglycemia. Most notably, the risk of severe hypoglycemia and severe nocturnal hypoglycemia were reduced with insulin glargine by 46% (P = 0.0442) and 59% (P = 0.0231), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results confirmed that insulin glargine given once daily reduces the risk of hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin, which can facilitate more aggressive insulin treatment to a HbA(1c) target of < or =7.0% in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The early initiation of insulin therapy to achieve good metabolic control is being increasingly considered in type 2 diabetes (1), but barriers, including fear of hypoglycemia, need to be overcome to achieve target glycemic control (2).\n\nInsulin glargine (glargine; Lantus) is a once-daily, basal human insulin analog. The 24-h duration and flat time-action profile of glargine (3) should give flexibility to patients in terms of the injection time despite targeting fasting blood glucose (FBG) close to normal: administration should be possible at any time of day provided it is at the same time each day. Previously, we have demonstrated similar levels of nocturnal hypoglycemia but better glycemic control with morning versus bedtime glargine plus three milligrams glimepiride (4).\n\nThe study objective was to compare the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia following morning \u2026",
