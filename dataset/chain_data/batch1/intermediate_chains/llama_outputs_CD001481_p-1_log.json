            "abstract": "Six primary care practices which utilize both physician and non-physician practitioner types were studied to measure differences between practitioner types in the care of patients. By chart review 1,369 patient-practitioner encounters were examined. Physicians identified less symptoms and signs in their patients and prescribed less non-drug therapies than did non-physicians. Likewise, at follow-up visits, physicians tended to document less follow-up of these types of problems and therapies than non-physicians. When examining the interaction between practitioners, the highest rates of follow-up of all types of problems and therapies were found when the same practitioner saw the patient at two successive visits to the same clinic. When a physician saw a patient following a previous visit to a nurse practitioner, there was a significant drop-off in the follow-up rate of problems and therapies. However, when a nurse practitioner saw the patient following a previous visit to a physician, the drop-off in follow-up rates was not as striking. These findings indicate that the skills of physician and nonphysician practitioners are potentially complementary. However, this potential is not fully exploited, particularly by physicians.",

Recommen dations for future studies include: (1) activities representing the full range of the nurse practitioner role should be included in any comprehensive evaluation of nurse practitioners; (2) explicit criteria with adequate sensitivity should form the basis of comparisons between nurse practitioners and physicians; (3) empirically established relationships between process and outcome variables should form the basis for estab lishing nonarbitrary performance standards whenever possible; (4) random sampling of nurse practitioners and physicians should be used when possible. When random sampling is not possible, providers should be selected using variables known to correlate with quality of care; (5) random assignment of patients to providers is strongly recommended, taking care to use clients new to both providers; (6) use of multiple data sources is recommended to decrease the current heavy reliance on audits; (7) conclusions should point out differential findings identifying those which favor physicians, those which favor nurse practi tioners, and those identifying no differences between providers.",

Subjects in a nonrandom sample of 15 NPs and 11 MDs independently described their proposed management of two pediatric and two adult hypothetical cases. NP and MD responses were compared to identify differences in the inclusion of explicit process criteria items in the following categories: problem assessment, diagnostic plan, therapeutic plan, health education, follow-up. The differences between NPs and MDs were almost entirely in the NPs' more frequent inclusion of expressive \"caring\" functions which have traditionally been the focus of nursing practice. The extent to which \"care\" as well as \"cure\" process variables affect outcome measures is discussed with regard to testing the effectiveness of the \"care\" component of health services, regardless of the professional identity of the provider.",

            "abstract": "This research examines the relationship between residence and infant mortality. The purpose of the study was to identify the effects of maternal residence on infant mortality, using a multivariate model which included both individual and county-level variables known to be associated with suboptimal birth outcome. Data on all births in Florida during 1987 were drawn from birth and infant death certificates. In addition, information concerning county sociodemographic structure and medical resources were gathered and linked to the individual records. After examining the distributions of selected risk variables across a five-category measure of residence (from most urban to most rural), a logit model was estimated to predict the odds of an infant death associated with maternal residence. At the bivariate level, rural residents were found to have increased odds of an infant death compared to residents of all other residence categories. Second, a logit model was estimated that controlled for the influence of important maternal, infant, and county risk characteristics. The results of this second, more fully specified model indicate that residence did not have an independent direct effect on infant mortality when the influence of the other risk factors was controlled. We conclude that although residence does not influence infant mortality directly, it does influence mortality indirectly through its association with key risk factors. In particular, because population characteristics and medical resources are differentially distributed across rural and urban areas, residence remains an important factor to be considered when predicting health outcomes. The implications of these findings for policy-makers and health planners, as well as for health services researchers, are also discussed.",

While the effectiveness of rural providers and hospitals has been evaluated in previous studies, this study focuses on poor birth outcomes in a population of rural residents, including those who leave rural areas for obstetrical care. Rural and urban differences in rates of inadequate prenatal care, neonatal death, and low birth weight were examined in the general population and in subpopulations stratified by risk and race using data from five years (1984-88) of birth and infant death certificates from Washington state. Also examined were care and outcome differences between rural women delivering in rural hospitals and those delivering in urban facilities. Bivariate analyses were confirmed with logistic regression. Results indicate that rural residents in the general population and in various subpopulations had similar or lower rates of poor outcome than did urban residents but experienced higher rates of inadequate prenatal care than did urban residents. Rural residents delivering in urban hospitals had higher rates of poor outcomes than those delivering in rural hospitals.

While the effectiveness of rural providers and hospitals has been evaluated in previous studies, this study focuses on poor birth outcomes in a population of rural residents, including those who leave rural areas for obstetrical care. Rural and urban differences in rates of inadequate prenatal care, neonatal death, and low birth weight were examined in the general population and in subpopulations stratified by risk and race using data from five years (1984-88) of birth and infant death certificates from Washington state. Also examined were care and outcome differences between rural women delivering in rural hospitals and those delivering in urban facilities. Bivariate analyses were confirmed with logistic regression. Results indicate that rural residents in the general population and in various subpopulations had similar or lower rates of poor outcome than did urban residents but experienced higher rates of inadequate prenatal care than did urban residents. Rural residents delivering in urban hospitals had higher rates of poor outcomes than those delivering in rural hospitals. We conclude that rural residence is not associated with greater risk of poor birth outcome. White and nonwhite differences appear to exceed any rural and urban resident differences in rates of poor birth outcome.",

            "abstract": "Pregnant women in nonmetropolitan communities are believed to use prenatal care services at lower rates than are metropolitan residents due to higher levels of poverty, lower levels of insurance coverage, and declining numbers of local hospitals and physicians. Yet scarce data exist on actual patterns of prenatal care use in nonmetropolitan areas. This study provides national estimates of prenatal care use among African American, White, and Hispanic women who delivered in 1988 in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas of the United States. This study finds that nonmetropolitan residents are no more likely than metropolitan residents to go without care, to enter care late, or to make fewer visits. Nonmetropolitan residents are more likely to receive \"inadequate\" prenatal care as measured by the Kotelchuck Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, with Hispanic residents having the highest rates of inadequate care. These findings are consistent with recent state-level reports, and they suggest the need to target prenatal care policies for populations in greatest need.",

            "abstract": "Adequate prenatal care is known to reduce the risks of low birth weight and neonatal death, yet nearly one quarter of all women giving birth in the United States receive delayed, inadequate or no prenatal care. This suboptimal use of prenatal care has contributed to rates of low birth weight and neonatal mortality higher than those in most other industrialized nations. This paper examines the relationships among race/ethnicity, residence, maternal sociodemographic and medical risk characteristics, and use of prenatal care in the United States. Using data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey, this study found important differences in prenatal care use by race/ethnicity and residence, as well as interactive effects of these variables. Single marital status, nonmetropolitan residence, poverty, low level of education, and no insurance were more strongly associated with inadequate prenatal care for whites and Hispanics than for blacks. Nonmetropolitan residents were more likely to receive inadequate care, regardless of race/ethnicity or sociodemographic characteristics. Predicted probabilities of prenatal care use by race/ethnicity and residence showed that, regardless of risk, nonmetropolitan Hispanic women had the highest probability of obtaining inadequate prenatal care. Results highlight the continued importance of race/ethnicity and rural residence in determining prenatal care use and the need to design interventions targeted to these populations.",

            "abstract": "One of the goals of Health People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities among minority populations by 2010, including improved childhood immunization rates among Mexican-American children. Prior research has identified the importance of interpersonal process-related factors as significant components of care sought by Mexican-Americans, but more knowledge is needed about what Mexican-American parents view as a beneficial relationship with the nurse during the immunization encounter. The purpose of this qualitative, descriptive pilot study was to explore and describe the perceptions of Mexican-American parents\u201f regarding their relationships with clinic nurses in a rural, primarily agricultural community. Thematic analysis of data describes a beneficial relationship between Mexican American women, their children, and nurses during immunization encounters as consisting of 1) trust in the nurse, 2) building confidence in the mother and child, and 3) language concordance.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Patient-clinician communication is a key factor in patient satisfaction with care. Clinicians take medical language courses to improve communication with linguistically diverse populations, yet little is known about how patients perceive clinicians\u2019 skills. Methods We designed a prospective, comparative survey study of patient perception of clinician communication using a convenience sampling of health professionals enrolled in an interprofessional medical Spanish course. We analyzed the patient-reported quality of communication skills from 214 clinical encounters and self-evaluations of 18 clinicians with Spanish- and English-speaking patients. Results Communication scores were lower for Spanish vs. English encounters as reported by both patients and clinicians (p<0.001). Clinician-reported scores were lower than patient-reported scores in Spanish encounters (9.05\u00b10.23 vs. 8.05\u00b10.23; p<0.001), whereas there was no difference in English encounters (11.17\u00b10.15 vs. 11.35\u00b10.19; p=0.914). The effect of language remained significant (p<0.001) when controlling for medical setting and complexity. Conclusion Spanish-speaking patients report lower-quality communication from clinicians learning Spanish than do English-speaking patients. Incorporating and further evaluating patient perceptions of clinician Spanish communication skills may improve language-appropriate healthcare and clinician education.",
