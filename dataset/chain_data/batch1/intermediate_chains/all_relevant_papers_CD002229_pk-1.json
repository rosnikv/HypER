        "title": "Hormone Replacement Therapy and Risk of New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation after Myocardial Infarction - A Nationwide Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Objectives Our aim was to assess the association between use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) after myocardial infarction. Design, Setting and Participants We used Danish nationwide registers of hospitalizations and prescriptions to identify all women admitted with myocardial infarction in the period 1997 to 2009 and with no known diagnosis of AF. Their use of overall HRT and HRT categories was assessed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to calculate the risk of new-onset AF first year after discharge, comparing use of HRT to no use. Main Outcome Measures New-onset atrial fibrillation. Results In the period 1997 to 2009, 32 925 women were discharged alive after MI. In the first year after MI, new-onset AF was diagnosed in 1381 women (4.2%). Unadjusted incidence rates of AF decreased with use of HRT (incidence rate 37.4 for use of overall HRT and 53.7 for no use). Overall HRT was associated with a decreased risk of AF (HR 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68\u20131.00). The lowest risk of AF was found in women \u226580 years old for use of overall HRT and vaginal estrogen (HR 0.63, CI 0.42\u20130.94, and HR 0.58, CI 0.34\u20130.99, respectively). Decreased risk of AF with use of overall HRT and HRT categories was also found in other age groups. Conclusions Use of HRT is associated with a decreased risk of new-onset AF in women with myocardial infarction first year after discharge. The underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Unmeasured confounding might be one of them.",

        "title": "Post-myocardial infarction hormone therapy revisited",
        "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend that postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used in the setting of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, and that it should be stopped when an acute coronary event occurs. Reviewing the available data on the issue of discontinuation of therapy in post-myocardial infarction patients shows that the basis for this recommendation is not so solid and clear-cut. In fact, the few relevant studies concluded that cessation of hormone therapy carried no benefit, and perhaps even caused some adverse cardiac events, when compared to women who continued with treatment after they suffered a coronary event. The following article uses a recently published study as an opportunity to review this topic. Based on the literature, my personal view is that long-term hormone users should not automatically withhold therapy post-myocardial infarction, but careful individual evaluation and consideration should precede any decision.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nDuring the intervention phase in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial, use of estrogen plus progestin reduced the colorectal cancer diagnosis rate, but the cancers were found at a substantially higher stage. To assess the clinical relevance of the findings, analyses of the influence of combined hormone therapy on colorectal cancer incidence and colorectal cancer mortality were conducted after extended follow-up.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe WHI study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 16,608 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who were randomly assigned to daily 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8,506) or matching placebo (n = 8,102). Colorectal cancer diagnosis rates and colorectal cancer mortality were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a mean of 5.6 years (standard deviation [SD], 1.03 years) of intervention and 11.6 years (SD, 3.1 years) of total follow-up, fewer colorectal cancers were diagnosed in the combined hormone therapy group compared with the placebo group (diagnoses/year, 0.12% v 0.16%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .014). Bowel screening examinations were comparable between groups throughout. Cancers in the combined hormone therapy group more commonly had positive lymph nodes (50.5% v 28.6%; P < .001) and were at higher stage (regional or distant, 68.8% v 51.4%; P = .003). Although not statistically significant, there was a higher number of colorectal cancer deaths in the combined hormone therapy group (37 v 27 deaths; 0.04% v 0.03%; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.11; P = .320).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings, suggestive of diagnostic delay, do not support a clinically meaningful benefit for combined hormone therapy on colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the long term effect of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in recently postmenopausal women. Design Open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Denmark, 1990-93. Participants 1006 healthy women aged 45-58 who were recently postmenopausal or had perimenopausal symptoms in combination with recorded postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone values. 502 women were randomly allocated to receive hormone replacement therapy and 504 to receive no treatment (control). Women who had undergone hysterectomy were included if they were aged 45-52 and had recorded values for postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone. Interventions In the treatment group, women with an intact uterus were treated with triphasic estradiol and norethisterone acetate and women who had undergone hysterectomy received 2 mg estradiol a day. Intervention was stopped after about 11 years owing to adverse reports from other trials, but participants were followed for death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer for up to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on women who took more than 80% of the prescribed treatment for five years. Main outcome measure The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to hospital for heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Results At inclusion the women on average were aged 50 and had been postmenopausal for seven months. After 10 years of intervention, 16 women in the treatment group experienced the primary composite endpoint compared with 33 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.87; P=0.015) and 15 died compared with 26 (0.57, 0.30 to 1.08; P=0.084). The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer. Conclusions After 10 years of randomised treatment, women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke.

        "abstract": "Little is known about age-related differences in short-term effects of estradiol on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) insults. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of short-term treatment with estradiol on reperfusion arrhythmias in isolated hearts of 6-7-week-old and 12-14-month-old female rats. Wistar rats were sham-operated, ovariectomized and treated with vehicle or ovariectomized and treated with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2; 5\u2005\u00b5g\u00b7100\u2005g\u22121\u00b7day\u22121) for 4 days. Hearts were perfused by the Langendorff technique. Reperfusion arrhythmias, i.e., ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation, were induced by 15\u2005min of left coronary artery ligation and 30\u2005min of reperfusion. The duration and incidence of I/R arrhythmias were significantly higher in young rats compared to middle-aged rats (arrhythmia severity index: 9.4 \u00b1 1.0 vs 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 arbitrary units, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, middle-aged rats showed lower heart rate, systolic tension and coronary flow. Four-day E2 treatment caused an increase in uterine weight. Although E2 administration had no significant effect on the duration of I/R arrhythmias in middle-aged rats, it induced a marked reduction in the rhythm disturbances of young rats accompanied by a decrease in heart rate of isolated hearts. Also, this reduction was associated with an increase in QT interval. No significant changes were observed in the QT interval of middle-aged E2-treated rats. These data demonstrate that short-term estradiol treatment protects against I/R arrhythmias in hearts of young female rats. The anti-arrhythmogenic effect of estradiol might be related to a lengthening of the QT interval.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of myocardial infarction rises sharply at menopause, implicating a potential role for estrogen (E(2)) loss in age-related increases in ischemic injury. We aimed to identify quantitative changes to the cardiac mitochondrial proteome of aging females, based on the hypothesis that E(2) deficiency exacerbates age-dependent disruptions in mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondria isolated from left ventricles of adult (6 mo) and aged (24 mo) F344 ovary-intact or ovariectomized (OVX) rats were labeled with 8plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ; n = 5-6/group). Groups studied were adult, adult OVX, aged, and aged OVX. In vivo coronary artery ligation and in vitro mitochondrial respiration studies were also performed in a subset of rats. We identified 965 proteins across groups and significant directional changes in 67 proteins of aged and/or aged OVX; 32 proteins were unique to aged OVX. Notably, only six proteins were similarly altered in adult OVX (voltage-dependent ion channel 1, adenine nucleotide translocator 1, cytochrome c oxidase subunits VIIc and VIc, catalase, and myosin binding protein C). Proteins affected by aging were primarily related to cellular metabolism, oxidative stress, and cell death. The largest change occurred in monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), a source of oxidative stress. While acute MAO-A inhibition induced mild uncoupling in aged mitochondria, reductions in infarct size were not observed. Age-dependent alterations in mitochondrial signaling indicate a highly selective myocardial response to E(2) deficiency. The combined proteomic and functional approaches described here offer possibility of new protein targets for experimentation and therapeutic intervention in the aged female population.",

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was undertaken using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, a population-based healthcare claims dataset. Eligible women aged 50 to 79 years were classified as exposed to CEE 0.625 mg/day with MPA 5.0 mg/day (estrogen [E] + progestin [P], n = 4,712) or CEE 0.625 mg/day only (E-only, n = 1,208) and were age-matched to unexposed women (n = 10,125). Follow-up was complete in 96% of the participants. The primary outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer. The global index summarized risks of primary outcomes, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colon and endometrial cancers, hip fractures, and death. Time-to-event analyses were performed. ResultsMedian durations of exposure in the E + P and E-only groups were 6.9 and 9 months, respectively. Median follow-up was 110 months. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for E + P exposure were as follows: myocardial infarction, 0.78 (0.51-1.19); CHD death, 1.21 (0.53-2.70); breast cancer, 1.48 (1.20-1.83); global index, 0.79 (0.72-0.87).

Per 10,000 person-years, there were 12 excess breast cancer cases with E + P exposure; there were 39 fewer global index events with E + P exposure. Adjusting for age, statin and aspirin use, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension did not significantly change estimates. ConclusionsIn postmenopausal Chinese women, CEE with or without MPA was not associated with increased rates of CHD, but CEE with MPA may be associated with a higher breast cancer rate.

Here, we present subgroup data in women with severe VMS (50 VMS of moderate\u2013severe intensity/wk) and also 1-mo withdrawal study outcomes. Women with severe VMS (n = 46) resembled the full cohort but experienced 10 VMS/d of 3 of 4 intensity. On therapy, the progesterone VMS number (#) decreased significantly more than placebo # to 5.5/day (d) versus 8/d (ANCOVA \u22122.0 95% CI: \u22123.5 to \u22120.4).

MethodsA population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Total Population Register for the period July 2005 to June 2009. We included women aged 45 to 70 years who had used HT continuously for more than 6 months before July 2008. Women with previous use of antidepressants since July 2005 were excluded. We compared the incidence rates of initiating antidepressant therapy during HT and after withdrawal of HT. The women were followed from July 2008 until the first dispensing of antidepressants, restart of HT, migration, death, or end of the study period, whichever occurred first.

The Women's Health Initiative reported most of the results, had 11 years of follow-up, and had data most applicable to postmenopausal women in the United States. It showed that estrogen plus progestin therapy reduced fractures (46 fewer per 10 000 woman-years) and increased invasive breast cancer (8 more per 10 000 woman-years), stroke (9 more per 10 000 woman-years), deep venous thrombosis (12 more per 10 000 woman-years), pulmonary embolism (9 more per 10 000 woman-years), lung cancer death (5 more per 10 000 woman-years), gallbladder disease (20 more per 10 000 woman-years), dementia (22 more per 10 000 woman-years), and urinary incontinence (872 more per 10 000 woman-years). Estrogen-only therapy reduced fractures (56 fewer per 10 000 woman-years), invasive breast cancer (8 fewer per 10 000 woman-years), and death (2 fewer per 10 000 woman-years) and increased stroke (11 more per 10 000 woman-years), deep venous thrombosis (7 more per 10 000 woman-years), gallbladder disease (33 more per 10 000 woman-years), and urinary incontinence (1271 more per 10 000 woman-years).

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014Our study aims to determine the role of time of menopause on vascular inflammation biomarkers and how it affects their modulation by estrogen and raloxifene in postmenopausal women. Methods and Results\u2014Uterine arteries from 68 postmenopausal women were divided into 3 segments and cultured for 24 hours in tissue culture media containing 17&bgr;-estradiol (100 nmol/L), raloxifene (100 nmol/L), or vehicle. Assessment of arterial concentration of 13 inflammatory biomarkers was performed by multiplex immunobead-based assay. Aging per se has a positive correlation with the generation of several proinflammatory markers. Although short-term estradiol exposure correlates with lower expression of tumor necrosis factor-&agr;, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-1&bgr; in all age groups, for most biomarkers aging was associated with a switch from a beneficial anti-inflammatory action by estrogen, at earlier stages of menopause, to a proinflammatory profile after 5 years past its onset. Raloxifene has no significant effect on the expression of all proinflammatory markers.

        "abstract": "Estrogens have well-recognized and complex cardiovascular effects, including altering myocardial contractility through changes in myofilament function. The presence of multiple estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms in the heart may explain some discrepant findings about the cardiac effects of estrogens. Most studies examining the impact of estrogens on the heart have focused on chronic changes in estrogen levels, and have not investigated rapid, non-genomic pathways. The first objective of this study was to determine how acute activation of ER\u03b1 impacts cardiac myofilaments. Nongenomic myocardial estrogen signaling is associated with the activation of a variety of signaling pathways. p38 MAPK has been implicated in acute ER signaling in the heart, and is known to affect myofilament function. Thus, the second objective of this study was to determine if acute ER\u03b1 activation mediates its myofilament effects through p38 MAPK recruitment. Hearts from female C57Bl/6 mice were perfused with the ER\u03b1 agonist PPT and myofilaments isolated. Activation of ER\u03b1 depressed actomyosin MgATPase activity and decreased myofilament calcium sensitivity. Inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuated the myofilament effects of ER\u03b1 activation. ER\u03b1 stimulation did not affect global myofilament protein phosphorylation, but troponin I phosphorylation at the putative PKA phosphorylation sites was decreased. Changes in myofilament activation did not translate into alterations in whole heart function. The present study provides evidence supporting rapid, non-genomic changes in cardiac myofilament function following acute ER\u03b1 stimulation mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway.",
