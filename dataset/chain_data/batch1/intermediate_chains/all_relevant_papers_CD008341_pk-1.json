        "abstract": "Golimumab is a new approved humanized antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This antibody belonging to biologic agents is raised against the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 playing an essential role in the initiation of RA. To date, Golimumab administration for patients with RA, as indicated by USA Food and Drug Administration, is subcutaneous combined with methotrexate (MTX). Here, we have reviewed current literature with a focus on characteristics of Golimumab and also have exposed the clinical trials either using MTX or not using MTX. We have also highlighted the incoming clinical trials on Golimumab and have proposed some indications for the future studies based on a setting of clinical data and post\u2010marketing observational studies. These studies will advance rheumatologists\u2019 decisions in the beginning of RA therapeutic interventions to insure the best outcomes for patients with RA and to improve their quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease characterized by symmetric arthritis leading to progressive erosion of cartilage and bone. Psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are also inflammatory arthritides that belong to the spondyloarthritides. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biologic therapies including anti-TNF agents are used in their treatment. The TNF antagonists have shown rapid and sustained therapeutic responses. However, a substantial number of patients fail to respond to anti-TNF agents or experience side effects. Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 requiring less frequent administration compared with current anti-TNF products. Various trials have shown promising results in terms of efficacy and safety in methotrexate-naive and -resistant patients with RA as well as in patients previously treated with other anti-TNF agents.

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab to 52 weeks in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate. Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo plus methotrexate (group 1), golimumab 100 mg plus placebo (group 2), golimumab 50 mg plus methotrexate (group 3) and golimumab 100 mg plus methotrexate (group 4). At week 16, patients in groups 1, 2 and 3 who had less than 20% improvement in tender and swollen joints entered early escape. At week 24, patients in group 1 who had not entered early escape crossed over to 50 mg golimumab plus methotrexate. Results At week 16, 31%, 27% and 17% of patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, entered early escape. At week 52, 44%, 45%, 64% and 58% of patients in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, achieved 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria; and 34%, 31%, 42% and 53%, respectively, achieved low disease activity (\u22643.2) according to the 28-joint disease activity score. Patients in group 4 appeared to have an increased risk of serious adverse events and serious infections. Conclusion The results of various outcome measures showed that the response rates achieved by patients receiving golimumab to 24 weeks were sustained to 52 weeks. The safety profile appeared to be consistent with the known safety profile of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewWith an increasing range of biological therapies available in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, sequencing of such therapies is becoming more frequent, particularly with more ambitious treatment aims. This review will address the evidence to date on use of successive targeted agents. Recent findingsDouble-blind, randomized controlled trials have confirmed the role of alternative tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (TNFi), rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab, following TNFi failure with no comparative studies to date. Registry data have demonstrated efficacy of switching from a first to a second TNFi. Observational experience has confirmed benefits of switching from TNFi to TNFi and TNFi to rituximab. Within available randomized controlled trial data, tocilizumab appears effective in TNFi failure group, irrespective of number of TNFi previously failed with similar data on abatacept. No safety signals have been identified thus far with biologic sequencing. Although formal comparative, controlled studies do not exist, type of previous failure to TNFi and disease characteristics (serology, comorbidity, concomitant therapy) can provide a good platform for choosing the next biologic treatment. SummaryAlthough biological sequencing is well established, optimal approach represents a significant knowledge gap; well designed clinical studies with associated mechanistic investigation are necessary to identify disease subgroups that would benefit from one sequence over another.",

        "abstract": "Since the advent of infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), new genetically-engineered molecules have appeared. This review aims to present the current data and body of evidence for golimumab (GLM). Safety, efficacy, tolerability and immunogenicity are all being investigated, not only through phase III trials (GO-BEFORE, GO-FORWARD, GO-AFTER, GO-MORE, GO-FURTHER, GO-NICE), but also through studies of real-world data. It seems that GLM in the subcutaneous form is an efficacious molecule with a good safety profile at the standard dosage scheme, but a 100 mg subcutaneous dose is associated with a higher risk of opportunistic infections, lymphoma and demyelination. Furthermore, when compared to other tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 molecules, it is non-inferior, and, at some points, such as when it comes to immunogenicity and persistence of the drug, it has a better profile. In summary, GLM is an effective, well-tolerated option for the treatment of RA, for both the clinician and patients who are seeking a convenient dosage scheme.",

        "title": "Golimumab: A Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibitor for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To review the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data of golimumab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) monoclonal antibody. DATA SOURCES A search of MEDLINE (1950-September 2009) was performed to identify any published clinical trials or review articles pertaining to golimumab. Key search terms included golimumab, rheumatoid arthritis, CNTO 148, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors. Bibliographies of selected articles were reviewed to identify other relevant citations. Abstracts from national and international meetings and information from the manufacturer were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION All available published articles and abstracts describing golimumab's pharmacologic or pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and safety were included. DATA SYNTHESIS Golimumab is a fully humanized TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody that is specific for human TNF-\u03b1. Trials have investigated the use of golimumab in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are on methotrexate, are methotrexate-na\u00efve, and have previously tried TNF-\u03b1 inhibition therapy. When used in combination with methotrexate or another disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, golimumab therapy results in improvements of clinical outcomes including the American College of Rheumatology parameters in all of the aforementioned populations. Although multiple doses and dosing regimens have been studied, the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose is 50 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. The most common adverse effects include injection site erythema, headaches, and nausea. There were a limited number of incidences of serious infection or malignancy. CONCLUSIONS With 4 TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies currently on the market, it is unclear what golimumab's place in therapy for RA will be. Some benefits include monthly injections, proven efficacy after previous TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor therapy, and limited antibody development during therapy. However, with a lack of longer-term trials assessing efficacy and safety compared with other TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, golimumab should be reserved for use after other therapies fail.",

Two additional TNF antagonists have recently been approved in the US for this indication, and clinicians will need to understand the data on the efficacy and safety of these agents in order to properly place them into the clinical treatment algorithm. Areas covered in this review: This review covers the published clinical trial data on the use of certolizumab and golimumab for RA. The literature search included manuscripts published through September 2009 and abstracts from major meetings (ACR and EULAR) in 2007 \u2013 2009. What the reader will gain: This paper will review the efficacy and safety of golimumab and certolizumab in the treatment of RA at various stages of disease. Use of these agents will be described in the context of other available alternatives, including other TNF antagonists and other biologic therapies. Take home message: Certolizumab and golimumab have comparable efficacy and safety profiles compared with previously approved TNF antagonists. These two agents have several unique theoretical benefits when compared to existing agents, but the available published data do not suggest a clear clinical advantage at this time.",

        "title": "Non-infectious pulmonary complications of newer biological agents for rheumatic diseases--a systematic literature review.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To evaluate the efficacy/safety of subcutaneous (SC) golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who previously received intravenous (IV) golimumab with or without methotrexate (MTX). Methods. Adult patients with RA (n = 643) with persistent disease despite MTX (\u2265 15 mg/wk for \u2265 3 months) were randomized to IV placebo + MTX (n = 129) or IV golimumab 2\u20134 mg/kg (\u00b1 MTX) every 12 weeks (n = 514). Patients who completed the study through Week 48 could participate in the longterm extension (LTE), comprising open-label golimumab 50 mg SC every 4 weeks (\u00b1 MTX) for 24 weeks (LTE-0 to LTE-24) followed by 16 weeks of safety followup (LTE-24 to LTE-40; MTX could be adjusted). Results. At Week 48, 28% (nominal p < 0.001 vs placebo), 11%, and 8% of patients who received IV golimumab + MTX, golimumab alone, and placebo + MTX, respectively, achieved \u2265 50% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR50). Among the 505 patients who entered the LTE and were still participating, the proportion of patients treated with golimumab 50 mg SC (\u00b1 MTX) achieving an ACR50 response increased to 44% at both LTE-14 and LTE-24. ACR20, ACR70, and 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein exhibited similar response patterns as ACR50. Infections were the most commonly reported adverse events through the end of IV golimumab dosing (37% placebo + MTX, 45% golimumab, 51% golimumab + MTX) and with SC golimumab from LTE-0 through LTE-40 (35% golimumab, 36% golimumab + MTX). Concomitant MTX use yielded lower incidences of antibodies to SC golimumab and injection-related reactions. Conclusion. Clinical improvements observed in golimumab-treated patients were sustained or improved in patients switched from IV (2\u20134 mg/kg \u00b1 MTX) to open-label SC (50 mg \u00b1 MTX) golimumab. Both IV and SC golimumab demonstrated acceptable safety profiles (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00361335).",
