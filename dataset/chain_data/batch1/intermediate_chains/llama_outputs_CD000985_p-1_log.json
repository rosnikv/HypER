There were no significant differences in age, duration of history, length of occlusion or presence of neurosensory deficit between the groups. Initially successful lysis was significantly greater with intra\u2010arterial (IA) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt\u2010PA) than with either streptokinase (Sk) (P < 0.04) or intravenous (IV) rt\u2010PA (P < 0.01). The duration of therapy varied from a median of 35 h with IA rt\u2010PA to 40 h with Sk (P > 0.5). The median (confidence interval) increase in ankle:brachial pressure index following IA rt\u2010PA of 0.57 (0.33\u20130.82) was significantly higher than for either Sk of 0.24 (0\u20130.57) or for IV rt\u2010PA of 0.18 (0\u20130.41). Limb salvage at 30 days was achieved in 80, 60 and 45 per cent respectively for IA rt\u2010PA, Sk and IV rt\u2010PA. Haemorrhagic complications occurred in six patients following Sk and in 13 following IV rt\u2010PA; only one minor haemorrhage occurred following a catheter perforation in a patient who received IA rt\u2010PA (P < 0.05). IA rt\u2010PA provides a more effective, safer fibrinolytic regimen than conventional therapy with Sk. IV rt\u2010PA has not been as successful and carries a significantly higher risk of haemorrhagic complications.",

New techniques of accelerated thrombolysis have expanded the indications to include almost all affected patients. Attention to detail and avoidance of known pitfalls, together with close cooperation between vascular surgeon and radiologist, ensure optimum results with minimum complications. A modern integrated lysis programme may vary from initial thrombolytic treatment for all patients with acute limb ischaemia to a selective policy of surgery and thrombolysis depending on the aetiology and severity of ischaemia.",

The mean age of patients was 67 years, 57% of the patients were male, and preexisting peripheral vascular disease was present in 74%. Presenting symptoms were limb-threatening ischemia (53%) and claudication (47%). Acute symptoms (< 2 weeks' duration) were present in 48%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 30-day morbidity rate was 31%, and four patients died. Complications were significant bleeding (23%), ischemic stroke (1%), and renal failure with (2%) and without (2%) dialysis. Concomitant angioplasty was performed in 63%. Complete or significant lysis as demonstrated with angiography was achieved in 75% of iliac, 58% of femoropopliteal, and 41% of crural vessels (P <.001). Within 30 days of lysis, 9% of patients underwent major amputation and 20% surgical revascularization (in 3 patients the extent of revascularization was lessened by the lytic therapy). Amputation-free survival was 83% and 75% at 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Relief of ischemia (defined as relief of claudication or limb salvage without major surgical intervention) was achieved in only 70% and 43% of patients at 30 days and 2 years, respectively (Kaplan-Meier analysis; mean follow-up, 31 months). Patients with aortoiliac disease had significantly better outcomes than those with infrainguinal disease (P =.03). Duration or type of presenting symptoms did not predict outcome. The cost of the initial hospitalization per patient for thrombolysis was $18,490.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThrombolysis can be as or more costly than surgery and is associated with a suboptimal outcome in a significant number of patients.

            "abstract": "Acute peripheral arterial occlusion is associated with great risk to the patient's limb and life. Failure to restore adequate arterial flow in a timely fashion can result in the development of irreversible tissue infarction and the opportunity for limb salvage is lost. On the other hand, patients with acute limb ischemia are often elderly and frail, and early invasive open surgical procedures without adequate preoperative stabilization and preparation result in an unacceptably high risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications and death. Percutaneous methods designed to remove the intraluminal thrombus offer an alternative to immediate open surgical revascularization. These less invasive techniques constitute an option that is better tolerated in medically compromised patients. The causative lesion can be precisely identified and the patency of outflow vessels can be restored. The lesion can then be addressed on an elective basis in a well-prepared patient, using percutaneous or open surgical techniques to effect a durable long-term solution. The treatment options include primary surgical revascularization, thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, or a combination of any of the three. Clinicians who themselves have the skills to perform a wide assortment of interventions ranging from percutaneous therapies through open surgical revascularization are best able to arrive at the most rational option for treating a specific clinical scenario. This article is directed at providing the practicing surgeon with a basic fund of knowledge on the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies useful in treating patients with peripheral arterial occlusion. Only in this manner can we expect to reduce the high rate of morbidity and mortality that remains associated with these events.",

Methods: Alteplase solutions were prepared by reconstitution in sterile water to obtain a targeted concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. A baseline control sample was obtained. The AngioJet system was modified by occluding the return line to allow collection of the dispersed fluid volume. Alteplase solutions (n=5) were delivered through the 6-F, 120-cm Xpeedior catheter and collected.

Results: Analysis of the test solutions demonstrated a mean protein recovery of 98.0%\u00b13.5% of targeted concentration; the collected protein was fully active, as determined by clot lysis assays (specific activity \u2265100%). All samples were clear and colorless. No significant fragmentation or aggregation of protein was observed. Conclusions: Alteplase solutions, when delivered through the AngioJet Xpeedior rheolytic thrombectomy device, remain stable and biologically active in vitro.

Background: Acute limb ischemia is associated with a high risk of amputation and death. Previous reports from the United States (U.S.) of surgical and nonsurgical treatments are limited to primarily 30 days to 1 year. Methods: Single\u2010center, retrospective review of 57 consecutive patients (30 male, 27 female; mean age 63.8 \u00b1 13.8 years) treated for limb threatening ischemia due to thrombotic arterial occlusions. Data includes baseline assessments, procedural outcomes, in\u2010hospital complications, 30\u2010day, and long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Results: Ninety\u2010three percent of patients (n = 53) presented with onset of symptoms (<14 days). Angiography following PMT showed thrombus removal complete/substantial 36 (63.6%), partial 16 (28.0%), and minimal 5 (8.8%), respectively. Catheter\u2010directed thrombolysis was used after PMT in 18 patients (31.6%). In\u2010hospital success with limb salvage was attained in 96.5% (n = 55) with mortality of 3.5% (n = 2). Thirty\u2010day limb salvage and mortality were 94.7% (n = 54) and 5.3% (n = 3), respectively. At mean 5\u2010year follow\u2010up (mean = 62 months), three patients have been lost to follow\u2010up.

Conclusions: Acute limb ischemia treated with PMT alone or in combination with thrombolysis, followed by definitive therapy, results in favorable long\u2010term limb salvage.

                    "explanation": "This paper describes a case of acute upper limb ischemia secondary to acute axillary artery occlusion caused by a proximal humeral fracture, treated with endovascular treatment (EVT). Although it discusses a different treatment method (EVT) and a specific cause of upper limb ischemia (proximal humeral fracture), it shares a similar goal with the source paper (upper limb salvage) and could be considered partially dependent on the source paper's findings regarding the importance of prompt treatment for upper limb ischemia.",
