        "title": "The Role of Sulfinpyrazone in the Prevention of Arterio\u2010venous Shunt Thrombosis",
        "abstract": "The effect of sulfinpyrazone on the incidence of thrombosis of arterio-venous shunts was investigated in a double-blind crossover study in 45 patients on chronic hemodialysis over a period of 12 months. The incidence of thrombosis was reduced from 0.64 thrombi per patient month when on placebo to 0.21 thrombi per patient month when on sulfinpryazone (P < 0.001). The therapeutic effect was more striking in men than in women and became evident within a week of starting the drug. The side effects were minimal, requiring withdrawal from the study of only one patient. This crossover study strengthens the findings in the previous report that sulfinpyrazone is of value in the prevention of thrombosis.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is directly inspired by the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the same topic (sulfinpyrazone's effect on arteriovenous-shunt thrombosis) and appears to be a follow-up study, using a different study design (crossover study)."

        "title": "In vitro evaluation of inhibitors of platelet release and aggregation.",
        "abstract": "In order to determine which drugs would be most effective as inhibitors of platelet release and aggregation, in vitro release reactions and platelet aggregometry were used to evaluate aspirin, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, flurbiprofen, low molecular weight dextran (dextran 40), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), apyrase, and adenosine. Adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation was most effectively inhibited by PGF1, sulfinpyrazone, and dipyridamole. The latter had to be used in large doses. Collagen and epinephrine-induced release and aggregation were inhibited by the same drugs as well as by aspirin and apyrase. Antihynocyte globulin (ATG)-induced release and aggregation could only be partially blocked by these agents. In vitro studies suggest that sulfinpyrazone is one of the most effective of platelet inhibitors currently available for clinical testing.",

        "relevance": 1,
        "explanation": "While this paper does investigate sulfinpyrazone, it is a more general study on platelet inhibitors and does not directly build upon the source paper's specific findings on arteriovenous-shunt thrombosis. However, it can be seen as partially dependent on the previous findings, as it explores the mechanism of action of sulfinpyrazone, which was previously found to be effective in preventing thrombosis."
