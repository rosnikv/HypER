            "title": "Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus by changes in lifestyle among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nType 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.",

Little is known about the relationship between participation in DPPsand participant characteristics or service delivery. We investigated uptake and retention in England\u2019s NHS DPP, reporting on variability among patient subgroups, providers, and sites. Research design and methods This prospective cohort study included 99\u2009473 adults with non-diabetic hyperglycemia referred to the English DPP between 2016 and 2017. The program seeks to change health behaviors by offering at least 16\u2009hours of group education and exercise. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to analyze variation in uptake, retention, and completion. Results Uptake among 99\u2009473 adults referred to the program was 56% (55 275). Among 55\u2009275 who started the program, 34% (18 562) achieved the required dose and 22% (12 127) completed the full course. After adjustment for variation in case mix, substantial heterogeneity in uptake and retention was seen across four service providers (uptake OR 1.77 (1.33, 2.34), 4.30 (3.01, 6.15), and 1.45 (1.07, 1.97) compared with the reference provider) and between sites (uptake for typical individuals ranged from 0.32 to 0.78 across the middle 95% of sites, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.07). Higher levels of retention and completion were seen where some out-of-hours provision was offered (retention OR 1.32 (1.25, 1.39)). Conclusions This study provides the first independent assessment of participation in the English DPP and the first study internationally to examine the impact of DPP service delivery on participation. When implementing a large-scale DPP, heterogeneity in service provision between different providers and sites can result in variable participation beyond that attributable to case mix, with potential consequences for effectiveness and health inequalities. Extending out-of-hours provision may improve participation in prevention programs.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background The National Health Service (NHS) Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a nationally implemented behavioral intervention for adults at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in England, based on a program specification that stipulates inclusion of 19 specific behavior change techniques (BCTs). Previous work has identified drift in fidelity from these NHS England specifications through providers\u2019 program manuals, training, and delivery, especially in relation to BCTs targeting self-regulatory processes. Purpose This qualitative study investigates intervention receipt, i.e., how the self-regulatory BCT content of the NHS-DPP is understood by participants. Methods Twenty participants from eight NHS-DPP locations were interviewed; topics included participants\u2019 understanding of self-monitoring of behavior, goal setting, feedback, problem solving, and action planning. Transcripts were analyzed thematically using the framework method. Results There was a wide variation in understanding among participants for some BCTs, as well as between BCTs. Participants described their understanding of \u201cself-monitoring of behaviors\u201d with ease and valued BCTs focused on outcomes (weight loss). Some participants learned how to set appropriate behavioral goals. Participants struggled to recall \u201caction planning\u201d or \u201cproblem solving\u201d or found these techniques challenging to understand, unless additional support was provided (e.g., through group discussion). Conclusions Participants\u2019 lack of understanding of some self-regulatory BCTs is consistent with the drift across fidelity domains previously identified from NHS design specifications. Behavioral interventions should build-in necessary support for participants to help them understand some BCTs such as action planning and problem solving. Alternatively, these self-regulatory BCTs may be intrinsically difficult to use for this population.",

            "abstract": "Background The National Health Service (NHS) Diabetes Prevention Program is a behavior change intervention for adults in England who are identified as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The face-to-face service was launched in 2016, followed by a digital service (NHS Digital Diabetes Prevention Program [NHS-DDPP]) in 2019. A total of 4 service providers were commissioned to deliver the NHS-DDPP and were required to deliver the digital service in line with a program specification detailing the key intervention content. The fidelity of the behavior change content in the digital service (ie, the extent to which the program is delivered as intended) is currently unknown. Digital interventions may allow higher fidelity as staff do not have to be trained to deliver all intervention content. Assessing fidelity of the intervention design is particularly important to establish the planned behavior change content in the NHS-DDPP and the extent to which this adheres to the program specification. This is the first known independent assessment of design fidelity in a large-scale digital behavior change intervention. Objective This study aims to assess the fidelity of the behavior change content in each of the 4 NHS-DDPP providers\u2019 intervention designs to the full program specification. Methods We conducted a document review of each provider\u2019s NHS-DDPP intervention design, along with interviews with program developers employed by the 4 digital providers (n=6). Providers\u2019 intervention design documents and interview transcripts were coded for behavior change techniques (BCTs; ie, the active ingredients of the intervention) using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 and underpinning theory using the Theory Coding Scheme framework. The BCTs identified in each digital provider\u2019s intervention design were compared with the 19 BCTs included in the program specification. Results Of the 19 BCTs specified in the program specification, the 4 providers planned to deliver 16 (84%), 17 (89%), 16 (84%), and 16 (84%) BCTs, respectively. An additional 41 unspecified BCTs were included in at least one of the 4 digital providers\u2019 intervention designs. By contrast, inconsistent use of the underpinning theory was apparent across providers, and none of the providers had produced a logic model to explain how their programs were expected to work. All providers linked some of their planned BCTs to theoretical constructs; however, justification for the inclusion of other BCTs was not described. Conclusions The fidelity of BCT content in the NHS-DDPP was higher than that previously documented for the face-to-face service. Thus, if service users engage with the NHS-DDPP, this should increase the effectiveness of the program. However, given that a clear theoretical underpinning supports the translation of BCTs in intervention designs to intervention delivery, the absence of a logic model describing the constructs to be targeted by specific BCTs is potentially problematic.",

            "abstract": "Background The National Health Service (NHS) Diabetes Prevention Program is a behavior change intervention for adults in England who are identified as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The face-to-face service was launched in 2016, followed by a digital service (NHS Digital Diabetes Prevention Program [NHS-DDPP]) in 2019. A total of 4 service providers were commissioned to deliver the NHS-DDPP and were required to deliver the digital service in line with a program specification detailing the key intervention content. The fidelity of the behavior change content in the digital service (ie, the extent to which the program is delivered as intended) is currently unknown. Digital interventions may allow higher fidelity as staff do not have to be trained to deliver all intervention content. Assessing fidelity of the intervention design is particularly important to establish the planned behavior change content in the NHS-DDPP and the extent to which this adheres to the program specification. This is the first known independent assessment of design fidelity in a large-scale digital behavior change intervention. Objective This study aims to assess the fidelity of the behavior change content in each of the 4 NHS-DDPP providers\u2019 intervention designs to the full program specification. Methods We conducted a document review of each provider\u2019s NHS-DDPP intervention design, along with interviews with program developers employed by the 4 digital providers (n=6). Providers\u2019 intervention design documents and interview transcripts were coded for behavior change techniques (BCTs; ie, the active ingredients of the intervention) using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 and underpinning theory using the Theory Coding Scheme framework. The BCTs identified in each digital provider\u2019s intervention design were compared with the 19 BCTs included in the program specification. Results Of the 19 BCTs specified in the program specification, the 4 providers planned to deliver 16 (84%), 17 (89%), 16 (84%), and 16 (84%) BCTs, respectively. An additional 41 unspecified BCTs were included in at least one of the 4 digital providers\u2019 intervention designs. By contrast, inconsistent use of the underpinning theory was apparent across providers, and none of the providers had produced a logic model to explain how their programs were expected to work. All providers linked some of their planned BCTs to theoretical constructs; however, justification for the inclusion of other BCTs was not described. Conclusions The fidelity of BCT content in the NHS-DDPP was higher than that previously documented for the face-to-face service. Thus, if service users engage with the NHS-DDPP, this should increase the effectiveness of the program. However, given that a clear theoretical underpinning supports the translation of BCTs in intervention designs to intervention delivery, the absence of a logic model describing the constructs to be targeted by specific BCTs is potentially problematic.",
