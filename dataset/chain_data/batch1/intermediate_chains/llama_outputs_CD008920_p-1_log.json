Amitriptyline was associated with a significant reduction in the number of painful/tender joints.

The subjects were 80 male patients with a diagnosis of classic or definite RA. Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Arthritis Helplessness Index, and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) pain score. Joint counts and immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes also were collected. Path analysis showed that percentage of HLA-DR+ cells in the peripheral blood and helplessness were related to join count. In addition, joint count had an effect upon depression. Depression had an effect upon pain, but there was no reciprocal effect of pain upon depression. This study describes a preliminary path model of interrelationships among psychological factors, immunologic activation, and disease activity in RA.",

Forty-two individuals from an outpatient rheumatology clinic were followed over the course of 1 year and completed measures of attributional style, arthritis helplessness, depression, pain, and disability at Time 1 and Time 2. Objective measures of functional disability were completed by a physician\u2019s assistant after routine physical examinations at both time periods. Results revealed that a pessimistic attributional style at Time 1 significantly predicted lower self-rated disability at Time 2. Similarly, greater arthritis helplessness at Time 1 predicted lower physician-rated disability at Time 2. Results are discussed with particular focus on the utility of differential disability assessments and the potential role of cognitive-behavioral interventions in treating individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.",

The present study examines other psychosocial factors, such as dispositional personality and social relationships, in order to investigate their influence on the well-being of 160 older adults with OA (80% women). Method: Older adults were recruited for self-reported knee or hip OA. Participants completed self-report measures of optimism and pessimism, social support, social strain, and life satisfaction using the computer program MediaLab. Measures were taken twice 9\u201312 months apart. Results: Results showed that, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, pessimism was related to lower social support and higher social strain. In addition, pessimism was mediated by social support in its relationship to life satisfaction. Discussion: Our models support the combined roles of pessimism and social support influencing life satisfaction over time. Future interventions may want to concentrate on improving the social relationships of people with OA to enhance psychological well-being.",

            "abstract": "Using the 2004 General Social Survey (N = 453), the identity stress process is investigated in terms of crises in intimate relationships and at the workplace. I discuss dispositional optimism as a psychological resource that is relatively independent of the situation and the self, making it ideal for structurally disadvantaged actors and for navigating crises that diminish self-based personal resources such as self-esteem. Consistent with this logic, dispositional optimism was associated with increases in self-esteem and self-rated health net of emotional stability; its effect on these outcomes intensified around the time of relationship crises and was stronger for women than for men. Moreover, optimism was more vital to self-rated health than self-esteem during either type of crisis, suggesting it may be a uniquely durable psychological resource in the stress process.",

We ask to what extent are young people able to steer the course of their lives despite the constraining forces of social structure, and how satisfied are they with their lives following the completion of compulsory schooling. Drawing on data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England we use sequence analysis of monthly activity data to identify differences in the timing and sequencing of education and employment transitions. We identified six distinct pathways, differentiating between an academic track, three pathways involving further education and training, as well as a work-focused transition and a group of young people who were over a long period not in education or training (NEET). The findings suggest that not all young people are inclined to follow an academic track and instead select into pathways involving vocational training or further education, enabling them to experience competence and life satisfaction. For others, however, the lack of socioeconomic and psycho-social resources is too overwhelming and they encounter long-term experience of NEET or are not able to transform their educational credentials into employment opportunities. The findings highlight that in addition to considering structural constraints it is important to conceptualise the role of the agent for a better understanding of variations in youth transitions",

            "abstract": "Adopting an ecological perspective on children\u2019s functioning and psychological well-being, we investigated the association between agency and life satisfaction, and its bearing on trauma symptoms and negative emotions in a group of Bedouin children living in the occupied Palestinian territories. Specifically, we hypothesized that the more children were agentic, the more they would be satisfied with their lives; and that greater life satisfaction would be associated with better affect balance, and reduced trauma symptoms. A sample of 286 Bedouin children attending primary schools in four different villages in the Jordan Valley completed the multidimensional students\u2019 life satisfaction scale (MSLSS), positive affect and negative affect scale for children (PANAS-C), Children\u2019s Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13), and the children\u2019s hope scale (CHS). Structural equation modeling was performed to evaluate the cumulative network of direct and indirect effects between children\u2019s agency, life satisfaction, and trauma symptoms. The findings confirmed the key role of life satisfaction in mitigating traumatic reactions. Higher levels of life satisfaction were associated with reduced negative emotions and trauma symptoms, suggesting that agency may be viewed as a pre-determining factor with the potential to protect children from trauma symptoms. We discuss the implications for research and clinical practice.",

            "abstract": "Adopting an ecological perspective on children\u2019s functioning and psychological well-being, we investigated the association between agency and life satisfaction, and its bearing on trauma symptoms and negative emotions in a group of Bedouin children living in the occupied Palestinian territories. Specifically, we hypothesized that the more children were agentic, the more they would be satisfied with their lives; and that greater life satisfaction would be associated with better affect balance, and reduced trauma symptoms. A sample of 286 Bedouin children attending primary schools in four different villages in the Jordan Valley completed the multidimensional students\u2019 life satisfaction scale (MSLSS), positive affect and negative affect scale for children (PANAS-C), Children\u2019s Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13), and the children\u2019s hope scale (CHS). Structural equation modeling was performed to evaluate the cumulative network of direct and indirect effects between children\u2019s agency, life satisfaction, and trauma symptoms. The findings confirmed the key role of life satisfaction in mitigating traumatic reactions. Higher levels of life satisfaction were associated with reduced negative emotions and trauma symptoms, suggesting that agency may be viewed as a pre-determining factor with the potential to protect children from trauma symptoms. We discuss the implications for research and clinical practice.",

Two-hundred-fifty Palestinian children from cities, villages, and refugee camps (M\u2009=\u200911.58, SD\u2009=\u20091.49) completed four self-reported measures, Multilevel Student\u2019s Life Satisfaction Scale, Children\u2019s Hope Scale, Children\u2019s Impact of Event Scale, and Positive and Negative Affect Scales. Based on drawings and walk-along interviews with 75 children (M\u2009=\u200910.27, SD\u2009=\u20091.38), thematic analysis was performed to detect gender and context-specific differences regarding all the variables, which assisted in the interpretation of quantitative findings. Findings showed higher girls\u2019 satisfaction in the dimension of school (MD\u2009=\u20091.497, p< .05) and higher values of negative affect (MD\u2009=\u20091.192, p< .05). Correlation analysis revealed that older girls displayed lower levels of life satisfaction, positive emotions, arousal symptoms, and agency (p< .05). Children living in the West Bank reported higher levels of agency (MD\u2009=\u20091.898, p< .05) in comparison to those in Gaza.
