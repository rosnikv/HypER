Green tea catechin possesses antidiabetic properties and antioxidant capacity. In the present study, we examined the acute and continuous effects of ingestion of catechin-rich green tea on postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in healthy postmenopausal women. Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3\u00a0h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0\u00a0h) and at 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3\u00a0% lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P<\u00a00\u00b705), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed. Conversely, serum postprandial thioredoxin concentrations were 5\u00a0% higher in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). These findings indicate that an acute ingestion of catechin-rich green tea has beneficial effects on postprandial glucose and redox homeostasis in postmenopausal women.",

            "abstract": "Elevated postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress increase the risks of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Green tea catechin possesses antidiabetic properties and antioxidant capacity. In the present study, we examined the acute and continuous effects of ingestion of catechin-rich green tea on postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in healthy postmenopausal women. Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3\u00a0h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0\u00a0h) and at 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3\u00a0% lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P<\u00a00\u00b705), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed. Conversely, serum postprandial thioredoxin concentrations were 5\u00a0% higher in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). These findings indicate that an acute ingestion of catechin-rich green tea has beneficial effects on postprandial glucose and redox homeostasis in postmenopausal women.",

            "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

            "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

However, a clear antioxidant mechanism of dietary isoflavones is still remained to be answered. In this study, the effects of isoflavones on the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Results showed that isoflavones are potential Nrf2-ARE activators while their activities were structure dependent. Biochanin A (BCA), an O-methylated isoflavone with low direct antioxidant activity, can effectively protect HepG2 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative damage via activation of the Nrf2 signaling, and thereby the induction of downstream cytoprotective enzymes including NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, heme oxygenasae-1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. A molecular docking study revealed that BCA could directly bind into the pocket of Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a cytoplasmic suppressor of Nrf2, to facilitate Nrf2 activation. The upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were also involved in the activation of Nrf2 signaling. These findings indicate that the protective actions of dietary isoflavones against oxidative damage may be at least partly due to their ability to enhance the intracellular antioxidant response system by modulating the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.",

            "abstract": "Revision operations have become a new issue after successful artificial joint replacements, and periprosthetic osteolysis leading to prosthetic loosening is the main cause of why the overactivation of osteoclasts (OCs) plays an important role. The effect of biochanin A (BCA) has been examined in osteoporosis, but no study on the role of BCA in prosthetic loosening osteolysis has been conducted yet. In this study, we utilised enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, computed tomography imaging, and histological analysis. Results showed that BCA downregulated the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), and IL\u20101\u03b2 to suppress inflammatory responses. The secretion levels of receptor\u2010activated nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB ligand, CTX\u20101, and osteoclast\u2010associated receptor as well as Ti\u2010induced osteolysis were also reduced. BCA effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed hydroxyapatite resorption by downregulating OC\u2010related genes in vitro. Analysis of mechanisms indicated that BCA inhibited the signalling pathways of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (P38, extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase, and c\u2010JUN N\u2010terminal kinase) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (inhibitor \u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and P65), thereby downregulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 and c\u2010Fos. In conclusion, BCA may be an alternative choice for the prevention of prosthetic loosening caused by OCs.",

            "abstract": "Revision operations have become a new issue after successful artificial joint replacements, and periprosthetic osteolysis leading to prosthetic loosening is the main cause of why the overactivation of osteoclasts (OCs) plays an important role. The effect of biochanin A (BCA) has been examined in osteoporosis, but no study on the role of BCA in prosthetic loosening osteolysis has been conducted yet. In this study, we utilised enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, computed tomography imaging, and histological analysis. Results showed that BCA downregulated the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), and IL\u20101\u03b2 to suppress inflammatory responses. The secretion levels of receptor\u2010activated nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB ligand, CTX\u20101, and osteoclast\u2010associated receptor as well as Ti\u2010induced osteolysis were also reduced. BCA effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed hydroxyapatite resorption by downregulating OC\u2010related genes in vitro. Analysis of mechanisms indicated that BCA inhibited the signalling pathways of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (P38, extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase, and c\u2010JUN N\u2010terminal kinase) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (inhibitor \u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and P65), thereby downregulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 and c\u2010Fos. In conclusion, BCA may be an alternative choice for the prevention of prosthetic loosening caused by OCs.",

Urolithin B (UB), as a potential natural drug, has been reported to exhibit numerous biological activities including antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory but its effects on OP, especially on RANKL\u2010stimulated osteoclast formation and activation, are still understood. In our study, we have demonstrated for the first time that UB inhibits RANKL\u2010induced osteoclast differentiation and explored its potential mechanisms of action. The RAW264.7 cells were cultured and induced with RANKL followed by UB treatment. Then, the effects of UB on mature osteoclast differentiation were evaluated by counting tartrate\u2010resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)\u2010positive multinucleated cells and F\u2010actin ring analysis. Moreover, the effects of UB on RANKL\u2010induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by 2\u2032, 7\u2032\u2010dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH\u2010DA) staining.

            "abstract": "Periodontal disease and arthroplasty prosthesis loosening and destabilization are both associated with osteolysis, which is predominantly caused by abnormal bone resorption triggered by pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Osteoclasts (OCs) are critical players in the process. Concerns regarding the long\u2010term efficacy and side effects of current frontline therapies, however, remain. Alternative therapies are still required. The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of Tenacissoside H (TDH) in RANKL\u2010mediated OC differentiation, as well as inflammatory osteolysis and associated processes. In vitro, bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (BMMs) cultured with RANKL and M\u2010CSF were used to detect TDH in the differentiation and function of OCs. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of specific genes and inflammatory factors in OCs. Western blot was used to identify NFATc1, IKK, NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPK pathway, and oxidative stress\u2010related components. Finally, an LPS\u2010mediated calvarial osteolysis mouse model was employed to explore TDH's role in inflammatory osteolysis. The results showed that in vivo TDH inhibited the differentiation and resorption functions of OCs and down\u2010regulated the transcription of osteoclast\u2010specific genes, as well as Il\u20101\u03b2, Il\u20106 and Tnf\u2010\u03b1. In addition, TDH inhibited the IKK and NF\u2010\u03baB signalling pathways and down\u2010regulated the level of ROS. In vivo studies revealed that TDH improves the bone loss caused by LPS. TDH may be a new candidate or treatment for osteoclast\u2010associated inflammatory osteolytic disease.",
