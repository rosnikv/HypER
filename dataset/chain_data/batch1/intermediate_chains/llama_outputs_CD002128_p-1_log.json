            "abstract": "Abstract Objective To conduct a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in managing secondary sleep disorders and sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. Data sources 13 electronic databases and reference lists of relevant reviews and included studies; Associated Professional Sleep Society abstracts (1999 to 2003). Study selection The efficacy review included randomised controlled trials; the safety review included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Quality assessment Randomised controlled trials were assessed by using the Jadad Scale and criteria by Schulz et al, and non-randomised controlled trials by the Downs and Black checklist. Data extraction and synthesis One reviewer extracted data and another reviewer verified the data extracted. The inverse variance method was used to weight studies and the random effects model was used to analyse data. Main results Six randomised controlled trials with 97 participants showed no evidence that melatonin had an effect on sleep onset latency in people with secondary sleep disorders (weighted mean difference \u221213.2 (95% confidence interval \u221227.3 to 0.9) min). Nine randomised controlled trials with 427 participants showed no evidence that melatonin had an effect on sleep onset latency in people who had sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction (\u22121.0 (\u22122.3 to 0.3) min). 17 randomised controlled trials with 651 participants showed no evidence of adverse effects of melatonin with short term use (three months or less). Conclusions There is no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. There is evidence that melatonin is safe with short term use.",

Main results Six randomised controlled trials with 97 participants showed no evidence that melatonin had an effect on sleep onset latency in people with secondary sleep disorders (weighted mean difference \u221213.2 (95% confidence interval \u221227.3 to 0.9) min). Nine randomised controlled trials with 427 participants showed no evidence that melatonin had an effect on sleep onset latency in people who had sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction (\u22121.0 (\u22122.3 to 0.3) min). 17 randomised controlled trials with 651 participants showed no evidence of adverse effects of melatonin with short term use (three months or less). Conclusions There is no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. There is evidence that melatonin is safe with short term use.",

In this way, melatonin also likely inhibits insulin secretion, whereas using the inositol triphosphate pathway after previous blocking of Gi\u2010proteins by pertussis toxin, melatonin increases insulin secretion. Desynchrony of receptor signaling may lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. This notion has recently been supported by genomewide association studies pinpointing variances of the MT2 receptor as a risk factor for this rapidly spreading metabolic disturbance. As melatonin is secreted in a clearly diurnal fashion, it is safe to assume that it also has a diurnal impact on the blood\u2010glucose\u2010regulating function of the islet.

            "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to rise worldwide and is reaching pandemic proportions. The notion that this is due to obesity, resulting from excessive energy consumption and reduced physical activity, is overly simplistic. Circadian de-synchrony, which occurs when physiological processes are at odds with timing imposed by internal clocks, also promotes obesity and impairs glucose tolerance in mouse models, and is a feature of modern human lifestyles. The purpose of this review is to highlight what is known about glucose metabolism in animal and human models of circadian de-synchrony and examine the evidence as to whether shifts in meal timing contribute to impairments in glucose metabolism, gut hormone secretion and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Lastly, we examine whether restricting food intake to discrete time periods, will prevent or reverse abnormalities in glucose metabolism with the view to improving metabolic health in shift workers and in those more generally at risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",

            "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to rise worldwide and is reaching pandemic proportions. The notion that this is due to obesity, resulting from excessive energy consumption and reduced physical activity, is overly simplistic. Circadian de-synchrony, which occurs when physiological processes are at odds with timing imposed by internal clocks, also promotes obesity and impairs glucose tolerance in mouse models, and is a feature of modern human lifestyles. The purpose of this review is to highlight what is known about glucose metabolism in animal and human models of circadian de-synchrony and examine the evidence as to whether shifts in meal timing contribute to impairments in glucose metabolism, gut hormone secretion and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Lastly, we examine whether restricting food intake to discrete time periods, will prevent or reverse abnormalities in glucose metabolism with the view to improving metabolic health in shift workers and in those more generally at risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of the gut microbiome with respect to health care prevention and diagnostic purposes is increasingly the focus of current research. We analyzed around 2000 stool samples from the KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing representing a total microbial diversity of 2089 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We evaluated the combination of three different components to assess the reflection of obesity related to microbiota profiles: (i) four prediction methods (i.e., partial least squares (PLS), support vector machine regression (SVMReg), random forest (RF), and M5Rules); (ii) five OTU data transformation approaches (i.e., no transformation, relative abundance without and with log-transformation, as well as centered and isometric log-ratio transformations); and (iii) predictions from nine measurements of obesity (i.e., body mass index, three measures of body shape, and five measures of body composition). Our results showed a substantial impact of all three components. The applications of SVMReg and PLS in combination with logarithmic data transformations resulted in considerably predictive models for waist circumference-related endpoints. These combinations were at best able to explain almost 40% of the variance in obesity measurements based on stool microbiota data (i.e., OTUs) only. A reduced loss in predictive performance was seen after sex-stratification in waist\u2013height ratio compared to other waist-related measurements. Moreover, our analysis showed that the contribution of OTUs less prevalent and abundant is minor concerning the predictive power of our models.",
