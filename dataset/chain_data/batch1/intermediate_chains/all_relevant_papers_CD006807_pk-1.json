        "relevance": 2,
        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it evaluates the efficacy of an absorbable ligation clip, which was previously shown to be effective in laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the source paper."
