        "title": "Effectiveness of a community health worker intervention among African American and Latino adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nWe tested the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, behavioral theory-based community health worker intervention for improving glycemic control.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used a randomized, 6-month delayed control group design among 164 African American and Latino adult participants recruited from 2 health systems in Detroit, Michigan. Our study was guided by the principles of community-based participatory research. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was the primary outcome measure. Using an empowerment-based approach, community health workers provided participants with diabetes self-management education and regular home visits, and accompanied them to a clinic visit during the 6-month intervention period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in the intervention group had a mean HbA1c value of 8.6% at baseline, which improved to a value of 7.8% at 6 months, for an adjusted change of -0.8 percentage points (P < .01). There was no change in mean HbA1c among the control group (8.5%). Intervention participants also had significantly greater improvements in self-reported diabetes understanding compared with the control group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study contributes to the growing evidence for the effectiveness of community health workers and their role in multidisciplinary teams engaged in culturally appropriate health care delivery.",

        "abstract": "nelson n, wong d & lai e (2011)\u00a0Journal of Nursing and Healthcare of Chronic Illness3, 496\u2013503 A self-management program for veterans and spouses living with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n \n \n \nAims and objectives.\u2002 The objective of this study was to determine whether Veterans and their spouses would participate in a self-management educational programme where they would practise the principles of self-efficacy for managing their chronic illnesses. The programme was designed using the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. \n \n \n \nBackground.\u2002 Whereas programmes for self-management of chronic conditions (arthritis, AIDS, diabetes) have been established for some time, only a few specific programmes for Parkinson\u2019s disease had been cited in the literature at the time of this study. In this report, we describe our initial attempts at recruitment, administration and evaluation of this programme for a small group of participants with the specific intent of assessing its feasibility and appropriateness for Veterans seen in an outpatient setting. \n \n \n \nConclusions.\u2002 Our study revealed that participants were willing to commit to an intensive interventional programme, and within the group setting were able to apply the principles of self-efficacy with guidance from their peers and facilitator. The support of the group was a strong motivator for continued participation and the practice of self-management skills. However, the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease and the lack of long-term follow-up prevented the identification of measurable significant changes. \n \n \n \nRelevance to clinical practice.\u2002 Patients living with chronic illness appear to benefit from group educational programmes, and this format could be adapted for others living with neurodegenerative illnesses and other chronic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Background Research suggests that psychoeducation, relapse prevention and recovery are all the key aspects of psychological treatment for bipolar disorder and the common components of self-management programmes. Aims This review traces the origins of self-management interventions as it appears in physical health research and evaluates the current evidence associated with self-management interventions for depression and more specifically for bipolar disorder. Method Literature review. Results Despite significant clinical and cost benefits associated with self-management programmes for physical and mental health problems, to date there has been less progress in the development of self-management interventions for bipolar disorder. Preliminary evidence indicates that people with bipolar disorder will engage with self-management support. Conclusion The rapid development and evaluation of self-management programmes for bipolar disorder is an important research and clinical priority.",
