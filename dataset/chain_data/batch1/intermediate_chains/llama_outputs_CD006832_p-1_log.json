However, the effect of high doses of growth hormone on the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the outcome in critically ill adults who are hospitalized for long periods is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out two prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in parallel involving 247 Finnish patients and 285 patients in other European countries who had been in an intensive care unit for 5 to 7 days and who were expected to require intensive care for at least 10 days. The patients had had cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple trauma, or acute respiratory failure. The patients received either growth hormone (mean [+/-SD] daily dose, 0.10 +/- 0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo until discharge from intensive care or for a maximum of 21 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe in-hospital mortality rate was higher in the patients who received growth hormone than in those who did not (P<0.001 for both studies). In the Finnish study, the mortality rate was 39 percent in the growth hormone group, as compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. The respective rates in the multinational study were 44 percent and 18 percent. The relative risk of death for patients receiving growth hormone was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.9) in the Finnish study and 2.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.5) in the multinational study. Among the survivors, the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital and the duration of mechanical ventilation were prolonged in the growth hormone group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with prolonged critical illness, high doses of growth hormone are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.",

Total intramuscular water increased by 12% +/- 14% in the control group as a result of an increase in extracellular water of 67% +/- 86%; these increases were not seen in the GH group. In contrast, the intracellular water increased by 6% +/- 8% in the GH group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with GH for 5 days in patients with multiple organ failure stimulated muscle protein synthesis, increased muscle free glutamine, and increased intracellular muscle water.",

Possible explanations included inhibition of glutamine release from skeletal muscle and consequent restriction of splanchnic glutamine supply. In this study, we examined the effects of rhGH on plasma glutamine levels and on muscle and liver glutamine concentrations and protein synthesis rates in sepsis. We investigated the possibility that administration of supplemental glutamine might ameliorate any adverse effects of rhGH. DesignProspective study in rats rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture. SettingUniversity hospital laboratory. SubjectsA total of 78 male Wistar rats in six groups. InterventionsAnimals received 6-hr tail vein infusions, commencing 18 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, of either (a) 0.9% sodium chloride, (b) a standard parenteral nutrition (PN) solution without glutamine, or (c) an isocaloric, isonitrogenous PN solution with glutamine.

Protein synthesis in muscle and liver was measured by a \u201cflooding-dose\u201d technique employing l-[4-H]phenylalanine. Plasma glutamine was increased after cecal ligation and puncture except in the saline and glutamine with rhGH animals.

Liver glutamine was increased in animals receiving saline and those receiving standard PN with rhGH. PN, with or without glutamine, increased muscle protein synthesis, and the administration of rhGH tended to further increase this effect. Neither PN, glutamine, nor rhGH had an effect on the increased liver protein synthesis characteristic of sepsis. ConclusionsIn sepsis, increased muscle protein synthesis with PN and rhGH administration is not associated with increased muscle glutamine levels. Administration of rhGH does not result in reduced liver glutamine levels or rates of hepatic protein synthesis.

            "abstract": "The effect of sepsis on liver synthesis of albumin remains controversial, with studies in man suggesting that synthesis increases, whereas in animals increased, decreased and unaltered synthesis have been reported. To reconcile these conflicting data, total and relative albumin synthesis was measured in rats 24 h after caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) by immunoprecipitation of albumin following a flooding dose of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine. Following CLP, animals were starved for 18 h and then received intravenous infusions of saline or parenteral nutrition (PN) with or without glutamine for 6 h. In animals receiving PN, parenteral injections of growth hormone (GH) or saline vehicle were also administered. Fractional rate of liver total protein synthesis was elevated and total albumin synthesis rate was reduced in all CLP groups when compared with non-operated animals. Total albumin synthesis was also lower in all animals receiving PN than those receiving saline alone, although these differences did not attain statistical significance, except for the group receiving PN+GH. Relative albumin synthesis was also reduced after CLP, and was significantly lower in animals receiving PN than in those receiving saline alone. These findings suggest that in sepsis hepatic protein synthesis is reprioritized away from the production of albumin towards the production of acute-phase proteins and that this change is not influenced by the provision of nutritional support, glutamine or the administration of GH.",

Design:A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Setting:Adult intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients:Fifty-five critically ill, septic patients requiring enteral feeding. Interventions:Patients received either an enteral supplement (500 mL of Intestamin, Fresenius Kabi) containing conditionally essential nutrients or a control solution via the nasogastric route for up to 10 days. Inclusion occurred within 24 hrs of intensive care unit admission. Additionally, patients received enteral feeding with an immunonutrition formula (experimental group) or standard formula (control group) initiated within 48 hrs after enrollment. Measurements and Main Results:Organ dysfunction was assessed by daily total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score over the 10-day study period in both patient groups. Patients receiving the experimental supplement showed a significantly faster decline in the regression slopes of delta daily total SOFA score over time compared with control. The difference between the regression coefficients of the two slopes was significant irrespective of the level of analysis: intent to treat \u22120.32 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; per protocol \u22120.34 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; and completers (patients receiving \u226580% of the calculated caloric target over a period of 6 days), \u22120.26 vs. \u22120.16, p = .0005. Vitamin C, as a marker of supplement absorption, increased from 10.6 (1.9\u2013159.4) &mgr;mol/L (normal range 20\u201350 &mgr;mol/L) on day 1 to 58.7 (5.4\u2013189.9) &mgr;mol/L by day 3 (p = .002) in the intervention group but remained below the normal range in the control group 17.0 (2.8\u201378.5) on day 1 and 14.3 (2.4\u2013179.6) on day 3. Serum levels of glycine, serine, arginine, ornithine, vitamin E, and &bgr;-carotene all increased significantly with treatment in the supplementation group.

SummaryDespite routine use of parenteral nutrition, surprisingly little clinical efficacy data are available to guide total or specific amino acid dosing in adult and pediatric patients requiring this therapy. This warrants increased attention by the research community and funding agencies to better define optimal amino acid administration strategies in patient subgroups requiring parenteral nutrition.",

Currently, the existing agents for T2DM treatment target only blood glucose levels. Over the past decades, specific building blocks of proteins\u2014branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including leucine, isoleucine, and valine\u2014have gained attention because they are linked with insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and diabetes development. In this review, we discuss the hypothetical link between BCAA metabolism, insulin resistance, T2DM, and its microvascular complications including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Further research on these amino acids and their derivates may eventually pave the way to novel biomarkers or therapeutic concepts for the treatment of diabetes and its accompanied complications.",
