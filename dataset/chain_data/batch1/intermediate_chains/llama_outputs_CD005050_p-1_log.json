We included 658 optimally treated CAD patients; 477 men, mean age 59.9+/-10.3 years. Three hundred and twenty-five patients received the influenza vaccine, and 333 patients placebo. Median follow-up was 298 (interquartile range 263-317) days. Primary endpoint was the cardiovascular death. Its estimated 12-month cumulative event rate was 0.63% in the vaccine vs. 0.76% in controls (HR 1.06 95% CI: 0.15-7.56, P = 0.95). There were two secondary composite endpoints: (i) the MACE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization) tended to occur less frequently in the vaccine group vs. placebo with the event rate 3.00 and 5.87%, respectively (HR 0.54;95% CI: 0.24-1.21, P = 0.13). (ii) Coronary ischaemic event (MACE or hospitalization for myocardial ischaemia) estimated 12-month event rate was significantly lower in the vaccine group 6.02 vs. 9.97% in controls (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.29-0.99, P = 0.047).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn optimally treated CAD patients influenza vaccination improves the clinical course of CAD and reduces the frequency of coronary ischaemic events.

            "abstract": "Vaccination against influenza averts cardiovascular events and is recommended for all patients with coronary heart disease. Because data were unavailable regarding vaccination rates among such patients' household contacts, we sought to estimate the rate of influenza vaccination in persons with cardiovascular disease and their contacts. In 2004, we conducted a random, nationwide telephone survey of 1,202 adults (age, > or = 18 yr) to ascertain knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding influenza vaccination. Of the interviewees, 134 (11.1%) had histories of heart disease or stroke. Of these 134, 57% were men, and 45% were > or = 65 years of age. Overall, 57% were inoculated against influenza in 2003-2004, and 68% intended the same during 2004-2005. Vaccination rates increased with age: 48% (ages, 18-49 yr), 68% (ages, 50-64 yr), and 75% (age, > or = 65 yr). Forty of 69 respondents (58%) reported that their spouses were vaccinated, and 7 of 21 (33%) reported the inoculation of children < or = 17 years old in their household. Only 65% of the 134 patients considered themselves to be of high-risk status. Chief reasons for remaining unvaccinated were disbelief in being at risk and fear of contracting influenza from the vaccine. Although seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all coronary heart disease patients and their household contacts, the practice is less prevalent than is optimal. Intensified approaches are needed to increase vaccination rates. These findings suggest a need to increase vaccination efforts in high-risk subjects, particularly amidst the emerging H1N1 pandemic.",

The risk groups are children with chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) such as children on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD), predialysis CKD (pCKD) and renal transplant (RTx) patients and immunosuppressed children. The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a single administration of a monovalent inactivated pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine in children with CKD. Methods: Patients were given a single intramuscular injection of 0.5 ml of monovalent inactivated vaccine. Results: Totally, there were 25 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of CKD (16 PD, 2 HD, 3 pCKD and 4 RTx). Seroconversion was observed in 15 of the 16 patients with PD. Seroconversion occurred in all patients undergoing pCKD and HD. However, 3 of the RTx patients were seronegative. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a high level of immunogenicity and safety of an (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine in children with CKD.",

Areas covered: This paper explores why compliance with official recommendations for influenza vaccination is poor in patients with ESRD and analyzes the true risk of infection as well as the immunogenicity, the effectiveness and the safety of influenza vaccination in these patients. Expert opinion: Epidemiological and clinical data support the importance of influenza in conditioning clinical deterioration of patients with ESRD, particularly in relation to their level of immunosuppression. However, the variable levels of immunodeficiency detected in patients with ESRD may reduce the immune response to influenza vaccination, which appears to be lower than that usually found in healthy subjects. However, few studies are available, and they are difficult to compare for several reasons. Additionally, limited data have been collected on influenza vaccine effectiveness, although the available studies support positive results of vaccination on outcomes of severe disease. Despite such limitations, it is important to highlight that all the available studies have confirmed the good safety and tolerability of inactivated influenza vaccines. These findings, together with the risks associated with influenza in these patients, support annual influenza vaccination in patients with ESRD as well as vaccination of their close contacts and should be presented in educational programs organized for nephrologists and patient associations.",

            "abstract": "A broad T cell receptor (TCR-) repertoire is required for an effective immune response. TCR-repertoire diversity declines with age. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have a prematurely aged T cell system which is associated with defective T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we showed that ESRD may significantly skew the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire. Here, we assessed the impact of ESRD on the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire within different T cell subsets using a multiparameter flow-cytometry-based assay, controlling for effects of aging and CMV latency. Percentages of 24 different TCR V\u03b2-families were tested in circulating naive and memory T cell subsets of 10 ESRD patients and 10 age- and CMV-serostatus-matched healthy individuals (HI). The Gini-index, a parameter used in economics to describe the distribution of income, was calculated to determine the extent of skewing at the subset level taking into account frequencies of all 24 TCR V\u03b2-families. In addition, using HI as reference population, the differential impact of ESRD was assessed on clonal expansion at the level of an individual TCR V\u03b2-family. CD8+, but not CD4+, T cell differentiation was associated with higher Gini-TCR indices. Gini-TCR indices were already significantly higher for different CD8+ memory T cell subsets of younger ESRD patients compared to their age-matched HI. ESRD induced expansions of not one TCR V\u03b2-family in particular and expansions were predominantly observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment. All ESRD patients had expanded TCR V\u03b2-families within total CD8+ T cells and the median (IQ range) number of expanded TCR V\u03b2-families/patient amounted to 2 (1\u20134). Interestingly, ESRD also induced clonal expansions of TCR V\u03b2-families within naive CD8+ T cells as 8 out of 10 patients had expanded TCR V\u03b2-families. The median (IQ range) number of expanded families/patient amounted to 1 (1\u20131) within naive CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, loss of renal function skews the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire already in younger patients by inducing expansions of different TCR V\u03b2-families within the various T cell subsets, primarily affecting the CD8+ T cell compartment. This skewed TCR V\u03b2-repertoire may be associated with a less broad and diverse T cell-mediated immunity.",

            "abstract": "A broad T cell receptor (TCR-) repertoire is required for an effective immune response. TCR-repertoire diversity declines with age. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have a prematurely aged T cell system which is associated with defective T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we showed that ESRD may significantly skew the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire. Here, we assessed the impact of ESRD on the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire within different T cell subsets using a multiparameter flow-cytometry-based assay, controlling for effects of aging and CMV latency. Percentages of 24 different TCR V\u03b2-families were tested in circulating naive and memory T cell subsets of 10 ESRD patients and 10 age- and CMV-serostatus-matched healthy individuals (HI). The Gini-index, a parameter used in economics to describe the distribution of income, was calculated to determine the extent of skewing at the subset level taking into account frequencies of all 24 TCR V\u03b2-families. In addition, using HI as reference population, the differential impact of ESRD was assessed on clonal expansion at the level of an individual TCR V\u03b2-family. CD8+, but not CD4+, T cell differentiation was associated with higher Gini-TCR indices. Gini-TCR indices were already significantly higher for different CD8+ memory T cell subsets of younger ESRD patients compared to their age-matched HI. ESRD induced expansions of not one TCR V\u03b2-family in particular and expansions were predominantly observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment. All ESRD patients had expanded TCR V\u03b2-families within total CD8+ T cells and the median (IQ range) number of expanded TCR V\u03b2-families/patient amounted to 2 (1\u20134). Interestingly, ESRD also induced clonal expansions of TCR V\u03b2-families within naive CD8+ T cells as 8 out of 10 patients had expanded TCR V\u03b2-families. The median (IQ range) number of expanded families/patient amounted to 1 (1\u20131) within naive CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, loss of renal function skews the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire already in younger patients by inducing expansions of different TCR V\u03b2-families within the various T cell subsets, primarily affecting the CD8+ T cell compartment. This skewed TCR V\u03b2-repertoire may be associated with a less broad and diverse T cell-mediated immunity.",

            "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes with potent antitumor functions and, consequently, several NK cell-based strategies have been developed for cancer immunotherapy. A remarkable therapeutic approach is the adoptive transfer of NK cells stimulated with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18. This cytokine stimulation endows NK cells with properties that resemble immunological memory and, for this reason, they are known as cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells. Very promising results have been reported in clinical trials and yet, there are still unknown aspects of CIML NK cells. Here, we have conducted a preliminary study of their mitochondrial dynamics. Our results show that upon IL-12/15/18 stimulation the viability of NK cells decreased and an increment in mitochondrial superoxide levels was observed. In addition, we found that mitochondria appeared slightly elongated and their cristae density decreased following IL-12/15/18 stimulation, possibly in a process mediated by the low levels of optic atrophy type 1 (OPA1) protein. Interestingly, although mitophagy was slightly impaired, an increase in autophagic flux was observed, which might explain the reduced viability and the accumulation of unfit mitochondria. Our findings could be of relevance in order to design new strategies intended to improve the mitochondrial fitness of IL-12/15/18-stimulated NK cells with the aim of improving their therapeutic efficacy.",
