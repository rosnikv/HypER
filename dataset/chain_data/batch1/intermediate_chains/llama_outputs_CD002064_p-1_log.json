This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to address whether IGF-1 benefited patients with ALS. Methods: A total of 330 patients from 20 medical centers were randomized to receive 0.05 mg/kg body weight of human recombinant IGF-1 given subcutaneously twice daily or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome measure was change in their manual muscle testing score. Secondary outcome measures included tracheostomy-free survival and rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale. Intention to treat analysis was used. Results: There was no difference between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcome measures after the 2-year treatment period.

We sought to review information in these prospective datasets and assess whether natural history of ALS has changed over time.

Similar data from the placebo arms of 12 other published efficacy ALS trials conducted between 1990 and 2008 were compared descriptively. In the three NEALS clinical trials, survival improved over time in the placebo cohort (p=0.05) while the rate of change in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) (p=0.15), ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) (p=0.6) and vital capacity (%VC) (p=0.5) was unchanged. No differences were observed in the mean rates of decline of these outcome measures in the published clinical trials. However, survival improved in the more recently conducted trials. Survival improved over time in placebo controlled participants enrolled in clinical trials in ALS since 1990. However, the decline in measures of function appears unchanged since then. These changes in natural history reflect improvements in symptomatic care of ALS.",

Understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of ALS has improved considerably in the past decade, but biomarkers of disease activity remain lacking.

Here we perform a multicenter study to further assess EIM\u2019s potential for tracking ALS. ALS patients were enrolled across eight sites. Each subject underwent EIM, handheld dynamometry (HHD), and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) regularly. Techniques were compared by assessing the coefficient of variation (CoV) in the rate of decline and each technique\u2019s correlation to survival. Results showed that in the 60 patients followed for one year, EIM phase measured from the most rapidly progressing muscle in each patient had a CoV in the rate of decline of 0.62, compared to HHD (0.82) and the ALSFRS-R (0.74). Restricting the measurements to the first six months gave a CoV of 0.55 for EIM, 0.93 for HHD, and 0.84 for ALSFRS-R. For both time-periods, all three measures correlated with survival. Based on these data, a six-month clinical trial designed to detect a 20% treatment effect with 80% power using EIM would require only 95 patients/arm compared to the ALSFRS-R, which would require 220 subjects/arm. In conclusion, EIM can serve as a useful ALS biomarker that offers the prospect of greatly accelerating phase 2 clinical trials.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Electrical impedance myography (EIM), a non-invasive, electrophysiological technique, has preliminarily shown value as an ALS biomarker. Here we perform a multicenter study to further assess EIM\u2019s potential for tracking ALS. ALS patients were enrolled across eight sites. Each subject underwent EIM, handheld dynamometry (HHD), and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) regularly. Techniques were compared by assessing the coefficient of variation (CoV) in the rate of decline and each technique\u2019s correlation to survival. Results showed that in the 60 patients followed for one year, EIM phase measured from the most rapidly progressing muscle in each patient had a CoV in the rate of decline of 0.62, compared to HHD (0.82) and the ALSFRS-R (0.74). Restricting the measurements to the first six months gave a CoV of 0.55 for EIM, 0.93 for HHD, and 0.84 for ALSFRS-R. For both time-periods, all three measures correlated with survival. Based on these data, a six-month clinical trial designed to detect a 20% treatment effect with 80% power using EIM would require only 95 patients/arm compared to the ALSFRS-R, which would require 220 subjects/arm. In conclusion, EIM can serve as a useful ALS biomarker that offers the prospect of greatly accelerating phase 2 clinical trials.",

Methods Twenty-three animals received 8 mg/kg/day riluzole in the drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age; 22 animals served as controls. Weight, motor score, PGE, CMAP, MUNE, and EIM were performed weekly to evaluate disease progression. Results No difference in clinical disease onset or survival was found between treated and untreated groups. In addition, all methods failed to identify any beneficial effect of riluzole. Thus, data from all animals were combined for additional analyses. Of the 4 parameters, EIM phase showed the earliest change from baseline and the most linear decline throughout the entire measurement period. In addition, EIM phase correlated with PGE, CMAP amplitude, and MUNE (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a0.92, 0.90, and 0.72, respectively, p<0.01 for all). The rate of EIM phase decline also correlated with individual animal survival (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.31, p<0.05).

Patient data were assessed for reliability, agreement and classification performance. Main results: No effect on phase spectra was seen if all electrodes remained in contact with the tissue. Small effects on magnitude were observed. Cole-Cole circuit simulations indicated capacitance reduced with disease severity. Lateral tongue muscle recordings in both patients and healthy volunteers were reproducible and symmetrical.

            "abstract": "Aging is a non-modifiable risk factor for stroke and the global burden of stroke is continuing to increase due to the aging society. Muscle dysfunction, common sequela of stroke, has long been of research interests. Therefore, how to accurately assess muscle function is particularly important. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) has proven to be feasible to assess muscle impairment in patients with stroke in terms of micro structures, such as muscle membrane integrity, extracellular and intracellular fluids. However, EIM alone is not sufficient to assess muscle function comprehensively given the complex contributors to paretic muscle after an insult. This article discusses the potential to combine EIM and other common quantitative methods as ways to improve the assessment of muscle function in stroke survivors. Clinically, these combined assessments provide not only a distinct advantage for greater accuracy of muscle assessment through cross-validation, but also the physiological explanation on muscle dysfunction at the micro level. Different combinations of assessments are discussed with insights for different purposes. The assessments of morphological, mechanical and contractile properties combined with EIM are focused since changes in muscle structures, tone and strength directly reflect the muscle function of stroke survivors. With advances in computational technology, finite element model and machine learning model that incorporate multi-modal evaluation parameters to enable the establishment of predictive or diagnostic model will be the next step forward to assess muscle function for individual with stroke.",
