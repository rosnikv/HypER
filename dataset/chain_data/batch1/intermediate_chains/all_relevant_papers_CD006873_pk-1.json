        "abstract": "Methods: A multicentre randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of oral mesalazine (5\u2010aminosalicylic acid) for the prevention of post\u2010operative recurrence in 110 patients operated on for Crohn's disease by first intestinal resection. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 2.4 g/day of mesalazine, or no treatment at all. The protocol included colonoscopy with ileoscopy at 6 months and yearly thereafter. Recurrence was denned on the basis of endoscopic criteria and classified as mild or severe.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper, as it investigates another drug (mesalazine) for the prevention of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease, similar to the source paper's exploration of sulfasalazine prophylaxis."
