            "abstract": "A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the use of absorbable clips in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Fifty consecutive patients, 36 females and 14 males, were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients had metal clips, and group 2 patients had absorbable clips applied on the cystic duct and cystic artery. These patients were followed for 3 months postoperatively. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. The absorbable clips were as effective as the metal clips in providing hemostasis and securing on the cystic duct stump.",

            "abstract": "We present a retrospective study of the use of titanium and absorbable clips during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim was to determine any differences in outcome and costs. From January 1999 to February 2002, 690 patients who had successfully undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed. According to the type of clip, we retrospectively identified two groups of patients: 199 in whom the surgeons had used absorbable clips (absorbable clip group, ACG) and 491 in whom the surgeons had used titanium nonabsorbable clips (titanium clip group, TCG). Data about demographics, operation, results, complications, and follow-up were collected and matched in the two groups. Demographics, concomitant surgery, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status were comparable between the two groups. Although the proportions of cases requiring urgent operation, intraoperative cholangiography, use of a fourth trocar, and use of drainage suction were similar, the difficulty score of the operation was lower (6.3 vs. 7.0, P =.03) and the operative time was shorter (44 vs. 61 minutes, P <.0001) in the ACG than in the TCG. Complications, hospital stay, and long-term results were satisfactory and comparable between the two groups. No correlation was found between clip type and the incidence of biliary tree injuries, bleeding, wound infection, or readmission. The cost of the two types of clips varied slightly (90 euros for each procedure). Despite the fact that absorbable clips are theoretically less likely to cause complications than metallic ones, we were not able to demonstrate any clinical advantage during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this retrospective study. Furthermore, the results suggest that absorbable clips are preferred when the cholecystectomy presents fewer difficulties.",

The patient experienced right chest pain and swelling; radiography and CT showed an intrathoracic abscess penetrating the extrathoracic space and the presence of metal clips over the diaphragm. After drainage of the subcutaneous abscess, fluid accumulation decreased; bacterial examination showed no positive findings. Another year later, the patient's condition relapsed. We thought that the empyema may have been caused by endoclips that had migrated. We performed thoracoplasty and retrieved three endoclips from the intrathoracic empyema cavity. The patient showed good recovery after the operation.",
