        "title": "Low power laser therapy of shoulder tendonitis.",
        "abstract": "30 patients with supraspinatus or bicipital tendonitis were randomly allocated to active infrared laser therapy at 904 nm three times weekly for 2 weeks, dummy laser or drug treatment for 2 weeks. Objectively maximum active extension, flexion and abduction of the shoulder, and subjectively pain stiffness movement and function were measured at 0 and 2 weeks. Significant improvement of active over dummy laser was noted for all seven assessments. Active laser therapy produced significant improvement over drug therapy for all three objective measures and pain. Naproxen sodium significantly improved only movement and function compared to dummy laser. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of laser therapy in tendonitis of the shoulder.",

However, it is inspired by the findings of the source paper regarding the potential benefits of laser therapy in reducing pain and inflammation."
