        "abstract": "Treatment of recurrent hepatitis C in liver transplant is controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and histological efficacy of pegylated interferon alpha 2b (PEG\u2010IFN) and ribavirin therapy of recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation (LT). We prospectively included 47 liver transplant patients with: 1) a positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010ribonucleic acid (RNA) in serum; 2) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >45 UI/mL; and 3) a liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis without rejection in the previous 2 months. Patients received PEG\u2010IFN (1.5 \u03bcg/kg/week) and ribavirin (800\u20101,000 mg/day) for 12 months. Follow\u2010up was based on biochemical (ALT), virological (RNA\u2010HCV), and histological (liver biopsy) examinations. Follow\u2010up lasted a minimum of 6 months after the end of antiviral therapy. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 23% of the patients. A total of 33 (70%) patients had normalized ALT levels at the end of therapy. Inflammatory portal and lobular score declined significantly in patients with SVR (P < 0.05) but not in nonresponder patients. Fibrosis did not change significantly in either group. SVR was significantly associated with low \u03b3\u2010glutamyltransferase GGT (P = 0.04) and HCV\u2010RNA levels (P = 0.03), a virological response at 12 weeks (P = 0.002) and patient's compliance (P = 0.04). Ten (21%) patients were withdrawn prematurely due to adverse effects. In conclusion, Therapy with PEG\u2010IFN and ribavirin achieved SVR and a significant histological improvement in 23% of liver transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C. Toxicity is an important drawback of this therapy. Liver Transpl 12:1805\u20101812, 2006. \u00a9 2006 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) is universal, and frequently leads to cirrhosis and death. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 48\u2010weeks of full\u2010dose peg\u2010interferon\u2010\u03b1\u20102a (n = 4) or \u03b1\u20102b (n = 51) plus ribavirin (>11 mg/kg/day) in a multicentric cohort of 55 patients \u226512 months after LT. All subjects had histologically proven HCV recurrence, excluding severe cholestatic recurrence. Mean age was 54.3 \u00b1 9.7, 77% male, 90.9% genotype 1, 32.7% cirrhotics. All but 5 patients received monotherapy with tacrolimus (54.5%), cyclosporine (30.7%) or mycophenolate mofetil (5.5%). The rates of end\u2010of\u2010treatment response and sustained virological response (SVR) were 66.7% and 43.6%, respectively. Low baseline HCV\u2010RNA (p = 0.005) and a length from LT to therapy between 2\u20134 years (p = 0.011) were predictors of SVR. The lack of achieving a viral load decrease \u22651\u2010log10 at week 4 and/or 2\u2010log10 at week 12 was 100% predictive of failure. The most frequent side effects were neutropenia (76,4%), anemia (60%) and infectious complications (30.9%). Toxicity led to peg\u2010interferon withdrawal in 16 (29%) subjects. In 15 patients with post\u2010treatment biopsy, the histological activity index was significantly improved (p = 0.006), whereas fibrosis did not change (p = 0.14). Three patients died (cholangitis, hepatic artery thrombosis and lung cancer). In conclusion, HCV therapy after LT was very effective, although it led to a significant rate of toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Recurrence of hepatitis C after liver transplantation (LT) is the main cause of graft loss and retransplantation. Frequent liver biopsies are essential to follow\u2010up hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2013induced liver damage. However, liver biopsy is an invasive and expensive procedure. We evaluated prospectively the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive measurement of liver stiffness (by transient elastography) to assess the severity of hepatitis C recurrence after LT. For this purpose, we included 124 HCV\u2010infected liver transplant recipients who underwent 169 liver biopsies and 129 hepatic hemodynamic studies with determination of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Simultaneously, patients underwent measurement of liver stiffness. Liver fibrosis was mild (F0\u2010F1) in 96 cases (57%) and significant (F2\u2010F4) in 73 (43%). HVPG was normal (<6 mm Hg) in 69 cases (54%) and elevated (\u22656 mm Hg) in 60 (46%). Using a liver stiffness cutoff value of 8.5 kilopascals, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for diagnosis of fibrosis \u2265F2 were 90%, 81%, 79%, and 92%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis of fibrosis \u2265F2, \u2265F3 and F4 were 0.90, 0.93, and 0.98, respectively. There was a close direct correlation between liver stiffness and HVPG (Pearson coefficient, 0.84; P < 0.001) and the AUC for diagnosis of portal hypertension (HVPG \u22656 mm Hg) was 0.93. Importantly, none of the individuals with liver stiffness below the cutoff value had either bridging fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) or significant portal hypertension (HVPG \u226510 mm Hg). In conclusion, determination of liver stiffness is an extremely valuable tool to assess the severity of HCV recurrence after LT and in reducing the need of follow\u2010up liver biopsies.

        "abstract": "Background. Recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) after liver transplantation (OLT) is a major cause of graft loss in HCV-positive patients. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon alfa-2b (peginterferon) and ribavirin treatment for recurrent HCV after OLT and analyzed the influence of antiviral treatment on the histological course of recurrent hepatitis. Methods. Twenty-five patients with recurrent HCV (genotype 1 n=20 and 2\u20134 n=5) received peginterferon (1 mg/kg/weekly) and ribavirin (600 mg) for 48 weeks. Viral load prior to treatment was below 1,000,000 (IU/ml) in 11 of 25 patients. Sustained antiviral response was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA in serum 6 months after stopping of therapy. All patients underwent liver biopsy prior to treatment and after 72 weeks. Results. Seventeen of 25 patients became HCV-RNA-negative after treatment (68%). Sustained virologic response (SVR) was achieved in 9/25 (36%) patients. Liver specimen showed increase of fibrosis from 1.7 to 2.0 within 72 weeks. Side effects like neutropenia (60%) and anemia (36%) were treated with G-CSF, erythropoietin, and dose reduction of peginterferon and ribavirin. Conclusions. The use of peginterferon is safe and effective in patients with recurrent HCV. Treatment of side effects, especially neutropenia or anemia, helped to maintain antiviral therapy. Despite a viral response of 68% during treatment, the patients showed further progress of recurrent hepatitis in liver specimen.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects approximately 1.3% of the general U.S. population and 5\u201310% of veterans who use Department of Veterans Affairs medical services. Chronic HCV is clearly linked to the development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. The consequences of HCV infection constitute a significant disease burden and demonstrate the need for effective medical care. Treatment of chronic HCV is aimed at slowing disease progression, preventing complications of cirrhosis, reducing the risk of HCC, and treating extrahepatic complications of the virus. As part of a comprehensive approach to HCV management, antiviral therapy with peginterferon alfa combined with ribavirin is the current standard of care. Antiviral therapy should be provided to those individuals who meet criteria for treatment and who are at greatest risk for progressive liver disease. Many of these patients may have comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, which may worsen while on antiviral therapy. Current antiviral regimens are associated with significant adverse effects that can lead to noncompliance, dose reduction, and treatment discontinuation. To overcome these barriers and to address these issues, it has become crucial to facilitate a multidisciplinary team who can respond to and provide HCV-specific care and treatment. Screening for HCV, preventing transmission, delaying disease progression, ensuring appropriate antiviral therapy, and managing treatment-related adverse effects can improve patient quality of life, treatment adherence, and ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",

We evaluated efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy in LT recipients with recurrent HCV and factors associated with SVR. All subjects with histologic evidence of recurrent HCV were intended to be treated for 48 weeks with full\u2010dose pegylated IFN; target dose of RBV was 800 mg/day. Thirty\u2010five LT recipients with recurrent HCV, median age 48.5 years, 77% genotype 1, and median pretreatment HCV RNA 6.4 log10 IU/mL were treated between January 2000 and February 2006.

We examined the incidence of chronic ductopenic rejection (CR) in patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (PEG) to treat recurrent HCV. Methods. A chart review of 12 patients developing CR while receiving an escalating dose regimen of PEG with protocol liver biopsies every 6 months was conducted. Values are shown as median (range). Results. Twelve of the 70 patients treated with PEG developed CR. Median age at LT was 53 (37\u201363) years; immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus or cyclosporine with prednisone. PEG was started at 3.6 (0.2\u201313.5) years after LT. Two patients had one episode of ACR before PEG. Four patients had first ACR while receiving PEG. CR was diagnosed after 12 (4\u201317) months of PEG; by then 8 patients had undetectable HCV-RNA. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine levels (ng/mL) were 7.9 (3.2\u201318.9) and 76 (71\u201393) before PEG, and 6.9 (3.7\u20139.7) and 130 (81\u2013153) at CR. Six patients were treated more than 1 year with PEG; three had undetectable HCV-RNA when CR was diagnosed. Five patients are being treated for CR; one has been listed for LT; two patients were retransplanted. Five patients died as a result of sepsis partially related to CR. Conclusions.

However, HCV recurrence is universal and this immediately occurs following LT, which endangers both the graft and patient survival. We investigated the frequency of posttransplant recurrence of HCV infection and the patient-graft survival, and we analyzed the responses to ribavirin and interferon therapy in the patients with recurrent HCV infection after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 39 HCV-associated cirrhosis patients who underwent LDLT at Asan Medical Center between August 1992 and June 2006. In this study, the diagnosis of recurrent HCV was made on the basis of increased transaminases and serum HCV RNA levels greater than 10 million IU/mL because protocol liver biopsy was not performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHCV recurrence was seen in 26 of the 39 LDLT patients (66.7%). 86.7% of recurrence occurred within the first postoperative year. Antiviral treatment was used for all patients with recurrence of HCV. None of the 10 patients receiving ribavirin alone and 9 of 16 patients who received combination therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin became HCV RNA negative and they remained persistently negative during the median follow-up of 24.9 months. Our data indicates that there is no significant factor influencing HCV recurrence except for the recipient's age. The 2-year patient survival for the HCV patients with HCC and those patients without HCC were 81.2% and 81.3%, respectively (P=0.85) and the 2-year graft survival rates were 81.2% and 68.2%, respectively (P=0.29). No patient died from HCV recurrence during the follow-up period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination therapy with ribavirin and interferon appears to improve the outcome of recurrent HCV infected patients after LDLT.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper. The source paper investigates the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2a for hepatitis C after liver transplantation, and this paper builds upon those findings by analyzing the responses to ribavirin and interferon therapy in patients with recurrent HCV infection after living donor liver transplantation."
