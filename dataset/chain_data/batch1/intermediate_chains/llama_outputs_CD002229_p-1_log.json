Mean age was 66.7 years.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nEither 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92).

The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.",

            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nObservational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nEither 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.",

Participants 1006 healthy women aged 45-58 who were recently postmenopausal or had perimenopausal symptoms in combination with recorded postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone values. 502 women were randomly allocated to receive hormone replacement therapy and 504 to receive no treatment (control). Women who had undergone hysterectomy were included if they were aged 45-52 and had recorded values for postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone. Interventions In the treatment group, women with an intact uterus were treated with triphasic estradiol and norethisterone acetate and women who had undergone hysterectomy received 2 mg estradiol a day. Intervention was stopped after about 11 years owing to adverse reports from other trials, but participants were followed for death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer for up to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on women who took more than 80% of the prescribed treatment for five years. Main outcome measure The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to hospital for heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Results At inclusion the women on average were aged 50 and had been postmenopausal for seven months.

The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer.

Design Open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Denmark, 1990-93. Participants 1006 healthy women aged 45-58 who were recently postmenopausal or had perimenopausal symptoms in combination with recorded postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone values. 502 women were randomly allocated to receive hormone replacement therapy and 504 to receive no treatment (control). Women who had undergone hysterectomy were included if they were aged 45-52 and had recorded values for postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone. Interventions In the treatment group, women with an intact uterus were treated with triphasic estradiol and norethisterone acetate and women who had undergone hysterectomy received 2 mg estradiol a day. Intervention was stopped after about 11 years owing to adverse reports from other trials, but participants were followed for death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer for up to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on women who took more than 80% of the prescribed treatment for five years. Main outcome measure The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to hospital for heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Results At inclusion the women on average were aged 50 and had been postmenopausal for seven months. After 10 years of intervention, 16 women in the treatment group experienced the primary composite endpoint compared with 33 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.87; P=0.015) and 15 died compared with 26 (0.57, 0.30 to 1.08; P=0.084). The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer. Conclusions After 10 years of randomised treatment, women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke.

The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer. Conclusions After 10 years of randomised treatment, women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke.

            "abstract": "Objective To investigate the long term effect of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in recently postmenopausal women. Design Open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Denmark, 1990-93. Participants 1006 healthy women aged 45-58 who were recently postmenopausal or had perimenopausal symptoms in combination with recorded postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone values. 502 women were randomly allocated to receive hormone replacement therapy and 504 to receive no treatment (control). Women who had undergone hysterectomy were included if they were aged 45-52 and had recorded values for postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone. Interventions In the treatment group, women with an intact uterus were treated with triphasic estradiol and norethisterone acetate and women who had undergone hysterectomy received 2 mg estradiol a day. Intervention was stopped after about 11 years owing to adverse reports from other trials, but participants were followed for death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer for up to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on women who took more than 80% of the prescribed treatment for five years. Main outcome measure The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to hospital for heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Results At inclusion the women on average were aged 50 and had been postmenopausal for seven months. After 10 years of intervention, 16 women in the treatment group experienced the primary composite endpoint compared with 33 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.87; P=0.015) and 15 died compared with 26 (0.57, 0.30 to 1.08; P=0.084). The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer. Conclusions After 10 years of randomised treatment, women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke.

In rodent models and patients with NAFLD, hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPARG) coactivator 1\u03b1\u00a0(PPARGC1A or PGC1A) is inversely correlated with liver fat and disease severity. A common polymorphism in this gene (rs8192678, encoding Gly482Ser) has been associated with NAFLD. We investigated whether reduced expression of PGC1A contributes to development of NAFLD using mouse models, primary hepatocytes, and human cell lines.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHepG2 cells were transfected with variants of PPARGC1A and protein and messenger RNA levels were measured. Mice with liver-specific hemizygous or homozygous disruption of Ppargc1a (Ppargc1af/+Alb-cre+/0 and Ppargc1af/f Alb-cre+/0 mice, respectively) were fed regular chow (control) or a high-fat diet supplemented with 30% d-fructose in drinking water (obesogenic diet) for 25-33 weeks. Liver tissues were analyzed by histology and by immunoblotting. Primary hepatocytes were analyzed for insulin signaling, reactive oxygen species, and estrogen response. Luciferase reporter expression was measured in transfected H2.35 cells expressing an estrogen receptor reporter gene, estrogen receptor 1, and/or PGC1A/B.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe serine 482 variant of the human PGC1A protein had a shorter half-life than the glycine 482 variant when expressed in HepG2 cells. Liver tissues from mice with liver-specific hemizygous disruption of Ppargc1a placed on an obesogenic diet expressed increased markers of inflammation and fibrosis and decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes compared with the Ppargc1a+/+ on the same diet. Oxidative damage was observed in livers from Ppargc1af/+Alb-cre+/0 mice of each sex, in a cell-autonomous manner, but was greater in\u00a0livers from the female mice. Expression of PGC1A in H2.35 cells coactivated estrogen receptor 1 and was required for estrogen-dependent expression of genes that encode antioxidant proteins. These findings could account for the increased liver damage observed in female Ppargc1af/+Alb-cre+/0 mice; while, compensatory increases in PPARG coactivator 1\u03b2 could prevent oxidative damage associated with complete loss of PGC1A expression in Ppargc1af/fAlb-cre+/0 female mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn mice, loss of estrogen signaling contributes to oxidative damage caused by low levels of PGC1A in liver, exacerbating steatohepatitis associated with diets high in fructose and fat.",

It responds to insulin and glucagon to either store or provide glucose to other organs. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Associations have been made between low hepatic levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) and hepatic insulin resistance, but underlying mechanisms are elusive. We show that PGC1A controls the hepatic ratio of Insulin Receptor Substrates 1 (IRS1) and IRS2 expression, crucial for defining the precise insulin signal in hepatocytes to respond to fasting and feeding. Importantly, PGC1A is key for insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production.

Insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Associations have been made between low hepatic levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) and hepatic insulin resistance, but underlying mechanisms are elusive. We show that PGC1A controls the hepatic ratio of Insulin Receptor Substrates 1 (IRS1) and IRS2 expression, crucial for defining the precise insulin signal in hepatocytes to respond to fasting and feeding. Importantly, PGC1A is key for insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Precise modulation of hepatic glucose metabolism is crucial during the fasting and feeding cycle and is controlled by the actions of circulating insulin and glucagon. The insulin-signaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, which are found to be dysregulated in diabetes and obesity. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) is a fasting-induced transcriptional coactivator. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes, low hepatic PGC1A levels are associated with insulin resistance. However, how PGC1A activity impacts the hepatic insulin-signaling pathway is still unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function models in mouse primary hepatocytes and measured hepatocyte insulin response by gene and protein expression and ex vivo glucose production. We found that the PGC1A level determines the relative ratio of IRS1 and IRS2 in hepatocytes, impacting insulin receptor signaling via protein kinase B/AKT (AKT). PGC1A drove the expression of IRS2 downstream of glucagon signaling while simultaneously reducing IRS1 expression. We illustrate that glucagon- or PGC1A-induced IRS2 expression was dependent on cAMP Response Element Binding Protein activity and that this was essential for suppression of hepatocyte gluconeogenesis in response to insulin in vitro. We also show that increased hepatic PGC1A improves glucose homeostasis in vivo, revealing a counterregulatory role for PGC1A in repressing uncontrolled glucose production in response to insulin signaling. These data highlight a mechanism by which PGC1A plays dual roles in the control of gluconeogenesis during the fasting-to-fed transition through regulated balance between IRS1 and IRS2 expression.",

Objective To explore the mechanism of berberine to improve insulin sensitivity in fructose-fed mice. Materials and methods Sixty male ICR mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (10 mice in each group): control, fructose, pioglitazone (10\u2009mg/kg) and berberine (50, 100, and 200\u2009mg/kg). Except for the control group, the mice received 20% fructose drinking for 10\u2009weeks. Pioglitazone and berberine were orally administered once daily during the last 4\u2009weeks. The insulin sensitivity was evaluated using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The serum levels of fasting glucose and insulin, blood lipids, and hormones were determined. The hepatic AMP and ATP contents were detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, and the protein expression was examined by immunoblotting. Results Berberine significantly reversed the insulin resistance induced by fructose, including lowering fasting insulin levels (from 113.9 to 67.4) and area under the curve (AUC) during OGTT (from 1310 to 1073), decreasing serum leptin (from 0.28 to 0.13) and increasing serum adiponectin levels (from 1.50 to 2.80). Moreover, berberine enhanced the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT; 2.27-fold) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2; 2.56-fold), and increased hepatic glycogen content (from 0.19 to 1.65).

As an isoquinoline alkaloid, Berberine exerts neuroprotective effects in neurological disease models with activated AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling. Aim: We aim to study the effect of Berberine on ICH-induced brain injury and explore the potential molecular mechanism. Methods: ICH model was established in mice through intracerebral injection of autologous whole blood, followed by treatment with Berberine. Neurological impairments were assessed by the modified neurological severity score and behavioral assays. Brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity were assessed by water content in the brain, amount of extravasated Evans blue, and BBB tight junction components. Neuroinflammatory responses were assessed by inflammatory cytokine levels. AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling was examined by AMPK mRNA expression and phosphorylated AMPK and PGC1\u03b1 protein levels. Results: Berberine (200 mg/kg) attenuated ICH-induced neurological deficits, motor and cognitive impairment, and BBB disruption. Berberine also suppressed ICH-induced inflammatory responses indicated by reduced production of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, Berberine drastically elevated AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling in the hemisphere of ICH mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Berberine plays an important neuroprotective role against ICH-induced neurological impairments and BBB injury, probably by inhibition of inflammation and activation of AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling.",

            "abstract": "Background: Elevation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1) signaling can suppress intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced neurological impairments. As an isoquinoline alkaloid, Berberine exerts neuroprotective effects in neurological disease models with activated AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling. Aim: We aim to study the effect of Berberine on ICH-induced brain injury and explore the potential molecular mechanism. Methods: ICH model was established in mice through intracerebral injection of autologous whole blood, followed by treatment with Berberine. Neurological impairments were assessed by the modified neurological severity score and behavioral assays. Brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity were assessed by water content in the brain, amount of extravasated Evans blue, and BBB tight junction components. Neuroinflammatory responses were assessed by inflammatory cytokine levels. AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling was examined by AMPK mRNA expression and phosphorylated AMPK and PGC1\u03b1 protein levels. Results: Berberine (200 mg/kg) attenuated ICH-induced neurological deficits, motor and cognitive impairment, and BBB disruption. Berberine also suppressed ICH-induced inflammatory responses indicated by reduced production of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, Berberine drastically elevated AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling in the hemisphere of ICH mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Berberine plays an important neuroprotective role against ICH-induced neurological impairments and BBB injury, probably by inhibition of inflammation and activation of AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 signaling.",

            "abstract": "Background: Neuroinflammation is a frequent cause of brain damage after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Gut microbiota are reported to regulate neuroinflammation. Berberine has been found to have anti-inflammatory actions, including in the central nervous system. However, it is not known whether berberine regulates neuroinflammation after ICH, nor is the relationship between the antineuroinflammatory actions of berberine and the gut microbiota after ICH understood. Methods: ICH was induced in male mice by collagenase injection. Immunofluorescent staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to detect microglia/macrophage phenotypes. Immunofluorescent staining, ELISA, and FITC-dextran were conducted to determine gut function. 16S rRNA sequencing of the fecal material was conducted to determine alterations in the gut microbiota. Antibiotic cocktail treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were used to deplete or restore the gut microbiota, respectively. Cylinder, forelimb placement and wire hanging tests were conducted to evaluate neurobehavioral function. Results: Berberine significantly reduced neuroinflammation and alleviated neurological dysfunction by preventing microglial/macrophage proinflammatory polarization in ICH mice. Berberine also enhanced the function of the intestinal barrier, as shown by reductions in the levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. Neuroinflammation in ICH mice was markedly reduced after transplantation of microbiota from berberine-treated mice, similar to treatment with oral berberine. In addition, a reduction in the microbiota reversed the neuroprotective effect of berberine. Conclusions: Berberine is a potential treatment for ICH-induced neuroinflammation, and its effects are at least partially dependent on the gut microbiota.",
