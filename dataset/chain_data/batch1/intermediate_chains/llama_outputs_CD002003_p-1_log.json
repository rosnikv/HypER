            "abstract": "As described in the preceding communication, either propranolol hydrochloride or hydrochlorothiazide were randomly allocated in a double-blind manner to 683 patients with initial diastolic BP in the range of 95 to 114 mm Hg. Of this number, 394 entered the long-term treatment phase. During the subsequent 12 months of long-term treatment, hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than propranolol in controlling BP (mean reductions, -17.5/-13.1 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide compared with -8.3/-11.3 with propranolol. After treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, a greater percentage of patients achieved the goal diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg (65.5% compared with 52.8% taking propranolol). Also during treatment, fewer patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide required termination as compared with those receiving propranolol; comparative dosage requirements were lower; additional titration during long-term treatment was required less often, and BP remained lower after withdrawal of the active drugs. However, biochemical abnormalities were greater with hydrochlorothiazide. Although not statistically significant, the antihypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide were greater in blacks than in whites. Whites, on the other hand, had a greater response to propranolol than blacks, although it was still less than the response of the whites to hydrochlorothiazide.",

            "abstract": "Our recent Veterans Administration Cooperative Study--involving 683 hypertensive male patients--showed that a diuretic was more effective than a beta blocker in controlling hypertension in most respects. In addition, in this study we failed to find evidence that thiazide-induced hypokalemia was associated with increased evidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients without overt heart disease. We are concerned that the current desire to avoid hypokalemia at all costs may result in the prescription of ineffective dosages of diuretics for the treatment of hypertension.",

            "abstract": "New diuretics introduced into clinical medicine during the past decade include potent new loop diuretics such as bumetanide and piretanide, the uricosuric indanyloxyacetic acid derivative indacrinone, and a new generation of sulfamoyl diuretics such as indapamide and xipamide, which are recommended primarily for the treatment of hypertension. Pharmacokinetic studies of individual diuretics have demonstrated that the diuretic and natriuretic responses to the newer agents generally follow the plasma drug concentration-time curves and urinary drug excretion rates. Therapeutic monitoring can therefore be achieved in most patients with edema or hypertension by close clinical observation and laboratory analysis of plasma electrolyte and creatinine concentrations and urinary electrolyte excretion rates. Interest in the mechanisms involved in the renal and extrarenal vascular actions of the newer diuretics has led to a better understanding of how changes in venous compliance, peripheral vascular resistance, and renal blood flow distribution may contribute to the overall therapeutic response to these agents, especially in patients with severe congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency with low glomerular filtration rates, and hypertension with cardiorenal complications. Adverse reactions to modern diuretics, which are mainly an extension of their renal pharmacodynamic effects, have proved to be minimal, provided that the dosage is adjusted to meet but not exceed individual patient requirements. However, the long-term consequences of prolonged periods of diuretic-induced alterations in plasma potassium levels, and metabolic effects that include elevated blood lipids, are still under investigation.",

            "abstract": "The antihypertensive, diuretic, and toxicological effects of S\u20108666 were studied in rats. At doses of more than 60 mg/kg/day, p.o., S\u20108666 was antihypertensive in DOCA\u2010salt hypertensive rats with a potency corresponding to 1/20 of that of trichlormethiazide. The antihypertensive effect was dose\u2010dependent, and, at the higher doses, S\u20108666 had a more potent depressor effect than trichlormethiazide. The antihypertensive activity of S\u20108666 was shown predominantly by the S\u2010(\u2212)\u2010enantiomer, with the R\u2010(+)\u2010enantiomer being only slightly active. A similar dose\u2010dependent antihypertensive effect was shown by furosemide, tienilic acid, or indacrinone, but the therapeutic index (LD50/minimum effective dose) of S\u20108666 was the highest among them. The acute diuretic and natriuretic effects of S\u20108666 after oral administration of 60\u2013200 mg/kg to DOCA\u2010salt hypertensive rats correlated well with its antihypertensive effect, although such diuretic and natriuretic effects in normotensive rats had no effect on blood pressure. S\u20108666, like trichlormethiazide, showed a prophylactic effect on the development of hypertension in DOCA\u2010salt hypertensive rats, salt\u2010loaded spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and salt\u2010loaded Dahl\u2010S rats, though it was much less potent. Moreover, the combination of S\u20108666 with captopril in SHR enhanced the depressor effect of captopril like hydrochlorothiazide. These results indicate that S\u20108666 can be an effective nonthiazide diuretic for use as an antihypertensive agent.",
