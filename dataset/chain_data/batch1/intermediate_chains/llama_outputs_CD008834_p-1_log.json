Thrombi occurred in 86 per cent of patients on placebo and 50 per cent of those on sulfinpyrazone (p<0.01). The incidence of thrombosis was reduced from 0.76 thrombi per patient month in the placebo group to 0.18 thrombi per patient month in the sulfinpyrazone group (p<0.001). Venous-shunt revisions were required in 48 per cent of patients given placebo and in only 16 per cent of those receiving sulfinpyrazone (p<0.05). Side effects were minimal and necessitated withdrawal from the study in only one patient. This study supports the results of animal experiments showing that sulfinpyrazone decreases thrombus formation the high-flow systems. (N Engl J Med 290:304\u2013306, 1974)",

            "abstract": "A CLINICAL TRIAL on 2 drugs which inhibit platelet function has been concluded after 5'/2 years of cooperative effort. The results indicate that male patients threatened with stroke will benefit by the daily use of the commonest and one of the oldest pharmaceutical agents \u2014 aspirin. Females will not benefit and neither men nor women will benefit from the use of sulfinpyrazone. This claim may be said to demand the attention of all who are engaged in clinical practice, since vascular stroke has been identified as the likely cause of death of 1 of every 5 persons by 1980. An expected 225,000 people will die each year in the United States and Canada, and, of a slightly larger number who will survive, half will be disabled, continuing as a burden to themselves, their families and the community. To those who frequent the wards of neurological departments and institutions these chilling figures require no elaboration. They are the \"raison d'etre\" of this journal and the compelling argument behind the apportionment of a significant part of the annual budget of the U.S. National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) to the pursuit of stroke-oriented research. It is imperative and appropriate that many American and Canadian neurologists and neurosurgeons occupy much of their time with problems of stroke. Progress in stroke research has been slow but measurable over the past 3 decades. The adoption of angiography focussed attention on the importance of the extracranial arteries and led in turn to the realization that atheromatous lesions in these extracranial sites were associated with some of the phenomena of the \"transient ischemic attack.\" These transient events came to be recognized as the forerunners of thrombo-embolic stroke, with a prognosis for stroke approximating 5-6% per year, and a similarly high annual threat of vascular death. It became possible to identify, in advance, a significant proportion of patients who were going on to have a stroke and to initiate such imperfect measures of investigation and therapy as were known. Anticoagulants were tested in studies wherein the entry criteria were not screened with sufficient scrupulousness to satisfy modern critical methodology. Their final role in TIA and in patients afflicted with partial non-progressing stroke (PNS) remains unsettled. Extracranial vascular surgery was introduced. In some hands, but decidedly not in others, it has found a limited but definite place in stroke prevention. Concomitantly came an increased understanding of the important role of platelets in initiating arterial thrombosis. Whitish material passing through retinal arterioles in patients experiencing amaurosis fugax was observed and identified as aggregates of platelets with fibrin. The ulcerated plaque in the extracranial arteries was recognized as a potential source for these aggregates. In addition, embolic material containing cholesterol and other elements of atheromatous debris have been seen in retinal arterioles (\"bright plaques\") and it was determined that these fragments were conducive to extending platelet-induced thrombus formation. Thus, the 2 varieties of artery-to-artery retinal or cerebral emboli were known to have a significant dependency on platelet reaction. Beginning in Mustard's laboratory in 1965, and continuing with the work of Weiss and Aledont, of Zucker and Peterson, and of Emmons et al, it was discovered that platelet function could be altered in a significant way by sulfinpyrazone, acetylsalicylic acid and by pyrimido-pyrimidine compounds. Experimental evidence from a variety of sources, a few clinical trials on cardiovascular and systemic vascular disease, and a few clinical fragments, largely of anecdotal variety, in cerebral vascular disease made it appear that the time had come to submit the platelet-inhibiting drugs to a full-scale clinical study. It was apparent that a trial would require a population of patients sufficiently large to settle the question of the drugs' efficacy in altering the prognosis in patients with TIA and PNS, and it was calculated that a minimum of 540 patients should be entered into the program. This demanded a collaborative effort among many neurological centers. It was recognized that the trial would utilize drugs whose mode of action, for the most part, was unknown.

Since some observations have linked this condition to stroke, we studied its incidence in two groups of patients with cerebral ischemia. The older group contained 141 patients over 45 years of age (mean, 64.7 years) who had transient ischemia or partial stroke. Prolapse was found in eight (5.7 per cent) of these patients and in 10 (7.1 per cent) of 141 age-matched controls. The second group contained 60 patients who had transient ischemia or partial stroke and were under 45 years old (mean 33.9 years). Prolapse was detected in 24 patients (40 per cent) but in only five (6.8 per cent) of 60 age-matched controls (mean age, 33.7 years). The odds ratio, 9.33, was highly significant (P less than 0.001). In six of the 24 patients there were other potential causes for cerebral ischemia leaving 18 whom the only recognizable potential cause was a prolapsing mitral valve (odds ratio, 7.00; P less than 0.001). This study suggests that this entity has a role in cerebral ischemia, at least in younger patients. (N Engl J Med 302:139-144, 1980).",

Prolapse was found in eight (5.7 per cent) of these patients and in 10 (7.1 per cent) of 141 age-matched controls. The second group contained 60 patients who had transient ischemia or partial stroke and were under 45 years old (mean 33.9 years). Prolapse was detected in 24 patients (40 per cent) but in only five (6.8 per cent) of 60 age-matched controls (mean age, 33.7 years). The odds ratio, 9.33, was highly significant (P less than 0.001).

            "abstract": "The etiology of cerebrovascular disease (CDV) in young patients is difficult to establish if the common causes of a focal neurological deficit are excluded by appropriate investigations. Since in some observations prolapse of the mitral-valve (MVP), alterations of platelet function, or both have been linked with cerebral ischemic events, we studied the in vivo platelet release reaction and the incidence of MVP in 47 patients (12 males, 35 females) under 45 years of age with TIA or stroke of unknown cause and in an age- and sex-matched control group. The mean plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) level of the patients (mean = 54.9 +/\u2212 31.4 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that of the controls (mean = 20.6 /- 6.9 ng/ml, p less than 0.001). MVP was demonstrated in 13 of 47 patients in contrast to 4 of the controls (p less than 0.01). However, the beta-T levels of patients with MVP (n = 13, 52.9 +/\u2212 25.5 ng/ml) did not differ from those of patients without MVP (n = 34, 55.7 +/\u2212 33.7 ng/ml) significantly (p less than 0.4). Our results confirm that the incidence of MVP is higher in young patients with cerebral ischemia of unknown cause than in asymptomatic controls. The significantly elevated plasma beta-TG concentrations in the patient's group indicate an increased platelet activity in vivo. Since there was no significant difference between beta-TG levels of patients with and without MVP, the mitral-valve abnormality can not be the cause for the altered platelet activity.",

This problem was approached by studying the possible occurrence of platelet activation in vivo in headache-free periods of subjects affected by common or classic migraine and, subsequently, by verifying the possibility of its pharmacological control through administration of a classic anti-aggregation drug such as aspirin (ASA). The plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin \u03b2-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4), indices of the occurrence of platelet activation in vivo, were therefore first assayed in both groups of migraine sufferers in the absence of therapy and then during the administration of aspirin (50 mg/daily).In the group of IS patients affected by classic migraine, basal plasma levels of \u03b2TG and PF4 were significantly higher than control subjects. On the other hand, only \u03b2-TG plasma levels were significantly higher in the group of 18 patients affected by common migraine. Patients suffering from classic migraine showed a high incidence of platelet activation (>90%) in comparison with common migraine patients (-33%). This suggests that platelet activation occurs in vivo in migrainous patients also during headache- free periods. Administration of aspirin to the patients affected by common and classic migraine caused a decrease in plasma \u03b2-TG and PF4 concentration. Consequently, pharmacological treatment with aspirin in adequate dose may prove to be helpful in diminishing the vascular side-effects known to occur in migraine sufferers.

Platelets are important in the regulation of the free serotonin level in plasma and may be a model of serotonergic neurons. The aim of the present study was to investigate the peripheral serotonin (5HT) metabolism in patients with chronic tension-type headache. The 5HT levels in platelets and in plasma, the beta-thromboglobulin (\u00df-TG) levels in plasma, and the urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) were measured in 40 patients with chronic tension-type headache and in 40 healthy controls. The platelet uptake index was calculated as the ratio between platelet 5HT and plasma 5HT levels. There were, no significant differences in platelet 5HT, plasma 5HT \u00df-TG, or 5HIAA between patients and controls. The platelet uptake index was significantly lower in patients 243 (136-367) than in controls 352 (202-508), p=0.03. Our results indicate that the peripheral 5HT metabolism is largely normal in patients with chronic tension-type headache.",

The presynaptic 5\u2010HT uptake mechanism, which is important for the regulation of 5\u2010HT levels in the neuronal synapses, can be examined indirectly by measuring the number of 5\u2010HT transporters in membranes from platelets. The aim of the present study was to investigate the platelet 5\u2010HT transport system in patients with primary headache disorders. Bmax, an index of the number of platelet 5\u2010HT transporters, was measured in 40 patients with chronic tension\u2010type headache, in 30 patients with migraine without aura, and in 40 healthy controls using a binding analysis with tritiated paroxetine as the ligand. The Bmax was 664 (589\u2013846) (median (quartiles)) fmol/mg protein in patients with tension\u2010type headache and 662 (534\u2013781) fmol/mg protein in healthy controls, P= 0.40. The Bmax was 675 (558\u2013747) fmol/mg protein in patients with migraine, which was not significantly different from the Bmax in controls, P= 0.94. In conclusion, the present results indicate that the number of platelet 5\u2010HT transporters is normal in patients with chronic tension\u2010type headache and in patients with migraine without aura.",

            "abstract": "The aim of the present thesis was to investigate the pathophysiology of chronic tension-type headache with special reference to central mechanisms. Increased tenderness to palpation of pericranial myofascial tissues is the most apparent abnormality in patients with tension-type headache. A new piece of equipment, a so-called palpometer, that makes it possible to control the pressure intensity exerted during palpation, was developed. Thereafter, it was demonstrated that the measurement of tenderness could be compared between two observers if the palpation pressure was controlled, and that the Total Tenderness Scoring system was well suited for the scoring of tenderness during manual palpation. Subsequently, it was found that pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds were significantly decreased in the finger and tended to be decreased in the temporal region in chronic tension-type headache patients compared with controls. In addition, the electrical pain threshold in the cephalic region was significantly decreased in patients. It was concluded that the central pain sensitivity was increased in the patients probably due to sensitization of supraspinal neurones. The stimulus-response function for palpation pressure vs. pain was found to be qualitatively altered in chronic tension-type headache patients compared with controls. The abnormality was related to the degree of tenderness and not to the diagnosis of tension-type headache. In support of this, the stimulus-response function was found to be qualitatively altered also in patients with fibromyalgia. It was concluded that the qualitatively altered nociception was probably due to central sensitization at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus. Thereafter, the prophylactic effect of amitriptyline, a non-selective serotonin(5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, and of citalopram, a highly selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, was examined in patients with chronic tension-type headache. Amitriptyline reduced headache significantly more than placebo, while citalopram had only a slight and insignificant effect. It was concluded that the blockade of 5-HT reuptake could only partly explain the efficacy of amitriptyline in tension-type headache, and that also other actions of amitriptyline, e.g. reduction of central sensitization, were involved. Finally, the plasma 5-HT level, the platelet 5-HT level and the number of platelet 5-HT transporters were found to be normal in chronic tension-type headache. On the basis of the present and previous studies, a pathophysiological model for tension-type headache is presented. According to the model, the main problem in chronic tension-type headache is central sensitization at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus due to prolonged nociceptive inputs from pericranial myofascial tissues. The increased nociceptive input to supraspinal structures may in turn result in supraspinal sensitization. The central neuroplastic changes may affect the regulation of peripheral mechanisms and thereby lead to, for example, increased pericranial muscle activity or release of neurotransmitters in the myofascial tissues. By such mechanisms the central sensitization may be maintained even after the initial eliciting factors have been normalized, resulting in the conversion of episodic into chronic tension-type headache. Future basic and clinical research should aim at identifying the source of peripheral nociception in order to prevent the development of central sensitization and at ways of reducing established sensitization. This may lead to a much needed improvement in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache and other chronic myofascial pain conditions.",

Firm evidence for peripheral muscle pathology as a cause of muscle pain and chronic headache is still lacking. Using a microdialysis technique, we aimed to estimate in vivo blood flow and interstitial lactate concentrations in the trapezius muscle at rest and during static exercise in patients with chronic tension-type headache and in healthy subjects. We recruited 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 17 healthy control subjects. Two microdialysis catheters were inserted into the trapezius muscle (on the non-dominant side) of subjects, and dialysates were collected at rest, 15 and 30 min after the start of static exercise (10% of maximal force) and 15 and 30 min after the exercise was completed. All samples were coded and analysed blind. The primary endpoints were to detect a difference between patients and controls in changes of muscle blood flow and the interstitial lactate concentration from baseline to exercise and post-exercise periods. The increase in muscle blood flow from baseline to exercise and post-exercise periods was significantly lower in patients than controls (P = 0.03). There was no difference in resting blood flow between patients and controls (P = 0.43). Resting interstitial concentration of lactate did not differ between patients (2.51 +/- 0.18 mM; mean +/- standard error of the mean) and controls (2.35 +/- 0.23 mM, P = 0.57).

            "abstract": "Increased muscle tenderness is the most prominent finding in patients with tension-type headache, and it has recently been shown that muscle blood flow is diminished in response to static exercise in tender points in these patients. Although tenderness has been ascribed to local inflammation and release of inflammatory mediators, the interstitial concentration of inflammatory mediators has not previously been studied in tender muscles of patients with tension-type headache. The aim of the present study was to investigate in vivo concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), glutamate, bradykinin and other metabolites in a tender point of patients with chronic tension-type headache, in the resting state as well as in response to static exercise, and to compare findings with measurements in a matched non-tender point of healthy controls. We recruited 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 17 healthy control subjects. Two microdialysis catheters were inserted into the trapezius muscle and dialysates were collected at rest, 15 and 30 min after start of static exercise (10% of maximal force) and 15 and 30 min after end of exercise. All samples were coded and analysed blindly. There was no difference in resting concentration of any inflammatory mediators or metabolites between tender patients and non-tender controls (P > 0.05). We also found no difference in change in interstitial concentration of ATP, PGE2, glutamate, glucose, pyruvate and urea from baseline to exercise and post-exercise periods between patients and controls (P > 0.05). The present study provides in vivo evidence of normal interstitial levels of inflammatory mediators and metabolites in tender trapezius muscle in patients with chronic tension-type headache during both rest and static exercise. Thus, our data suggest that tender points in these patients are not sites of ongoing inflammation.",

            "abstract": "Treatment for chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is unsatisfactory. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine in the prophylactic treatment of CTTH. We included 40 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Memantine 20\u201340 mg/day or placebo was each given for 10 weeks separated by a 2-week wash-out period; 29 patients completed the study. The primary efficacy variable, area-under-the-headache curve (duration X intensity), did not differ between memantine (1352 \u00b1 927) and placebo (1449 \u00b1 976; P = 0.10). Headache intensity in both sexes was significantly lower on a 0\u201310 verbal rating scale with memantine (3.8) than with placebo (4.1; P = 0.03). In women, area-under-the-headache curve was significantly lower with memantine (1343 \u00b1 919) than with placebo (1555 \u00b1 1019; P = 0.01). The most common side-effects were dizziness and nausea. In conclusion, although no statistically significant effect was seen in the primary end-point, some beneficial effects of memantine were observed in women. Memantine was shown to reduce pain intensity in CTTH patients, albeit to a limited extent. Future NMDA antagonists with higher efficacy could be of major interest as regards the pathophysiology and future treatment of CTTH and other chronic pain disorders.",

            "abstract": "Treatment for chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is unsatisfactory. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine in the prophylactic treatment of CTTH. We included 40 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Memantine 20\u201340 mg/day or placebo was each given for 10 weeks separated by a 2-week wash-out period; 29 patients completed the study. The primary efficacy variable, area-under-the-headache curve (duration X intensity), did not differ between memantine (1352 \u00b1 927) and placebo (1449 \u00b1 976; P = 0.10). Headache intensity in both sexes was significantly lower on a 0\u201310 verbal rating scale with memantine (3.8) than with placebo (4.1; P = 0.03). In women, area-under-the-headache curve was significantly lower with memantine (1343 \u00b1 919) than with placebo (1555 \u00b1 1019; P = 0.01). The most common side-effects were dizziness and nausea. In conclusion, although no statistically significant effect was seen in the primary end-point, some beneficial effects of memantine were observed in women. Memantine was shown to reduce pain intensity in CTTH patients, albeit to a limited extent. Future NMDA antagonists with higher efficacy could be of major interest as regards the pathophysiology and future treatment of CTTH and other chronic pain disorders.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Primary headache disorders are common, but many patients are refractory to medical treatment. Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) therapy involves the stimulation of one or more individual nerves or dermatomes using needle probes. We assessed whether a \u2018single shot with single probe\u2019 strategy would benefit patients with refractory headache disorders, including chronic migraine (CM), and chronic cluster headache (CCH). Materials and methods: Service evaluation of 36 patients treated with PENS therapy between September 2012 and June 2016. Follow-up data were available for 33 patients, of whom 16 had CM, nine had CCH, and six had secondary headache disorders. PENS was given using Algotec\u00ae disposable 21 gauge PENS therapy probes (8\u2009cm) to the occipital nerve ipsilateral to the pain (or bilaterally in cases of bilateral pain). Stimulation was delivered at 2\u2009Hz/100\u2009Hz, at 3 cycles/s, between 1.2 and 2.5 V depending on patient tolerability, for 25\u201328\u2009min. Results: Six of nine patients with CCH improved significantly after the first session. In all patients with CCH, PENS therapy was well tolerated, with no significant adverse events reported. One patient with CCH reverted to episodic cluster. Only four patients with CM experienced any benefit. Conclusion: PENS therapy shows potential as a relatively non-invasive, low-risk, and inexpensive component of the treatment options for refractory primary headache disorders, particularly CCH.",

Recognizing new treatments provides opportunities to advance current management.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nIn contrast to the classic treatments, new options narrow in on the therapeutic target and are better tolerated. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway blockade with monoclonal antibodies (MABs), specifically the CGRP MAB galcanezumab, represents an important advance for episodic cluster headache, reducing the number of attacks during a bout. Neuromodulation strategies aimed at anatomical structures involved in the pathophysiology of cluster headache, such as the sphenopalatine ganglion and the vagus nerve, have proved effective in reducing the pain intensity and the number of attacks, and also to be safe and well tolerated.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nOur understanding of the pathophysiology of cluster headache and its management continues to grow. Novel treatments have appeared from research, such as neuromodulation and CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Nonetheless, chronic cluster headache and designing trials that select the correct sham in evaluating devices remain challenging.",
