A concomitant double-blind investigation of the effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam was performed. The results measured by visual analog scale and Roland's functional tests showed a satisfactory improvement throughout the 4 weeks of observation. The piroxicam-treated group had same results as the control group. Based on questionnaires at months 3 and 12 approximately 30% of the patients still complained about back trouble and 19.5% were out of work after 1 year. Four patients underwent surgery during this period.",

Selection criteria included patients with predominance of low-back pain, diffuse posterior disk bulges and concomitant spinal stenosis who are not normally accepted for nucleotomy. In all, 142 patients were treated. The overall success rate after an average observation time of 21 months was 56%. The results were not influenced by whether a diffuse posterior bulge or a focal hernia had been treated or not (p=0.449). Spinal stenosis (p=0.043) and disk space narrowing exceeding 25% of the expected width (p=0.017) were associated with a poor outcome. By excluding these categories and patients with symptoms from more than one disk level, the success rate rose to 70%. With this selection, the results were equally good in patients with predominantly low-back pain compared to those with predominantly sciatica (p=0.490).",
