        "title": "Postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease: pathophysiology and prevention.",
        "abstract": "Postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease is often inevitable. Certain risk factors such as smoking, young age, and a perforating disease behavior have been identified. Patients running an enhanced risk should be treated with mesalamine or, with higher success rates, with azathioprine. An endoscopic evaluation of the neoterminal ileum 6 to 12 months after surgery provides relevant information predicting the further clinical course and can be used as a guide to adjust medical therapy.",

        "explanation": "This paper mentions mesalamine as a treatment option for preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease, which suggests a connection to the source paper. The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it uses mesalamine's effectiveness in maintaining remission as a sub-hypothesis."
