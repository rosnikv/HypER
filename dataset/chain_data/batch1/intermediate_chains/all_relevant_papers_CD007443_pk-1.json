        "abstract": "Current interest in probiotics is motivated not only by the clinical data showing efficacy of some probiotic bacteria but also by the increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria (particularly in hospitals) and the rise of consumers\u2019 demand for natural substitutes of drugs. Only few randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled human trials are available, and some involved only small numbers of patients. They are difficult to compare because of differences in probiotic strains employed, doses and formulation. Among probiotic applications, reduction of diarrhea is probably the best-documented effect confirmed by recent meta-analyses. Literature on Helicobacter pylori indicates that probiotics are unable to eradicate the infection but could be useful in decreasing infection levels and as adjuvants of therapy-associated side effects. Studies performed in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that high doses of probiotics and most likely a combination of different lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are more effective in decreasing inflammatory score and maintaining patients in remission than a single probiotic strain. Probiotic studies evaluating amelioration of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome would require more sustained patient numbers. However, accumulated data is encouraging and suggests that efficacy is strain-dependent. Finally, too few probiotic intervention trials have been reported on colon cancer to allow any firm conclusion.",

        "abstract": "Little doubt remains that in addition to genetic and environmental factors, bacteria play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD suffer from dysbiosis \u2013 a term used to describe the abnormalities in intestinal bacterial content and host-bacterial interaction that characterize the disease. What remains controversial is how our knowledge of this dysbiotic state can best be put to therapeutic use. Three strategies currently exist: antibiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics. \n \nAntibiotics have long been used to treat IBD with limited success, and with the knowledge that they currently represent a \u201cblind attack\u201d on intestinal bacteria because there is no clear idea of which organisms are being targeted. Probiotics and synbiotics are clinically administered bacteria, with or without a coadministered nutrient to facilitate bacterial growth. The rationale for the use of these agents derives from the fact that different bacterial species have variable effects on intestinal inflammation in IBD and that some bacteria seem to have relatively beneficial effects. Researchers have examined the use of these agents in several clinical settings; however, the quality of evidence differs between these settings as does the apparent clinical effect. The clinical settings of interest can be stratified as follows: pouchitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.",

Bacteria are involved, and probiotics may modulate immune responses to the intestinal flora. Here we tested the probiotic strain Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 in this setting. Patients and methods: This was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients were eligible if they had undergone surgical resection of <1 m, removing all macroscopic lesions within the past 21 days. Patients were randomised to receive two packets per day of lyophilised LA1 (2\u00d7109 cfu) or placebo for six months; no other treatment was allowed. The primary endpoint was endoscopic recurrence at six months, with grade >1 in Rutgeerts\u2019 classification or an adapted classification for colonic lesions. Endoscopic score was the maximal grade of ileal and colonic lesions. Analyses were performed primarily on an intent to treat basis. Results: Ninety eight patients were enrolled (48 in the LA1 group). At six months, endoscopic recurrence was observed in 30/47 patients (64%) in the placebo group and in 21/43 (49%) in the LA1 group (p\u200a=\u200a0.15). Per protocol analysis confirmed this result. Endoscopic score distribution did not differ significantly between the LA1 and placebo groups. There were four clinical recurrences in the LA1 group and three in the placebo group.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 has been proven to be efficacious for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, the underlying mechanisms of action still remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of E. coli Nissle 1917 on cell cycling and apoptosis of peripheral blood and lamina propria T cells (PBT and LPT, respectively). Anti-CD3-stimulated PBT and LPT were treated with E. coli Nissle 1917-conditioned medium (E. coli Nissle 1917-CM) or heat-inactivated E. coli Nissle 1917. Cyclin B1, DNA content, and caspase 3 expression were measured by flow cytometry to assess cell cycle kinetics and apoptosis. Protein levels of several cell cycle and apoptosis modulators were determined by immunoblotting, and cytokine profiles were determined by cytometric bead array. E. coli Nissle 1917-CM inhibits cell cycling and expansion of peripheral blood but not mucosal T cells. Bacterial lipoproteins mimicked the effect of E. coli Nissle 1917-CM; in contrast, heat-inactivated E. coli Nissle 1917, lipopolysaccharide, or CpG DNA did not alter PBT cell cycling. E. coli Nissle 1917-CM decreased cyclin D2, B1, and retinoblastoma protein expression, contributing to the reduction of T-cell proliferation. E. coli Nissle 1917 significantly inhibited the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and gamma interferon but increased IL-10 production in PBT. Using Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) knockout mice, we further demonstrate that the inhibition of PBT proliferation by E. coli Nissle 1917-CM is TLR-2 dependent. The differential reaction of circulating and tissue-bound T cells towards E. coli Nissle 1917 may explain the beneficial effect of E. coli Nissle 1917 in intestinal inflammation. E. coli Nissle 1917 may downregulate the expansion of newly recruited T cells into the mucosa and limit intestinal inflammation, while already activated tissue-bound T cells may eliminate deleterious antigens in order to maintain immunological homeostasis.",

Resident bacteria deliver regulatory signals to the epithelium and instruct mucosal immune responses. Recent research has revealed a potential therapeutic role for the manipulation of the microbiota and exploitation of host-microbial signalling pathways in the maintenance of human health and treatment of various mucosal disorders. A variety of pharmabiotic strategies, such as the use of specific members of the microbiota, their surface components, or metabolites, as well as genetically modified commensal bacteria, are being investigated for their ability to enhance the beneficial components of the microbiota. It is clear that engagement with host cells is central to pharmabiotic action, and several strain-specific mechanisms of action have been elucidated. However, the molecular details underpinning these mechanisms remain almost entirely unknown. Understanding how pharmabiotics exert their beneficial effects is critical for the establishment of definitive selection criteria for certain pharmabiotic strategies for specific clinical conditions. Scientifically accredited evidence of efficacy and studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of host-microbiota interactions are needed to lend credence to the use of pharmabiotic strategies in clinical medicine.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in inflammatory bowel disease. However, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. In this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three lactobacilli (LAB) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced acute colitis. We first compared the in vitro ability of LAB to survive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions and their ability to persist in the GIT of mice following daily oral administration. As a control, we included a nonprobiotic Lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an endocarditis patient. Feeding high doses of LAB strains to healthy and to TNBS-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation of the bacteria. Oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 had a significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM did not. None of the three selected LAB strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of TNBS-treated mice. In contrast, L. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and translocated to extraintestinal organs. This study showed that evaluations of the safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. We conclude that not all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that selected probiotics such as L. salivarius Ls-33 may be considered in the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous studies of the endogenous microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have not taken bacterial activity into account, yet bacteria with high transcriptional activity might have a more important pathophysiological role than inactive bacteria. We therefore analyzed the biodiversity of active bacteria in the fecal microbiota of UC patients, in comparison with that of healthy subjects. Feces were collected from nine patients with active UC and from nine healthy controls. Total DNA and RNA were extracted, and 16S ribosomal DNA and RNA were amplified by PCR and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. Amplification products were compared by means of temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Bands of interest were excised, sequenced, and identified by comparison with the GenBank database (NCBI). The dominant-species diversity based on RNA-derived TTGE profiles was significantly lower for UC patients than for healthy controls (P = 0.01). The mean similarity index between the \u201cpresent\u201d and \u201cactive\u201d microbiota was 74% \u00b1 18% for UC patients. Comparison of the individual \u201cactive\u201d microbiota identified a band that was present for eight UC patients and only two controls (89% versus 22%; P = 0.008). The band was sequenced for 6 patients and always corresponded to Escherichia coli. The biodiversity of active bacteria in the dominant fecal microbiota of patients with UC is lower than that of healthy subjects. E. coli is more represented in the active microbiota of UC patients.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle strain 1917 in experimental colitis induced in TLR-2 and TLR-4 knockout mice. Colitis was induced in wild-type (wt), TLR-2 knockout, and TLR-4 knockout mice via administration of 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Mice were treated with either 0.9% NaCl or 107E. coli Nissle 1917 twice daily, followed by the determination of disease activity, mucosal damage, and cytokine secretion. wt and TLR-2 knockout mice exposed to DSS developed acute colitis, whereas TLR-4 knockout mice developed significantly less inflammation. In wt mice, but not TLR-2 or TLR-4 knockout mice, E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorated colitis and decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In TLR-2 knockout mice a selective reduction of gamma interferon secretion was observed after E. coli Nissle 1917 treatment. In TLR-4 knockout mice, cytokine secretion was almost undetectable and not modulated by E. coli Nissle 1917, indicating that TLR-4 knockout mice do not develop colitis similar to the wt mice. Coculture of E. coli Nissle 1917 and human T cells increased TLR-2 and TLR-4 protein expression in T cells and increased NF-\u03baB activity via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorates experimental induced colitis in mice via TLR-2- and TLR-4-dependent pathways.",

The unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of clinical inflammatory bowel disease.

        "abstract": "The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) follows an acute, presumably infectious diarrheal illness in \u223c15% of patients. There may be a persistent, mild inflammatory state with changes in mucosal function or structure. Changes in the colonic bacterial flora reported in IBS seem related to predominant bowel. Colonic bacteria normally metabolize nutrients with the formation of gas and short chain fatty acids. The latter may induce propulsive contractions and accelerate colonic transit or they may enhance fluid and sodium absorption in the colon. This review addresses the mechanisms, rationale and current evidence for the efficacy of probiotics, including Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and VSL\u266f3, in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms influenced by probiotics include immune function, motility, and the intraluminal milieu. Probiotics may suppress the low-grade inflammation associated with IBS or restore normal local immune function. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria subspecies are able to deconjugate and absorb bile acids, potentially reducing the colonic mucosal secretion of mucin and fluids that may contribute to functional diarrhea or IBS with diarrhea. Therapeutic trials show the potential benefit of Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli species alone or in the specific probiotic combination, VSL\u266f3, on symptoms in IBS. Colonic transit was retarded in IBS patients treated with VSL\u266f3 without induction of significant changes in bowel function. In summary, probiotics are promising therapies in IBS.",
