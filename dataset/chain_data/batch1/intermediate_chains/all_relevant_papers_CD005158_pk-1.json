Over the last years, several studies have evaluated old and new oral or intravenous antiplatelet agents in ACS patients. In particular, research was focused on assessing superiority of two novel platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 receptor antagonists (i.e. prasugrel and ticagrelor) over clopidogrel. Several large randomized controlled trials have been undertaken in this setting and a wide variety of pre-specified and post hoc analyses are available that evaluated the potential benefits of novel antiplatelet therapies in different subsets of patients with ACS. The aim of this document is to review recent data on the use of current antiplatelet agents for in-hospital treatment of ACS patients. For each drug or class of drugs, strong evidence and/or areas of uncertainty that warrant further research are highlighted by examining 10 subgroups of patients with ACS.",

Although coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, advancements in medical therapy, particularly antithrombotic agents, have improved patient outcomes.1\u20134 Although the trend for MI and death after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) over the past 20 years has declined,5,6 such medical advancements are still met with discouraging rates of death and MI after revascularization.7 To this end, it is the recommendation of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association that all ACS patients, regardless of whether percutaneous coronary intervention was performed, be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1 year ( Class IA ).8 Such recommendations are based largely on results from the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial, which assessed aspirin versus DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for the reduction of ischemic end points in patients presenting with non\u2013ST-segment\u2013elevation ACS who did not receive percutaneous coronary intervention.9\n\nSeeing a need for further risk reduction in long-term management of patients with established atherothrombotic risk, the Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events (TRA 2P)\u2013Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 50 was conducted.

        "abstract": "Summary The aim was to investigate the perioperative risk of ischaemic and bleeding events in patients with coronary stents undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery and how these outcomes are affected by the perioperative use of oral antiplatelet therapy. This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study conducted in patients with coronary stent(s) undergoing cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. The primary safety endpoint was the 30-day incidence of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding \u2265 2. A total of 666 patients were included. Of these, 371 (55.7 %) discontinued their antiplatelet medication(s) (all or partly) before undergoing surgery. At 30 days, patients with perioperative discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy experienced a significantly higher incidence of MACE (7.5 % vs 0.3 %, p < 0.001), cardiac death (2.7 % vs 0.3 %, p=0.027), and MI (4.0 % vs 0 %, p < 0.001). After adjustment, peri-operative antiplatelet discontinuation was the strongest independent predictor of 30-day MACE (odds ratio [OR]=25.8, confidence interval [CI]=3.37\u2013198, p=0.002). Perioperative aspirin (adjusted OR 0.27, 95 % CI 0.11\u20130.71, p=0.008) was significantly associated with a lower risk of MACE. The overall incidence of BARC \u2265 2 bleeding events at 30-days was significantly higher in patients who discontinued oral antiplatelet therapy (25.6 % vs 13.9 %, p < 0.001). However, after adjustment, antiplatelet discontinuation was not independently associated with BARC \u2265 2 bleeding. In conclusion antiplatelet discontinuation increases the 30-day risk of MACE, in patients with coronary stents undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery, while not offering significant protection from BARC\u2265 2 bleeding.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To describe VerifyNow-P2Y12 (VN-P2Y12, Accumetrics, San Diego, CA) results from patients treated with either clopidogrel or prasugrel who were seeking care in a hospital setting. Background: VN-P2Y12 is a point-of-care device that measures platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate. Past assessments of thienopyridine therapy utilizing VN-P2Y12 have largely come from clinical trial settings. There are limited data from real-world settings. Methods: Electronic medical record data from Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, AL) for those who underwent VN-P2Y12 testing for clopidogrel or prasugrel between January 1, 2009 and October 31, 2010 were analyzed. The VN-P2Y12 data included P2Y12 reaction units (PRUs) and device-reported percentage of inhibition. Descriptive analyses were conducted with t tests, and a logistic regression model was estimated to assess the association between patient characteristics and the likelihood of platelet nonresponse. Results: In total, 2882 tests (2476 with clopidogrel and 406 with prasugrel) were analyzed. For clopidogrel and prasugrel, respectively, mean PRU standard deviation (SD) was 206 (90) and 107 (93; P < 0.0001) and mean % inhibition (SD) was 31% (26%) and 63% (31%; P < 0.0001). Treatment with clopidogrel alone (odds ratio [OR] = 5.25; P < 0.0001), being non-Caucasian (OR = 1.48; P = 0.0440), obese (OR = 1.49; P = 0.0010), anemic (OR = 3.29; P < 0.0001), diabetic (OR = 1.75; P < 0.0001), and having a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.57; P < 0.0001) were significant predictors of having PRU \u2265 235. Conclusion: This real-world data analysis shows results that are consistent with clinical trial results, namely that compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel is associated with significantly lower PRU and greater percentage of inhibition, regardless of age, race, gender, diabetes, obesity, or proton pump inhibitor use.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin has previously been the standard of care for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but international guidelines have been evolving over the last 4 years with the introduction of prasugrel and ticagrelor. In October 2009, prasugrel was approved in the UK by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), diabetic patients with non-ST-elevation (NSTE) ACS undergoing PCI and patients with stent thrombosis while other ACS patients were to continue receiving clopidogrel. Ticagrelor was approved in October 2011 by NICE for use in patients with moderate-to-high risk NSTE ACS and STEMI undergoing primary PCI and was recommended in preference to clopidogrel in European guidelines. These recommendations were adopted in our region, constituting a population of 1.8 million. We studied the effect of changing patterns of P2Y12 inhibitor usage on levels of platelet inhibition during maintenance therapy. Patients admitted to Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, with NSTE ACS or STEMI managed with primary PCI were enrolled over two periods of time: May 2010 to November 2011 (T1); and October 2012 to February 2013 (T2). Venous blood samples were obtained at 1 month after the onset of ACS. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) was performed and maximum aggregation response to ADP 20\u2009\u03bcM was determined. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in T1 of whom 82 were receiving clopidogrel and 34 were receiving prasugrel. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in T2, all of whom were receiving ticagrelor. Mean LTA results according to treatment with clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor were 57\u2009\u00b1\u200918%, 41\u2009\u00b1\u200920%, and 31\u2009\u00b1\u200912%, respectively. Prasugrel was associated with significantly lower platelet aggregation responses than clopidogrel (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and ticagrelor was associated with significantly lower platelet aggregation responses than both prasugrel (p\u2009=\u20090.015) and clopidogrel (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We conclude that international guidelines and NICE approval have led to increasing levels of P2Y12 inhibition in ACS patients in this UK centre between May 2010 and February 2013. Ticagrelor was associated with significantly greater P2Y12 inhibition than both clopidogrel and prasugrel during maintenance therapy.",

Switching these patients to prasugrel may be desirable because higher platelet inhibition is expected.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized trial, 75 patients were categorized into 2 treatment strategies: Those who received a clopidogrel 600-mg LD and received a reloading dose of prasugrel 60\u2009mg (clopidogrel/prasugrel group) and those who did not receive a clopidogrel LD and received a prasugrel 60-mg LD (prasugrel group).

No significant differences in PRU and PRI were observed at discharge. Few bleeding events were reported without any significant differences between the 2 groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPlatelet reactivity with prasugrel 60\u2009mg added to a clopidogrel 600-mg LD was not significantly different compared with prasugrel 60\u2009mg alone in ACS patients undergoing PCI.",

        "abstract": "Optimization of platelet inhibition in patients with acute coronary syndromes reduces the risk for ischemic events, but at the same time increases the risk for bleeding. There are several predictors of bleeding risk in patients with acute coronary syndromes. These include demographic variables such as advanced age, female gender, low body weight, concomitant diseases such as diabetes,renal insufficiency, noncardiac vascular disease such as cerebral vascular disease and a history of bleeding. It also includes the type of acute coronary syndromes such as patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, high killip class and low blood pressure. The diabetic population contains a higher proportion of patients who do not respond to antiplatelet drugs as expected and who also have more activated platelets that deserve very vigorous inhibition. The importance of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing balloon angioplasty and stenting is much discussed. Yet there are some questions which are to be answered clearly such as the following:- 1) In the need to balance the benefit of clot prevention with bleeding risk, is it better to continue dual antiplatelet therapy for longer than one year? 2) If so, is this benefit specific to drug eluting stents or to a more general population of stent patients? 3) Is the benefit mediated by prevention of stent thrombosis or is there a global reduction in cardiovascular risk? This review is to understand all these aspects and help a physician use antiplatelet drugs appropriately in day to day clinical practice for better patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses a spectrum of diseases, ranging from ST-elevation myocardial infarction to non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina. A key initiating event in the pathology of ACS is atheromatous plaque disruption, in which the exposure of thrombogenic material triggers simultaneous activation of primary and secondary hemostatic pathways. Targeting platelet-mediated thrombus formation with dual antiplatelet therapy comprising acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y12 antagonist is the current mainstay for management of ACS. However, a significant proportion of patients remain at risk of cardiovascular events. Fibrin is an important contributor to thrombogenesis and may account for the residual event rates. This review examines evidence for the role of the coagulation cascade in thrombus formation in ACS, which provides a rationale for the use of anticoagulation therapy. The current status of research with novel oral anticoagulants in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention of ACS is also discussed.",

We aimed to evaluate the effect of DAPT duration with clopidogrel and aspirin on the recurrence of ischaemic events and bleeding in a large, unselected ACS population.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe performed a prospective, observational cohort study of patients in Sweden (n = 56 440) admitted for ACS, with prescribed DAPT and hospitalized between January 2006 and July 2010. Patients were obtained from the SWEDEHEART register and data were merged with registers from the National Board of Health and Welfare. Depending on dispensed clopidogrel tablets, patients were divided into groups based on DAPT duration with clopidogrel and aspirin (3 months: 84-100 clopidogrel tablets (t); >3 months: >100 t; 6 months: 168-200 t; >6 months: >200 t). For the combined primary endpoint, defined as all-cause death, stroke, or re-infarction, only patients with an uneventful first 3-month period (no death, stroke, re-infarction, bleeding, stent thrombosis, or revascularization) were included. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 45 events per 1000 person-years in the >3 months DAPT group compared with 65 events per 1000 person-years in the 3 months DAPT group [adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI (0.75; 0.95)].

        "abstract": "Despite widespread adoption of acetylsalicylic acid and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy as the standard of care for secondary event prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the rate of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction following discharge is approximately 24-31% over five years, indicating an important unmet need to reduce further the risk of recurrent ACS events. Because thrombin has a role in arterial thrombus generation, a mechanistic rationale exists for adding an anticoagulant to dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce cardiovascular event rates and mortality. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have been investigated for this application, with only rivaroxaban successfully completing a phase III trial. These results suggest that dose selection is of paramount importance in this indication, with lower anticoagulant doses (relative to those used in other indications, such as stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation) plus low-dose acetylsalicylic acid potentially improving cardiovascular outcomes. This article reviews clinical trial data of anticoagulants for secondary event prevention in patients with ACS; it also discusses the mechanistic reasons that may underlie these observations and looks towards the potential impact of findings from the ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 trial on clinical practice.",
