            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care model on the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in urban African-American patients. DESIGN: Eligible patients were randomized to either a pharmacist intervention or control group and followed over a 4-month period. Patients in the intervention group received diabetes education, medication counseling, instructions on dietary regulation, exercise, and home blood glucose monitoring, and evaluation and adjustment of their hypoglycemic regimen. Patients in the control group continued to receive standard medical care provided by their physicians. SETTING: A university-affiliated internal medicine outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: The study population consisted of urban African-American patients with NIDDM currently attending the clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations. Secondary outcome endpoints included blood pressure, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, microalbumin to creatinine ratio, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein concentrations. Quality-of-life assessments were performed in both groups at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (17 intervention, 22 control) completed the study. The intervention group consisted of 12 women and 5 men with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 59 \u00b1 12 years, total body weight (TBW) of 93 \u00b1 22 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 34 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, and duration of NIDDM 6.8 \u00b1 6.5 years. The control group consisted of 15 women and 7 men with a mean age of 65 \u00b1 12 years, TBW of 88 \u00b1 19 kg, BMI of 33 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, and a duration of NIDDM of 6.2 \u00b1 4.8 y. Significant improvement in glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.015) was achieved in the intervention group. No change in glycemia was observed in the control subjects. Statistically significant differences in the final glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.022) concentrations were noted between groups. No significant changes in blood pressure control, lipid profile, renal function parameters, weight, or quality-of-life measures were noted within or between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care in the reduction of hyperglycemia associated with NIDDM in a group of urban African-American patients.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of clinical pharmacists involved in direct patient care on the glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Eligible patients included those with type 2 diabetes who received insulin or were initiated on insulin therapy by the pharmacists and were willing to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose. The pharmacists provided diabetes education, medication counseling, monitoring, and insulin initiation and/or adjustments. All initial patient interactions with the pharmacists were face-to-face. Thereafter, patient\u2013pharmacist interactions were either face-to-face or telephone contacts. SETTING: Two primary care clinics in a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes who were referred to the pharmacists by their primary care providers for better glycemic control. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome variables were changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, and random blood glucose measurements. Secondary outcomes were the number and severity of symptomatic episodes of hypoglycemia, and the number of emergency room visits or hospitalizations related to diabetes. Twenty-three veterans aged 65 \u00b1 9.4 years completed the study. Fifteen (65%) patients were initiated on insulin by the pharmacists; 8 (35%) were already using insulin. Patients were followed for a mean \u00b1 SD of 27 \u00b1 10 weeks. Glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose concentrations, and random blood glucose concentrations significantly decreased from baseline by 2.2% (p = 0.00004), 65 mg/dL (p < 0.01), and 82 mg/dL (p = 0.00001), respectively. Symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes occurred in 35% of patients. None of these episodes required physician intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pharmacists working as members of interdisciplinary primary care teams can positively impact glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin.",

However, few data are available to support pharmacists optimizing therapy and improving outcomes in these patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a clinical pharmacist\u2014directed diabetes management clinic on glycemic control and cardiovascular and renal parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS A nonrandomized, prospective study was conducted in 70 Veterans Affairs patients. Patients met with the pharmacist every 6\u20138 weeks for approximately 30 minutes for education, medication counseling, monitoring, and management. The primary endpoint was the impact of 9\u201312 months of participation in the clinic on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). Secondarily, we evaluated body weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and level of microalbuminuria. All comparisons were made using a paired t-test at a significance level of p \u2264 0.05. RESULTS HbA1C significantly decreased from 10.3% \u00b1 2.2% at baseline to 6.9% \u00b1 1.1% (mean \u00b1 SD) during the 9- to 12-month evaluation period (p < 0.001).

We conducted a retrospective study evaluating clinical outcomes in a diabetes disease management program in which clinical pharmacists possessed collaborative practice agreements. OBJECTIVE To evaluate changes in clinical outcomes for patients enrolled in a pharmacist-coordinated diabetes management program. METHODS Medical records of 157 patients enrolled in the diabetes management program between June 2003 and April 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Data collection included baseline and follow-up values for hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and lipids as well as frequency of adherence to preventive care, including annual foot and eye examinations and daily aspirin therapy. RESULTS For patients with both baseline and follow-up data, the mean A1C reduction was 1.6% (n = 109; p < 0.001). For patients with an initial A1C of \u22658.5%, the mean reduction was 2.7% (n = 57; p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with A1C \u22647% increased from 19% at baseline to 50% at follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction observed was 16 mg/dL (n = 73; NS) and the percentage of patients with LDL values \u2264100 mg/dL increased from 30% at baseline to 56% at follow-up (p < 0.001). The frequency of microalbumin screening increased by 27% (p < 0.001), and the number of patients with annual eye and foot examinations increased by 27% (p < 0.05) and 15% (p < 0.05), respectively. The percentage of patients who had a positive microalbumin test and were taking a renal protective agent rose 19% from baseline to follow-up (NS). The percentage of patients taking daily aspirin increased from 42% at baseline to 80% at follow-up (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist-coordinated diabetes management program was effective in improving clinical markers for enrolled patients. Significant improvements were observed in A1C and LDL values as well as the frequency of adherence to preventive care.",

Patients with diabetes require ongoing disease management, and community pharmacists are in a strategic position to provide such extended care. Little is known, however, about the effects of community pharmacist\u2013provided interventions beyond the initial treatment period. Objective To evaluate the effect of community pharmacist\u2013provided extended diabetes care service on primary clinical outcomes, including hemoglobin A1c (A1C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood pressure, and on patients' reported self-care activities. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with diabetes. Participants had already completed at least 2 diabetes education sessions at a local diabetes education center. Nine specially trained pharmacists administered interventions during up to 4 quarterly visits per patient. Interventions included discussing medications, clinical goals, and self-care activities with patients and recommending medication changes to physicians when appropriate. The main outcome measures were 12-month changes in A1C, LDL-C, blood pressure, and self-report of self-care activities. Results Seventy-eight patients participated in the study (36 intervention, 42 control); 66 were included in the final analysis (31 intervention, 35 control). Compared with changes in the control group, patients who received interventions significantly increased the number of days per week that they engaged in a set of diet and diabetes self-care activities (1.25 and 0.73 more days/wk, respectively). The mean 12-month changes for A1C, LDL-C, and blood pressure were not significantly different between the 2 study groups. Conclusions Although pharmacist-provided interventions did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes over the study period, study results did show that pharmacists were effective at increasing the number of days that patients spent engaging in healthy diet and diabetes self-care activities. Addressing lifestyle and self-care behaviors can be a beneficial component of a pharmacist-provided extended diabetes care service.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus continues to result in substantial morbidity and mortality despite receiving much attention from health care providers. Automated clinician reminder systems have been developed to improve adherence to diabetes care guidelines, but these reminder systems do not always provide actionable information and may be unable to detect relevant, subjective patient information that affects clinical decision making. Face-to-face visits with pharmacists, who have knowledge of care guidelines and medication management strategies, may assist in improving diabetes care. It is unknown if the combination of pharmacist chart review and clinician reminders could improve diabetes care without requiring face-to-face visits. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a comprehensive, pharmacist delivered, primary care, physician-focused intervention in a large hospital-based primary care practice to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes including rates of semiannual hemoglobin A1c testing and other biomarker and process measures. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study conducted in a hospital-based, primary care practice, composed of 37 faculty primary care physicians (PCPs) and 95 internal medicine residents. The initial sample included 346 patients with diabetes and 72 PCPs caring for them. PCPs were randomized to receive either a personalized letter from a practicing pharmacist containing treatment recommendations for patients with upcoming primary care visits (intervention, n = 33) or to usual care without the letters (control, n = 39). The letter included patient-specific recommendations regarding overdue testing as well as drug therapy to achieve diabetes-related treatment targets. The intervention included addition of the letter to the electronic medical record (EMR) and presentation of the letter to the PCP at the time of the index primary care visit that occurred between November 2003 and August 2004. Follow-up chart review was performed after the primary care visit to determine changes in 5 process and 3 biomarker outcome measures of diabetes care within 30 days of the index visit. The primary study outcome was a process measure, change in rates of semiannual A1c testing from baseline to 30-day follow-up. Baseline differences were tested for statistical significance using Pearson chisquare. The statistical significance of the intervention's effect was tested using logistic regression models predicting achievement of each study outcome, with randomization status (intervention vs. control) as the predictor variable of interest, controlling for baseline performance for each measure. RESULTS: 171 patients were in the 4 medical clinic suites with 33 PCPs who received the intervention, and 175 patients were in the 4 suites with 39 PCPs in usual care. 30-day outcomes were analyzed for 301 patients (87.0%) who attended their scheduled index primary care visit. Of these 301 patients, 44.5% were black, 65.8% were female, and the mean age was 63 years. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the intervention group (n = 150) and the usual care (control) group (n = 151) in the 3 biomarker measures (proportion with A1c less than 7%, proportion with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] less than 100 milligrams per deciliter [mg per dL], or blood pressure less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mm Hg]). There were no significant baseline differences in 4 of the 5 process measures; however, the rate of annual LDL-C testing was significantly higher for the intervention than for the control group at baseline (86.0% vs. 74.8%, respectively, P = 0.015). In logistic regression analysis, rates of semiannual A1c testing were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups, increasing from baseline to follow-up by 16% in the intervention group and 9% in the control group (P = 0.146). The proportion of patients with A1c less than 7% at follow-up was 43.3% in the intervention group versus 37.7% in the control group (intervention effect P = 0.099). The only statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the 8 outcome measures was a higher proportion with an annual eye exam at follow-up in the intervention group (60.0%) versus the usual care group (50.3%, intervention effect P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-generated recommendations delivered by letter to PCPs in an academic medical practice were not associated with statistically significant improvements in most quality measures for diabetes care assessed at 30 days following the intervention. Further research is needed with more patients and a longer follow-up time to determine how best to improve the quality of care of patients with diabetes using focused recommendations for therapy changes and reminder notices to clinicians.",

Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs effectively improved health care process measures related to performing preventive services (n = 25; OR 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.58), ordering clinical studies (n = 20; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.00), and prescribing therapies (n = 46; OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.82). Fourteen CDSS/KMS features were assessed for correlation with success of CDSSs/KMSs across all endpoints. Meta-analyses identified six new success features: Integration with charting or order entry system. Promotion of action rather than inaction. No need for additional clinician data entry. Justification of decision support via research evidence. Local user involvement. Provision of decision support results to patients as well as providers. Three previously identified success features were confirmed: Automatic provision of decision support as part of clinician workflow. Provision of decision support at time and location of decisionmaking. Provision of a recommendation, not just an assessment. Only 29 (19.6%) RCTs assessed the impact of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, 22 (14.9%) assessed costs, and 3 assessed KMSs on any outcomes. The primary source of knowledge used in CDSSs was derived from structured care protocols.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nStrong evidence shows that CDSSs/KMSs are effective in improving health care process measures across diverse settings using both commercially and locally developed systems. Evidence for the effectiveness of CDSSs on clinical outcomes and costs and KMSs on any outcomes is minimal. Nine features of CDSSs/KMSs that correlate with a successful impact of clinical decision support have been newly identified or confirmed.",

            "abstract": "Context: The recent explosion in available electronic health record (EHR) data is motivating a rapid expansion of electronic health care predictive analytic (e-HPA) applications, defined as the use of electronic algorithms that forecast clinical events in real time with the intent to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. There is an urgent need for a systematic framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA to ensure that the field develops in a scientifically sound, ethical, and efficient manner. Objectives: Building upon earlier frameworks of model development and utilization, we identify the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA, propose a framework that enables us to realize these opportunities, address these challenges, and motivate e-HPA stakeholders to both adopt and continuously refine the framework as the applications of e-HPA emerge. Methods: To achieve these objectives, 17 experts with diverse expertise including methodology, ethics, legal, regulation, and health care delivery systems were assembled to identify emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA and to propose a framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA. Findings: The framework proposed by the panel includes three key domains where e-HPA differs qualitatively from earlier generations of models and algorithms (Data Barriers, Transparency, and Ethics) and areas where current frameworks are insufficient to address the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA (Regulation and Certification; and Education and Training). The following list of recommendations summarizes the key points of the framework: Data Barriers: Establish mechanisms within the scientific community to support data sharing for predictive model development and testing. Transparency: Set standards around e-HPA validation based on principles of scientific transparency and reproducibility. Ethics: Develop both individual-centered and society-centered risk-benefit approaches to evaluate e-HPA. Regulation and Certification: Construct a self-regulation and certification framework within e-HPA. Education and Training: Make significant changes to medical, nursing, and paraprofessional curricula by including training for understanding, evaluating, and utilizing predictive models.",

            "abstract": "Context: The recent explosion in available electronic health record (EHR) data is motivating a rapid expansion of electronic health care predictive analytic (e-HPA) applications, defined as the use of electronic algorithms that forecast clinical events in real time with the intent to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. There is an urgent need for a systematic framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA to ensure that the field develops in a scientifically sound, ethical, and efficient manner. Objectives: Building upon earlier frameworks of model development and utilization, we identify the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA, propose a framework that enables us to realize these opportunities, address these challenges, and motivate e-HPA stakeholders to both adopt and continuously refine the framework as the applications of e-HPA emerge. Methods: To achieve these objectives, 17 experts with diverse expertise including methodology, ethics, legal, regulation, and health care delivery systems were assembled to identify emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA and to propose a framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA. Findings: The framework proposed by the panel includes three key domains where e-HPA differs qualitatively from earlier generations of models and algorithms (Data Barriers, Transparency, and Ethics) and areas where current frameworks are insufficient to address the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA (Regulation and Certification; and Education and Training). The following list of recommendations summarizes the key points of the framework: Data Barriers: Establish mechanisms within the scientific community to support data sharing for predictive model development and testing. Transparency: Set standards around e-HPA validation based on principles of scientific transparency and reproducibility. Ethics: Develop both individual-centered and society-centered risk-benefit approaches to evaluate e-HPA. Regulation and Certification: Construct a self-regulation and certification framework within e-HPA. Education and Training: Make significant changes to medical, nursing, and paraprofessional curricula by including training for understanding, evaluating, and utilizing predictive models.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: Early prediction of undesired outcomes among newly hospitalized patients could improve patient triage and prompt conversations about patients\u2019 goals of care. We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, and elastic net regression models, with and without unstructured clinical text data, to predict a binary composite outcome of in-hospital death or ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days using data from the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Design: Retrospective cohort study with split sampling for model training and testing. Setting: A single urban academic hospital. Patients: All hospitalized patients who required ICU care at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, from 2001 to 2012. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Among eligible 25,947 hospital admissions, we observed 5,504 (21.2%) in which patients died or had ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days. The gradient boosting machine model had the highest discrimination without (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81\u20130.84) and with (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88\u20130.90) text-derived variables. Both gradient boosting machines and random forests outperformed logistic regression without text data (p < 0.001), whereas all models outperformed logistic regression with text data (p < 0.02). The inclusion of text data increased the discrimination of all four model types (p < 0.001). Among those models using text data, the increasing presence of terms \u201cintubated\u201d and \u201cpoor prognosis\u201d were positively associated with mortality and ICU length of stay, whereas the term \u201cextubated\u201d was inversely associated with them. Conclusions: Variables extracted from unstructured clinical text from the first 48 hours of hospital admission using natural language processing techniques significantly improved the abilities of logistic regression and other machine learning models to predict which patients died or had long ICU stays. Learning health systems may adapt such models using open-source approaches to capture local variation in care patterns.",

            "abstract": "Background Successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are exceedingly rare, and barriers to its adoption are poorly characterized in the literature. Objective This study aims to report a quality improvement effort to integrate a deep learning sepsis detection and management platform, Sepsis Watch, into routine clinical care. Methods In 2016, a multidisciplinary team consisting of statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, and clinicians was assembled by the leadership of an academic health system to radically improve the detection and treatment of sepsis. This report of the quality improvement effort follows the learning health system framework to describe the problem assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation plan of Sepsis Watch. Results Sepsis Watch was successfully integrated into routine clinical care and reshaped how local machine learning projects are executed. Frontline clinical staff were highly engaged in the design and development of the workflow, machine learning model, and application. Novel machine learning methods were developed to detect sepsis early, and implementation of the model required robust infrastructure. Significant investment was required to align stakeholders, develop trusting relationships, define roles and responsibilities, and to train frontline staff, leading to the establishment of 3 partnerships with internal and external research groups to evaluate Sepsis Watch. Conclusions Machine learning models are commonly developed to enhance clinical decision making, but successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are rare. Although there is no playbook for integrating deep learning into clinical care, learnings from the Sepsis Watch integration can inform efforts to develop machine learning technologies at other health care delivery systems.",

Objective This study aims to report a quality improvement effort to integrate a deep learning sepsis detection and management platform, Sepsis Watch, into routine clinical care. Methods In 2016, a multidisciplinary team consisting of statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, and clinicians was assembled by the leadership of an academic health system to radically improve the detection and treatment of sepsis. This report of the quality improvement effort follows the learning health system framework to describe the problem assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation plan of Sepsis Watch. Results Sepsis Watch was successfully integrated into routine clinical care and reshaped how local machine learning projects are executed. Frontline clinical staff were highly engaged in the design and development of the workflow, machine learning model, and application. Novel machine learning methods were developed to detect sepsis early, and implementation of the model required robust infrastructure. Significant investment was required to align stakeholders, develop trusting relationships, define roles and responsibilities, and to train frontline staff, leading to the establishment of 3 partnerships with internal and external research groups to evaluate Sepsis Watch. Conclusions Machine learning models are commonly developed to enhance clinical decision making, but successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are rare.

            "abstract": "Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) has demonstrated efficacy in computer imaging and other self-contained digital workflows, but has failed to substantially impact routine clinical care. This is no longer because of poor adoption of Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS), but because ML4H needs an infrastructure for development, deployment and evaluation within the healthcare institution. In this paper, we propose a design pattern called a Clinical Deployment Environment (CDE). We sketch the five pillars of the CDE: (1) real world development supported by live data where ML4H teams can iteratively build and test at the bedside (2) an ML-Ops platform that brings the rigour and standards of continuous deployment to ML4H (3) design and supervision by those with expertise in AI safety (4) the methods of implementation science that enable the algorithmic insights to influence the behaviour of clinicians and patients and (5) continuous evaluation that uses randomisation to avoid bias but in an agile manner. The CDE is intended to answer the same requirements that bio-medicine articulated in establishing the translational medicine domain. It envisions a transition from \u201creal-world\u201d data to \u201creal-world\u201d development.",
