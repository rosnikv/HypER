            "title": "Natural interferon-alpha versus its combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone in the therapy of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia: a long-term, randomized, controlled study.",
            "abstract": "Type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is an often progressive vasculitis characterized by circulating cold-precipitable proteins that usually consists of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM kappa with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity. Its etiology is unknown, although recent evidence strongly suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a major role. Plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, and cytotoxic drugs have been used in the therapy of MC patients. Recently, favorable results with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN alpha) have been reported. To further assess its effectiveness, we studied the effects of natural human interferon-alpha (nIFN alpha), alone and in combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone (PDN), in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with symptomatic MC. Sixty-five patients were enrolled onto the trial, 52 (80%) of whom presented serum anti-HCV antibodies and specific genomic RNA sequences. Fifteen patients received nIFN alpha (3 MU) intramuscularly (IM) three times weekly, whereas 17 patients also received 16 mg/d of PDN orally on non-IFN days. Moreover, 18 patients received 16 mg/d of PDN only, and 15 were untreated. Treatment was discontinued after 1 year and patients were monitored for 8 to 17 months (mean, 13). A complete response was achieved in eight of 15 patients (53.3%) treated with nIFN alpha and nine of 17 (52.9%) treated with nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with three of 18 patients (16.7%) who received PDN only (P < .05) and one of 15 (6.7%) untreated controls (P < .01). Partial response occurred in two of 15 (13.3%) patients treated with nIFN alpha, three of 17 (17.6%) who received nIFN alpha plus PDN, one of 18 (5.5%) who received PDN only, and one of 15 (6.7%) controls. A complete response in six patients (66.7%) was achieved within 3 months in the group that received nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with two patients (25%) of those who received nIFN alpha alone (P < .02). In anti-HCV-positive patients, the clinical response occurred in step with reduced or undetectable levels of HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. Quantification of circulating HCV RNA represented a good predictive response marker. The probability of relapse within 3 months after treatment was 100% (three of three patients) and 75% (six of eight patients), respectively, in patients who received PDN alone or nIFN alpha alone as compared with none of those who received nIFN alpha plus PDN (P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

            "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA agent which expresses its genetic informations in the form of a single, large polyprotein encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) that extends through most of its genomic RNA. Proteolytic cleavage of the ORF product is essential for the virogenesis and the production of viral progeny. HCV is responsible for chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral persistence is considered the greatest problem in the management of HCV infection. It may result from several mechanisms, two of which are established. In the first, the high rate of genetic variations during viral replication results in the production of mutants capable of escaping the immune attack. In the second, the virus infects cells of the immune system itself, which represent a privileged site that cannot be reached by virus-specific T cell response. Involvement of lymphoid cells in the early stages of HCV infection may provide insight into the pathobiologic patterns of extrahepatic dissemination (lymph nodes, major salivary glands, kidneys, blood vessels). Dissemination of HCV-infected lymphoid cells throughout the organism is likely to maintain a mobile and extensive reservoir of the virus. In this respect, extrahepatic sites may act as a source of continuous reinfection of hepatocytes. Studies of intrahepatic B lymphocytes indicate that they are infected with HCV, clonally expanded and activated to secrete IgM molecules with rheumatoid factor activity. This strongly suggests that HCV directly stimulates B cell expansion, which may result in an indolent stage of lymphoproliferation (i.e., mixed cryoglobulinemia) or in frank B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The frequency of NHL, however, is much lower than that of HCV infection, suggesting that HCV alone is not able to induce tumors and that cellular events, in addition to the presence of virus and virus-encoded products, are necessary in order to obtain a malignant B cell phenotype. The demonstration of HCV productive infection in bone marrow-recruited and circulating pluripotent hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells indicates that HCV replication occurs in the early differentiation stages of hematopoietic progenitors. These are stable cell populations and are likely to represent the initial site of infection and a continuous source of virus production.",

In the first, the high rate of genetic variations during viral replication results in the production of mutants capable of escaping the immune attack. In the second, the virus infects cells of the immune system itself, which represent a privileged site that cannot be reached by virus-specific T cell response. Involvement of lymphoid cells in the early stages of HCV infection may provide insight into the pathobiologic patterns of extrahepatic dissemination (lymph nodes, major salivary glands, kidneys, blood vessels). Dissemination of HCV-infected lymphoid cells throughout the organism is likely to maintain a mobile and extensive reservoir of the virus. In this respect, extrahepatic sites may act as a source of continuous reinfection of hepatocytes. Studies of intrahepatic B lymphocytes indicate that they are infected with HCV, clonally expanded and activated to secrete IgM molecules with rheumatoid factor activity. This strongly suggests that HCV directly stimulates B cell expansion, which may result in an indolent stage of lymphoproliferation (i.e., mixed cryoglobulinemia) or in frank B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The frequency of NHL, however, is much lower than that of HCV infection, suggesting that HCV alone is not able to induce tumors and that cellular events, in addition to the presence of virus and virus-encoded products, are necessary in order to obtain a malignant B cell phenotype. The demonstration of HCV productive infection in bone marrow-recruited and circulating pluripotent hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells indicates that HCV replication occurs in the early differentiation stages of hematopoietic progenitors. These are stable cell populations and are likely to represent the initial site of infection and a continuous source of virus production.",

For almost all NHLs, both heavy- and light-chain complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) showed the highest similarity to antibodies with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity that have been found in the MC syndrome, thus suggesting that a common antigenic stimulus is involved in MC syndrome and in HCV-associated lymphomagenesis. Moreover, because HCV is the recognized pathologic agent of MC and the CDR3 amino acid sequences of some HCV-associated NHLs also present a high homology for antibody specific for the E2 protein of HCV, it may be reasonable to speculate that HCV E2 protein is one of the chronic antigenic stimuli involved in the lymphomagenetic process. Finally, the use of specific segments, in particular the D segment, in assembling the IgH chain of IgR seems to confer B-cell disorders with the property to produce antibody with RF activity, which may contribute to the manifestation of an overt MC syndrome.",

We undertook this study after a patient with splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes had a hematologic response after antiviral treatment of HCV infection.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNine patients who had splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and HCV infection were treated with interferon alfa-2b (3 million IU three times per week) alone or in combination with ribavirin (1000 to 1200 mg per day). The outcomes were compared with those of six similarly treated patients with splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes who tested negative for HCV infection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the nine patients with HCV infection who received interferon alfa, seven had a complete remission after the loss of detectable HCV RNA. The other two patients had a partial and a complete remission after the addition of ribavirin and the loss of detectable HCV RNA. One patient had a relapse when the HCV RNA load again became detectable in blood. In contrast, none of the six HCV-negative patients had a response to interferon therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes who are infected with HCV, treatment with interferon can lead to regression of the lymphoma.",

The outcomes were compared with those of six similarly treated patients with splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes who tested negative for HCV infection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the nine patients with HCV infection who received interferon alfa, seven had a complete remission after the loss of detectable HCV RNA.

            "abstract": "Epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic data have shown a close association between chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In many countries of the developed world, HCV infection accounts for more than half of the cases of HCC. HCC usually arises after 2-4 decades of infection, typically in the context of an underlying cirrhosis. Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-alfa can lead to sustained clearance of HCV, and small prospective studies as well as larger retrospective analyses suggest that interferon therapy leads to a decrease in the incidence of HCC. Without a reliable tissue culture system or a small animal model of HCV infection, analysis of the mechanisms by which HCV leads to cancer has been difficult. Nevertheless, both in vitro expression systems and in vivo transgenic mice studies suggest that HCV has an inherent carcinogenic potential. Understanding the pathogenesis of HCV-associated HCC is important in developing effective means of prevention and treatment of this highly malignant form of cancer.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe previously reported that impaired retinoid signaling in the liver causes steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, oxidative stress induced by hepatic iron overload has emerged as an important factor for the progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In this study, the relationship between retinoid signaling and iron metabolism in the liver was investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effect of retinoids on the iron metabolism was examined in HuH7 cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid and acyclic retinoid NIK-333. In in vivo experiments, we used the mice expressing the dominant negative form of retinoic acid receptor alpha gene under the control of albumin enhancer/promoter (RAR-E Tg) and iron-overloaded wild mice fed with retinoid-deficient and retinoid-excess diets.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHepatic iron accumulation and increased expression of hemojuvelin were observed in RAR-E Tg mouse liver. Retinoid treatment significantly suppressed expression of hemojuvelin and mildly suppressed expression of transferrin receptor type 2 and hepcidin, accompanied by decreased hepatic iron content and iron-induced oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of hemojuvelin in HuH7 hepatoma cells led to a significant increase in cellular iron content.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that retinoids are involved in hepatic iron metabolism through transcriptional regulation of hemojuvelin. This study demonstrated a novel functional role of retinoids in preventing iron-induced oxidative stress in the liver.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe previously reported that impaired retinoid signaling in the liver causes steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, oxidative stress induced by hepatic iron overload has emerged as an important factor for the progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In this study, the relationship between retinoid signaling and iron metabolism in the liver was investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effect of retinoids on the iron metabolism was examined in HuH7 cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid and acyclic retinoid NIK-333. In in vivo experiments, we used the mice expressing the dominant negative form of retinoic acid receptor alpha gene under the control of albumin enhancer/promoter (RAR-E Tg) and iron-overloaded wild mice fed with retinoid-deficient and retinoid-excess diets.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHepatic iron accumulation and increased expression of hemojuvelin were observed in RAR-E Tg mouse liver. Retinoid treatment significantly suppressed expression of hemojuvelin and mildly suppressed expression of transferrin receptor type 2 and hepcidin, accompanied by decreased hepatic iron content and iron-induced oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of hemojuvelin in HuH7 hepatoma cells led to a significant increase in cellular iron content.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that retinoids are involved in hepatic iron metabolism through transcriptional regulation of hemojuvelin. This study demonstrated a novel functional role of retinoids in preventing iron-induced oxidative stress in the liver.",

            "abstract": "Recent data link vitamin A and its retinoid metabolites to the regulation of adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis. Retinoid metabolism is tightly controlled by an enzymatic network in which retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (Aldh1-3) are the rate-limiting enzymes that convert retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Aldh1a1-deficient mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and hence diabetes. Here we investigated whether Aldh1a1 and the retinoid axis regulate hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism independent of adiposity. The impact of Aldh1a1 and the retinoid pathway on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism was analyzed in hepatocytes in vitro and in chow-fed, weight-matched Aldh1a1-deficient vs. wild-type (WT) mice in vivo. Aldh1a1-deficient mice displayed significantly decreased fasting glucose concentrations compared with WT controls as a result of attenuated hepatic glucose production. Expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes as well as the activity of Forkhead box O1 was decreased in Aldh1a1-deficient vs. WT livers. In vitro, retinoid or cAMP agonist stimulation markedly induced gluconeogenesis in WT but not Aldh1a1-deficient primary hepatocytes. Aldh1a1 deficiency increased AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 activity, decreased expression of lipogenic targets of AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 and significantly attenuated hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis. In metabolic cage studies, lean Aldh1a1-deficient mice manifested enhanced oxygen consumption and reduced respiratory quotient vs. WT controls, consistent with increased expression of fatty acid oxidation markers in skeletal muscle. Taken together, this work establishes a role for retinoid metabolism in glucose homeostasis in vivo and for Aldh1a1 as a novel determinant of gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism independent of adiposity.",

            "abstract": "The effects of retinoids, the structural derivatives of vitamin A (retinol), on post-natal peak bone density acquisition and skeletal remodeling are complex and compartment specific. Emerging data indicates that retinoids, such as all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its precursor all trans retinaldehyde (Rald), exhibit distinct and divergent transcriptional effects in metabolism. Despite these observations, the role of enzymes that control retinoid metabolism in bone remains undefined. In this study, we examined the skeletal phenotype of mice deficient in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a1), the enzyme responsible for converting Rald to ATRA in adult animals. Bone densitometry and micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) demonstrated that Aldh1a1-deficient (Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212) female mice had higher trabecular and cortical bone mass compared to age and sex-matched control C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice at multiple time points. Histomorphometry confirmed increased cortical bone thickness and demonstrated significantly higher bone marrow adiposity in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In serum assays, Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice also had higher serum IGF-1 levels. In vitro, primary Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressed significantly higher levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and demonstrated enhanced osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis versus WT MSCs. BMP2 was also expressed at higher levels in the femurs and tibias of Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice with accompanying induction of BMP2-regulated responses, including expression of Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase, and Smad phosphorylation. In vitro, Rald, which accumulates in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice, potently induced BMP2 in WT MSCs in a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent manner, suggesting that Rald is involved in the BMP2 increases seen in Aldh1a1 deficiency in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate Aldh1a1 as a novel determinant of cortical bone density and marrow adiposity in the skeleton in vivo through modulation of BMP signaling.",

            "abstract": "The effects of retinoids, the structural derivatives of vitamin A (retinol), on post-natal peak bone density acquisition and skeletal remodeling are complex and compartment specific. Emerging data indicates that retinoids, such as all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its precursor all trans retinaldehyde (Rald), exhibit distinct and divergent transcriptional effects in metabolism. Despite these observations, the role of enzymes that control retinoid metabolism in bone remains undefined. In this study, we examined the skeletal phenotype of mice deficient in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a1), the enzyme responsible for converting Rald to ATRA in adult animals. Bone densitometry and micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) demonstrated that Aldh1a1-deficient (Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212) female mice had higher trabecular and cortical bone mass compared to age and sex-matched control C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice at multiple time points. Histomorphometry confirmed increased cortical bone thickness and demonstrated significantly higher bone marrow adiposity in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In serum assays, Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice also had higher serum IGF-1 levels. In vitro, primary Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressed significantly higher levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and demonstrated enhanced osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis versus WT MSCs. BMP2 was also expressed at higher levels in the femurs and tibias of Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice with accompanying induction of BMP2-regulated responses, including expression of Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase, and Smad phosphorylation. In vitro, Rald, which accumulates in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice, potently induced BMP2 in WT MSCs in a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent manner, suggesting that Rald is involved in the BMP2 increases seen in Aldh1a1 deficiency in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate Aldh1a1 as a novel determinant of cortical bone density and marrow adiposity in the skeleton in vivo through modulation of BMP signaling.",

            "abstract": "Sirt1 promotes odontoblastic gene expression in human dental pulp cells, whereas the inhibition of Sirt1 downregulates the expression of those genes. To investigate whether the overexpression of Sirt1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) driven by Prx1 promoter could rescue the dentin formation defects in Bmi1-deficient (Bmi1\u2212/\u2212) mice, we established the MSCs overexpressing Sirt1 in Bmi1 knockout mice (Sirt1TGBmi1\u2212/\u2212). First, we used Prx1-Cre/ROSAnTnG mice to demonstrate that Prx1 linage cells exist mainly in the pulp horns at 4 wk of age. Second, we found that 4-wk-old Sirt1TG mice had increased tooth volume as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. The expression level of Sirt1 was significantly higher in dental papilla mesenchymal cells of Sirt1TG mice than WT mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the tooth mineralization, dental volume, dentin sialoprotein\u2013immunopositive areas, odontoblastic gene expression, and percentage of proliferating BrdU-positive cells were significantly elevated in the Sirt1TG mice and dramatically reduced in the Bmi1\u2013/\u2013 mice versus the WT littermates at 4 wk of age. However, the areas of predentin and the percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were significantly reduced in the Sirt1TG mice but dramatically increased in the Bmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared with the WT littermates. All these parameters were rescued in the Sirt1TGBmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice versus the Bmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Finally, by using dental papilla mesenchymal cells, we found that the overexpression of Sirt1 rescued the reduced cell proliferation and differentiation and increased the cell apoptosis caused by Bmi1 deficiency, which was associated with increased p53 deacetylation. Therefore, this study indicates that Sirt1 is a potential therapeutic target for promoting dentin formation in an anabolic approach to the treatment of dental developmental defects.",

            "abstract": "It has been reported that 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] deficiency leads to the loss of mandibular bone, however the mechanism is unclear. We investigated whether the Sirt1/FOXO3a signaling pathway is involved in this process. Using a 1,25(OH)2D deficiency model induced by genetic deletion in mice of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1 hydroxylase [1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice]. We first documented a sharp reduction of expression levels of Sirt1 in the 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice in vivo. Next, we demonstrated dose-dependent upregulation of Sirt1 by treatment with exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro. We then identified a functional VDR binding site in the Sirt1 promoter. By crossing Prx1-Sirt1 transgenic mice with 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice we demonstrated that the overexpression of Sirt1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) greatly improved the 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mandibular bone loss phenotype by increasing osteoblastic bone formation and reducing osteoclastic bone resorption. In mechanistic studies, we showed, in 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice, decreases of Sirt1 and FoxO3a, an increase in oxidative stress as reflected by a reduction of the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1), SOD1 and SOD2 expression, and an increase of markers for osteocyte senescence and senescence associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), including \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal), p16, p53 and p21. The targeted overexpression of Sirt1 in the 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice restored the expression levels of these molecules. Finally, we demonstrated that a Sirt1 agonist can upregulate FOXO3a activity by increasing deacetylation and nuclear translocation. Overall, results from this study support the concept that targeted increases in Sirt1/FOXO3a signaling levels can greatly improve the bone loss caused by 1,25(OH)2D deficiency.",

            "abstract": "It has been reported that 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] deficiency leads to the loss of mandibular bone, however the mechanism is unclear. We investigated whether the Sirt1/FOXO3a signaling pathway is involved in this process. Using a 1,25(OH)2D deficiency model induced by genetic deletion in mice of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1 hydroxylase [1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice]. We first documented a sharp reduction of expression levels of Sirt1 in the 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice in vivo. Next, we demonstrated dose-dependent upregulation of Sirt1 by treatment with exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro. We then identified a functional VDR binding site in the Sirt1 promoter. By crossing Prx1-Sirt1 transgenic mice with 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice we demonstrated that the overexpression of Sirt1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) greatly improved the 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mandibular bone loss phenotype by increasing osteoblastic bone formation and reducing osteoclastic bone resorption. In mechanistic studies, we showed, in 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice, decreases of Sirt1 and FoxO3a, an increase in oxidative stress as reflected by a reduction of the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1), SOD1 and SOD2 expression, and an increase of markers for osteocyte senescence and senescence associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), including \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal), p16, p53 and p21. The targeted overexpression of Sirt1 in the 1\u03b1(OH)ase-/- mice restored the expression levels of these molecules. Finally, we demonstrated that a Sirt1 agonist can upregulate FOXO3a activity by increasing deacetylation and nuclear translocation. Overall, results from this study support the concept that targeted increases in Sirt1/FOXO3a signaling levels can greatly improve the bone loss caused by 1,25(OH)2D deficiency.",

            "title": "Elevated interleukin\u201011 in systemic sclerosis and role in disease pathogenesis",
            "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease in which there is elevated inflammation, aberrant cytokine expression, and subsequent fibrosis. Interleukin\u201011 (IL\u201011) is a recently described profibrotic cytokine that can mediate fibrosis in the heart, lungs, and skin and is upregulated by transforming Growth Factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b21). The objective of this study was to quantify the serum levels of IL\u201011 in early diffuse SSc patients. Also, if IL\u201011 could regulate the alarmin IL\u201033 in dermal fibroblasts was quantified. Early diffuse SSc patient sera was isolated and IL\u201011 was quantified by specific commercial ELISA compared to healthy control (n\u2009=\u200917). Healthy dermal fibroblasts were cultured in vitro and then serum starved and incubated with or without recombinant IL\u201011. At specific early and late time points the supernatant was quantified for the alarmin IL\u201033 by specific ELISA. In early diffuse SSc patients it was demonstrated that they have elevated IL\u201011 in their sera. In a subgroup of SSc patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) this elevation was particularly pronounced compared to those devoid of fibrotic lung disease. In vitro incubation of healthy dermal fibroblasts led to a significant induction of IL\u201033 cytokine release into the cell media. IL\u201011 is a profibrotic cytokine that is elevated in early diffuse SSc and is particularly elevated in those with ILD. This suggests that IL\u201011 could be a possible biomarker of ILD in SSc. It was also found that IL\u201011 led to release of the cytokine alarmin IL\u201033 in fibroblasts at earlier time points but not late time points, suggesting early stimulation elicits an inflammatory response in the local microenvironment but prolonged stimulation leads to fibrosis.",
