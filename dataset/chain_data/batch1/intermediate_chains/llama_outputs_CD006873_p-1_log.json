            "abstract": "Recurrence rate is high after operation for Crohn's disease. A multicenter trial was performed to study the effect of radical or nonradical operation and of sulfasalazine prophylaxis versus placebo on postoperative recurrence rate in 232 patients with Crohn's disease. Sixteen medical and surgical centers participated in the study, 7 operating radically and 9 nonradically. The follow-up period lasted 3 years, the allocation to drug treatment was randomized and double blind. Recurrence was significantly less frequent and occurred later in patients who were operated nonradically. Patients on sulfasalazine prophylaxis had a better prognosis than on placebo. This effect was statistically significant in the first 2 years of treatment. Both strategies were additive: nonradical operation and sulfasalazine had the best prognosis, radical operation and placebo was worst. It is concluded that postoperative recurrence is best prevented by resecting nonradically and prescribing 3 g of sulfasalazine daily at least over 2 years.",

Among these, more than half of the children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (120 patients) had ileocolonic involvement, and pancolitis predominated in those with ulcerative colitis (33 patients). Patients with ulcerative colitis were diagnosed at a younger age than those with Crohn's disease, and thus mesalamine therapy was initiated earlier. When used as monotherapy, no difference was noted in the average dose used for the treatment of active disease versus maintenance therapy (36 mg/kg/day). However, the average dose used did increase since 1992, for both the treatment of active disease and relapse prevention (43 mg/kg/ day). Overall, 18 patients (11.8%) were withdrawn from mesalamine therapy; however only 8 (5.2%) had objective side effects. Exacerbation of diarrhea was the most common reason for withdrawal. Although reported rarely, no serious adverse reactions such as pancreatitis or hepatic or renal dysfunction were observed. This study suggests that mesalamine is a safe and well\u2010tolerated medication in the long\u2010term treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.",

A variety of 5-ASA delivery systems are available and in development, including both oral and rectal formulations; all of which aim to deliver the active drug to the colon while minimizing systemic absorption. Because the efficacy of most oral 5-ASA therapies is broadly similar, the appropriate selection of a given formulation often relies on other factors. This article explores the differences between oral 5-ASA formulations in terms of their delivery system, reviews the available data on oral 5-ASA treatment efficacy and tolerability, and examines the rationale for changing from one 5-ASA formulation to another if a patient does not respond to, or worsens on, their existing agent.",

            "abstract": "5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the standard first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. A variety of 5-ASA delivery systems are available and in development, including both oral and rectal formulations; all of which aim to deliver the active drug to the colon while minimizing systemic absorption. Because the efficacy of most oral 5-ASA therapies is broadly similar, the appropriate selection of a given formulation often relies on other factors. This article explores the differences between oral 5-ASA formulations in terms of their delivery system, reviews the available data on oral 5-ASA treatment efficacy and tolerability, and examines the rationale for changing from one 5-ASA formulation to another if a patient does not respond to, or worsens on, their existing agent.",

The current study examined the burden of disease and the impact of daily multimatrix (MMX\u00ae) mesalamine treatment on HRQoL for patients with active or quiescent mild-to-moderate UC. Methods:Data were from a two-phase, multicenter, open-label study with mild-to-moderate UC patients. In the acute phase, 132 patients with active disease received MMX mesalamine 2.4\u20134.8 g/day QD for 8 weeks. In the maintenance phase, 207 patients with quiescent disease received MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day QD for 12 months. The Short Form-12 (version 2) (SF-12v2) measured HRQoL during each phase. Disease burden was examined by comparing acute-phase baseline scores with a U.S. general population sample. Repeated-measures analyses assessed change in SF-12v2 scores for each phase. Correspondence between HRQoL and disease activity was examined through correlations between SF-12v2 scores with patient-reported symptom measures. Results:Baseline SF-12v2 scores for patients with UC were generally much lower than for the general population sample, indicating a broad disease burden. In the acute phase, significant improvement was observed for most SF-12v2 scores at week 8; a comparison with the matched norms showed a complete elimination of burden. No changes in SF-12v2 scores were observed during the maintenance phase. Changes in symptom measures and SF-12v2 scores were moderately correlated. Conclusions:The sizeable burden of active mild-to-moderate UC on HRQoL was eliminated following 8 weeks' treatment with MMX mesalamine 2.4\u20134.8 g/day. HRQoL remained stable over 12 months of maintenance treatment in patients with quiescent UC.",

We assessed the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD) of the pouch and chronic antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at 5 academic referral centers in the United States. Adult patients with endoscopic inflammation of the pouch who received vedolizumab were included. The primary outcome was clinical response at any time point. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response, and remission. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed for the effect of the following variables on clinical response: fistula, onset of pouchitis less than 1 year after IPAA, younger than 35 years old, gender, previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-alpha use, and BMI >30.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-three patients were treated with vedolizumab for inflammation of the pouch between January 2014 and October 2017. Median follow-up was 1.3 years (interquartile range 0.7-2.1). The proportion of patients that achieved at least a clinical response was 71.1%, with 19.3% achieving clinical remission. Of the 74 patients with a follow-up pouchoscopy, the proportion of patients with endoscopic response and mucosal healing was 54.1% and 17.6%, respectively. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms less than 1 year after undergoing IPAA were less likely to respond to vedolizumab, even after controlling for other risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVedolizumab is safe and effective in the management of CD of the pouch and chronic pouchitis. Further studies are needed to compare vedolizumab with other biologic therapies for pouchitis and CD of the pouch.",

Of the 74 patients with a follow-up pouchoscopy, the proportion of patients with endoscopic response and mucosal healing was 54.1% and 17.6%, respectively. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms less than 1 year after undergoing IPAA were less likely to respond to vedolizumab, even after controlling for other risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVedolizumab is safe and effective in the management of CD of the pouch and chronic pouchitis. Further studies are needed to compare vedolizumab with other biologic therapies for pouchitis and CD of the pouch.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nInflammation of the pouch after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) can significantly impact quality of life and be difficult to treat. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD) of the pouch and chronic antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at 5 academic referral centers in the United States. Adult patients with endoscopic inflammation of the pouch who received vedolizumab were included. The primary outcome was clinical response at any time point. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response, and remission. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed for the effect of the following variables on clinical response: fistula, onset of pouchitis less than 1 year after IPAA, younger than 35 years old, gender, previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-alpha use, and BMI >30.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-three patients were treated with vedolizumab for inflammation of the pouch between January 2014 and October 2017. Median follow-up was 1.3 years (interquartile range 0.7-2.1). The proportion of patients that achieved at least a clinical response was 71.1%, with 19.3% achieving clinical remission.
