Methods Between December 2003 and December 2009, 861 patients (603 men; mean age 72 years) underwent nitinol stenting of the femoropopliteal segment in 1017 limbs. A quarter (26%) of the patients had critical limb ischemia. Mean lesion length was 152\u00b193 mm. Stent patency was assessed by either duplex ultrasound or angiography and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimation. The determinants of restenosis were explored with Cox proportional hazard regression analyses; the results are presented as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk stratification of primary patency was subsequently analyzed using a score based on the significant prognostic factors identified in the multivariate model. Results Stent fracture occurred in 10% (104 limbs) of the lesions. At 1, 3, and 6 years, the primary patency rates were 77%, 67%, and 63%; secondary patency rates were 91%, 87%, and 87%; freedom from femoropopliteal bypass grafting was 99%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified female gender (HR 1.899; 95% CI 1.318 to 2.737, p<0.001), ankle-brachial index <0.6 (HR 1.921; 95% CI 1.348 to 2.736, p<0.001), TASC II C/D lesion (HR 2.068; 95% CI 1.346 to 3.177, p=0.0009), stent fracture (HR 1.937; 95% CI 1.203 to 3.118, p=0.006), and the absence of cilostazol administration (HR 2.102; 95% CI 1.394 to 3.172, p<0.001) as strong independent factors associated with restenosis. After assigning a risk score based on the outcomes of the multivariate regression analysis (1 each for female gender, ABI <0.6, TASC II C/D, stent fracture, and absence of cilostazol therapy), primary patency was found to be lower in limb groups with a higher cumulative score (12-month primary patency: score 0: 93%, score 1: 80%, score 2: 73%, score 3; 47%, score 4: 0%, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusions Endovascular therapy using nitinol stents for FP lesions yielded acceptable outcomes up to 6 years.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPeripheral artery disease accounts for more than 400 000 hospitalizations in the USA and results in symptoms ranging from claudication to gangrene. Recent advances in endovascular techniques have led to a more aggressive approach for treating peripheral artery disease. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of endovascular interventions on TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) II C and D femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData for all patients undergoing endovascular interventions for femoropopliteal occlusive disease from December 2007 through December 2010 were reviewed. Demographic data, risk factor data, preprocedural and postprocedural ankle-brachial indices, technical success rates, and complication rates were obtained. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors adversely affecting primary patency.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study group included 52 TASC II C and 106 TASC II D limbs in 126 patients (mean age, (68.0 \u00b1 18.0) years). The technical success rate was 91.1%. Complications occurred in 19 limbs (12.0%), including 8 (5.1%) major complications. The mean follow-up period was (17.6 \u00b1 5.1) months (range, 12.0 - 48.0 months). Primary patency rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 95%, 78%, 74%, and 74% in TASC II C lesions and 89%, 62%, 52%, and 52% in TASC II D lesions, respectively. Secondary patency rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 97%, 94%, 94%, and 94% in TASC II C lesions and 97%, 95%, 83%, and 83% in TASC II D lesions, respectively. It is significantly different between primary patency rates (P < 0.05) but not secondary patency rates of TASC II C and D groups (P > 0.05). Predictors of restenosis/occlusion included hyperlipidemia, lesion length, and popliteal artery involvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEndovascular treatment of TASC II C and D femoropopliteal artery occlusion has a high technical success rate with favorable mid-term secondary patency rate. Hyperlipidemia, lesion length, and popliteal artery involvement were independent risk factors for in-stent restenosis.",

            "abstract": "AIM\nTo perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to help hospital decision-makers with regard to the use of drug-coated balloons compared with bare metal stents and uncoated balloons for femoropopliteal occlusive disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nClinical outcomes were extracted from the results of meta-analyses already published, and cost units are those used in the Quebec healthcare network. The literature review was limited to the last four years to obtain the most recent data. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a 2-year perspective, and risk factors of reintervention were considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that drug-coated balloons were generally more efficient than bare metal stents, particularly for patients with higher risk of reintervention (up to CAD$1686 per patient TASC II C or D). Compared with uncoated balloons, results indicated that drug-coated balloons were more efficient if the reintervention rate associated with uncoated balloons is very high and for patients with higher risk of reintervention (up to CAD$3301 per patient).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe higher a patient's risk of reintervention, the higher the savings associated with the use of a drug-coated balloon will be. For patients at lower risk, the uncoated balloon strategy is still recommended as a first choice for endovascular intervention.",
