        "title": "Combination thymosin alpha 1 and lymphoblastoid interferon treatment in chronic hepatitis C.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C using interferon (IFN) results in a very small proportion of patients exhibiting a sustained response. Clinical trials assessing the benefit of combination drug therapy may provide evidence of improved treatment response over that seen with single drug treatment. AIM: To assess the response in patients with chronic hepatitis C to one year of combination treatment: thymosin alpha 1 (T alpha 1), 1 mg twice weekly, and lymphoblastoid (L)-IFN, 3 MU thrice weekly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with serum HCV RNA positive chronic hepatitis C were studied. Eleven patients were treatment naive and four had failed previous standard IFN therapy. Thirteen patients were HCV RNA serotype 1b. All patients were given combination T alpha 1 and L-IFN therapy for one year with a six month follow up period. RESULTS: Six months after initiation of treatment seven patients (47%) were sera HCV RNA negative and at completion of the one year treatment 11 (73%), including two who had failed previous standard IFN treatment, had negative serum HCV RNA. Six months after treatment, six patients (40%), including five with HCV type 1b, showed a sustained response characterized by a negative serum HCV RNA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this open label trial suggest that there may be a potential benefit to combining an immune modulator (T alpha 1) with an antiviral (IFN) in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Verification of the observations in this study require completion of a randomised controlled study.",

        "title": "Factors Affecting Treatment Responses to Interferon-\u03b1 in Chronic Hepatitis C",
        "abstract": "Parameters have been studied to predict responses to interferon (IFN) therapy for chronic hepatitis C, but the definition of a response, the times at which responses were assessed, and the pretreatment parameters considered differ markedly from study to study. Thus, 113 patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated 3-6 months with 3 MU of IFN-alpha 2a three times a week and assessed for pretreatment parameters predictive of responses to IFN. In a multivariate analysis, a biochemical response (normal aminotransferase activity) at the end of treatment was significantly associated with low body weight, normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and a pretreatment hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype other than 1. Six months after the end of treatment, a low virus burden and a lack of anti-HCV IgM core antibodies were independently associated with sustained virologic response (i.e., normal aminotransferase activity and HCV RNA negativity). Therefore, these pretreatment parameters should be taken into account when individual treatment protocols are designed.",
