        "abstract": "Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are the two recognized major presentations of microscopic colitis. Both diseases present with chronic watery diarrhea and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the colonic mucosa without specific endoscopic abnormalities, and hence diagnosis is established by histology. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that microscopic colitis may affect as many patients as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The cause of these diseases is unknown; however, several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of mucosal injury from an unknown agent in the fecal stream. Due to the lack of disease causality, therapeutic management of microscopic colitis is now directed primarily at symptoms' resolution or improvement. Based on current evidence, oral budesonide represents an effective treatment option for patients with microscopic colitis to achieve and maintain remission. Other anti-inflammatory drugs such as mesalazine or bismuth subsalicylate are now under evaluation. The optimal long-term management strategy of microscopic colitis, however, remains an unsolved issue.",

        "title": "Interventions for treating collagenous colitis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCollagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active collagenous colitis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nRelevant papers published between 1970 and January 2002 were identified via the MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nFour randomized trials were identified. One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), and 3 trials (2 published in abstract form only) studied budesonide in the therapy of collagenous colitis.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThere were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active drug were more likely to have clinical (p=0.003) and histological (p=0.003) improvement than those assigned to placebo. A total of 86 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 16.79 (95% CI 7.28-38.74), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is effective in the treatment of collagenous colitis. The evidence for bismuth subsalicylate is weaker, but still important. The roles of these and other therapies in inducing or maintaining remission (as opposed to clinical or histological improvement) of collagenous colitis are unknown.",
