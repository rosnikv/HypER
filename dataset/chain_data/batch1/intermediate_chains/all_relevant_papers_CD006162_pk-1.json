        "abstract": "Rimonabant is the first drug to target the endocannabinoid (CB) pathway by inhibiting the actions of anandamide and 2\u2010archidonyl\u2010glycerol on CB1 receptors. This review gives an overview of rimonabant and the CB system and how this system relates to obesity. Rimonabant blocks the central effects of this neurotransmitter pathway involved in obesity and weight control and also blocks the direct effects of CBs on adipocyte and hepatocyte metabolism. Blockade of CB1 receptors leads to a decrease in appetite and also has direct actions in adipose tissue and the liver to improve glucose, fat and cholesterol metabolism so improving insulin resistance, triglycerides and high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL\u2010C) and in some patients, blood pressure. The Rimonabant in Obesity (RIO) trials have shown that rimonabant induces weight loss >5% in 30\u201340% of patients and >10% in 10\u201320% above both a dietary run\u2010in and long\u2010term hypocaloric management over a 2\u2003year period with a low level of drug\u2010related side effects. Rimonabant therapy is associated with an extra 8\u201310% increase in HDL\u2010C and a 10\u201330% reduction in triglycerides and improvements in insulin resistance, glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and also adipokines and cytokines including C\u2010reactive protein over hypocaloric diet therapy. In addition rimonabant abolishes the weight gain associated with smoking cessation and improves the chances of quitting smoking. Thus rimonabant has major effects on both the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors thus has the potential to reduce the risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease associated with the cardiometabolic phenotype.",

        "title": "Effects of Rimonabant (SR141716) on Fasting-Induced Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis and Neuronal Activation in Lean and Obese Zucker Rats",
        "abstract": "The effects of the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) antagonist rimonabant on energy metabolism and fasting-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and neuronal activation were investigated. Lean and obese Zucker rats were treated orally with a daily dose of 10 mg/kg rimonabant for 14 days. A comprehensive energy balance profile based on whole-carcass analyses further demonstrated the potential of CB1 antagonists for decreasing energy gain through reducing food intake and potentially increasing brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Rimonabant also reduced plasma glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, which further confirms the ability of CB1 antagonists to improve insulin sensitivity. To test the hypothesis that rimonabant attenuates the effect of fasting on HPA axis activation in the obese Zucker model, rats were either ad libitum\u2013fed or food-deprived for 8 h. Contrary to expectation, rimonabant increased basal circulating corticosterone levels and enhanced the HPA axis response to food deprivation in obese rats. Rimonabant also exacerbated the neuronal activation seen in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) after short-term deprivation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that CB1 blockade does not prevent the hypersensitivity to food deprivation occurring at the level of HPA axis and ARC activation in the obese Zucker rats. This, however, does not prevent CB1 antagonism from exerting beneficial effects on energy and glucose metabolism.",

        "title": "The Endocannabinoid System as a Target for the Treatment of Visceral Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome",
        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 The endogenous cannabinoid system is a novel, remarkably elaborate physiological signaling system, comprising the recently identified endogenous cannabinoid ligands, their corresponding selective receptors, and the machinery of proteins and enzymes that is involved in their biosynthesis, release, transport, and degradation. This system extends widely in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery and exhibits a variety of actions implicated in vital functions (e.g., behavioral, antinociceptive, neuroprotective, immunosuppressive, cardiovascular, and metabolic). Particular interest has been focused on the apparent participation of endocannabinoids in metabolic homeostasis by modulating the activity of CNS circuits that control food intake and energy expenditure, the neuroendocrine response of the stress system, and the metabolic functions of crucial peripheral tissues, such as the adipose tissue, the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, and the skeletal muscles. These effects are predominantly CB1 receptor mediated and, thus, selective antagonists of this receptor subtype are being vigorously investigated as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of various metabolic derangements (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome). The first selective CB1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant, has already successfully completed phase III clinical trials as adjunctive obesity treatment, with significant improvements in several associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that led to the recent approval of its clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration.",

        "title": "Dysregulation of the Peripheral and Adipose Tissue Endocannabinoid System in Human Abdominal Obesity",
        "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system has been suspected to contribute to the association of visceral fat accumulation with metabolic diseases. We determined whether circulating endocannabinoids are related to visceral adipose tissue mass in lean, subcutaneous obese, and visceral obese subjects (10 men and 10 women in each group). We further measured expression of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) genes in paired samples of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in all 60 subjects. Circulating 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) was significantly correlated with body fat (r = 0.45, P = 0.03), visceral fat mass (r = 0.44, P = 0.003), and fasting plasma insulin concentrations (r = 0.41, P = 0.001) but negatively correlated to glucose infusion rate during clamp (r = 0.39, P = 0.009). In visceral adipose tissue, CB1 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with visceral fat mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.01), fasting insulin (r = 0.48, P < 0.001), and circulating 2-AG (r = 0.5, P < 0.001), whereas FAAH gene expression was negatively correlated with visceral fat mass (r = 0.39, P = 0.01) and circulating 2-AG (r = 0.77, P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that abdominal fat accumulation is a critical correlate of the dysregulation of the peripheral endocannabinoid system in human obesity. Thus, the endocannabinoid system may represent a primary target for the treatment of abdominal obesity and associated metabolic changes.",

        "abstract": "Obesity and being overweight are risk factors for kidney diseases. The spectrum ranges from glomerulomegaly with or without focal or segmental glomerulosclerosis, to diabetic nephropathy, to carcinoma of the kidney and nephrolithiasis. The first sign of renal injury is microalbuminuria or frank proteinuria, in particular in the presence of hypertension. The occurrence of microalbuminuria and/or chronic kidney insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) is related to the increasing number of components of the metabolic syndrome; that is, central obesity, elevated fasting blood glucose level, hypertriglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and hypertension. Obesity-associated renal disease should be prevented or retarded by weight reduction following lifestyle modification (salt restriction, hypocaloric diet, aerobic exercise) or eventually by antiobesity medication or bariatric surgery. Rimonabant, a new antiobesity medication, showed beneficial potential effect in treating clusters of metabolic syndrome, which may ultimately suggest potential benefit in treating obesity-related glomerulopathy.",

However, stimulation of cannabinoid receptors impacts on gastrointestinal functions in several other ways.

        "title": "The Endocannabinoid System as an Emerging Target of Pharmacotherapy",
        "abstract": "The recent identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid ligands has triggered an exponential growth of studies exploring the endocannabinoid system and its regulatory functions in health and disease. Such studies have been greatly facilitated by the introduction of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists and inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism and transport, as well as mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors or the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amidohydrolase. In the past decade, the endocannabinoid system has been implicated in a growing number of physiological functions, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in peripheral organs. More importantly, modulating the activity of the endocannabinoid system turned out to hold therapeutic promise in a wide range of disparate diseases and pathological conditions, ranging from mood and anxiety disorders, movement disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, to cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, obesity/metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, to name just a few. An impediment to the development of cannabinoid medications has been the socially unacceptable psychoactive properties of plant-derived or synthetic agonists, mediated by CB1 receptors. However, this problem does not arise when the therapeutic aim is achieved by treatment with a CB1 receptor antagonist, such as in obesity, and may also be absent when the action of endocannabinoids is enhanced indirectly through blocking their metabolism or transport. The use of selective CB2 receptor agonists, which lack psychoactive properties, could represent another promising avenue for certain conditions. The abuse potential of plant-derived cannabinoids may also be limited through the use of preparations with controlled composition and the careful selection of dose and route of administration. The growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials with compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system will probably result in novel therapeutic approaches in a number of diseases for which current treatments do not fully address the patients' need. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the current state of knowledge of the endocannabinoid system as a target of pharmacotherapy.",

        "title": "Management issues in the metabolic syndrome.",
        "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome is characterized by obesity, central obesity, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The major risk factors leading to this syndrome are physical inactivity and an atherogenic diet and cornerstone clinical feature is abdominal obesity or adiposity. In addition, patients usually have elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated LDL cholesterol, other abnormal lipid parameters, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood glucose. Impaired fibrinolysis, increased susceptibility to thrombotic events, and raised inflammatory markers are also observed. Given that India has the largest number of subjects with type-2 diabetes in the world it can be extrapolated that this country also has the largest number of patients with the metabolic syndrome. Epidemiological studies confirm a high prevalence. Therapeutic approach involves intervention at a macro-level and control of multiple risk factors using therapeutic lifestyle approaches (diet control and increased physical activity, pharmacotherapy - anti-obesity agents) for control of obesity and visceral obesity, and targeted approach for control of individual risk factors. Pharmacological therapy is a critical step in the management of patients with metabolic syndrome when lifestyle modifications fail to achieve the therapeutic goals. Anti-obesity drugs such as sibutramine and orlistat can be tried to reduce weight and central obesity and jointly control the metabolic syndrome components. Other than weight loss, there is no single best therapy and treatment should consist of treatment of individual components of the metabolic syndrome. Newer drugs such as the endocannabinoid receptor blocker,rimonabant, appear promising in this regard. Atherogenic dyslipidemia should be controlled initially with statins if there is an increase in LDL cholesterol. If there are other lipid abnormalities then combination therapy of statin with fibrates, nicotinic acid, or ezetimibe should be considered. For insulin resistance, drugs such as thiazolidinediones and renin-angiotensin system blockers are available. Available evidence suggests that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBS) may be more beneficial for treatment of hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome compared to others as these drugs also prevent development of diabetes. Patients with metabolic syndrome also have elevations in fibrinogen and other coagulation factors leading to prothrombotic state and aspirin may be beneficial for primary prevention in these patients. The new developments in the treatment of metabolic syndrome with drugs, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists and cannabinoid receptor-1 antagonists, will broaden the horizons of the current treatment options. Fixed-dose combination polypharmacy using a single pill is an interesting concept that needs to be evaluated in long-term prospective trials in such patients.",

Improvements in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have been reported in studies using dietary interventions combined with exercise. When weight loss is achieved primarily via pharmacological interventions, these benefits have not occurred quite so consistently.11\n\nReduced caloric intake and increased physical activity are generally accepted as the foundations of any approach directed at weight reduction, but these lifestyle interventions do not appear to provide long-lasting success for obese individuals wishing to lose weight.

Chronic treatment of adipocytes with insulin is accompanied by permanently elevated endocannabinoid signaling, whereas culturing of RIN-m5F beta-cells in high glucose transforms insulin down-regulation of endocannabinoid levels into up-regulation. Epididymal fat and pancreas from mice with diet-induced obesity contain higher endocannabinoid levels than lean mice. Patients with obesity or hyperglycemia caused by type 2 diabetes exhibit higher concentrations of endocannabinoids in visceral fat or serum, respectively, than the corresponding controls. CB(1) receptor stimulation increases lipid droplets and decreases adiponectin expression in adipocytes, and it increases intracellular calcium and insulin release in RIN-m5F beta-cells kept in high glucose.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPeripheral endocannabinoid overactivity might explain why CB(1) blockers cause weight-loss independent reduction of lipogenesis, of hypoadiponectinemia, and of hyperinsulinemia in obese animals and humans.",

All alternatives, except no treatment, were accompanied by lifestyle interventions. Treatment benefits included gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and reduced incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease (CHD). Drug acquisition cost was based on the average wholesale price of a comparator drug minus 15%. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the base-case results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne-year rimonabant and 1-year rimonabant followed by placebo were extensively dominated.

        "abstract": "The rising tide of obesity is one of the most pressing health issues of our time, yet existing medicines to combat the problem are disappointingly limited in number and effectiveness. Fortunately, a recent burgeoning of mechanistic insights into the neuroendocrine regulation of body weight provides an expanding list of molecular targets for novel, rationally designed antiobesity pharmaceuticals. In this review, we articulate a set of conceptual principles that we feel could help prioritize among these molecules in the development of obesity therapeutics, based on an understanding of energy homeostasis. We focus primarily on central targets, highlighting selected strategies to stimulate endogenous catabolic signals or inhibit anabolic signals. Examples of the former approach include methods to enhance central leptin signaling through intranasal leptin delivery, use of superpotent leptin-receptor agonists, and mechanisms to increase leptin sensitivity by manipulating SOCS-3, PTP-1B, ciliary neurotrophic factor, or simply by first losing weight with traditional interventions. Techniques to augment signaling by neurochemical mediators of leptin action that lie downstream of at least some levels of obesity-associated leptin resistance include activation of melanocortin receptors or 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptors. We also describe strategies to inhibit anabolic molecules, such as neuropeptide Y, melanin-concentrating hormone, ghrelin, and endocannabinoids. Modulation of gastrointestinal satiation and hunger signals is discussed as well. As scientists continue to provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms governing body weight, the future looks bright for development of new and better antiobesity medications to be used with diet and exercise to facilitate substantial weight loss.",

Adipose tissue endocannabinoids may produce metabolic and endocrine effects, but very few data are available in human adipose tissue and in primary human fat cells.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nWe measured expression of type 1 and type 2 cannabinoid receptors (CNR), enzymes of cannabinoids synthesis and degradation in human omental, sc abdominal, and gluteal adipose tissue from lean and obese subjects. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of CNR1 stimulation on glucose uptake and intracellular transduction mechanisms in primary human adipocytes. Then we assessed the reciprocal regulation between CNR1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). Finally, we tested whether leptin and adiponectin are regulated by CNR1 in human adipocytes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that most genes of the endocannabinoid system are down-regulated in gluteal fat and up-regulated in visceral and sc abdominal adipose tissue of obese patients. Treatment of adipocytes with rosiglitazone markedly down-regulated CNR1 expression, whereas Win 55,212 up-regulated PPARgamma. Win 55,212 increased (+50%) glucose uptake, the translocation of glucose transporter 4, and intracellular calcium in fat cells. All these effects were inhibited by SR141716 and wortmannin and by removing extracellular calcium. Win 55,212 and SR141716 had no effect on expression of adiponectin and leptin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results indicate a role for the local endocannabinoids in the regulation of glucose metabolism in human adipocytes and suggest a role in channeling excess energy fuels to adipose tissue in obese humans.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is usually associated with a number of metabolic and cardiovascular (or cardiometabolic) risk factors that contribute to a high rate of vascular events in these patients. Adipose tissue is now known to secrete a number of pro-inflammatory adipokines that are thought to mediate the link between obesity, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. Therefore, not only is abdominal obesity a major cardiometabolic risk factor per se, it has the potential to give rise to other emerging risk factors. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, may provide additional information to guide management and may even represent therapeutic targets. Reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with Type 2 diabetes will involve targeting traditional risk factors and probably novel cardiometabolic factors.",

        "abstract": "Although rimonabant has been approved for use in several countries, the Food and Drug Administration has expressed concern about the potential for adverse neurologic and psychiatric effects, considering the widespread distribution of CB1 receptors in the brain. While more research is clearly needed, the clinical evidence shows that CB1-receptor blockade with rimonabant improves multiple cardiovascular and metabolic variables, including body weight and waist circumference, HDL-C, triglycerides, and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, these effects, which are probably mediated by both peripheral and central actions in the ECS, appear to be greater than the improvements that would be expected from weight loss alone. There are multiple ongoing and planned studies with rimonabant as well as several other CB-receptor blockers (e.g., taranabant, CP-945,598). While diet and exercise are the cornerstones of cardiometabolic risk-factor reduction, improved pharmacotherapies are urgently needed.

We summarize the available experimental and clinical data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe ECS is composed of two 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, endogenous cannabinoid ligands (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol), and the enzymes that synthesize and break down the ligands. Understanding the role of the ECS in central and peripheral metabolic processes related to the regulation of food intake and energy balance as well as the endocrine role of excess adipose tissue, particularly visceral adipose tissue, and its promotion of global cardiometabolic risk has led to the development of pharmacologic agents with potential for blockade of CB1 receptors. In several studies, rimonabant (20 mg daily) demonstrated a favorable effect on various risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and measures of inflammation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe ECS has been shown to have a key role in the regulation of energy balance, and modulation of this system may affect multiple cardiometabolic risk factors.

On the other hand, a sustained weight loss of 5-10% in the obese confers marked health benefits. Current strategies for the management of obesity include lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy. At present, three drugs are approved for the medical management of obesity in the UK : orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant. All three agents are efficacious in reducing body weight but by different mechanisms. Although weight loss is an important treatment outcome, a major goal of obesity management should be to improve cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in order to reduce obesity-related morbidity and mortality.

Addition of anti-obesity drugs allows keeping the weight loss during years and improving obesity-related comorbidities. Methods This review is an actualisation on efficacy, safety and tolerability of the approved drugs on the long-term treatment of obesity (orlistat and sibutramine). New indications and effects of their use far beyond the weight loss are as well commented. Finally, potential benefits of the administration of CB1 antagonist rimonabant on the weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors are analysed in detail. Discussion A decade of experience on the use of orlistat and sibutramine has demonstrated their higher efficacy on the weight loss when compared to placebo either on adult or teenage population as well as safety and tolerability on long-term administration. Beneficial effects on the lipid profile, glycosilated haemoglobin on diabetic patients, blood pressure and levels of inflammatory cytokines, contribute to decrease the cardiovascular risk on obese patients. Phase III clinical trials using rimonabant show additional benefits to the expected weight loss, mainly reducing visceral fat and cardiometabolic risk factors. Conclusion Pharmacological treatment of obesity must be considered as a therapeutical tool that has to be used together with long-term lifestyle changes, contributing to the body weight reduction as well as to the improvement of the cardiometabolic risk related to obesity.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity and overweight affect over 1 billion people worldwide and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Clinical features of obesity converge with those of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, greatly increasing the risk of long-term adverse outcomes. Aims: To review the evidence on rimonabant, a novel CB1 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of obese and overweight patients. Evidence review: There is clear evidence that rimonabant 20 mg/day in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet causes a mean weight loss of 4.6 kg in obese and overweight patients after 1 year\u2019s treatment, with approximately 50% of patients achieving a weight loss of \u22655%. One study demonstrated that weight loss is maintained for up to 2 years. The drug also improves lipid and glycemic cardiovascular risk factors, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and insulin resistance, and reduces waist circumference, thus reducing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Treatment of obese and overweight diabetic patients with rimonabant decreases glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), including patients previously untreated for diabetes. The effect of rimonabant appears to be partly independent of weight loss. Rimonabant 20 mg/day is generally well tolerated, with mild to moderate transient adverse effects including nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and anxiety. Approximately 14% of patients receiving rimonabant 20 mg/day discontinued due to adverse effects, primarily depressed mood, although overall rates of depression did not differ significantly compared with placebo. Place in therapy: The evidence supports the use of rimonabant 20 mg/day along with dietary modification to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in obese and overweight patients, including those with diabetes. The drug is contraindicated in patients receiving antidepressants. Long-term data on cardiovascular outcomes, morbidity, and mortality are eagerly awaited.",

        "abstract": "Obesity, the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiometabolic risk are increasing at epidemic rates worldwide. Without interventions, the healthcare ramifications and costs of this epidemic will be astronomical. Current available treatment modalities have demonstrated limited effectiveness to deal with this metabolic epidemic. A novel metabolic pathway, the endocannabinoid system, plays a significant and direct role in appetite regulation, glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Activation of the endocannabinoid system increases hunger and decreases satiety, and promotes insulin resistance and lipogenesis. Studies indicate that the endocannabinoid system is chronically activated in abdominal obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, blockade of the endocannabiniod receptor type-1 improves multiple cardiometabolic parameters and may represent a potential mechanism to combat obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other cardiometabolic risks. Rimonabant, a novel agent, blocks the endocannabinoid-receptor type 1, and results in weight loss, decreases in abdominal adiposity, improvement in glucose and lipid homeostasis and decreases components of the metabolic syndrome. It is the first therapeutic agent that inhibits the endocannabiniod system and improves multiple cardiometabolic parameters.",

        "abstract": "To the Editor: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a chronic liver disease characterized by insulin resistance, accumulation of hepatic fat and hepatocellular necroinflammation, has been recognized as a leading cause of (cryptogenic) liver cirrhosis in developed countries. The pathogenesis of NASH has been tightly linked to the presence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), both of which have become increasingly prevalent over the recent decades (1, 2). Current treatment regiments for NASH include lifestyle modification (diet, increased physical activity) as well as pharmacological interventions aiming to improve insulin sensitivity, such as metformin of thiazolidinediones. However, given the rising incidence of NASH and the limitations associated with current treatment strategies (lack of adherence to dietary regimens, side effects of metformin or glitazone treatment), novel therapeutic approaches are warranted. The endocannabinoid (EC) system is a physiological network implicated in appetite control and energy homeostasis. Thus, an over-activity of the EC system leads to excessive caloric intake and obesity, whereas antagonizing cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors using the selective CB1 blocker rimonabant reduces food consumption and body weight over longer treatment periods (3, 4). In addition to these central nervous effects, rimonabant treatment has led to significant improvements in lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (5\u20137). Owing to these pleiotropic metabolic effects, the drug has been widely used for the treatment of obesity, dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes. Because the CB1 receptor is also present in the liver, where it enhances the expression of the lipogenic transcription factors (8, 9), antagonizing the EC system might also attenuate the phenotype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Based on these considerations, we examined the effects of rimonabant of hepatic and metabolic functions in a patient with NASH.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate in fed Wistar rats whether the cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor antagonist AVE1625 causes primary effects on metabolic blood and tissue parameters as well as metabolic rate, which are independent of reduced caloric intake. After single administration to rats postprandially, AVE1625 caused a slight dose-dependent increase in basal lipolysis. Six hours after single administration, liver glycogen content was dose-dependently reduced to approximately 60% of that of untreated controls. These findings demonstrate a primary acute effect of AVE1625 on induction of 1) lipolysis from fat tissue (increased FFA) and 2) glycogenolysis from the liver (reduced hepatic glycogen). Measured by indirect calorimetry, AVE1625 caused an immediate increase in total energy expenditure, a long-lasting increase of fat oxidation, and a transient increase of glucose oxidation, which were consistent with the acute findings on metabolic blood and tissue parameters. We conclude that, in addition to the well-investigated effects of CB1 receptor antagonists to reduce caloric intake and subsequently body weight, this pharmacological approach is additionally linked to inherently increased lipid oxidation. This oxidation is driven by persistently increased lipolysis from fat tissues, independently of reduced caloric intake, and might significantly contribute to the weight-reducing effect.",

We report that oral treatment of obese (fa/fa) rats with rimonabant (30 mg/kg) daily for 8 weeks abolished hepatic steatosis. This treatment reduced hepatomegaly, reduced elevation of plasma levels of enzyme markers of hepatic damage (alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) and decreased the high level of local hepatic TNF\u03b1 currently associated with steatohepatitis.

        "title": "Food energy efficiency, cannabinoids, and a slow death of the weight loss dogma",
        "abstract": "Weight loss is achieved by simply burning more calories through physical activity than are consumed, at least according to a commonly counseled dogma that seems to be solidly based on thermodynamic principles. The beauty of this simplicity not withstanding, biological systems are rarely so simple. Mounting evidence from more than 2 decades of research has shown that the energy efficiency of consumed food is in fact modulated and energy consumed in the form of food calories can be lost by seemingly futile wastage not taken into account in the current simplistic paradigm. Much attention has been given to the roles of uncoupling proteins in such energy wastage, but now increasing attention is also being given to the role of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling system as a major regulator of food energy efficiency. Cannabis use spans more than 5 millennia of written history, yet discussions of its value in modern medicine continue to evoke a spectrum of opinions and emotions that is arguably unmatched by any other member of the natural pharmacopoeia. Historically used to treat a diversity of ailments, the active ingredients of cannabis plants were isolated in the late nineteenth century, and the primary psychoactive component was identified as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol by Gaoni and Mechoulam in 1964.1 Debate ensued as to its mechanism of action, but the issue was settled with the discovery of a cannabinoid receptor by Allyn Horvath working at Saint Louis University in 1988.2 Its primary function in retrograde presynaptic regulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system was soon discovered (Fig. 1). The fact that the cannabinoid receptor CB1 is the most abundant G protein\u2013coupled receptor in the brain provides some hints as to its importance in global neurological function. The other characterized receptor, CB2, appears to be restricted to cells of the immune system. The early work describing the functions of CB1 has now been further expanded by recent studies describing important functions of this receptor outside the central nervous system that play a major role in regulating energy efficiency. Although the discovery of cannabinoid signaling was driven by the need to understand the psychopharmacology of Cannabis sativa, the finding of specific receptors suggested the presence of endogenous ligands.3 Such ligands, or endocannabinoids (ECs), are locally synthesized arachidonic acid derivatives originating from membrane phospholipids that are rapidly degraded near their sites of action.4 The 2 most studied ECs are the respective ester and amide of arachidonic acid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and arachidonyl ethanolamide (AEA, anandamide). In the central nervous system, these are synthesized on demand by postsynaptic neurons from membrane phospholipids via diacylglycerol lipase and phospholipase D, respectively. ECs bind CB1 receptors on presynaptic neurons to activate G protein signaling cascades that include activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphoinositide-3 kinases, calcium signaling and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 1). Degradation of ECs requires reuptake and destruction by enzymes such as fatty acid amide hydrolase in the case of 2-AG.5 How endocannabinoid signaling is mediated outside the central nervous system has not been similarly elucidated, but 2-AG is a major monoacylglycerol in rat liver.6 The history of cannabis use provides ample evidence that cannabinoids are potent appetite stimulants. Endocannabinoid signaling tonically activates hypothalamic CB1 receptors to maintain food intake7 and it interacts with opiate signaling pathways and reward centers in the central nervous system to increase the hedonic desire for pleasurable foods in particular.4,8 Based on the role of EC signaling in eating behaviors, rimonabant in obesity (RIO) trials were carried out in Europe and North America to determine if the cannabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant (SR141716A)4,9 would be an effective treatment of obesity when given for 2 years.10,11 In the first year of RIO-Europe, subjects lost weight and the major side effects were nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, and arthralgias, whereas depression was the most common reason for drug cessation in both the treatment and placebo groups. The final report of this 2-year trial has not yet been published. The RIO-North America trial of 3045 subjects was weakened by a 49% dropout rate, but it demonstrated similar weight loss and improved metabolic abnormaliAbbreviations: 2-AG, arachidonoyl glycerol; AEA, anandamide; EC, endocannabinoid; RIO, rimonabant in obesity; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

Treatment with the cannabinoid type 1 receptor blocker, rimonabant, reduces body weight in obese individuals.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene encoding cannabinoid type 1 receptor, CNR1, are associated with body fat mass and distribution in two independent samples of white European adult men.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe 3813A/G and 4895A/G single nucleotide polymorphisms at the exon 4 of CNR1 were genotyped in 930 participants to the Olivetti Prospective Heart Study (OPHS) in Southern Italy and in 216 participants to the Wandsworth Heart and Stroke Study in the United Kingdom. Retrospective analysis was also performed on an OPHS subsample (n = 360) for which anthropometric data from 1987 and 1994-1995 examinations were available.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nCNR1 genotypes and anthropometric measures of body fat distribution were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the OPHS study, the 3813G allele was associated with increased subscapular skinfold thickness (24.2 +/- 9.1 vs. 22.8 +/- 7.7 mm; P = 0.031) and waist circumference (WC) (99.1 +/- 8.8 vs. 97.7 +/- 8.8 cm; P = 0.050). No association was observed with 4895A/G variant. Haplotype analysis confirmed that the unique haplotype carrying the 3813G was associated with increased WC and subscapular skinfold thickness. Similar results were observed in the OPHS retrospective subsample and the Wandsworth Heart and Stroke Study sample. In the latter, the 3813G was associated with increased WC (96.8 +/- 11.3 vs. 91.6 +/- 10.4 cm; P = 0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGenetic variants at CNR1 are associated with obesity-related phenotypes in men. The detection of polymorphic variants in genes involved in the process of fat accumulation may help identify specific targets for pharmacological treatment of obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptors (CBR) are located on cholinergic neurons in the brain stem, stomach, and colon. CBR stimulation inhibits motility in rodents. Effects in humans are unclear. Dronabinol (DRO), a nonselective CBR agonist, inhibits colonic motility and sensation. The aim of this study was to compare effects of DRO and placebo (PLA) on colonic motility and sensation in healthy volunteers. Fifty-two volunteers were randomly assigned (double-blind) to a single dose of 7.5 mg DRO or PLA postoperative with concealed allocation. A balloon-manometric assembly placed into the descending colon allowed assessment of colonic compliance, motility, tone, and sensation before and 1 h after oral ingestion of medication, and during fasting, and for 1 h after 1,000-kcal meal. There was an overall significant increase in colonic compliance (P = 0.045), a borderline effect of relaxation in fasting colonic tone (P = 0.096), inhibition of postprandial colonic tone (P = 0.048), and inhibition of fasting and postprandial phasic pressure (P = 0.008 and 0.030, respectively). While DRO did not significantly alter thresholds for first gas or pain sensation, there was an increase in sensory rating for pain during random phasic distensions at all pressures tested and in both genders (P = 0.024). In conclusion, in humans the nonselective CBR agonist, DRO, relaxes the colon and reduces postprandial colonic motility and tone. Increase in sensation ratings to distension in the presence of relaxation of the colon suggests central modulation of perception. The potential for CBR to modulate colonic motor function in diarrheal disease such as irritable bowel syndrome deserves further study.",

        "abstract": "The cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) has been implicated in the control of energy balance. To explore the pharmacological utility of CB1R inhibition for the treatment of obesity, we evaluated the efficacy of N-[(1S,2S)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(3-cyanophenyl)-1-methylpropyl]-2-methyl-2-{[5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]oxy}propanamide (MK-0364) and determined the relationship between efficacy and brain CB1R occupancy in rodents. MK-0364 was shown to be a highly potent CB1R inverse agonist that inhibited the binding and functional activity of various agonists with a binding Ki of 0.13 nM for the human CB1R in vitro. MK-0364 dose-dependently inhibited food intake and weight gain, with an acute minimum effective dose of 1 mg/kg in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. CB1R mechanism-based effect was demonstrated for MK-0364 by its lack of efficacy in CB1R-deficient mice. Chronic treatment of DIO rats with MK-0364 dose-dependently led to significant weight loss with a minimum effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg (p.o.), or a plasma Cmax of 87 nM. Weight loss was accompanied by the loss of fat mass. Partial occupancy (30\u201340%) of brain CB1R by MK-0364 was sufficient to reduce body weight. The magnitude of weight loss was correlated with brain CB1R occupancy. The partial receptor occupancy requirement for efficacy was also consistent with the reduced food intake of the heterozygous mice carrying one disrupted allele of CB1R gene compared with the wild-type mice. These studies demonstrated that MK-0364 is a highly potent and selective CB1R inverse agonist and that it is orally active in rodent models of obesity.",

As demonstrated in large clinical trials of 2 to 4 years' duration, these medications significantly increase weight loss compared with placebo; weight loss with these drugs reaches a nadir between 20 and 28 weeks; weight loss, averaged 8%-10%, with the placebo contributing 4%-6% of that. Weight maintenance is demonstrated as long as adherence to medication continues. All medications have side effects that need to be considered. For sibutramine, there is a rise in blood pressure and heart rate that may require discontinuation of the drug in a small percent of patients. For orlistat, steatorrhea produces the principal gastrointestinal side effects. Rimonabant appears to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms are the chief tolerability issue, but they are usually self-limited.

Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide produced by the stomach, which appears to act as a meal initiator. Satiety signals derived from the intestine and pancreas include peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide 1, oxyntomodulin, and cholecystokinin.

Basic research has demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system plays an integral role in the regulation of food intake, metabolism, and storage. Research with the endocannabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in body weight, fasting insulin levels, glucose tolerance, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, serum triglyceride levels, and waist circumference, compared with placebo. Rimonabant has also produced statistically significant improvements in inflammatory markers. Research with rimonabant has demonstrated sustained efficacy for as long as 2 years when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and moderate physical activity. Rimonabant is the first cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist to be marketed in Europe and the first to file an New Drug Application in the United States.

        "abstract": "Background: Since the purification of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 40 years ago, many studies have concluded that the endocannabinoid system is one of the most important orexigenic systems in the body. Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipids capable of activating the two cannabinoid receptors, CB type 1 (CB1) and CB type 2. These receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled family receptors and they were discovered while investigating the molecular mode of action of THC, to which they bind with high affinity. Endogenous cannabinoids stimulate hunger and promote appetite through activation of the CB1 receptors. The CB1 receptor is expressed in several organs that are involved at both the central and peripheral level in the control of food intake and energy metabolism. These organs include the mesolimbic system, hypothalamus, gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, hepatocytes and endocrine cells of the pancreas. The endocannabinoid system is believed to play a crucial role in controlling energy balance through the possible targeting of a large variety of peripheral organs while modulating metabolic processes. Conclusions: To better understand the effects of the endocannabinoid system, future studies will require detailed charac- terization of each individual contribution and the reciprocal interactions among the organs. Because the endocannabinoid system is likely overactivated in conditions such as obesity, pharmacologic therapy with a CB1 receptor antagonist like rimonabant might normalize the imbalance induced by this overactivation and produce a viable option in the fight against obesity and its associated comorbid conditions.",

        "abstract": "Summary Rimonabant, the first selective CB-1 receptor blocker, is expected to reduce cardiometabolic risk substantially. This study assesses the economics of such treatment in patients at elevated cardiometabolic risk. A Markov model was developed using data from the Rimonabant in Obesity (RIO) trial, published risk equations, and UK cost and utility data. Patients begin either in a diabetic or a non-diabetic state and can transition to cardiovascular disease or to death (based on UK life tables). Transitions to diabetes and subsequent cardiovascular events are also counted. Resource use due to events and long-term management were translated to UK costs (2005 GBP). Tariffs for events and states were applied to age-dependent utilities. Extensive univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Over 10 years, 8% will suffer a cardiovascular event with a loss of more than 1,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a cost of more than \u00a3500,000 per 1,000 patients. Projecting risk for a lifetime, 1 year of rimonabant use is estimated to gain >65 QALYs at \u00a38,574/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied from \u00a32,657 to \u00a322,141/QALY.
