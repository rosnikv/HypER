            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nPrevious studies of testosterone supplementation in HIV-infected men failed to demonstrate improvement in muscle strength. The effects of resistance exercise combined with testosterone supplementation in HIV-infected men are unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of testosterone replacement with and without resistance exercise on muscle strength and body composition in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels and weight loss.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nPlacebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from September 1995 to July 1998 at a general clinical research center.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nSixty-one HIV-infected men aged 18 to 50 years with serum testosterone levels of less than 12.1 nmol/L (349 ng/dL) and weight loss of 5% or more in the previous 6 months, 49 of whom completed the study.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: placebo, no exercise (n = 14); testosterone enanthate (100 mg/wk intramuscularly), no exercise (n = 17); placebo and exercise (n = 15); or testosterone and exercise (n = 15). Treatment duration was 16 weeks.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nChanges in muscle strength, body weight, thigh muscle volume, and lean body mass compared among the 4 treatment groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBody weight increased significantly by 2.6 kg (P<.001) in men receiving testosterone alone and by 2.2 kg (P = .02) in men who exercised alone but did not change in men receiving placebo alone (-0.5 kg; P = .55) or testosterone and exercise (0.7 kg; P = .08). Men treated with testosterone alone, exercise alone, or both experienced significant increases in maximum voluntary muscle strength in leg press (range, 22%-30%), leg curls (range, 18%-36%), bench press (range, 19%-33%), and latissimus pulls (range, 17%-33%). Gains in strength in all exercise categories were greater in men assigned to the testosterone-exercise group or to the exercise-alone group than in those assigned to the placebo-alone group. There was a greater increase in thigh muscle volume in men receiving testosterone alone (mean change, 40 cm3; P<.001 vs zero change) or exercise alone (62 cm3; P = .003) than in men receiving placebo alone (5 cm3; P = .70). Average lean body mass increased by 2.3 kg (P = .004) and 2.6 kg (P<.001), respectively, in men who received testosterone alone or testosterone and exercise but did not change in men receiving placebo alone (0.9 kg; P = .21). Hemoglobin levels increased in men receiving testosterone but not in those receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data suggest that testosterone and resistance exercise promote gains in body weight, muscle mass, muscle strength, and lean body mass in HIV-infected men with weight loss and low testosterone levels. Testosterone and exercise together did not produce greater gains than either intervention alone.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review the preclinical and clinical literature relevant to the efficacy and safety of anabolic androgen steroid therapy for palliative treatment of severe weight loss associated with chronic diseases. Data sources were published literature identified from the Medline database from January 1966 to December 2000, bibliographic references, and textbooks. Reports from preclinical and clinical trials were selected. Study designs and results were extracted from trial reports. Statistical evaluation or meta-analysis of combined results was not attempted. Androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) are widely prescribed for the treatment of male hypogonadism; however, they may play a significant role in the treatment of other conditions as well, such as cachexia associated with human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, burns, renal and hepatic failure, and anemia associated with leukemia or kidney failure. A review of the anabolic effects of androgens and their efficacy in the treatment of these conditions is provided. In addition, the numerous and sometimes serious side effects that have been known to occur with androgen use are reviewed. Although the threat of various side effects is present, AAS therapy appears to have a favorable anabolic effect on patients with chronic diseases and muscle catabolism. We recommend that AAS can be used for the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting and in severely catabolic patients with severe burns. Preliminary data in renal failure-associated wasting are also positive. Advantages and disadvantages should be weighed carefully when comparing AAS therapy to other weight-gaining measures. Although a conservative approach to the use of AAS in patients with chronic diseases is still recommended, the utility of AAS therapy in the attenuation of severe weight loss associated with disease states such as cancer, postoperative recovery, and wasting due to pulmonary and hepatic disease should be more thoroughly investigated.",

            "abstract": "Ribosomopathies are a group of rare diseases in which genetic mutations cause defects in either ribosome biogenesis or function, given specific phenotypes. Ribosomal proteins, and multiple other factors that are necessary for ribosome biogenesis (rRNA processing, assembly of subunits, export to cytoplasm), can be affected in ribosomopathies. Despite the need for ribosomes in all cell types, these diseases result mainly in tissue-specific impairments. Depending on the type of ribosomopathy and its pathogenicity, there are many potential therapeutic targets. The present manuscript will review our knowledge of ribosomopathies, discuss current treatments, and introduce the new therapeutic perspectives based on recent research. Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia, currently treated with blood transfusion prior to steroids, could be managed with a range of new compounds, acting mainly on anemia, such as L-leucine. Treacher Collins syndrome could be managed by various treatments, but it has recently been shown that proteasomal inhibition by MG132 or Bortezomib may improve cranial skeleton malformations. Developmental defects resulting from ribosomopathies could be also treated pharmacologically after birth. It might thus be possible to treat certain ribosomopathies without using multiple treatments such as surgery and transplants. Ribosomopathies remain an open field in the search for new therapeutic approaches based on our recent understanding of the role of ribosomes and progress in gene therapy for curing genetic disorders.",

            "abstract": "Although expression of ribosomal protein L27 (RPL27) is upregulated in clinical colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue, to the best of our knowledge, the oncogenic role of RPL27 has not yet been defined. The present study aimed to investigate whether targeting RPL27 could alter CRC progression and determine whether RPL27 gains an extra-ribosomal function during CRC development. Human CRC cell lines HCT116 and HT29 were transfected with RPL27-specific small interfering RNA and proliferation was assessed in vitro and in vivo using proliferation assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and western blotting were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for RPL27 silencing-induced CRC phenotypical changes. Inhibiting RPL27 expression suppressed CRC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induced apoptotic cell death. Targeting RPL27 significantly inhibited growth of human CRC xenografts in nude mice. Notably, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which serves an important role in mitotic cell cycle progression and stemness, was downregulated in both HCT116 and HT29 cells following RPL27 silencing. RPL27 silencing reduced the levels of PLK1 protein and G2/M-associated regulators such as phosphorylated cell division cycle 25C, CDK1 and cyclin B1. Silencing of RPL27 reduced the migration and invasion abilities and sphere-forming capacity of the parental CRC cell population. In terms of phenotypical changes in cancer stem cells (CSCs), RPL27 silencing suppressed the sphere-forming capacity of the isolated CD133+ CSC population, which was accompanied by decreased CD133 and PLK1 levels. Taken together, these findings indicated that RPL27 contributed to the promotion of CRC proliferation and stemness via PLK1 signaling and RPL27 may be a useful target in a next-generation therapeutic strategy for both primary CRC treatment and metastasis prevention.",
