In some patients, attempts to discontinue corticosteroids are unsuccessful.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of weekly injections of methotrexate in patients who had chronically active Crohn's disease despite a minimum of three months of prednisone therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg once weekly) or placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 mg once a day), which was tapered over 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at the end of the 16-week trial. Remission was defined by the discontinuation of prednisone and a score of < or = 150 points on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 141 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to methotrexate (94 patients) or placebo (47 patients). After 16 weeks, 37 patients (39.4 percent) were in clinical remission in the methotrexate group, as compared with 9 patients (19.1 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.025; relative risk, 1.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 3.48). The patients in the methotrexate group received less prednisone overall than those in the placebo group (P = 0.026). The mean (+/- SE) score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index after 16 weeks of treatment was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (162 +/- 12) than in the placebo group (204 +/- 17, P = 0.002). The changes in quality-of-life scores and serum orosomucoid concentrations were similar. In the methotrexate group, 16 patients (17 percent) withdrew from treatment because of adverse events (including asymptomatic elevation of serum aminotransferase in 7 and nausea in 6), as compared with 1 patient (2 percent) in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a group of patients with chronically active Crohn's disease, methotrexate was more effective than placebo in improving symptoms and reducing requirements for prednisone.",

All had scores on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index between 220 and 400 (scores can range from 0 to about 600, with higher scores indicating more severe illness). Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single two-hour intravenous infusion of either placebo or cA2 in a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight, 10 mg per kilogram, or 20 mg per kilogram.

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impact of infliximab on early endoscopic lesions after resection for CD. Methods: Twenty\u2010six patients maintaining clinical remission (CD activity index [CDAI] score <150) with mesalamine (3 g/day) after resection showed endoscopic recurrence in the neoterminal ileum at 6 months postoperatively (=baseline). Over the following 6 months, 10 patients were treated with continuous mesalamine (3 g/day), 8 patients were treated with azathioprine therapy (50 mg/day), and the other 8 patients were treated with infliximab therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). During ileocolonoscopy at baseline and 6 months later, mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. Results: During 6\u2010month observation, no patients in the infliximab group, 3 (38%) in the azathioprine group, and 7 (70%) in the mesalamine group developed clinical recurrence (CDAI \u2265150) (P = 0.01).

The severity of lesions found at postoperative endoscopy is reported to be a strong predictive factor for future clinical recurrence. If endoscopic lesions in the early postoperative period can be reduced with medications, symptomatic recurrence will likely be delayed and decreased. Before the introduction of biologic therapies, various medications were used for the maintenance of clinical remission after surgery; however, few demonstrated consistent efficacy. Infliximab is a recombinant anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 antibody. Although infliximab is one of the most effective medications in the management of CD, its efficacy for early endoscopic lesions after surgery has not yet been assessed. The author and colleagues recently conducted a prospective study in order to investigate the impact of infliximab on early endoscopic lesions after resection for CD. We found that infliximab therapy showed clear suppressive effects on clinical and endoscopic disease activity in patients with early endoscopic lesions after resection.",

            "abstract": "AIM\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab in preventing recurrence after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease in high-risk patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted from June 2009 until June 2010. We consecutively included high-risk Crohn's disease patients who had undergone an ileal/ileocolonic resection. High-risk patients were defined as two or more criteria: smokers, penetrating pattern, one or more previous surgical resections or prior extensive resection. Subcutaneous adalimumab was administered 2 wk (\u00b1 5 d) after surgery at a dose of 40 mg eow, with an initial induction dose of 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2. Demographic data, previous and concomitant treatments (antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators or biologic therapies), smoking status at the time of diagnosis and after the index operation and number of previous resections (type and reason for surgery) were all recorded. Biological status was assessed with C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fecal calprotectin. One year (\u00b1 3 mo) after surgery, an ileocolonoscopy and/or magnetic resonance enterography was performed. Endoscopic recurrence was defined as Rutgeerts score \u2265 i2. Morphological recurrence was based on magnetic resonance (MR) score \u2265 MR1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-nine patients (55.2% males, 48.3% smokers at diagnosis and 13.8% after the index operation), mean age 42.3 years and mean duration of the disease 13.8 years were included in the study. A mean of 1.76 (range: 1-4) resections previous to adalimumab administration and in 37.9% was considered extensive resection. 51.7% had previously received infliximab. Immunomodulators were given concomitantly to 17.2% of patients. Four of the 29 (13.7%) developed clinical recurrence, 6/29 (20.7%) endoscopic recurrence and 7/19 (36.8%) morphological recurrence after 1-year. All patients with clinical recurrence showed endoscopic and morphological recurrence. A high degree of concordance was found between clinical-endoscopic recurrence (\u03ba = 0.76, P < 0.001) and clinical-morphological recurrence (\u03ba = 0.63, P = 0.003). Correlation between endoscopic and radiological findings was good (comparing the 5-point Rutgeerts score with the 4-point MR score, a score of i4 was classified as MR3, i3 as MR2, and i2-i1 as MR1) (P < 0.001, r(s) = 0.825). During follow-up, five (17.2%) patients needed adalimumab dose intensification (40 mg/wk); Mean time to intensification after the introduction of adalimumab treatment was 8 mo (range: 5 to 11 mo). In three cases (10.3%), a biological change was needed due to a worsening of the disease after the dose intensification to 40 mg/wk. One patient suffered an adverse event.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdalimumab seems to be effective and safe in preventing postoperative recurrence in a selected group of patients who had undergone an intestinal resection for their CD.",

            "title": "Postoperative Use of Anti-TNF-&agr; Agents in Patients with Crohn's Disease and Risk of Reoperation\u2014A Nationwide Cohort Study",
            "abstract": "Background:Approximately 80% of patients with Crohn's disease will require surgery. Surgery for Crohn's disease is not curative, and recurrence is typical. In this cohort study, based on nationwide Danish registries, we examined the association between postoperative treatment with anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor &agr; (anti-TNF-&agr;) agents and reoperation. Methods:The association was examined in cohort 1 = patients not treated with anti-TNF-&agr; agents within 6 months before operation, cohort 2 = patients treated with anti-TNF-&agr; agents within 6 months before operation. Within both cohorts, we defined postoperative exposure to anti-TNF-&agr; agents as at least 1 treatment within 6 months after the first operation and the reference cohorts were those not treated. Patients were followed from 6 months after operation and until 5 years. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to compute adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results:In cohort 1, 31 (1.3%) were treated with anti-TNF-&agr; agents within 6 months after operation and compared with those not treated, the adjusted hazard ratio of reoperation among those treated with anti-TNF-&agr; agents was 3.53 (95% confidence interval: 1.61\u20137.72). In cohort 2, 63 (16.3%) were treated with anti-TNF-&agr; agents within 6 months after operation, and the corresponding adjusted hazard ratio of reoperation was 2.16 (95% confidence interval: 1.11\u20134.18). Conclusions:Our data suggest that anti-TNF-&agr; treatment within 6 months after the first operation is not associated with a reduction in the need for subsequent operation. Uncontrolled confounding might have influenced our results, and, furthermore, future studies are warranted to clarify whether our study population is different from populations most often associated with postoperative anti-TNF-&agr; treatment.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with Crohn's disease experiencing endoscopic postoperative recurrence (POR) may benefit from antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents but scarce data on this are available. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of anti-TNF in improving mucosal lesions in patients with endoscopic POR. METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective, study of patients with Crohn's disease who underwent therapy with anti-TNF agents for endoscopic POR (Rutgeerts score > i1). Treatment outcomes were assessed by the findings in the last ileocolonoscopy performed after anti-TNF therapy was initiated. Endoscopic improvement and remission were defined as any reduction in the baseline Rutgeerts score and by a Rutgeerts score < i2, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients were included, 83 were treated with infliximab and 96 with adalimumab. Median time on anti-TNF therapy at the last endoscopic assessment was 31 months (interquartile range, 13\u201354). Endoscopic improvement was observed in 61%, including 42% who achieved endoscopic remission. Concomitant use of thiopurines and treatment with infliximab were associated with endoscopic improvement (odds ratio [OR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04\u20134.46; P = 0.03, and OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.18\u20134.62; P < 0.01, respectively) and endoscopic remission (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.65\u20136.05; P < 0.01, and OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05\u20133.88; P = 0.04, respectively) in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. These results were confirmed in a propensity-matched score analysis. DISCUSSION: In patients with endoscopic POR, anti-TNF agents improve mucosal lesions in almost two-thirds of the patients. In this setting, concomitant use of thiopurines and use of infliximab seem to be more effective in improving mucosal lesions.",

            "abstract": "Background A considerable proportion of Crohn\u2019s disease patients that undergo ileocecal resection (ICR) have failed anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy preoperatively. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of retreatment of anti-TNF therapy in patients with postoperative recurrence. Methods A real-world cohort study was performed on Crohn\u2019s disease patients who underwent primary ICR after anti-TNF therapy failure, and who were retreated with anti-TNF therapy for postoperative symptomatic Crohn\u2019s disease. The primary outcome was treatment failure (the need for (re)introduction of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or biologicals or the need for re-resection). Sub-analyses were performed on the nature of preoperative anti-TNF failure (primary non-response, secondary loss of response, intolerance), indication for ICR (refractory, stricturing, penetrating disease), combination therapy with immunomodulators, retreatment with the same anti-TNF agent and preoperative exposure to 1 vs. >1 anti-TNF agents. Results In total, 66 of 364 patients retreated with anti-TNF therapy following ICR. Cumulative rates of treatment failure at 1 and 2\u2009years were 28% and 47%. Treatment failure rate at 2 years was significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy as compared to anti-TNF monotherapy (30% vs. 49%, P\u2009=\u20090.02). No difference in treatment failure was found with regards to the nature of preoperative anti-TNF failure (P\u2009=\u20090.76), indication for ICR (P\u2009=\u20090.88) switch of anti-TNF agent (P\u2009=\u20090.55) agent, and preoperative exposure to 1 vs. >1 anti-TNF agents (P\u2009=\u20090.88). Conclusion Retreatment with anti-TNF therapy for postoperative Crohn\u2019s disease recurrence is a valid strategy after preoperative failure. Combination therapy is associated with a lower rate of treatment failure.",

            "abstract": "Background A considerable proportion of Crohn\u2019s disease patients that undergo ileocecal resection (ICR) have failed anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy preoperatively. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of retreatment of anti-TNF therapy in patients with postoperative recurrence. Methods A real-world cohort study was performed on Crohn\u2019s disease patients who underwent primary ICR after anti-TNF therapy failure, and who were retreated with anti-TNF therapy for postoperative symptomatic Crohn\u2019s disease. The primary outcome was treatment failure (the need for (re)introduction of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or biologicals or the need for re-resection). Sub-analyses were performed on the nature of preoperative anti-TNF failure (primary non-response, secondary loss of response, intolerance), indication for ICR (refractory, stricturing, penetrating disease), combination therapy with immunomodulators, retreatment with the same anti-TNF agent and preoperative exposure to 1 vs. >1 anti-TNF agents. Results In total, 66 of 364 patients retreated with anti-TNF therapy following ICR. Cumulative rates of treatment failure at 1 and 2\u2009years were 28% and 47%. Treatment failure rate at 2 years was significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy as compared to anti-TNF monotherapy (30% vs. 49%, P\u2009=\u20090.02). No difference in treatment failure was found with regards to the nature of preoperative anti-TNF failure (P\u2009=\u20090.76), indication for ICR (P\u2009=\u20090.88) switch of anti-TNF agent (P\u2009=\u20090.55) agent, and preoperative exposure to 1 vs. >1 anti-TNF agents (P\u2009=\u20090.88). Conclusion Retreatment with anti-TNF therapy for postoperative Crohn\u2019s disease recurrence is a valid strategy after preoperative failure. Combination therapy is associated with a lower rate of treatment failure.",
