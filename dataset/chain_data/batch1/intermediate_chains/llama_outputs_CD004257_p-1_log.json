            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose.",

The 9411 case patients were newly started on an antihypertensive medication between November 1981 and February 1990. A similar number of controls were randomly selected among other enrollees.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy in patients using NSAIDs relative to nonusers, after adjusting for age, sex, race, nursing home residence, number of prescriptions filled, intensity of physician utilization, and days hospitalized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe adjusted odds ratio for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy for recent NSAID users compared with nonusers was 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 1.80). The odds ratio increased with increasing daily NSAID dose: the adjusted odds ratio for users of low average daily doses relative to nonusers was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.74), that for medium-dose users was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.44 to 1.87), and that for high-dose users was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.62 to 2.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUse of NSAIDs may increase the risk for initiation of antihypertensive therapy in older persons. Given the high prevalence of NSAID use by elderly persons, this association may have important public health implications for the management of hypertension in the older population.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether there is an increased risk for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy in older persons prescribed nonaspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n\nDESIGN\nCase-control study.\n\n\nSETTING\nNew Jersey Medicaid program.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nMedicaid enrollees aged 65 years and older. The 9411 case patients were newly started on an antihypertensive medication between November 1981 and February 1990. A similar number of controls were randomly selected among other enrollees.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy in patients using NSAIDs relative to nonusers, after adjusting for age, sex, race, nursing home residence, number of prescriptions filled, intensity of physician utilization, and days hospitalized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe adjusted odds ratio for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy for recent NSAID users compared with nonusers was 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 1.80). The odds ratio increased with increasing daily NSAID dose: the adjusted odds ratio for users of low average daily doses relative to nonusers was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.74), that for medium-dose users was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.44 to 1.87), and that for high-dose users was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.62 to 2.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUse of NSAIDs may increase the risk for initiation of antihypertensive therapy in older persons. Given the high prevalence of NSAID use by elderly persons, this association may have important public health implications for the management of hypertension in the older population.",

            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nAlthough clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy, little is known about how these drugs are prescribed or used in the general population.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo estimate predictors of persistence with therapy for lipid-lowering drug regimens in typical populations of patients in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cohort study defining all prescriptions filled for lipid-lowering drugs during 1 year, as well as patients' demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n\nSETTING\nNew Jersey's Medicaid and Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs and Quebec's provincial medical care program.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nAll continuously enrolled patients older than 65 years who filled 1 or more prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs (N = 5611 in the US programs, and N = 1676 drawn from a 10% sample in Quebec).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nProportion of days during the study year for which patients had filled prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs; predictors of good vs poor persistence with therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both populations, patients failed to fill prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs for about 40% of the study year. Persistence rates with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors were significantly higher than those seen with cholestyramine (64.3% vs 36.6% of days with drug available, respectively). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease had significantly higher rates of persistence with lipid-lowering regimens. In New Jersey, multivariable analysis indicated that the poorest patients (those enrolled in Medicaid) had lower rates of drug use than less indigent patients (those enrolled in Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled) after adjusting for possible confounders, despite virtually complete drug coverage in both programs. When rates of use were measured in the US population for the 5 years following the study year, only 52% of surviving patients who were initially prescribed lipid-lowering drugs were still filling prescriptions for this drug class.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn all populations studied, patients who were prescribed lipid-lowering drug regimens remained without filled prescriptions for over a third of the study year on average. Rates of persistence varied substantially with choice of agent prescribed, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status, despite universal coverage of prescription drug costs. After 5 years, about half of the surviving original cohort in the United States had stopped using lipid-lowering therapy altogether.",

The study sample consisted of 38 866 new statin users 18 to 65 years old beginning treatment with atorvastatin calcium, fluvastatin sodium, lovastatin, pravastatin sodium, or simvastatin.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCompliance was measured by the \"medication possession ratio,\" and persistence was measured by the time to discontinuation. Switching rates were derived from the proportions of patients filling a prescription other than the initial statin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients who switched statins were less compliant by 18.9% (odds ratio, 0.81; P < .001), as defined by the probability of having a medication possession ratio of 0.8 or higher, and were less persistent by 20.9% to 48.3% (P < .001) depending on the gap length used to define discontinuation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSwitching statins substantially reduces the likelihood that patients will be compliant and remain on treatment long enough to obtain the full benefit of statin treatment. To ensure better compliance, special care should be given to patients who change drugs.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effect of switching drugs on the compliance and persistence of new statin users.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nRetrospective database analysis of pharmacy claims provided by a large pharmacy benefit manager. The study sample consisted of 38 866 new statin users 18 to 65 years old beginning treatment with atorvastatin calcium, fluvastatin sodium, lovastatin, pravastatin sodium, or simvastatin.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCompliance was measured by the \"medication possession ratio,\" and persistence was measured by the time to discontinuation. Switching rates were derived from the proportions of patients filling a prescription other than the initial statin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients who switched statins were less compliant by 18.9% (odds ratio, 0.81; P < .001), as defined by the probability of having a medication possession ratio of 0.8 or higher, and were less persistent by 20.9% to 48.3% (P < .001) depending on the gap length used to define discontinuation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSwitching statins substantially reduces the likelihood that patients will be compliant and remain on treatment long enough to obtain the full benefit of statin treatment. To ensure better compliance, special care should be given to patients who change drugs.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: The study objective was to compare dose-equivalence, adherence and subsequent switch rates among patients recently switched from a branded to generic version of the same statin (generic substitution, GS) vs. those switched from branded statin to generic version of a different statin (therapeutic substitution, TS). Methods: In a retrospective cohort analysis among adult enrollees in over 90 US health plans, the authors identified adult patients who switched from a branded to generic statin from July\u2013December 2006 (simvastatin became generic in June 2006). Patients were classified by type of statin switch: GS (e.g., branded simvastatin\u2009\u2192\u2009generic simvastatin), and TS (e.g., branded atorvastatin\u2009\u2192\u2009generic simvastatin). Demographic and clinical data were collected from claims before switch through 6 months follow-up. Separate outcomes of interest included proportion of patients that switched to a less potent daily dose, that switched back to previous branded statin after switch, and that were at least 80% adherent during the 6 months after initial switch. Significant predictors of each clinical outcome were identified using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for differences between groups in covariates and potential confounders. Results: The 6-month TS (n\u2009=\u20093807) and GS (n\u2009=\u200940,165) groups were generally similar demographically. Compared to GS, TS patients were significantly more likely to be switched to a less potent dose (26.2% vs. 0.5%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] in patients with high-potency index medication\u2009=\u200983.4, p\u2009<\u20090.0001); 33% less likely to be adherent in the 6 months after switch (67.7% vs. 75.9%, AOR in patients with no switch in first 6 months follow-up = 0.67, p\u2009<\u20090.0001); and four times more likely to switch back to previous branded statin (11.3% vs. 2.9%, AOR = 4.1, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Limitations: This study did not account for co-payment changes, lipid measurements, or changes in pill burden. Conclusions: While this study did not have data on why patients had TS (e.g., for cost or clinical reasons), TS was more likely to involve a subsequent disruption to statin therapy than GS. TS could potentially lead to adverse impacts on patients\u2019 outcomes, and should be studied further.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background: As clinical trials have shown the benefits of more intensive cholesterol control, treatment targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have decreased progressively. At the same time, physicians have been encouraged to contain costs by prescribing cheaper, generic statins for cholesterol management. To determine how these possibly conflicting goals are managed in clinical practice, we examined LDL-C control in patients switched from a potent, branded statin (atorvastatin) to a less potent, generic statin (simvastatin). Methods: Patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin between July 2006 and January 2008 were retrospectively identified from a US medical and pharmacy claims database, and matched with controls remaining on atorvastatin. Outcomes measured were the number of switched patients receiving a simvastatin milligram dose \u2265 2 times their previous atorvastatin dose, changes in LDL-C levels, and percentage of patients achieving recommended LDL-C targets. All study variables were analyzed descriptively. Results: After applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, 1048 patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin and 1048 matched controls who remained on atorvastatin were included. Among the switchers, 379 (36%) received an inappropriately low dose of simvastatin (< 2 times atorvastatin dose). In patients remaining on atorvastatin, mean LDL-C decreased from 105.7 mg/dL to 102.3 mg/dL after 44 weeks, whereas in switched patients, LDL-C remained similar, at 105.9 mg/dL on atorvastatin and 105.8 mg/dL on simvastatin. Before switching, when all patients were receiving atorvastatin, 67.4% of switchers and 69.9% of controls achieved recommended LDL-C targets. After switching, significantly fewer switchers than controls met LDL-C targets (69.1% vs 74.6%; P = 0.005). However, among patients who switched to an equivalent dose of simvastatin (\u2265 2 times prior atorvastatin dose), similar proportions met LDL-C targets (72.8% vs 74.6% of controls; P = 0.402), whereas among patients who switched to inappropriate non-equivalent dose of simvastatin, a significantly lower proportion met LDL-C targets (62.5% vs 74.6% of controls; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Continuing atorvastatin was associated with lower LDL-C levels and better LDL-C target attainment compared with switching to simvastatin. Patients switched to an equivalent simvastatin dose had lower LDL-C levels and were more likely to achieve LDL-C targets than patients switched to a non-equivalent dose, suggesting physicians must consider dosage equivalence when switching statins, and should measure LDL-C and titrate statins as necessary to achieve LDL-C control.",

After adjusting for covariates, adherent patients in the primary-prevention population had a significantly lower risk of CV events compared with nonadherent patients (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74\u20130.91). In the secondary-prevention population, adherence to atorvastatin was also associated with lower CV risk (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.66\u20130.82). Atorvastatin discontinuation rates were high 1 year after treatment initiation. Patients who adhered to atorvastatin treatment were at lower CV risk. Quality-of-care interventions should target improvements to therapy persistence.",

Their effectiveness could be compromised in actual practice when patients are not adherent to the treatments. Higher copayments have been shown to be associated with lower adherence to statins. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect on patient adherence of moving branded atorvastatin and rosuvastatin from the second to the first tier by a Medicare Part D plan sponsor. METHODS: Pharmacy claims and eligibility records between July 1, 2009, and July 31, 2011, of Medicare Part D members not receiving the low-income subsidy were analyzed. New atorvastatin and rosuvastatin users in January 2010 (2010 cohort) were compared with those in January 2011 (2011 cohort) after this formulary tier change (tier-reduction group). Adherence was defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) over 6 months. The impact of tier reduction on adherence was evaluated via logistic regression for binary outcome (PDC\u22650.8) and generalized linear regression for continuous PDC by comparing the 2011 cohort with the 2010 cohort, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Other statin users (97% on generic statins) were also analyzed, serving as a nontier-reduction comparator group. RESULTS: We identified 12,437 members in the tier-reduction group. Between the 2010 and 2011 cohorts, mean PDC increased from 0.77 to 0.83, and the proportion of members with high adherence increased from 62.0% to 72.9% (both P\u2009 less than \u20090.001). After regression adjustment, members in the 2011 cohort were more likely to be adherent (OR=1.68; 95% CI=1.55-1.82) and had a 5.9% increase in PDC (P\u2009 less than \u20090.05). There was no significant increase in adherence observed in the comparator nontier-reduction group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that financial incentives may improve medication adherence. Future studies should evaluate whether such formulary strategies improve long-term adherence and patient outcomes.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Widespread use of statins has improved hypercholesterolemia management, yet a significant proportion of patients remain at risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Analyses of treatment patterns reveal inadequate intensity and duration of statin therapy among patients with hypercholesterolemia, and little is known about real-world statin use, specifically in subgroups of patients at high risk for CV events. OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns of statin use and outcomes among patients with high-risk features who newly initiated statin monotherapy. METHODS: Adult patients (aged > 18 years) at high CV risk who received > 1 prescription for statin monotherapy and who had not received lipid-modifying therapy during the previous 12 months were identified from the Truven MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases (from January 2007 to June 2013). Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or diabetes were hierarchically classified into 5 mutually exclusive CV risk categories (listed here in order from highest to lowest risk): (1) recent CV event (subcategorized by hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome [ACS] or other non-ACS CV event within 90 days of index); (2) coronary heart disease (CHD); (3) history of ischemic stroke; (4) peripheral artery disease (PAD); and (5) diabetes. Outcomes of interest included changes in therapy, proportion of days covered (PDC), time to discontinuation, and proportion of patients with ASCVD-related inpatient visit during the follow-up period. Statin therapy was subdivided into high-intensity treatment (atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg, or simvastatin 80 mg) or moderate- to low-intensity treatment (all other statins and statin dosing regimens). Follow-up data were obtained from the index date (statin initiation) until the end of continuous enrollment. RESULTS: A total of 541,221 patients were included in the analysis. The majority of patients were stratified in the diabetes cohort (61.1%), followed in frequency by recent ACS event (15.8%), recent non-ACS CV event (9.9%), PAD (4.7%), CHD (4.4%), and history of ischemic stroke (4.1%). Only 15.0% of the population initiated therapy with a high-intensity statin, and 22.5% of these high-intensity statin initiators switched to a moderate- to low-intensity regimen during the follow-up period. Median time to statin discontinuation was approximately 15 months. Duration of treatment was longer among those who were treated with a high-intensity versus a moderate- to low-intensity statin regimen (21 and 15 months, respectively). The PDC was highest in the recent ACS hospitalization cohort (66.4%) and lowest in the diabetes cohort (55.5%). The PDC was significantly greater among patients who initiated treatment with a high-intensity statin regimen than with a moderate- to low-intensity statin regimen (62.1% vs. 57.5%, respectively; P< 0.001). At 1 year, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative rates for ASCVD-related hospitalizations ranged from 3.5% (diabetes) to 21.8% (recent ACS hospitalization). CONCLUSIONS: Patients at high risk for CV events are suboptimally dosed with statins, have high rates of discontinuation, and have low rates of adherence. Despite the use of statin therapy, ASCVD-related inpatient visit rates were high, particularly among those patients at highest risk because of a recent ACS hospitalization.

Objective To estimate the proportion of patients filling high-intensity statin prescriptions following myocardial infarction who continue taking this medication with high adherence and to analyze factors associated with continuing a high-intensity statin with high adherence after myocardial infarction. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients following hospitalization for myocardial infarction. Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 75 years (n\u2009=\u200929 932) and older than 75 years (n\u2009=\u200927 956) hospitalized for myocardial infarction between 2007 and 2012 who filled a high-intensity statin prescription (atorvastatin, 40-80 mg, and rosuvastatin, 20-40 mg) within 30 days of discharge. Beneficiaries had Medicare fee-for-service coverage including pharmacy benefits. Exposures Sociodemographic, dual Medicare/Medicaid coverage, comorbidities, not filling high-intensity statin prescriptions before their myocardial infarction (ie, new users), and cardiac rehabilitation and outpatient cardiologist visits after discharge. Main Outcomes and Measures High adherence to high-intensity statins at 6 months and 2 years after discharge was defined by a proportion of days covered of at least 80%, down-titration was defined by switching to a low/moderate-intensity statin with a proportion of days covered of at least 80%, and low adherence was defined by a proportion of days covered less than 80% for any statin intensity without discontinuation. Discontinuation was defined by not having a statin available to take in the last 60 days of each follow-up period. Results Approximately half of the beneficiaries were women and fourth-fifths were white. At 6 months and 2 years after discharge among beneficiaries 66 to 75 years of age, 17 633 (58.9%) and 10 308 (41.6%) were taking high-intensity statins with high adherence, 2605 (8.7%) and 3315 (13.4%) down-titrated, 5182 (17.3%) and 4727 (19.1%) had low adherence, and 3705 (12.4%) and 4648 (18.8%) discontinued their statin, respectively. The proportion taking high-intensity statins with high adherence increased between 2007 and 2012. African American patients, Hispanic patients, and new high-intensity statin users were less likely to take high-intensity statins with high adherence, and those with dual Medicare/Medicaid coverage and more cardiologist visits after discharge and who participated in cardiac rehabilitation were more likely to take high-intensity statins with high adherence. Results were similar among beneficiaries older than 75 years of age. Conclusions and Relevance Many patients filling high-intensity statins following a myocardial infarction do not continue taking this medication with high adherence for 2 years postdischarge.

Data were analyzed from January 4, 2017, through May 12, 2019.\n\n\nExposures\nBeneficiary characteristics were abstracted from Medicare data. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the 2014 American Hospital Association Survey and Hospital Compare quality metrics. Nine regions were defined according to the US Census.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nIntensity of the first statin claim after discharge characterized as high (atorvastatin calcium, 40-80 mg, or rosuvastatin calcium, 20-40 mg/d) vs low to moderate (all other statin types and doses). Trends in high-intensity statins were examined from 2011 through 2015. Associations of region and beneficiary and hospital characteristics with high-intensity statin use from January 1, 2014, to June 15, 2015, were examined using Poisson distribution mixed models.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 139 643 fee-for-service beneficiaries included (69 968 men [50.1%] and 69 675 women [49.9%]; mean [SD] age, 76.7 [7.5] years), high-intensity statin use overall increased from 23.4% in 2011 to 55.6% in 2015, but treatment gaps persisted across regions. In models considering region and beneficiary and hospital characteristics, region was the strongest correlate of high-intensity statin use, with 66% higher use in New England than in the West South Central region (risk ratio [RR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.47-1.87). Hospital size of at least 500 beds (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.23), medical school affiliation (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17), male sex (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13), and patient receipt of a stent (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.31-1.39) were associated with greater high-intensity statin use. For-profit hospital ownership, patient age older than 75 years, prior coronary disease, and other comorbidities were associated with lower use.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study's findings suggest that geographic region is the strongest correlate of high-intensity statin use after MI, leading to large treatment disparities.",

            "abstract": "Importance\nHigh-intensity statin use after myocardial infarction (MI) varies by patient characteristics, but little is known about differences in use by hospital or region.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore the relative strength of associations of region and hospital and patient characteristics with high-intensity statin use after MI.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis retrospective cohort analysis used Medicare administrative claims and enrollment data to evaluate fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who were hospitalized for MI from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2015, with a statin prescription claim within 30 days of discharge. Data were analyzed from January 4, 2017, through May 12, 2019.\n\n\nExposures\nBeneficiary characteristics were abstracted from Medicare data. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the 2014 American Hospital Association Survey and Hospital Compare quality metrics. Nine regions were defined according to the US Census.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nIntensity of the first statin claim after discharge characterized as high (atorvastatin calcium, 40-80 mg, or rosuvastatin calcium, 20-40 mg/d) vs low to moderate (all other statin types and doses). Trends in high-intensity statins were examined from 2011 through 2015. Associations of region and beneficiary and hospital characteristics with high-intensity statin use from January 1, 2014, to June 15, 2015, were examined using Poisson distribution mixed models.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 139 643 fee-for-service beneficiaries included (69 968 men [50.1%] and 69 675 women [49.9%]; mean [SD] age, 76.7 [7.5] years), high-intensity statin use overall increased from 23.4% in 2011 to 55.6% in 2015, but treatment gaps persisted across regions. In models considering region and beneficiary and hospital characteristics, region was the strongest correlate of high-intensity statin use, with 66% higher use in New England than in the West South Central region (risk ratio [RR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.47-1.87). Hospital size of at least 500 beds (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.23), medical school affiliation (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17), male sex (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13), and patient receipt of a stent (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.31-1.39) were associated with greater high-intensity statin use. For-profit hospital ownership, patient age older than 75 years, prior coronary disease, and other comorbidities were associated with lower use.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study's findings suggest that geographic region is the strongest correlate of high-intensity statin use after MI, leading to large treatment disparities.",

            "abstract": "Background Since 2014 English national guidance recommends \u2018high-intensity\u2019 statins, reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by \u226540%. Aim To describe trends and variation in low-/medium-intensity statin prescribing and assess the feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change. Design and setting A retrospective cohort study using OpenPrescribing data from all 8142 standard NHS general practices in England from August 2010 to March 2019. Method Statins were categorised as high- or low-/medium-intensity using two different thresholds, and the proportion prescribed below these thresholds was calculated. The authors plotted trends and geographical variation, carried out mixed-effects logistic regression to identify practice characteristics associated with breaching of guidance, and used indicator saturation to identify sudden prescribing changes. Results The proportion of statins prescribed below the recommended 40% LDL-lowering threshold has decreased gradually from 80% in 2011/2012 to 45% in 2019; the proportion below a pragmatic 37% threshold decreased from 30% to 18% in 2019. Guidance from 2014 had minimal impact on trends. Wide variation was found between practices (interdecile ranges 20% to 85% and 10% to 30% respectively in 2018). Regression identified no strong associations with breaching of guidance. Indicator saturation identified several practices exhibiting sudden changes towards greater guideline compliance. Conclusion Breaches of guidance on choice of statin remain common, with substantial variation between practices. Some have implemented rapid change, indicating the feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change. This article discusses the potential for a national strategic approach, using data and evidence to optimise care, including targeted education alongside audit and feedback to outliers through services such as OpenPrescribing.",

The former 2 groups also experience excess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) complications of diabetes. We aimed to study ethnic differences in statin initiation, a cornerstone of ASCVD primary prevention, for people with type 2 diabetes. Methods and findings Observational cohort study of UK primary care records, from 1 January 2006 to 30 June 2019. Data were studied from 27,511 (88%) people of European ethnicity, 2,386 (8%) people of South Asian ethnicity, and 1,142 (4%) people of African/African Caribbean ethnicity with incident type 2 diabetes, no previous ASCVD, and statin use indicated by guidelines. Statin initiation rates were contrasted by ethnicity, and the number of ASCVD events that could be prevented by equalising prescribing rates across ethnic groups was estimated. Median time to statin initiation was 79, 109, and 84 days for people of European, South Asian, and African/African Caribbean ethnicity, respectively. People of African/African Caribbean ethnicity were a third less likely to receive guideline-indicated statins than European people (n/N [%]: 605/1,142 [53%] and 18,803/27,511 [68%], respectively; age- and gender-adjusted HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.76], p < 0.001). The HR attenuated marginally in a model adjusting for total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (0.77 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.85], p < 0.001), with no further diminution when deprivation, ASCVD risk factors, comorbidity, polypharmacy, and healthcare usage were accounted for (fully adjusted HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.68, 0.85], p < 0.001). People of South Asian ethnicity were 10% less likely to receive a statin than European people (1,489/2,386 [62%] and 18,803/27,511 [68%], respectively; fully adjusted HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.98], p = 0.008, adjusting for all covariates). We estimated that up to 12,600 ASCVD events could be prevented over the lifetimes of people currently affected by type 2 diabetes in the UK by equalising statin prescribing across ethnic groups. Limitations included incompleteness of recording of routinely collected data. Conclusions In this study we observed that people of African/African Caribbean ethnicity with type 2 diabetes were substantially less likely, and people of South Asian ethnicity marginally less likely, to receive guideline-indicated statins than people of European ethnicity, even after accounting for sociodemographics, healthcare usage, ASCVD risk factors, and comorbidity. Underuse of statins in people of African/African Caribbean or South Asian ethnicity with type 2 diabetes is a missed opportunity to prevent cardiovascular events.",
