We report a case\u2010control cohort study to determine the incidence and microbiologic profile of bilomas and risk factors for biloma formation in 492 patients undergoing liver transplantation from 1994 to 2001. Fifty\u2010seven patients (11.5%) developed one or more bilomas; 95% in the first year post\u2010transplantation. The most common initial infecting pathogens were enterococci (37%), one\u2010half resistant to vancomycin (VRE); coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci (26%); and Candida species (26%). Infection by coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci was strongly associated with the presence of a T\u2010tube (OR 9.60, p = 0.02). In stepwise logistic regression multivariable analyses, hepatic artery thrombosis (OR 90.9, p < 0.0001), hepatic artery stenosis (OR 13.2, p < 0.0001) and Roux\u2010en\u2010Y choledochojejunostomy (OR 5.8, p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for biloma formation; ursodeoxycholic acid use was highly protective (OR 0.1, p = 0.002). Strategies to prevent biloma formation must focus on measures to prevent hepatic artery thrombosis and colonization of liver transplant patients by multiresistant nosocomial pathogens. T\u2010tube drainage post\u2010transplantation bears reassessment. The protective effect of ursodeoxycholic acid found in this study warrants confirmation in a prospective multicenter, randomized trial.",

Standard practice does not include screening deceased donors for heritable thrombophilias, even if they have a personal history of thrombosis. Here we report a case of hepatic artery thrombosis in a liver recipient whose native and donor livers were heterozygous for FVL. The patient subsequently underwent a successful retransplant. FVL and its variants are expressed phenotypically as activated protein C (APC) resistance. We believe that testing liver donors (deceased or living) for APC resistance \u2013 a surrogate marker for the most common liver\u2010based thrombophilia \u2013 will reduce the incidence of thrombotic events by identifying a need for posttransplant prophylactic anticoagulation in patients at risk. The estimated cost of testing all liver donors in the US for APC resistance is less than the cost of two complications secondary to thrombosis. Testing for APC resistance may further improve outcome and reduce cost after liver transplantation.",

            "abstract": "Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most common vascular complication after liver transplantation; it has been reported to occur in 2% to 5% of liver transplant recipients. Most reports of HAT in the literature describe single\u2010center series with small numbers of patients and lack the power to definitively identify nontechnical risk factors. We used the United Network for Organ Sharing database of adult deceased donor liver transplants from 1987 to 2006 to identify 1246 patients with graft loss from HAT. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify donor and graft risk factors for HAT\u2010induced graft loss. Although most donor predictors of HAT\u2010induced graft loss were surrogates for vessel size, donor age > 50 years was also a significant predictor of graft loss from HAT (relative risk = 1.45, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the risk of graft loss from HAT increased progressively with each decade of donor age > 50 years, such that a 61% increased risk of HAT\u2010related graft loss (relative risk = 1.61, P < 0.001) was associated with donor age > 70 years. A separate analysis of risk factors for early HAT graft loss (\u226490 days) and late HAT graft loss (> 90 days) found that older donor age was associated with increased late HAT graft loss. These findings are of interest in an era of ongoing organ shortages requiring maximum utilization of potential allografts and increasing allocation of older allografts.

Despite the demand, many marginal livers are discarded annually. We evaluated the impact of center volume on survival outcomes associated with liver transplantation using high\u2013donor risk index (DRI) allografts. We queried the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database for deceased donor liver transplants (n = 31,576) performed between 2002 and 2008 for patients who were 18 years old or older, and we excluded partial and multiple liver transplants. A high\u2010DRI cohort (n = 15,668), which was composed of patients receiving grafts with DRIs > 1.90, was analyzed separately. Transplant centers (n = 102) were categorized into tertiles by their annual procedure volumes: high\u2010volume centers (HVCs; 78\u2010215 cases per year), medium\u2010volume centers (MVCs; 49\u201077 cases per year), and low\u2010volume centers (LVCs; 5\u201048 cases per year). The endpoints were allograft survival and recipient survival. In comparison with their lower volume counterparts, HVCs used donors with higher mean DRIs (2.07 for HVCs, 2.01 for MVCs, and 1.91 for LVCs), more donors who were 60 years old or older (18.02% for HVCs, 16.85% for MVCs, and 12.39% for LVCs), more donors who died after a stroke (46.52% for HVCs, 43.71% for MVCs, and 43.36% for LVCs), and more donation after cardiac death organs (5.04% for HVCs, 4.45% for MVCs, and 3.51% for LVCs, all P values < 0.001). Multivariate risk\u2010adjusted frailty models showed that increased procedure volume at a transplant center led to decreased risks of allograft failure [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89\u20100.98, P = 0.002] and recipient death (HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83\u20100.97, P = 0.004) for high\u2010DRI liver transplants. In conclusion, HVCs more frequently used higher DRI livers and achieved better risk\u2010adjusted allograft and recipient survival.

DGF occurred in 230 of 671 (34%) recipients. Only 1\u2010h flow was inversely associated with DGF. Higher NGAL or L\u2010FABP concentrations and increased resistance were inversely associated with 6\u2010mo eGFR, whereas higher flow was associated with higher adjusted 6\u2010mo eGFR. Discarded kidneys had consistently higher median resistance and lower median flow than transplanted kidneys, but median perfusate biomarker concentrations were either lower or not significantly different in discarded compared with transplanted kidneys. Notably, most recipients of transplanted kidneys with isolated \u201cundesirable\u201d biomarker levels or HMP parameters experienced acceptable 6\u2010mo allograft function, suggesting these characteristics should not be used in isolation for discard decisions.

Notably, most recipients of transplanted kidneys with isolated \u201cundesirable\u201d biomarker levels or HMP parameters experienced acceptable 6\u2010mo allograft function, suggesting these characteristics should not be used in isolation for discard decisions. Additional studies must confirm the utility of combining HMP measurements with other characteristics to assess kidney quality.",

            "abstract": "Ex-situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of transplant kidneys allows assessment of kidney quality and targeted intervention to initiate repair processes prior to transplantation. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to possess the capacity to stimulate kidney repair. Therefore, the combination of NMP and MSC therapy offers potential to repair transplant kidneys. It is however unknown how NMP conditions affect MSC. In this study the effect of NMP perfusion fluid on survival, metabolism and function of thawed cryopreserved human (h)MSC and porcine (p)MSC in suspension conditions was studied. Suspension conditions reduced the viability of pMSC by 40% in both perfusion fluid and culture medium. Viability of hMSC was reduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid, whilst no differences were found in survival in culture medium. Under adherent conditions, survival of the cells was not affected by perfusion fluid. The perfusion fluid did not affect survival of fresh MSC in suspension compared to the control culture medium. The freeze-thawing process impaired the survival of hMSC; 95% survival of fresh hMSC compared to 70% survival of thawed hMSC. Moreover, thawed MSC showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species, which indicates elevated levels of oxidative stress, and reduced mitochondrial activity, which implies reduced metabolism. The adherence of pMSC and hMSC to endothelial cells was reduced after the thawing process, effect which was particularly profound in in the perfusion fluid. To summarize, we observed that conditions required for machine perfusion are influencing the behavior of MSC. The freeze-thawing process reduces survival and metabolism and increases oxidative stress, and diminishes their ability to adhere to endothelial cells. In addition, we found that hMSC and pMSC behaved differently, which has to be taken into consideration when translating results from animal experiments to clinical studies.",

MAPC\u2010treated kidneys demonstrated improved urine output (P = .009), decreased expression of injury biomarker NGAL (P = .012), improved microvascular perfusion on contrast\u2010enhanced ultrasound (cortex P = .019, medulla P = .001), downregulation of interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2 (P = .050), and upregulation of IL\u201010 (P < .047) and Indolamine\u20102, 3\u2010dioxygenase (P = .050). A chemotaxis model demonstrated decreased neutrophil recruitment when stimulated with perfusate from MAPC\u2010treated kidneys (P < .001). Immunofluorescence revealed prelabeled MAPC cells in the perivascular space of kidneys during NMP. We report the first successful delivery of cellular therapy to a human kidney during NMP. Kidneys treated with MAPC cells demonstrate improvement in clinically relevant parameters and injury biomarkers. This novel method of cell therapy delivery provides an exciting opportunity to recondition organs prior to transplantation.",

            "abstract": "Significance Statement Cold storage-associated transplantation (CST) injury occurs in renal transplant from deceased donors, the main organ source. The pathogenesis of CST injury remains poorly understood, and effective therapies are not available. This study has demonstrated an important role of microRNAs in CST injury and revealed the changes in microRNA expression profiles. Specifically, microRNA-147 (miR-147) is consistently elevated during CST injury in mice and in dysfunctional renal grafts in humans. Mechanistically, NDUFA4 (a key component of mitochondrial respiration complex) is identified as a direct target of miR-147. By repressing NDUFA4, miR-147 induces mitochondrial damage and renal tubular cell death. Blockade of miR-147 and overexpression of NDUFA4 reduce CST injury and improve graft function, unveiling miR-147 and NDUFA4 as new therapeutic targets in kidney transplantation. Background Kidney injury due to cold storage\u2013associated transplantation (CST) is a major factor determining the outcome of renal transplant, for which the role and regulation of microRNAs remain largely unclear. Methods The kidneys of proximal tubule Dicer (an enzyme for microRNA biogenesis) knockout mice and their wild-type littermates were subjected to CST to determine the function of microRNAs. Small RNA sequencing then profiled microRNA expression in mouse kidneys after CST. Anti\u2013microRNA-147 (miR-147) and miR-147 mimic were used to examine the role of miR-147 in CST injury in mouse and renal tubular cell models. Results Knockout of Dicer from proximal tubules attenuated CST kidney injury in mice. RNA sequencing identified multiple microRNAs with differential expression in CST kidneys, among which miR-147 was induced consistently in mouse kidney transplants and in dysfunctional human kidney grafts. Anti\u2013miR-147 protected against CST injury in mice and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction after ATP depletion injury in renal tubular cells in intro. Mechanistically, miR-147 was shown to target NDUFA4, a key component of the mitochondrial respiration complex. Silencing NDUFA4 aggravated renal tubular cell death, whereas overexpression of NDUFA4 prevented miR-147\u2013induced cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, overexpression of NDUFA4 alleviated CST injury in mice. Conclusions microRNAs, as a class of molecules, are pathogenic in CST injury and graft dysfunction. Specifically, miR-147 induced during CST represses NDUFA4, leading to mitochondrial damage and renal tubular cell death. These results unveil miR-147 and NDUFA4 as new therapeutic targets in kidney transplantation.",
