            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInsulin glargine (21A-Gly-30Ba-L-Arg-30Bb-L-Arg-human insulin) is a biosynthetic insulin analog with a prolonged duration of action compared with NPH human insulin. This study compared insulin glargine with NPH human insulin in subjects with type 1 diabetes who had been previously treated with multiple daily injections of NPH insulin and regular insulin.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis study was a multicenter randomized parallel-group study in which subjects were randomized to receive premeal regular insulin and either insulin glargine (at bedtime) or NPH insulin (at bedtime for patients on once-daily therapy and at bedtime and in the morning for patients on twice-daily therapy) for up to 28 weeks. Dose titration of both basal insulins was based on capillary fasting whole blood glucose (FBG) levels; the goal was a premeal blood glucose concentration of 4.4-6.7 mmol/l.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 534 well-controlled type 1 diabetic subjects (mean GHb 7.7%, mean fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 11.8 mmo/l) were treated. A small decrease in GHb levels was noted with both insulin glargine (-0.16%) and NPH insulin (-0.21%; P > 0.05). Significant reductions in median FPG levels from baseline (-1.67 vs. -0.33 mmol/l with NPH insulin, P = 0.0145) and a trend for a reduction in capillary FBG levels were achieved with insulin glargine. After the 1-month titration phase, significantly fewer subjects receiving insulin glargine experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia (39.9 vs. 49.2%, P = 0.0219) or nocturnal hypoglycemia (18.2 vs. 27.1%, P = 0.0116) with a blood glucose level <2.0 mmol/l compared with subjects receiving NPH insulin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLower FPG levels with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia were achieved with insulin glargine compared with once- or twice-daily NPH insulin as part of a basal-bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes.",

            "abstract": "Objective: To investigate differences in preand postoperative patient-relevant outcome between hybrid total hip replacement (THR) and cemented THR in patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: 245 consecutive patients were included in the study. 68 of the patients (mean age 62) were operated on with hybrid THR and 177 (mean age 74) were operated on with cemented THR. All patients were investigated preoperatively and 0.5, 1 and 3.6 years postoperatively with two selfadministered questionnaires, SF-36 and WOMAC (Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, LK 3.0). Results: Preoperatively, there was a difference in the SF-36 subscales RP (role physical) and GH (general health) where the patients with the hybrid THR attained better scores. At 3.6-years the patients with the hybrid THR reached better scores in all SF-36 subscales except BP (bodily pain) and GH. Further, they had better scores in WOMAC function. However, after adjusting for age, sex, follow-up time and baseline values there were no differences in outcome between the two different surgical techniques. Conclusion: This medium term (3\u20135 years), controlled, open cohort study, using patient-relevant outcome measures, did not reveal any differences between hybrid THR and cemented THR for OA at 3.6 years after surgery. Since the study had 75\u201394% power to detect the clinically significant score difference of 10 points, we suggest that any difference in outcome between these two methods is small and may require a large-scale, blinded, randomized trial to show. Introduction Since the development of total hip replacement (THR) there has been a wish to evaluate the results of the intervention. Approximately 20 different hip scores have been introduced [1]. The variables measured have been pain, walking distance, use of walking assistance, range of motion, ability to put on shoes, climb stairs, use of public transport, etc. Inconsistent results have been found when comparing outcomes with scores which used descriptive terms such as excellent, good or failure, whereas there was better correlation between outcomes when using different numerical scores [1]. Callaghan et al. [2] compared five different rating systems and found no uniformity in the results between ratings, nor any uniformity between the Published: 11 June 2003 Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2003, 1:21 Received: 23 April 2003 Accepted: 11 June 2003 This article is available from: http://www.hqlo.com/content/1/1/21 \u00a9 2003 Nilsdotter and Lohmander; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: 245 consecutive patients were included in the study. 68 of the patients (mean age 62) were operated on with hybrid THR and 177 (mean age 74) were operated on with cemented THR. All patients were investigated preoperatively and 0.5, 1 and 3.6 years postoperatively with two selfadministered questionnaires, SF-36 and WOMAC (Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, LK 3.0). Results: Preoperatively, there was a difference in the SF-36 subscales RP (role physical) and GH (general health) where the patients with the hybrid THR attained better scores. At 3.6-years the patients with the hybrid THR reached better scores in all SF-36 subscales except BP (bodily pain) and GH. Further, they had better scores in WOMAC function. However, after adjusting for age, sex, follow-up time and baseline values there were no differences in outcome between the two different surgical techniques. Conclusion: This medium term (3\u20135 years), controlled, open cohort study, using patient-relevant outcome measures, did not reveal any differences between hybrid THR and cemented THR for OA at 3.6 years after surgery. Since the study had 75\u201394% power to detect the clinically significant score difference of 10 points, we suggest that any difference in outcome between these two methods is small and may require a large-scale, blinded, randomized trial to show. Introduction Since the development of total hip replacement (THR) there has been a wish to evaluate the results of the intervention. Approximately 20 different hip scores have been introduced [1]. The variables measured have been pain, walking distance, use of walking assistance, range of motion, ability to put on shoes, climb stairs, use of public transport, etc. Inconsistent results have been found when comparing outcomes with scores which used descriptive terms such as excellent, good or failure, whereas there was better correlation between outcomes when using different numerical scores [1].

            "abstract": "Objective: To investigate differences in preand postoperative patient-relevant outcome between hybrid total hip replacement (THR) and cemented THR in patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: 245 consecutive patients were included in the study. 68 of the patients (mean age 62) were operated on with hybrid THR and 177 (mean age 74) were operated on with cemented THR. All patients were investigated preoperatively and 0.5, 1 and 3.6 years postoperatively with two selfadministered questionnaires, SF-36 and WOMAC (Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, LK 3.0). Results: Preoperatively, there was a difference in the SF-36 subscales RP (role physical) and GH (general health) where the patients with the hybrid THR attained better scores. At 3.6-years the patients with the hybrid THR reached better scores in all SF-36 subscales except BP (bodily pain) and GH. Further, they had better scores in WOMAC function. However, after adjusting for age, sex, follow-up time and baseline values there were no differences in outcome between the two different surgical techniques. Conclusion: This medium term (3\u20135 years), controlled, open cohort study, using patient-relevant outcome measures, did not reveal any differences between hybrid THR and cemented THR for OA at 3.6 years after surgery. Since the study had 75\u201394% power to detect the clinically significant score difference of 10 points, we suggest that any difference in outcome between these two methods is small and may require a large-scale, blinded, randomized trial to show. Introduction Since the development of total hip replacement (THR) there has been a wish to evaluate the results of the intervention. Approximately 20 different hip scores have been introduced [1]. The variables measured have been pain, walking distance, use of walking assistance, range of motion, ability to put on shoes, climb stairs, use of public transport, etc. Inconsistent results have been found when comparing outcomes with scores which used descriptive terms such as excellent, good or failure, whereas there was better correlation between outcomes when using different numerical scores [1]. Callaghan et al. [2] compared five different rating systems and found no uniformity in the results between ratings, nor any uniformity between the Published: 11 June 2003 Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2003, 1:21 Received: 23 April 2003 Accepted: 11 June 2003 This article is available from: http://www.hqlo.com/content/1/1/21 \u00a9 2003 Nilsdotter and Lohmander; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is conflicting evidence about what factors influence outcomes after total knee replacement (TKR). The objective is to identify baseline factors that differentiate patients who achieve both, minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) in pain and function, measured by WOMAC, after TKR from those who do not attain scores above the cutoff in either of these dimensions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne-year prospective multicentre study. Patients completed WOMAC, SF-12, EQ-5D, expectations, other joint problems and sociodemographic data while in the waiting list, and 1-year post-TKR. Dependent variable was a combination of MCID and PASS in both dimensions (yes/no). Univariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to study how these variables grouped into different factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTotal sample comprised 492 patients. Mean (SD) age was 71.3 (6.9), and there were a 69.7% of women. Of the total, 106 patients did not attain either MCID or PASS in either dimension, and 230 exceeded both thresholds in both dimensions. In the univariate analysis, 13 variables were associated with belonging to one group or another. These 13 variables were included in EFA; 3 factors were extracted: expectations, mental health, and other joints problems. The percentage of variance explained by the 3 factors was 80.4%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe have found 2 modifiable baseline factors, expectations and mental health, that should be properly managed by different specialist. Indication of TKR should take into account these modifiable factors for improving outcomes after TKR.",

Even though several studies have attempted to identify patients at risk of having poor clinical outcomes, few have approached this issue by considering the outcome of the patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS), defined as the value on a patient-reported outcome measure scale above which the patient deems their current symptom state acceptable.\n\n\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES\n(1) What is the proportion of patients who do not attain the PASS in pain and function at 1 year after TKA? (2) Which preoperative patient factors are associated with not achieving the PASS in pain at 1 year after TKA? (3) Which preoperative patient factors are associated with not achieving the PASS in function at 1 year after TKA?\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective study is a secondary analysis of the 1-year follow-up data from a prospective, international, multicenter study of a single TKA system. Inclusion criteria for that study were patients diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis or post-traumatic arthritis and who were able to return for follow-up for 10 years; exclusion criteria were infection, osteomyelitis, and failure of a previous joint replacement. Between 2011 and 2014, 449 patients underwent TKA at 10 centers in five countries. At 1 year, 13% (58 of 449) were lost to follow-up, 2% could not be analyzed (eight of 449; missing 1-year KOOS), leaving 85% (383 of 449) for analysis here. The primary outcomes were not surpassing evidence-derived PASS thresholds in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain and Activities in Daily Living (ADL) sub-scores. Multivariate binary logistic regressions considering preoperative demographic, radiographic, and patient-reported outcome measure data were constructed using a forward stepwise elimination algorithm to reach the simplest best-fit regression models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 1 year after TKA, 32% of the patients (145 of 449) did not reach the PASS in KOOS Pain, 31% (139 of 449) did not reach the PASS in KOOS ADL, and 25% (110 of 449) did not achieve the PASS in either KOOS Pain or ADL. After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as gender, age, BMI, and comorbidity scores, we found that men (odds ratio 2.09; p = 0.01), and patients with less-than-advanced radiographic osteoarthritis (OR 2.09; p = 0.01) were strongly associated with not achieving the PASS in pain. After controlling for the same potentially confounding variables, we found that patients with less-than-advanced radiographic osteoarthritis (OR 2.09; p = 0.01) were also strongly associated with not achieving the PASS in function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found that patients with less severe osteoarthritis were much less likely to attain the PASS in pain and function at 1 year after TKA, and that men were much less likely to achieve the PASS in pain at 1 year after TKA. Based on these findings, surgeons should strongly consider delaying surgery in patients who present with less-than-severe osteoarthritis, with increased caution in men. Surgeons should counsel their patients on their expectations and their chances of achieving meaningful levels of pain and functional improvement. Future regional and national registry studies should assess the true proportion of patients attaining PASS in pain and function after TKA and confirm if the preoperative factors identified in this study remain significant in larger, more diverse patient populations.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nLevel III, therapeutic study.",

            "abstract": "Abstract There is currently a paucity of data regarding the potential relationships between preexisting spinal deformity and clinical outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We sought to expand upon this deficit. We hypothesize that lumbar sagittal mismatch deformity (MD) will correlate with a decrease in functional outcomes after TKA. This retrospective cohort comparison of 933 TKAs was performed between January 2017 and 2020. TKAs were excluded if they were not performed for primary osteoarthritis (OA) or if preoperative lumbar radiographs were unavailable/inadequate to measure sagittal parameters of interest: pelvic incidence, sacral slope, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis, and deformity mismatch. Ninety-four TKAs were subsequently available for inclusion and divided into two groups: those with MD as defined by |PI-LL|\u2009>\u200910 degrees and those without MD. The following clinical outcomes were compared between the groups: total postoperative arc of motion (AOM), incidence of flexion contracture, and need for manipulation under anesthesia (MUA). In total, 53 TKAs met the MD criteria, while 41 did not have MD. There were no significant differences in demographics, body mass index, preoperative knee range of motion (ROM), preoperative AOM, or opiate use between the groups. TKAs with MD were more likely to have MUA (p\u2009=\u20090.026), ROM <0 to 120 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), a decreased AOM by 16 degrees (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and a flexion contracture postoperatively (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Preexisting MD may adversely affect clinical results following TKA. Statistically and clinically significant decreases in postoperative ROM/AOM, increased likelihood of flexion contracture, and increased need for MUA were all noted in those with MD. This is a Level 3 study.",

            "abstract": "Background This study aimed to analyze the risk factors that predict recurrent flexion contracture (FC) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in osteoarthritic knees with FC \u2265 15\u00b0. Methods Data from a consecutive cohort comprising 237 TKAs in 187 patients with degenerative osteoarthritis, preoperative FC \u2265 15\u00b0, and a minimum follow-up period of 2 years were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative FC was corrected intraoperatively from 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0. The incidence of recurrent FC (FC \u2265 10\u00b0) at 2 years postoperatively was investigated. Potential risk factors predicting recurrent FC including age, sex, body mass index, unilateral TKA, severity of preoperative FC, 3-month postoperative residual FC, \u03b3 angle, change in posterior femoral offset ratio, and lumbar degenerative kyphosis (LDK) were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The post-hoc powers for the identified factors were then determined. Results Forty-one knees (17.3%) with recurrent FC were identified. Risk factors with sufficient power for recurrent FC were unilateral TKA, severity of preoperative FC, residual FC at 3 months postoperatively, and LDK (odds ratios of 3.579, 1.115, 1.274, and 3.096, respectively; p < 0.05; power \u2265 86.1). Conclusions Recurrent FC can occur in TKAs with the risk factors including unilateral TKA, severe preoperative FC, residual FC at 3 months postoperative, and LDK despite appropriate intraoperative correction. Surgical strategies and rehabilitation protocols used in managing FC should be applied in TKA cases with risk factors for recurrent FC.",
