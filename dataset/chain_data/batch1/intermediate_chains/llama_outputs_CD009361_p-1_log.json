            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\u2014Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for microvascular complications and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study tested the LDL cholesterol\u2013lowering agent colesevelam HCl (colesevelam) as a potential novel treatment for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea-based therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was carried out between August 2004 and August 2006 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colesevelam for reducing A1C in adults with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate (A1C 7.5\u20139.5%) with existing sulfonylurea monotherapy or sulfonylurea in combination with additional oral antidiabetes agents. In total, 461 patients were randomized (230 given colesevelam 3.75 g/day and 231 given placebo). The primary efficacy measurement was mean placebo-corrected change in A1C from baseline to week 26 in the intent-to-treat population (last observation carried forward). RESULTS\u2014The least squares (LS) mean change in A1C from baseline to week 26 was \u22120.32% in the colesevelam group and +0.23% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of \u22120.54% (P < 0.001). The LS mean percent change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 26 was \u221216.1% in the colesevelam group and +0.6% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of \u221216.7% (P < 0.001). Furthermore, significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol, non\u2013HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were demonstrated in the colesevelam relative to placebo group at week 26. CONCLUSIONS\u2014Colesevelam improved glycemic control and reduced LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving sulfonylurea-based therapy.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was carried out between August 2004 and August 2006 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colesevelam for reducing A1C in adults with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate (A1C 7.5\u20139.5%) with existing sulfonylurea monotherapy or sulfonylurea in combination with additional oral antidiabetes agents. In total, 461 patients were randomized (230 given colesevelam 3.75 g/day and 231 given placebo). The primary efficacy measurement was mean placebo-corrected change in A1C from baseline to week 26 in the intent-to-treat population (last observation carried forward). RESULTS\u2014The least squares (LS) mean change in A1C from baseline to week 26 was \u22120.32% in the colesevelam group and +0.23% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of \u22120.54% (P < 0.001). The LS mean percent change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 26 was \u221216.1% in the colesevelam group and +0.6% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of \u221216.7% (P < 0.001). Furthermore, significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol, non\u2013HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were demonstrated in the colesevelam relative to placebo group at week 26. CONCLUSIONS\u2014Colesevelam improved glycemic control and reduced LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving sulfonylurea-based therapy.",

To investigate how colesevelam (CL) HCl improves hyperglycemia, studies were conducted in diet-induced obesity (F-DIO) rats, which develop insulin resistance when fed a high-energy (high fat/high sucrose) diet (HE). The rats were fed HE; HE + 2% CL; HE + 0.02% SC-435 (SC), an apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitor; and regular chow (controls). After 4 wk of treatment, both in the HE group and the SC + HE group, plasma glucose and insulin levels remained elevated compared with baseline values throughout an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In contrast, in the CL + HE group, plasma glucose levels returned to baseline by the end of the test, and insulin peaked in 15-30 min and then returned to baseline. CL induced release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) because the area under the curve of plasma total GLP-1 in the CL + HE group was significantly greater than in the HE group during the OGTT. Bile acid concentrations in the portal blood did not decrease in the HE group but declined significantly both in the CL + HE and SC + HE groups with reduced farnesoid X receptor activation compared with controls. We concluded that CL reduces plasma glucose levels by improving insulin resistance in this rat model. It is unlikely that the improvement is attributable to decreased bile acid flux to the liver but is likely secondary to induced GLP-1 secretion, which improves insulin release.",

CL induced release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) because the area under the curve of plasma total GLP-1 in the CL + HE group was significantly greater than in the HE group during the OGTT. Bile acid concentrations in the portal blood did not decrease in the HE group but declined significantly both in the CL + HE and SC + HE groups with reduced farnesoid X receptor activation compared with controls. We concluded that CL reduces plasma glucose levels by improving insulin resistance in this rat model. It is unlikely that the improvement is attributable to decreased bile acid flux to the liver but is likely secondary to induced GLP-1 secretion, which improves insulin release.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Bile acids (BA) participate in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis acting through different signaling pathways. The nuclear BA receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates pathways in BA, lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism, which become dysregulated in obesity. However, the role of FXR in obesity and associated complications, such as dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, has not been directly assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Here, we evaluate the consequences of FXR deficiency on body weight development, lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance in murine models of genetic and diet-induced obesity. RESULTS FXR deficiency attenuated body weight gain and reduced adipose tissue mass in both models. Surprisingly, glucose homeostasis improved as a result of an enhanced glucose clearance and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. In contrast, hepatic insulin sensitivity did not change, and liver steatosis aggravated as a result of the repression of \u03b2-oxidation genes. In agreement, liver-specific FXR deficiency did not protect from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, indicating a role for nonhepatic FXR in the control of glucose homeostasis in obesity. Decreasing elevated plasma BA concentrations in obese FXR-deficient mice by administration of the BA sequestrant colesevelam improved glucose homeostasis in a FXR-dependent manner, indicating that the observed improvements by FXR deficiency are not a result of indirect effects of altered BA metabolism.

Aged (>12 months old) Fxr(-/-) mice also develop spontaneous liver carcinomas. In this report, we used three mouse models to investigate the role of FXR deficiency in obesity. As compared with low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) knockout (Ldlr(-/-)) mice, the Ldlr(-/-)Fxr(-/-) double-knockout mice were highly resistant to diet-induced obesity, which was associated with increased expression of genes involved in energy metabolism in the skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue. Such a striking effect of FXR deficiency on obesity on an Ldlr(-/-) background led us to investigate whether FXR deficiency alone is sufficient to affect obesity. As compared with wild-type mice, Fxr(-/-) mice showed resistance to diet-induced weight gain. Interestingly, only female Fxr(-/-) mice showed significant resistance to diet-induced obesity, which was accompanied by increased energy expenditure in these mice. Finally, we determined the effect of FXR deficiency on obesity in a genetically obese and diabetic mouse model. We generated ob(-/-)Fxr(-/-) mice that were deficient in both Leptin and Fxr. On a chow diet, ob(-/-)Fxr(-/-) mice gained less body weight and had reduced body fat mass as compared with ob/ob mice. In addition, we observed liver carcinomas in 43% of young (<11 months old) Ob(-/-)Fxr(-/-) mice. Together these data indicate that loss of FXR prevents diet-induced or genetic obesity and accelerates liver carcinogenesis under diabetic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor involved in bile acid synthesis and homeostasis. Dysfunction of FXR is involved in cholestasis and atherosclerosis. FXR is prevalent in liver, gallbladder, and intestine, but it is not yet clear whether it modulates neurobehavior. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that mouse FXR deficiency affects a specific subset of neurotransmitters and results in an unique behavioral phenotype. The FXR knockout mice showed less depressive-like and anxiety-related behavior, but increased motor activity. They had impaired memory and reduced motor coordination. There were changes of glutamatergic, GABAergic, serotoninergic, and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission in either hippocampus or cerebellum. FXR deletion decreased the amount of the GABA synthesis enzyme GAD65 in hippocampus but increased GABA transporter GAT1 in cerebral cortex. FXR deletion increased serum concentrations of many bile acids, including taurodehydrocholic acid, taurocholic acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), tauro-\u03b1-muricholic acid, tauro-\u03c9-muricholic acid, and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA). There were also changes in brain concentrations of taurocholic acid, taurodehydrocholic acid, tauro-\u03c9-muricholic acid, tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid (LCA). Taken together, the results from studies with FXR knockout mice suggest that FXR contributes to the homeostasis of multiple neurotransmitter systems in different brain regions and modulates neurobehavior. The effect appears to be at least partially mediated by bile acids that are known to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) inducing potential neurotoxicity.",

            "title": "Deletion of mouse FXR gene disturbs multiple neurotransmitter systems and alters neurobehavior",
            "abstract": "Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor involved in bile acid synthesis and homeostasis. Dysfunction of FXR is involved in cholestasis and atherosclerosis. FXR is prevalent in liver, gallbladder, and intestine, but it is not yet clear whether it modulates neurobehavior. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that mouse FXR deficiency affects a specific subset of neurotransmitters and results in an unique behavioral phenotype. The FXR knockout mice showed less depressive-like and anxiety-related behavior, but increased motor activity. They had impaired memory and reduced motor coordination. There were changes of glutamatergic, GABAergic, serotoninergic, and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission in either hippocampus or cerebellum. FXR deletion decreased the amount of the GABA synthesis enzyme GAD65 in hippocampus but increased GABA transporter GAT1 in cerebral cortex. FXR deletion increased serum concentrations of many bile acids, including taurodehydrocholic acid, taurocholic acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), tauro-\u03b1-muricholic acid, tauro-\u03c9-muricholic acid, and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA). There were also changes in brain concentrations of taurocholic acid, taurodehydrocholic acid, tauro-\u03c9-muricholic acid, tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid (LCA). Taken together, the results from studies with FXR knockout mice suggest that FXR contributes to the homeostasis of multiple neurotransmitter systems in different brain regions and modulates neurobehavior. The effect appears to be at least partially mediated by bile acids that are known to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) inducing potential neurotoxicity.",

In addition, new data in the last decade have shown that bile acids also function as gut hormones capable of influencing metabolic processes via receptors such as FXR (farnesoid X receptor) and TGR5 (Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5). These effects of bile acids are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, but can affect different tissues throughout the organism. It is still unclear whether these effects also involve signaling of bile acids to the central nervous system (CNS). Bile acid signaling to the CNS encompasses both direct and indirect pathways. Bile acids can act directly in the brain via central FXR and TGR5 signaling. In addition, there are two indirect pathways that involve intermediate agents released upon interaction with bile acids receptors in the gut. Activation of intestinal FXR and TGR5 receptors can result in the release of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), both capable of signaling to the CNS. We conclude that when plasma bile acids levels are high all three pathways may contribute in signal transmission to the CNS.

Although numerous studies show a strong relationship between the composition of gut microbiota and specific metabolic disorders associated with obesity, the key mechanisms are still being studied. The present review focuses on specific complex pathways as well as key interactions. For instance, the nervous routes are explored by examining the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the brain, as well as the endocrine routes (i.e., glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101, peptide YY, endocannabinoids) by which gut microbes communicate with the host. Moreover, the key metabolites involved in such specific interactions (e.g., short chain fatty acids, bile acids, neurotransmitters) as well as their targets (i.e., receptors, cell types, and organs) are briefly discussed. Finally, the review highlights the role of metabolic endotoxemia in the onset of metabolic disorders and the implications for alterations in gut microbiota\u2010host interactions and ultimately the onset of diseases.",

Although numerous studies show a strong relationship between the composition of gut microbiota and specific metabolic disorders associated with obesity, the key mechanisms are still being studied. The present review focuses on specific complex pathways as well as key interactions. For instance, the nervous routes are explored by examining the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the brain, as well as the endocrine routes (i.e., glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101, peptide YY, endocannabinoids) by which gut microbes communicate with the host. Moreover, the key metabolites involved in such specific interactions (e.g., short chain fatty acids, bile acids, neurotransmitters) as well as their targets (i.e., receptors, cell types, and organs) are briefly discussed. Finally, the review highlights the role of metabolic endotoxemia in the onset of metabolic disorders and the implications for alterations in gut microbiota\u2010host interactions and ultimately the onset of diseases.",

We recently observed, in mice and in humans, that pasteurization of A. muciniphila increases its beneficial effects on metabolism. However, it is currently unknown if the observed beneficial effects on body weight and fat mass gain are due to specific changes in energy expenditure. Therefore, we investigated the effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila on whole-body energy metabolism during high-fat diet feeding by using metabolic chambers. We confirmed that daily oral administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila alleviated diet-induced obesity and decreased food energy efficiency. We found that this effect was associated with an increase in energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity. Strikingly, we discovered that energy expenditure was enhanced independently from changes in markers of thermogenesis or beiging of the white adipose tissue. However, we found in brown and white adipose tissues that perilipin2, a factor associated with lipid droplet and known to be altered in obesity, was decreased in expression by pasteurized A. muciniphila. Finally, we observed that treatment with pasteurized A. muciniphila increased energy excretion in the feces. Interestingly, we demonstrated that this effect was not due to the modulation of intestinal lipid absorption or chylomicron synthesis but likely involved a reduction of carbohydrates absorption and enhanced intestinal epithelial turnover. In conclusion, this study further dissects the mechanisms by which pasteurized A. muciniphila reduces body weight and fat mass gain. These data also further support the impact of targeting the gut microbiota by using specific bacteria to control whole-body energy metabolism.",

However, its underlying mechanism involved in its well-known metabolic actions needs further evaluation. The present study explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of A. muciniphila in intervening MAFLD by using a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet induced obese mice model. Mice treated with A. muciniphila efficiently reversed MAFLD in the liver, such as hepatic steatosis, inflammatory, and liver injury. These therapeutic effects persisted after long-term drug withdrawal and were slightly weakened in the antibiotics-treated obese mice. A. muciniphila treatment efficiently increased mitochondrial oxidation and bile acid metabolism in the gut-liver axis, ameliorated oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis in gut, leading to the reshaping of the gut microbiota composition. These metabolic improvements occurred with increased L-aspartate levels in the liver that transported from the gut. The administration of L-aspartate in vitro or in mice displayed the similar beneficial metabolic effects mentioned above and efficiently ameliorated MAFLD. Together, these data indicate that the anti-MAFLD activity of A. muciniphila correlated with lipid oxidation and improved gut\u2013liver interactions through regulating the metabolism of L-aspartate. A. muciniphila could be a potential agent for clinical intervention in MAFLD.",

However, its underlying mechanism involved in its well-known metabolic actions needs further evaluation. The present study explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of A. muciniphila in intervening MAFLD by using a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet induced obese mice model. Mice treated with A. muciniphila efficiently reversed MAFLD in the liver, such as hepatic steatosis, inflammatory, and liver injury. These therapeutic effects persisted after long-term drug withdrawal and were slightly weakened in the antibiotics-treated obese mice. A. muciniphila treatment efficiently increased mitochondrial oxidation and bile acid metabolism in the gut-liver axis, ameliorated oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis in gut, leading to the reshaping of the gut microbiota composition. These metabolic improvements occurred with increased L-aspartate levels in the liver that transported from the gut. The administration of L-aspartate in vitro or in mice displayed the similar beneficial metabolic effects mentioned above and efficiently ameliorated MAFLD. Together, these data indicate that the anti-MAFLD activity of A. muciniphila correlated with lipid oxidation and improved gut\u2013liver interactions through regulating the metabolism of L-aspartate.

These findings may uncover the role of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and identify novel noninvasive diagnostic tools for NAFLD based on microbial biomarkers. ABSTRACT Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent and progressive disease spectrum ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet there is no effective treatment and efficient noninvasive diagnostic method for NASH. The present study investigated the longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in the Western diet (WD) induced murine NAFLD model using 16S rRNA sequencing. Evident steatosis and inflammation were detected in the liver at the 8th and 12th week, while prompted hepatic oxidative injury and fibrosis were found at the 16th week. In this progressive process, impaired bile acid (BA) metabolism plays a vital part. Long-term WD intervention alters microbial richness and composition in the intestine, shaping characteristic microbial feature correspondence to each NAFLD stage. Descending abundances of Clostridia and Ruminococcaceae were found in NAFLD progression, while inflammation-related microbes [Eubacterium]_fissicatena_group, Romboutsia, and Erysipelatoclostridium were verified to identify borderline NASH at 8th and 12th week, and BA-associated taxa Dubosiella, Bosea, Helicobacter, and Alistipes were recognized as special symbols reflecting the state of oxidative damage and fibrosis in NASH at 16th week. Further, feces and colon abundances of Akkermansia were verified to be depleted in the process of borderline NASH progressed to NASH, and exhibited substantial correlations with NAFLD indexes ALT, AST, TC, and TBA. These characteristic taxa were effective to identify NAFLD and NASH, and microbiota-derived predictive models for NAFLD and NASH exhibited great potential (AUC 0.983 and 0.784). These findings demonstrate that a core set of gut microbiome especially BA-related taxa may be adopted as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for NAFLD and NASH.

            "abstract": "This study concentrates on longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and discovers the interrelationships between them. These findings may uncover the role of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and identify novel noninvasive diagnostic tools for NAFLD based on microbial biomarkers. ABSTRACT Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent and progressive disease spectrum ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet there is no effective treatment and efficient noninvasive diagnostic method for NASH. The present study investigated the longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in the Western diet (WD) induced murine NAFLD model using 16S rRNA sequencing. Evident steatosis and inflammation were detected in the liver at the 8th and 12th week, while prompted hepatic oxidative injury and fibrosis were found at the 16th week. In this progressive process, impaired bile acid (BA) metabolism plays a vital part. Long-term WD intervention alters microbial richness and composition in the intestine, shaping characteristic microbial feature correspondence to each NAFLD stage. Descending abundances of Clostridia and Ruminococcaceae were found in NAFLD progression, while inflammation-related microbes [Eubacterium]_fissicatena_group, Romboutsia, and Erysipelatoclostridium were verified to identify borderline NASH at 8th and 12th week, and BA-associated taxa Dubosiella, Bosea, Helicobacter, and Alistipes were recognized as special symbols reflecting the state of oxidative damage and fibrosis in NASH at 16th week. Further, feces and colon abundances of Akkermansia were verified to be depleted in the process of borderline NASH progressed to NASH, and exhibited substantial correlations with NAFLD indexes ALT, AST, TC, and TBA. These characteristic taxa were effective to identify NAFLD and NASH, and microbiota-derived predictive models for NAFLD and NASH exhibited great potential (AUC 0.983 and 0.784). These findings demonstrate that a core set of gut microbiome especially BA-related taxa may be adopted as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for NAFLD and NASH. IMPORTANCE This study concentrates on longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and discovers the interrelationships between them. These findings may uncover the role of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and identify novel noninvasive diagnostic tools for NAFLD based on microbial biomarkers.",
