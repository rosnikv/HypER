            "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

However, clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have yielded inconsistent results, and the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture-produced anti-inflammation are unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) on inflammation in a rat model.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFour experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8-9 per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw of the rat. Experiment 1: To determine the effect of EA (10 and 100 Hz) versus sham treatment on inflammation. Experiment 2: To investigate the involvement of the adrenal glands on the effect of EA treatment using adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. Experiment 3: To determine the effects of EA on plasma levels of corticosterone. Experiment 4: To determine the effects of EA treatment versus immobilization on such stress indicators as heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 10 Hz EA significantly reduced CFA-induced hind paw edema. The effect was partially blocked in the ADX rats.

To induce ankle sprain in Sprague-Dawley rats, the ankle of right hindpaw was overextended in direction of simultaneous inversion and plantar flexion. Stepping force and edema in the paw of the sprained ankle were measured by electronic balance and plethysmometer, respectively.

To examine the underlying mechanisms of the acupuncture-induced analgesia, the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on weight-bearing forces (WBR) of the affected foot and dorsal horn neuron activities were examined in a rat model of ankle sprain. Ankle sprain was induced manually by overextending ligaments of the left ankle in the rat. Dorsal horn neuron responses to ankle movements or compression were recorded from the lumbar spinal cord using an in vivo extracellular single unit recording setup 1 day after ankle sprain. EA was applied to the SI-6 acupoint on the right forelimb (contralateral to the sprained ankle) by trains of electrical pulses (10 Hz, 1-ms pulse width, 2-mA intensity) for 30 min. After EA, WBR of the sprained foot significantly recovered and dorsal horn neuron activities were significantly suppressed in ankle-sprained rats. However, EA produced no effect in normal rats. The inhibitory effect of EA on hyperactivities of dorsal horn neurons of ankle-sprained rats was blocked by the \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (5 mg/kg ip) but not by the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (10 mg/kg ip). These data suggest that EA-induced analgesia in ankle sprain pain is mediated mainly by suppressing dorsal horn neuron activities through \u03b1-adrenergic descending inhibitory systems at the spinal level.",

Currently to examine the underlying mechanisms of the EA-induced analgesia, the effects of EA on weight-bearing forces(WBR) were examined at ankle sprain classified as grade 3 in rats. Methods : The severe ankle sprain classified as grade 3 was induced surgically by ankle ligament injury in the Sprague-Dawley rats. WBR of the affected foot were examined to evaluate effects and mechanism of EA(2 Hz, 1 ms pulse width, 2 mA intensity, for 15 min) which was applied to either SI6, GB34, or GB39 acupoints. The rats were pretreated with naltrexone(10 mg/kg, i.p.) as an opioid receptor antagonist or phentolamine(5 mg/kg, i.p) as an -adrenoceptor antagonist at 30 min before EA. Results : The daily repeat EA at either SI6, GB34, or GB39 showed significant analgesic effects on the severe ankle sprain. Particularly, daily EA at GB34 showed more potent analgesic effect than the others. In addition, the naltrexone pretreatment completely blocked the analgesic effect of EA at GB34, indicating the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in mediating the effect of EA at GB34. However, the phentolamine pretreament blocked analgesic effects of EA at either SI6 or GB39, indicating the involvement of -adrenoceptors in mediating the effect of EA at either SI6 or GB39. Conclusions : These data suggest that EA-induced analgesia on ankle sprain pain is mediated through either endogenous opioids or -adrenoceptors dependant on acupoint specific pattern.",

            "abstract": "Objectives : The objectives of this study is to compare the effects of electroacupuncture(EA), warm needling(WN) and Radio Frequency warm needling(RFWN) stimulations on the acupoints at the artificially damaged ankles of Sprague-Dawley rats, which could be classified as the Grade 3. Methods : The foot weight bearing force ratio(FWBFR) of ankle sprain was measured first at 24 hours after without any other stimulations. Pain Recovery Index(PRI) represents the analgesic level, and modified Pain Recovery Index(mPRI) shows the accumulated recovery level. PRI was measured at 2 hours after each stimulus on GB34, GB39 and GB42, and mPRI was during 7 days. Results : EA stimulation of GB34 and GB39 acupoint in grade 3 ankle sprain showed a marked analgesic and recovery effect. RFWN of GB42 exhibited significant analgesic and pain recovery effect. RFWN of GB34 resulted in pain recovery effect but not analgesic effects, and RFWN of GB39 resulted in analgesic effect 2 hours after but not pain recovery. However, WN did not affect the pain recovery among three acupoints at all. Conclusions : In the Grade 3 ankle sprain model, the difference of analgesic effects were explained by the acupoints and the stimulation methods according to the accumulated recovery effects during 7 days. It is insufficient to determine that a certain acupoint has a specific analgesic effect depending on the stimulation method by the results of this study. Therefore, the effects of each stimulation on the acupoints in any other meridians at the sprained ankle should be compared and analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Objectives : The purpose of this study was to investigate the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture(EA) and radio-frequency warm needling(RFWN) stimulation in acupoint combination on ankle sprained pain in rats. Methods : The lateral ligaments of the Sprague-Dawley rats ankle were injured surgically resulting in sprain, of which was divided into EA, RFWN treatment groups and control group without treatment. The level of pain was measured through foot weight bearing force ratio followed by calculating pain relief. To stimulate proximal or distal area in ankle sprain, combination of proximal acupoints(GB34-GB39) and distal acupoints(GB39-GB42) from sprain area were applied, respectively, to either EA or RFWN stimulation. In addition, naltrexone or phentolamine was injected intraperitoneally before the stimulation to observe the pathway of analgesic effects. Results : In the proximal combination of GB34-GB39, EA and RFWN significantly increased pain relief compared to the control group (p \uff1c 0.05). However, in distal combination with GB39-GB42, both EA and RFWN stimulation did not relieve pain due to ankle sprains. In the combination of GB34-GB39, the analgesia of EA was inhibited by blockade of the \u03b1 -adrenoceptor receptor. The analgesia of RFWN was inhibited by blockade of the \u03b1 -adrenoceptor receptor as well as \u03bc -opioid receptor. Conclusions : We observed that the proximal combination was effective in relieving pain when the treatment by acupoint combination was applied to the ankle sprain pain. Also, it was confirmed that this analgesia was also related to the pathways of \u03bc -opioid receptors and/or \u03b1 -adrenoceptors.",
