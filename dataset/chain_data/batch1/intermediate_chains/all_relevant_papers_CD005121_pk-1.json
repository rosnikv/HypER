        "abstract": "The two major advances over the 1990s in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were a shift in strategy from a \"pyramid\", in which disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were deferred for several years, to the early aggressive use of DMARDs and widespread acceptance of methotrexate as the DMARD with the most long-term effectiveness and safety. Methotrexate courses are continued far longer than those of any other DMARD, an excellent indicator of greater effectiveness and safety. In one recent series, methotrexate was the first DMARD used in more than 80% of patients with RA. Studies which document the superiority of combinations of methotrexate with biological agents to methotrexate monotherapy select for only a minority of contemporary patients with RA who have severe disease activity and incomplete responses to methotrexate. In one locale, only 5% of patients met criteria for the Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Trial in RA with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) trial and only 30% met the criteria for the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (ERA) trial. In studies comparing methotrexate directly with biological agents, the biological agents have greater efficacy in patients with very severe disease, but the best results are seen in patients who take a combination of methotrexate and biologic agents. These data establish that methotrexate is the anchor drug and probably should be the first DMARD used in the majority of patients with RA at this time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\u2002Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) play key proinflammatory roles in a variety of human diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a naturally occurring structural variant of IL-1 that competitively inhibits receptor binding of IL-1. Four forms of IL-1Ra have been described: secretory IL-1Ra (sIL-1Ra) and three intracellular molecules (icIL-1Ra1, 2, and 3). Excess amounts of IL-1Ra are necessary to inhibit the biological effects of IL-1. The endogenous production of IL-1Ra plays an anti-inflammatory role, but the level of production of IL-1Ra in inflamed tissues may not be adequate to block IL-1 effectively. An allelic polymorphism in the IL-1Ra gene is associated with a variety of human diseases, largely of epithelial or endothelial cell origin. The disease associated allele IL1RN*2 may lead to a decreased production of icIL-1Ra1 by these cells, predisposing the patient to an imbalance in the IL-1 system. The therapeutic administration of IL-1Ra was found to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of RA. Intraarticular delivery of the IL-1Ra cDNA by ex vivo gene therapy in patients with RA was effective in enhancing local IL-1Ra production. This unique form of therapy is under further evaluation.",

        "abstract": "The progress in defining the immunological and inflammatory mechanisms that lead to the progressive joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [1,2] has led to the development of new inhibitory drugs. Large randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of the new treatments and led to the recent approval of several new drugs by American and European health authorities. These are the COX2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib, the anti-metabolite leflunomide, and the \u2018biologicals\u2019, the TNFa neutralizing substances etanercept and infliximab and the IL1-receptor antagonist anakinra. At the same time, epidemiological investigations have started to describe the socio-economic consequences of inflammatory joint diseases, which often start at a young age and lead to retirement in 50% of the patients in the initial 3 years of the disease [3]. Analysing the outcome of patients with RA, responsive or not to methotrexate (MTX) treatment, it could be shown that compared with age-matched healthy persons, patients with RA without efficient treatment have a )4-fold increased standardized mortality ratio. This is reduced to 1.5-fold by MTX and probably other efficient treatments [4]. For the evaluation of the patient before and during treatment, the DAS28 (disease activity score) has been developed as a standardized evaluation instrument using the swollen and tender joint count of 28 joints, the serologic inflammation and the patients self assessment of pain [5]. Since the nephrologist will see many patients with rheumatic disorders, it is useful to stay updated on recent progress in rheumatology.",

Anakinra is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but its therapeutic potential has not been proved in patients with SLE. Objective: To determine the safety/tolerability and efficacy of anakinra in patients with SLE with leading joint involvement. Methods: In patients with SLE with active polyarthritis and no other uncontrolled systemic/organ manifestations, 100 mg/day anakinra was self administered subcutaneously for 3 months. Disease activity was assessed by VAS, number of swollen/tender joints, ECLAM score, and serological and immunological measures. Results: Four patients with SLE were studied; anakinra was safe in all four patients and no drug related serious adverse events occurred. A subjective benefit was seen in all patients and a trend towards better activity measures after 4 weeks. After an initial response, one patient left the study because of an arthritic flare after 6 weeks. Conclusion: In this study anakinra was apparently safe and well tolerated and led to clinical and serological improvement. Anakinra might be an interesting alternative in individual patients with lupus arthritis not responding to conventional treatments.",

In rheumatoid arthritis, for example, these biological agents rapidly reduce signs and symptoms of joint inflammation and profoundly slow the progression of joint damage. However, data that have emerged following Food and Drug Administration approval of these agents have alerted clinicians to an increased likelihood of opportunistic infections in patients treated with these agents, particularly tuberculosis. The effect of TNF inhibition on the frequency of infection with more common bacterial pathogens is less clear. Animal models of tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections have demonstrated the importance of TNF-\u03b1 in controlling and containing intracellular pathogens. The spectrum of infections reported to date in the setting of anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment is reviewed here.

Outcomes from 6-month assessments were grouped into four categories: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, patient-reported measures (patient-reported pain, patient global assessment, and assessment of physical function using the Health Assessment Questionnaire), physician-reported measures (tender and swollen joint counts and physician global assessment), and laboratory tests (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Effect sizes were calculated using changes from baseline and pooled standard deviations for each of these types of outcome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActive treatment with anakinra was superior to placebo by ACR(20) responses in all three RCTs. Effect sizes for patient-reported outcomes were greater than for physician-reported outcomes, and also greater than ACR(20) in three of five anakinra cohorts. Across the RCTs, placebo responses were greater with physician-reported than with patient-reported outcomes. In the two studies evaluating patients with longer-standing disease, differences between pooled effect sizes for patient-reported and physician-reported outcomes were even more pronounced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn three pivotal RCTs, active treatment with anakinra resulted in greater improvements in patient-reported than physician-reported outcomes compared with placebo.

        "abstract": "A significant body of experimental evidence has implicated the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 in the pathogenesis of RA. For example, IL-1beta overexpression in rabbit knee joints causes arthritis with clinical and histological features characteristic of RA, whereas IL-1 deficiency is associated with reduced joint damage. In experimental models, IL-1 blockers, including IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), significantly reduce clinical and histological disease parameters. In RA patients, plasma and synovial fluid concentrations of IL-1 are elevated, and these correlate with various parameters of disease activity. The production of endogenous IL-1Ra, however, appears to be insufficient to balance these higher IL-1 levels. The efficacy of blocking IL-1 in patients with active RA has been established in controlled clinical trials of anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1Ra (r-metHuIL-1ra). When used alone or in combination with methotrexate, anakinra significantly reduces the clinical signs and symptoms of RA compared with placebo.

        "abstract": "The past decade has seen a shift in the paradigm for RA management. DMARDs have been introduced at earlier stages of disease in an effort to slow or stop radiographic disease progression before irreversible joint damage, work disability, functional decline and other adverse outcomes are seen. Although often effective, DMARDs have been limited in treatment durability over the long term due to side-effects and declining efficacy. Combination regimens, often involving weekly methotrexate as the anchor drug, have been used increasingly to overcome the limitations of DMARD monotherapy. The advent of biological therapies that specifically target key proinflammatory cytokines, believed to be important in disease pathogenesis, provides several new treatment options. In controlled clinical trials, the IL-1 blocker anakinra (r-metHuIL-1ra) significantly reduced the clinical signs and symptoms of RA when used alone or in combination with weekly methotrexate. The TNF inhibitors etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab have shown similar efficacy; indeed, higher response rates for clinical and radiological parameters have been seen with the TNF blockers. Importantly, each of these biological response modifiers significantly reduced radiographic disease progression in 6- to 12-month studies, and some radiographic data extend to 24 months. Despite these promising findings, it remains to be determined whether slowing radiographic progression will translate into significant improvements in long-term outcomes.",

Patients with RA with a wide range of comorbid conditions, disease activity, and background medications were randomly assigned in a 4:1 allocation ratio to treatment with anakinra 100 mg or placebo administered daily by injection. Safety was assessed by comparing adverse event profiles between anakinra and placebo patients according to concomitant medications received.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnakinra patients (n = 1116) showed no difference in the incidence of upper respiratory infections or overall serious adverse events compared with placebo patients (n = 283). The anakinra group had more injection site reactions (72.6% vs 32.9% in placebo) and a small increase in serious infections (2.1% vs 0.4% in placebo). Anakinra's safety profile did not differ in patients receiving antihypertensive, antidiabetic, or statin drugs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study indicates that anakinra has a good safety profile in patients typically seen in a rheumatology practice who are considered candidates for therapy with agents that are immunomodulatory and disease modifying. Except for injection site reactions and a nonstatistically although potentially clinically significant increase in serious infections in the anakinra versus the placebo groups, the addition of anakinra to a stable background regimen of RA medications introduced no other important safety risk in patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the efficacy of single and combined blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and RANKL pathways on synovial inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction in a TNF-driven arthritis model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHuman TNF-transgenic (hTNFtg) mice were treated with anti-TNF (infliximab), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; anakinra), or osteoprotegerin (OPG; an OPG-Fc fusion protein), either alone or in combinations of 2 agents or all 3 agents. Synovial inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage damage were evaluated histologically.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSynovial inflammation was inhibited by anti-TNF (-51%), but not by IL-1Ra or OPG monotherapy. The combination of anti-TNF with either IL-1Ra (-91%) or OPG (-81%) was additive and almost completely blocked inflammation. Bone erosion was effectively blocked by anti-TNF (-79%) and OPG (-60%), but not by IL-1Ra monotherapy. The combination of anti-TNF with IL-1Ra, however, completely blocked bone erosion (-98%). Inhibition of bone erosion was accompanied by a reduction of osteoclast numbers in synovial tissue. Cartilage destruction was inhibited by anti-TNF (-43%) and was weakly, but not significantly, inhibited by IL-1Ra, but was not inhibited by OPG monotherapy. The combination of anti-TNF with IL-1Ra was the most effective double combination therapy in preventing cartilage destruction (-80%). In all analyses, the triple combination of anti-TNF, IL-1Ra, and OPG was not superior to the double combination of anti-TNF and IL-1Ra.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nArticular changes caused by chronic overexpression of TNF are not completely blockable by monotherapies that target TNF, IL-1, or RANKL. However, combined approaches, especially the combined blockade of TNF and IL-1 and, to a lesser extent, TNF and RANKL, lead to almost complete remission of disease. Differences in abilities to block synovial inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction further strengthen the rationale for using combined blockade of more than one proinflammatory pathway.",
