We examined the effect of hormone therapy on mean and VVV of BP in postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trials. Methods: BP was measured at baseline and annually in the two WHI hormone therapy trials, in which 10\u200a739 and 16\u200a608 postmenopausal women were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs, 0.625\u200amg/day) or placebo, and CEEs and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 2.5\u200amg/day) or placebo, respectively. Results: At the first annual visit (year 1), mean SBP was 1.04\u200ammHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58, 1.50] and 1.35\u200ammHg (95% CI 0.99, 1.72) higher in the CEEs and CEEs and MPA arms, respectively, compared with the corresponding placebos. These effects remained stable after year 1. CEEs also increased the VVV of SBP (ratio of VVV in CEEs vs. placebo, 1.03; P\u200a<\u200a0.001), whereas CEEs and MPA did not (ratio of VVV in CEEs and MPA vs. placebo, 1.01; P\u200a=\u200a0.20). After accounting for study drug adherence, the effects of CEEs and CEEs and MPA on mean SBP increased at year 1, and the differences in the CEEs and CEEs and MPA arms vs. placebos also continued to increase after year 1. Further, both CEEs and CEEs and MPA significantly increased the VVV of SBP (ratio of VVV in CEEs vs. placebo, 1.04; P\u200a<\u200a0.001; ratio of VVV in CEEs and MPA vs. placebo, 1.05; P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Conclusion: Among postmenopausal women, CEEs and CEEs and MPA at conventional doses increased mean and VVV of SBP.",

            "abstract": "Perinatal growth restriction (GR) is associated with heightened sympathetic tone and hypertension. We have previously shown that naturally occurring neonatal GR programmes hypertension in male but not female mice. We therefore hypothesized that intact ovarian function or post-ovariectomy (OVX) oestrogen administration protects GR female mice from hypertension. Utilizing a non-interventional model that categorizes mice with weanling weights below the tenth percentile as GR, control and GR adult mice were studied at three distinct time points: baseline, post-OVX and post-OVX with oral oestrogen replacement. OVX elicited hypertension in GR mice that was significantly exacerbated by psychomotor arousal (systolic blood pressure at light to dark transition: control 122 \u00b1 2; GR 119 \u00b1 2; control-OVX 116 \u00b1 3; GR-OVX 126 \u00b1 3 mmHg). Oestrogen partially normalized the rising blood pressure surge seen in GR-OVX mice (23 \u00b1 7% reduction). GR mice had left ventricular hypertrophy, and GR-OVX mice in particular had exaggerated bradycardic responses to sympathetic blockade. For GR mice, a baseline increase in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and high frequency spectral power support a vagal compensatory mechanism, and that compensation was lost following OVX. For GR mice, the OVX-induced parasympathetic withdrawal was partially restored by oestrogen (40 \u00b1 25% increase in high frequency spectral power, P<0.05). In conclusion, GR alters cardiac morphology and cardiovascular regulation. The haemodynamic consequences of GR are attenuated in ovarian-sufficient or oestrogen-replete females. Further investigations are needed to define the role of hormone replacement therapy targeted towards young women with oestrogen deficiency and additional cardiovascular risk factors, including perinatal GR, cardiac hypertrophy and morning surge hypertension.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that maternal hypertension during pregnancy sensitizes an angiotensin (ANG) II-induced increase in blood pressure (BP) in adult male offspring that was associated with upregulation of mRNA expression of several renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components and NADPH oxidase in the lamina terminalis (LT) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The purpose of the present study was to test whether there are sex differences in the maternal hypertension-induced sensitization of ANG II hypertension, and whether sex hormones are involved in the sensitization process. Male offspring of hypertensive dams showed an enhanced hypertensive response to systemic ANG II when compared with male offspring of normotensive dams and to female offspring of either normotensive or hypertensive dams. Castration did not alter the hypertensive response to ANG II in male offspring. Intact female offspring had no upregulation of RAAS components and NADPH oxidase in the LT and PVN, whereas ovariectomy (OVX) upregulated mRNA expression of several RAAS components and NADPH oxidase in these nuclei and induced a greater increase in the pressor response to ANG II in female offspring of hypertensive dams compared with female offspring of normotensive dams. This enhanced increase in BP was partially attenuated by 17\u03b2-estradiol replacement in the OVX offspring of hypertensive dams. The results suggest that maternal hypertension induces a sex-specific sensitization of ANG II-induced hypertension and mRNA expression of brain RAAS and NADPH oxidase in offspring. Female offspring are protected from maternal hypertension-induced sensitization of ANG II hypertension, and female sex hormones are partially responsible for this protective effect.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that maternal hypertension during pregnancy sensitizes an angiotensin (ANG) II-induced increase in blood pressure (BP) in adult male offspring that was associated with upregulation of mRNA expression of several renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components and NADPH oxidase in the lamina terminalis (LT) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The purpose of the present study was to test whether there are sex differences in the maternal hypertension-induced sensitization of ANG II hypertension, and whether sex hormones are involved in the sensitization process. Male offspring of hypertensive dams showed an enhanced hypertensive response to systemic ANG II when compared with male offspring of normotensive dams and to female offspring of either normotensive or hypertensive dams. Castration did not alter the hypertensive response to ANG II in male offspring. Intact female offspring had no upregulation of RAAS components and NADPH oxidase in the LT and PVN, whereas ovariectomy (OVX) upregulated mRNA expression of several RAAS components and NADPH oxidase in these nuclei and induced a greater increase in the pressor response to ANG II in female offspring of hypertensive dams compared with female offspring of normotensive dams. This enhanced increase in BP was partially attenuated by 17\u03b2-estradiol replacement in the OVX offspring of hypertensive dams. The results suggest that maternal hypertension induces a sex-specific sensitization of ANG II-induced hypertension and mRNA expression of brain RAAS and NADPH oxidase in offspring. Female offspring are protected from maternal hypertension-induced sensitization of ANG II hypertension, and female sex hormones are partially responsible for this protective effect.",

            "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with a greater prevalence of hypertension and an earlier age at menopause in women in later life. Yet, the association between birth weight and blood pressure (BP) in women as they age is not well defined. In a rodent model of low birth weight induced by placental insufficiency, intrauterine growth restriction programs a significant increase in BP by 12 months of age in female growth-restricted offspring that is associated with early reproductive senescence, increased testosterone, and a shift in the hormonal milieu. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that increased BP in female growth-restricted offspring is abolished by chronic estradiol supplementation. Placebo or 17&bgr;-estradiol valerate mini pellets (1.5 mg for 60-day release) were administered at 12 months of age for 6 weeks. BP, measured in conscious catheterized rats, was significantly increased in placebo-treated growth-restricted relative to placebo-treated control. However, BP was not elevated in estradiol-treated growth-restricted relative to placebo-treated growth-restricted. Estradiol mediates its effects on BP via its receptors and the renin-angiotensin system. BP was decreased in growth-restricted offspring treated with a G-protein coupled receptor agonist, G1 (400 mg/kg for 2 weeks). Renal AT1aR (angiotensin type 1a receptor) and AT1bR (angiotensin type 1b receptor) and renal AR (androgen receptor) mRNA expression were elevated in vehicle-treated growth-restricted offspring, but not in G1-treated growth-restricted. Therefore, these data suggest that chronic estradiol supplementation prevents the increase in BP that develops in female growth-restricted offspring via actions that may involve its G-protein coupled receptor and the renin-angiotensin system.",

            "abstract": "Stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) improves fetal growth at gestational day 20 in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rat model of placental ischemia suggesting a role for sGC in the etiology of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). This study tested the hypothesis that stimulation of sGC until birth attenuates asymmetric IUGR mitigating increased cardiovascular risk in offspring. Sham or RUPP surgery was performed at gestational day 14 (G14); vehicle or sGC stimulator, Riociguat (10mg/kg/day, s.c.) were administered G14 until birth. Birth weight was reduced in offspring from RUPP (intrauterine growth restricted or IUGR), sGC RUPP (sGC IUGR), and sGC Sham (sGC Control) compared to Sham (Control). Crown circumference was maintained but abdominal circumference was reduced in IUGR and sGC IUGR compared to Control indicative of asymmetrical growth. Gestational length was prolonged in sGC RUPP, and survival at birth was reduced in sGC IUGR. Probability of survival to postnatal day 2 was also significantly reduced in IUGR and sGC IUGR versus Control, and in sGC IUGR versus IUGR. At 4 months of age blood pressure was increased in male IUGR and sGC IUGR, but not male sGC Control born with symmetrical IUGR. Global longitudinal strain was increased and stroke volume was decreased in male IUGR and sGC IUGR compared to Control. Thus, late gestational stimulation of sGC does not mitigate asymmetric IUGR or increased cardiovascular risk in male sGC IUGR. Furthermore, late gestational stimulation of sGC is associated with symmetrical growth restriction in sGC Control implicating contraindications in normal pregnancy.",
