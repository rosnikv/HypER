Group A was treated while Group B served as a no\u2010treatment control group. After 9 weeks Group B was treated too. Analgesic consumption, pain and objective measurements were registered. All objective measures were done by investigators who were \u201cblinded\u201d as to Group A & B. In the second part of the study 17 patients (26 knees) continued with treatments once a month. Registration of analgesic consumption, pain and objective measurements continued. Total study period 49 weeks. Results: Comparing Group A to B there was a significant reduction in pain, analgesic consumption and in most objective measures. In Group A + B combined there was an 80% subjective improvement, and a significantly increased knee range movement \u2013 an increase mainly in the worst knees. Results were significantly better in those who had not been ill for a long time. In the second part of the study, it was shown that it was possible to maintain the improvements. Conclusions: Acupuncture can ease the discomfort while waiting for an operation and perhaps even serve as an alternative to surgery. Seven patients have responded so well that at present they do not want an operation. (USD 9000 saved per operation).",

            "abstract": "This controlled trial used a prospective, randomised open design to compare the effectiveness of acupuncture and intra-articular injections in reducing chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. Thirty two patients awaiting hip arthroplasty with chronic pain of more than twelve months duration were included. Group A received acupuncture using a standardised technique of periosteal needling to the greater trochanter of the femur with three acupuncture needles. The treatment was repeated on three occasions at weekly intervals. Group B received an intra-articular/peri-articular hip injection of 20ml of 1% lignocaine + 80mg Depo-Medrone. Patients were assessed for pain intensity, mobility and pattern of analgesia usage pre-treatment and at one, two and four week intervals thereafter. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain intensity and analgesic usage following treatment. This decrease was greater in the acupuncture group. However, mobility remained unchanged in both groups. From the results of this study, periosteal acupuncture appears to be as effective as an intra-articular injection in relieving the pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. However, due to the small numbers involved, statistical significance was not achieved.",

            "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

In the first set of experiments, male Swiss mice were allocated into five groups: the control (sterile saline), dexamethasone (DEXA), invasive sham-acupuncture (non-acupoint), SP6 acupuncture and carrageenan-treated groups. Ten minutes after needle retention or 30\u2009min after DEXA treatment, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of carrageenan (750\u2009\u03bcg/mouse). After 4\u2009h, total leukocyte and differential cell counts (neutrophils and mononuclear), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, vascular permeability and cytokine levels were evaluated. In another set of experiments, adrenalectomized (ADX) mice were used to study the involvement of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic effects of acupuncture. Mice were allocated into two groups: the ADX and sham-operated animals (Sham ADX) that were subdivided into four subgroups each: the control (sterile saline), DEXA, SP6 acupuncture and carrageenan-treated groups. The SP6 and DEXA treatments inhibited the inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular permeability and MPO activity in carrageenan-injected mice. In addition, the SP6 treatment also increased interleukin (IL)-10 levels. In contrast, when the animals were adrenalectomized, the SP6 treatment failed to reduce total leukocyte and the plasma extravasation. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates the anti-inflammatory effect of SP6 acupuncture in a model of carrageenan-induced peritonitis. Our results demonstrated that SP6 acupuncture depends of the adrenal glands and increased IL-10 levels to produce its anti-inflammatory action.",

            "abstract": "Background Caffeine\u2019s properties as an analgesic adjuvant with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/acetaminophen are well documented. However, little clinical research has explored caffeine\u2019s effects on opioid analgesia. This study assessed the effects of caffeine consumption on pain and other symptoms in opioid-using and nonusing chronic pain patients meeting the survey criteria for fibromyalgia. Materials and methods Patients presenting to a university-based pain clinic completed validated self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms. Patients (N=962) meeting the fibromyalgia survey criteria were stratified by opioid use and further split into groups based on caffeine amount consumed per day (no caffeine, or low, moderate, high caffeine). Analysis of covariance with Dunnett\u2019s post hoc testing compared pain and symptom severity between the no caffeine group and the caffeine consuming groups. Results In opioid users, caffeine consumption had modest but significant effects on pain, catastrophizing, and physical function. Lower levels of pain interference were associated with low and moderate caffeine use compared to no caffeine intake. Lower pain catastrophizing and higher physical function were observed in all caffeine dose groups, relative to the no caffeine group. Lower pain severity and depression were observed only in the moderate caffeine group. In opioid nonusers, low caffeine intake was associated with higher physical function; however, no other significant effects were observed. Conclusion Caffeine consumption was associated with decreased pain and symptom severity in opioid users, but not in opioid nonusers, indicating caffeine may act as an opioid adjuvant in fibromyalgia-like chronic pain patients. These data suggest that caffeine consumption concomitant with opioid analgesics could provide therapeutic benefits not seen with opioids or caffeine alone.",

            "abstract": "Background Caffeine\u2019s properties as an analgesic adjuvant with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/acetaminophen are well documented. However, little clinical research has explored caffeine\u2019s effects on opioid analgesia. This study assessed the effects of caffeine consumption on pain and other symptoms in opioid-using and nonusing chronic pain patients meeting the survey criteria for fibromyalgia. Materials and methods Patients presenting to a university-based pain clinic completed validated self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms. Patients (N=962) meeting the fibromyalgia survey criteria were stratified by opioid use and further split into groups based on caffeine amount consumed per day (no caffeine, or low, moderate, high caffeine). Analysis of covariance with Dunnett\u2019s post hoc testing compared pain and symptom severity between the no caffeine group and the caffeine consuming groups. Results In opioid users, caffeine consumption had modest but significant effects on pain, catastrophizing, and physical function. Lower levels of pain interference were associated with low and moderate caffeine use compared to no caffeine intake. Lower pain catastrophizing and higher physical function were observed in all caffeine dose groups, relative to the no caffeine group. Lower pain severity and depression were observed only in the moderate caffeine group. In opioid nonusers, low caffeine intake was associated with higher physical function; however, no other significant effects were observed. Conclusion Caffeine consumption was associated with decreased pain and symptom severity in opioid users, but not in opioid nonusers, indicating caffeine may act as an opioid adjuvant in fibromyalgia-like chronic pain patients. These data suggest that caffeine consumption concomitant with opioid analgesics could provide therapeutic benefits not seen with opioids or caffeine alone.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: A preliminary, open label study was initiated to determine if oral wafers containing a combination of membrane glycerolphospholipids and controlled-release caffeine could reduce self-reported pain, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms and improve quality of life (QOL) indicators in fibromyalgia patients. Methods: Pain, fatigue and other symptoms were determined using validated, patient survey forms completed over an 8-day test period and compared to baseline values. Participants included 21 patients (15 females and 6 males) of average age of 48.5 \u00b1 9.8 years with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. These patients consumed four daily chewable wafers containing glycerolphospholipids (4.8 g) and one controlled-released caffeine (184 mg) wafer that maintained caffeine levels at approximately one cup of coffee for over 8 h. Results: Participants in the study responded to the combination test supplement within days. By the end of the study there were significant overall improvements (36.1%, p < 0.001), reductions in pain (27.2%, p < 0.001), fatigue (37.8%, p < 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (54.7%, p < 0.001) and improved ability to complete tasks and participate in activities (quality of life indicators) (39.1%, p < 0.001). Regression analysis of the data using a generalized mixed-effects model and calculating R2 values indicated that reductions in pain, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms and improvements in quality of life indicators were consistent, and occurred with a low degree of variance. Males responded slightly better to the combination supplement than females but for most parameters these differences were not significant. Conclusions: The combination membrane lipid replacement glycerolphospholipid supplement with controlled-release caffeine was safe and effective and significantly reduced pain, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as improved QOL indicators in fibromyalgia patients.",

When compared individually, CoQ10 with NTFL showed the most significant increase in absorption (2.01-times more compared to controls without NTFL, p=0.0011) at a concentration of NTFL of 10 mg/mL. NTFL also increased absorption and transfer across a Caco-2 cell layer of the other test nutrients, but these results did not achieve the same level of significance. \u00a0Discussion:\u00a0A variety of Oral membrane lipid replacement supplements with NTFL, such as various vitamins, minerals and nutrients, have been designed to reduce fatigue, improve health conditions, and protect cellular and especially mitochondrial membranes from damage.
