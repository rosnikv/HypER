            "abstract": "Statin therapy is well established for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins may also reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity via a pleiotropic (non\u2013lipid-lowering) effect. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to determine the influence of statin treatment on adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac, vascular, or noncardiovascular surgery. Two independent authors abstracted data from 12 retrospective and 3 prospective trials (n = 223,010 patients). A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the overall effect of preoperative statin therapy on postoperative outcomes. Preoperative statin therapy was associated with 38% and 59% reduction in the risk of mortality after cardiac (1.9% vs. 3.1%; P = 0.0001) and vascular (1.7% vs. 6.1%; P = 0.0001) surgery, respectively. When including noncardiac surgery, a 44% reduction in mortality (2.2% vs. 3.2%; P = 0.0001) was observed. Preoperative statin therapy may reduce postoperative mortality in patients undergoing surgical procedures. However, the statin associated effects on postoperative cardiovascular morbidity are too variable to draw any conclusion.",

            "abstract": "AIMS\nTo determine the strength of evidence for preoperative statin use for prevention of adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAfter literature search in major databases, 19 studies were identified [three RCT (randomized prospective clinical trials), 16 observational] that reported outcomes of 31 725 cardiac surgery patients with (n = 17 201; 54%) or without (n = 14 524; 46%) preoperative statin therapy. Outcomes that were analysed included early all-cause mortality (30-day mortality), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke and renal failure. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported using fixed or random effect models and publication bias was assessed. Preoperative statin therapy resulted in a 1.5% absolute risk reduction (2.2 vs. 3.7%; P < 0.0001) and 43% odds reduction for early all-cause mortality (OR 0.57; 95%CI: 0.49-0.67). A significant reduction (P < 0.01) in statin pretreated patients was also observed for AF (24.9 vs. 29.3%; OR 0.67, 95%CI: 0.51-0.88), stroke (2.1 vs. 2.9%, OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.60-0.91), but not for MI (OR 1.11; 95%CI: 0.93-1.33) or renal failure (OR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.46-1.31). Funnel plot and Egger's regression analysis (P = 0.60) excluded relevant publication bias.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur meta-analysis provides evidence that preoperative statin therapy exerts substantial clinical benefit on early postoperative adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery patients, but underscores the need for RCT trials.",

Early postoperative statin use was defined as statin treatment within the first postoperative day. Statin withdrawal was defined as the discontinuation of preoperative statin treatment before surgery until at least postoperative day 2. Logistic regression and propensity score modeling were used to control for AKI risk factors. Sixty-eight of 324 patients (21.0%) developed AKI. AKI patients stayed in the hospital longer (p = 0.03) and were more likely to develop pneumonia (p = 0.002) or die (p = 0.001). A higher body mass index (p = 0.003), higher central venous pressure (p = 0.03), and statin withdrawal (27.4 v 14.7%, p = 0.046) were associated with a higher incidence of AKI, whereas early postoperative statin use was protective (12.5% v 23.8%, p = 0.03). Preoperative statin use did not affect the risk of AKI. In multivariate logistic regression, age (p = 0.03), male sex (p = 0.02), body mass index (p < 0.001), and early postoperative statin use (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.72; p = 0.006) independently predicted AKI. Propensity score-adjusted risk assessment confirmed the association between early postoperative statin use and reduced AKI (odds ratio = 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.70; p = 0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly postoperative statin use is associated with a lower incidence of AKI among both chronic statin users and statin-naive cardiac surgery patients.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo test the hypothesis that perioperative statin use reduces acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from an ongoing clinical trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nA quaternary-care university hospital.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nThree hundred twenty-four adult elective cardiac surgery patients.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nNone.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nThe authors assessed the association of preoperative statin use, early postoperative statin use, and acute statin withdrawal with the incidence of AKI. Early postoperative statin use was defined as statin treatment within the first postoperative day. Statin withdrawal was defined as the discontinuation of preoperative statin treatment before surgery until at least postoperative day 2. Logistic regression and propensity score modeling were used to control for AKI risk factors. Sixty-eight of 324 patients (21.0%) developed AKI. AKI patients stayed in the hospital longer (p = 0.03) and were more likely to develop pneumonia (p = 0.002) or die (p = 0.001). A higher body mass index (p = 0.003), higher central venous pressure (p = 0.03), and statin withdrawal (27.4 v 14.7%, p = 0.046) were associated with a higher incidence of AKI, whereas early postoperative statin use was protective (12.5% v 23.8%, p = 0.03). Preoperative statin use did not affect the risk of AKI. In multivariate logistic regression, age (p = 0.03), male sex (p = 0.02), body mass index (p < 0.001), and early postoperative statin use (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.72; p = 0.006) independently predicted AKI. Propensity score-adjusted risk assessment confirmed the association between early postoperative statin use and reduced AKI (odds ratio = 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.70; p = 0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly postoperative statin use is associated with a lower incidence of AKI among both chronic statin users and statin-naive cardiac surgery patients.",

We examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and AKI in 445 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and whether oxidative stress (F(2)-isoprostanes), inflammation (IL-6), or antifibrinolysis (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) contribute to any identified relationship. Overall, 112 (25%) of the 445 patients developed AKI. Higher BMI was independently associated with increased odds of AKI (26.5% increase per 5 kg/m(2) [95% confidence interval, 4.3%-53.4%]; P=0.02).

BMI no longer predicted AKI after adjustment for the effect of F(2)-isoprostanes, suggesting that obesity may affect AKI via effects on oxidative stress.

Further, deconstruction of the obesity-AKI relationship into direct (i.e., independent of candidate pathways) and indirect (i.e., effect of BMI on AKI via each candidate pathway) effects indicated that F(2)-isoprostanes, but not IL-6 or PAI-1, partially mediate the relationship between obesity and AKI (P=0.001).

However, studies on outcome-modifying factors in geriatric patients with AKI are absent, especially the influence of body mass index (BMI). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multicenter observational cohort, which enrolled elderly (\u226565 years) who developed AKI after major surgery in the intensive care units. We analyzed in-hospital mortality within BMI category utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and generalized additive modeling. Results: Data of a total of 2,015 postoperative elderly patients were retrieved and analyzed. Generalized additive modeling showed that elderly AKI patients with a BMI between 21 and 31 kg/m2 (\u201cnormal\u201d) had a lower mortality risk than those with a BMI of less than 21 kg/m2 (\u201cunderweight\u201d) or 31 kg/m2 or greater (\u201cobese\u201d). Both \u201cunderweight\u201d and \u201cobese\u201d individuals had a greater risk of mortality compared with patients with \u201cnormal\u201d BMI. Conclusions: The U-shaped association of BMI with hospital mortality in geriatric AKI patients contains a widened base and a shifted nadir comparing with chronic dialysis and other AKI patients. This finding is interesting and warrants our attention.",

The presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) can accelerate energy-consuming processes, particularly in patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Thus, we aimed to investigate whether obesity can provide a survival benefit in this highly catabolic condition. Methods We conducted an observational study in 212 patients who had undergone CRRT owing to various causes of AKI between 2010 and 2014. The study end point was defined as death that occurred within 30 days after the initiation of CRRT. Results Patients were categorized into three groups according to tertiles of body mass index (BMI). During \u226530 days after the initiation of CRRT, 39 patients (57.4%) in the highest tertile died, as compared with 58 patients (78.4%) in the lowest tertile (P = 0.02). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for cofounding factors, the highest tertile of BMI was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37\u20130.87; P = 0.01). This significant association remained unaltered for 60-day (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43\u20130.94; P = 0.03) and 90-day mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44\u20130.97; P = 0.03).

Our aim is to report on the epidemiology and outcomes of obesity within a large heterogenous critically ill adult population. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand. Participants: Critically ill patients who had both height and weight recorded between 2010 and 2018. Outcome measures: Hospital mortality in each of five body mass index (BMI) strata. Subgroups analysed included diagnostic category, gender, age, ventilation status and length of stay. Results: Data were available for 381 855 patients, 68% of whom were overweight or obese. Increasing level of obesity was associated with lower unadjusted hospital mortality: underweight (11.9%), normal weight (7.7%), overweight (6.4%), class I obesity (5.4%), and class II obesity (5.3%). After adjustment, mortality was lowest for patients with class I obesity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74\u20130.82). Adverse outcomes with class II obesity were only seen in patients with cardiovascular and cardiac surgery ICU admission diagnoses, where mortality risk rose with progressively higher BMIs. Conclusion: We describe the epidemiology of obesity within a critically ill Australian and New Zealand population and confirm that some level of obesity is associated with lower mortality, both overall and across a range of diagnostic categories and important subgroups.

Adverse outcomes with class II obesity were only seen in patients with cardiovascular and cardiac surgery ICU admission diagnoses, where mortality risk rose with progressively higher BMIs. Conclusion: We describe the epidemiology of obesity within a critically ill Australian and New Zealand population and confirm that some level of obesity is associated with lower mortality, both overall and across a range of diagnostic categories and important subgroups. Further research should focus on potential confounders such as nutritional status and the appropriateness of BMI in isolation as an anthropometric measure in critically ill patients.",

            "abstract": "Objective: The apparent survival benefit of being overweight or obese in critically ill patients (the obesity paradox) remains controversial. Our aim is to report on the epidemiology and outcomes of obesity within a large heterogenous critically ill adult population. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand. Participants: Critically ill patients who had both height and weight recorded between 2010 and 2018. Outcome measures: Hospital mortality in each of five body mass index (BMI) strata. Subgroups analysed included diagnostic category, gender, age, ventilation status and length of stay. Results: Data were available for 381 855 patients, 68% of whom were overweight or obese. Increasing level of obesity was associated with lower unadjusted hospital mortality: underweight (11.9%), normal weight (7.7%), overweight (6.4%), class I obesity (5.4%), and class II obesity (5.3%). After adjustment, mortality was lowest for patients with class I obesity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74\u20130.82).

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Across guidelines, protein dosing for critically ill patients with obesity varies considerably. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether this population would benefit from higher doses of protein. DESIGN: A post hoc subgroup analysis of the effect of higher protein dosing in critically ill patients with high nutritional risk (EFFORT Protein): an international, multicenter, pragmatic, registry-based randomized trial. SETTING: Eighty-five adult ICUs across 16 countries. PATIENTS: Patients with obesity defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30\u2009kg/m2 (n = 425). INTERVENTIONS: In the primary study, patients were randomized into a high-dose (\u2265 2.2\u2009g/kg/d) or usual-dose protein group (\u2264 1.2\u2009g/kg/d). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Protein intake was monitored for up to 28 days, and outcomes (time to discharge alive [TTDA], 60-d mortality, days of mechanical ventilation [MV], hospital, and ICU length of stay [LOS]) were recorded until 60 days post-randomization. Of the 1301 patients in the primary study, 425 had a BMI greater than or equal to 30\u2009kg/m2. After adjusting for sites and covariates, we observed a nonsignificant slower rate of TTDA with higher protein that ruled out a clinically important benefit (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58\u20131.05; p = 0.10). We found no evidence of difference in TTDA between protein groups when subgroups with different classes of obesity or patients with and without various nutritional and frailty risk variables were examined, even after the removal of patients with baseline acute kidney injury. Overall, 60-day mortality rates were 31.5% and 28.2% in the high protein and usual protein groups, respectively (risk difference, 3.3%; 95% CI, \u20135.4 to 12.1; p = 0.46). Duration of MV and LOS in hospital and ICU were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with obesity, higher protein doses did not improve clinical outcomes, including those with higher nutritional and frailty risk.",
