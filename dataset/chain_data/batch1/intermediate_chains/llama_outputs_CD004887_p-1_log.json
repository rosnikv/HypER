            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a severe and frequent complication of cirrhosis. Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been shown to correct the prolonged prothrombin time in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB. This trial aimed to determine efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in cirrhotic patients with variceal and nonvariceal UGIB.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 245 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh < 13; Child-Pugh A = 20%, B = 52%, C = 28%) with UGIB (variceal = 66%, nonvariceal = 29%, bleeding source unknown = 5%) were randomized equally to receive 8 doses of 100 microg/kg rFVIIa or placebo in addition to pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment. The primary end point was a composite including: (1) failure to control UGIB within 24 hours after first dose, or (2) failure to prevent rebleeding between 24 hours and day 5, or (3) death within 5 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics were similar between rFVIIa and placebo groups. rFVIIa showed no advantage over standard treatment in the whole trial population. Exploratory analyses, however, showed that rFVIIa significantly decreased the number of failures on the composite end point (P = 0.03) and the 24-hour bleeding control end point (P = 0.01) in the subgroup of Child-Pugh B and C variceal bleeders. There were no significant differences between rFVIIa and placebo groups in mortality (5- or 42-day) or incidence of adverse events including thromboembolic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough no overall effect of rFVIIa was observed, exploratory analyses in Child-Pugh B and C cirrhotic patients indicated that administration of rFVIIa significantly decreased the proportion of patients who failed to control variceal bleeding. Dosing with rFVIIa appeared safe. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a severe and frequent complication of cirrhosis. Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been shown to correct the prolonged prothrombin time in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB. This trial aimed to determine efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in cirrhotic patients with variceal and nonvariceal UGIB.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 245 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh < 13; Child-Pugh A = 20%, B = 52%, C = 28%) with UGIB (variceal = 66%, nonvariceal = 29%, bleeding source unknown = 5%) were randomized equally to receive 8 doses of 100 microg/kg rFVIIa or placebo in addition to pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment. The primary end point was a composite including: (1) failure to control UGIB within 24 hours after first dose, or (2) failure to prevent rebleeding between 24 hours and day 5, or (3) death within 5 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics were similar between rFVIIa and placebo groups. rFVIIa showed no advantage over standard treatment in the whole trial population. Exploratory analyses, however, showed that rFVIIa significantly decreased the number of failures on the composite end point (P = 0.03) and the 24-hour bleeding control end point (P = 0.01) in the subgroup of Child-Pugh B and C variceal bleeders. There were no significant differences between rFVIIa and placebo groups in mortality (5- or 42-day) or incidence of adverse events including thromboembolic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough no overall effect of rFVIIa was observed, exploratory analyses in Child-Pugh B and C cirrhotic patients indicated that administration of rFVIIa significantly decreased the proportion of patients who failed to control variceal bleeding. Dosing with rFVIIa appeared safe. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\u2002 In recent years, the hemostatic agent recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has emerged as a potentially new therapeutic agent for management of coagulopathy in patients with cirrhosis or following severe traumatic injury, a complex problem for clinicians in which standard treatment strategies are not always effective. As with other hemostatic agents, a primary safety concern of rFVIIa therapy is the theoretical possibility that systemic administration could confer an increased risk of thrombotic complications. So far, clinical experience indicates rFVIIa to be a safe treatment for currently approved indications within hemophilia. Little information is available, however, for patient populations outside this clinical setting.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCoagulopathy is a consequence of severe trauma, especially in massively transfused patients (>or=10 units of red blood cells in 24 hours), and is associated with increased mortality. We hypothesized that recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) administered to massive transfusion patients before transfusion of 8 units of blood (early) would reduce transfusion requirements compared with rFVIIa after 8 units (late).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed records for trauma admissions to combat support hospitals in Iraq between January 2004 and October 2005. Patients requiring a massive transfusion and receiving rFVIIa were identified. Groups were divided into those who received rFVIIa early or late.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 5,334 trauma patients (civilian and military), 365 (6.8%) required massive transfusion. Of these, 117 (32%) received rFVIIa. Complete records for blood transfusions were available for 61 patients: 90% had penetrating trauma, 17 received rFVIIa early, and 44 received it late.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFibrinolysis contributes to coagulopathy after major trauma and surgery. We hypothesized that progressive haemodilution is responsible, at least in part, for increased fibrinolytic tendency of blood clot.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was performed in two parts. First, whole blood (WB) samples collected from six healthy, consented volunteers were diluted in vitro with either saline or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) to 40% and 15% of baseline. We quantified factor levels related to coagulation and fibrinolysis, and measured endogenous thrombin generation in undiluted control plasma samples and in samples diluted with saline or FFP. Additionally, thromboelastometry was used to assess susceptibility to fibrinolysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator in undiluted WB samples and in samples diluted with saline before and after substitution of fibrinogen or FFP. Secondly, as a model of in vivo haemodilution, we evaluated the same parameters before and after operation in nine consented patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe dilution with saline caused dose-dependent decreases in plasma levels of coagulation and antifibrinolytic factors, and in thrombin generation. In FFP-supplemented samples, factor levels and thrombin generation were maintained within normal ranges. Fibrinolytic tendency was significantly higher after haemodilution with saline independent of fibrinogen substitution compared with FFP. Similarly, increased tendency for fibrinolysis was also observed in the in vivo haemodilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that progressive haemodilution decreases endogenous antifibrinolytic proteins including alpha(2)-antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, resulting in increased fibrinolytic tendency. Therefore, early fluid replacement therapy with FFP might be advantageous after massive haemorrhage.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFibrinolysis contributes to coagulopathy after major trauma and surgery. We hypothesized that progressive haemodilution is responsible, at least in part, for increased fibrinolytic tendency of blood clot.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was performed in two parts. First, whole blood (WB) samples collected from six healthy, consented volunteers were diluted in vitro with either saline or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) to 40% and 15% of baseline. We quantified factor levels related to coagulation and fibrinolysis, and measured endogenous thrombin generation in undiluted control plasma samples and in samples diluted with saline or FFP. Additionally, thromboelastometry was used to assess susceptibility to fibrinolysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator in undiluted WB samples and in samples diluted with saline before and after substitution of fibrinogen or FFP. Secondly, as a model of in vivo haemodilution, we evaluated the same parameters before and after operation in nine consented patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe dilution with saline caused dose-dependent decreases in plasma levels of coagulation and antifibrinolytic factors, and in thrombin generation. In FFP-supplemented samples, factor levels and thrombin generation were maintained within normal ranges. Fibrinolytic tendency was significantly higher after haemodilution with saline independent of fibrinogen substitution compared with FFP. Similarly, increased tendency for fibrinolysis was also observed in the in vivo haemodilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that progressive haemodilution decreases endogenous antifibrinolytic proteins including alpha(2)-antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, resulting in increased fibrinolytic tendency. Therefore, early fluid replacement therapy with FFP might be advantageous after massive haemorrhage.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) on clot formation and resistance to fibrinolysis in hemodilution conditions. Citrated whole blood from 36 healthy volunteers was diluted to 30 and 60% with lactated Ringer's solution. Blood samples were subsequently supplemented with fibrinogen, FXIII, TAFI or their combinations. Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in whole blood and thrombin generation in plasma were performed in the presence of CaCl2 and tissue factor/EXTEM reagent, and fibrinolysis was induced by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Hemodilution was expressed by decrease of peak height in thrombin generation and &agr;-angle and maximum clot firmness (MCF) in ROTEM. Fibrinogen, FXIII or TAFI did not correct the decrease in thrombin generation peak height. In ROTEM, spiking of diluted blood with fibrinogen stimulated clot propagation. In tPA-treated blood fibrinogen, FXIII and TAFI increased clot firmness and inhibited fibrinolysis. Stronger protection against fibrinolysis was achieved combining FXIII with TAFI. Hemodilution was associated with inhibition of thrombin generation; however, this effect was not sensitive to blood spiking with fibrinogen, FXIII and TAFI. In ROTEM, these hemostasis agents improved clot strength and decreased clot susceptibility to tPA in nondiluted and to more extent in diluted blood. The maximal protection against fibrinolysis was caused by TAFI. Combining FXIII with TAFI exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on fibrinolysis.",

Results. Haemodilution with albumin significantly attenuated EXTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), alpha angle (AA), clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), and FIBTEM MCF (p < 0.001). Following haemodilution, both doses of fibrinogen significantly corrected all ROTEM parameters (p \u2264 0.02), except the lower dose did not correct AA.

Electron microscopy explained the gain of stiffness. Incorporated RBCs weakened the clots. Reduction of temperature during the clotting process supported the development of high moduli by providing more time for fiber assembly. But at low HCT, clot firmness could be increased by elevating the temperature from 32 to 37\u00b0C. In contrast, when the fibrinogen concentration was modified, acceleration of clotting via temperature always reduced clot stiffness, whatever the initial fibrinogen concentration. Electrical resistance increased continuously during clotting; loss tangent (D) (relaxation frequency 249\u200akHz) decreased when clots became denser: fewer dipoles contributed to the relaxation process. The relaxation peak (Dmax) shifted to lower frequencies at higher platelet count.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncreasing temperature accelerates clot formation but weakens clots. Rheometry and ROTEM correlate well.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDynamic mechanical analysis of blood clots can be used to detect the coagulability of blood.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe investigated the kinetics of clot formation by changing several blood components, and we looked into the clot \"signature\" at its equilibrium state by using viscoelastic and dielectric protocols.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOscillating shear rheometry, ROTEM, and a dielectro-rheological device was used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn fibrinogen- spiked samples we found the classical high clotting ability: shortened onset, faster rate of clotting, and higher plateau stiffness. Electron microscopy explained the gain of stiffness. Incorporated RBCs weakened the clots. Reduction of temperature during the clotting process supported the development of high moduli by providing more time for fiber assembly. But at low HCT, clot firmness could be increased by elevating the temperature from 32 to 37\u00b0C. In contrast, when the fibrinogen concentration was modified, acceleration of clotting via temperature always reduced clot stiffness, whatever the initial fibrinogen concentration. Electrical resistance increased continuously during clotting; loss tangent (D) (relaxation frequency 249\u200akHz) decreased when clots became denser: fewer dipoles contributed to the relaxation process. The relaxation peak (Dmax) shifted to lower frequencies at higher platelet count.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncreasing temperature accelerates clot formation but weakens clots. Rheometry and ROTEM correlate well.",

            "abstract": "Objective: There is uncertainty about deep vein thrombosis standard treatment as thrombus stiffness alters each case. Here, we investigated thrombus\u2019 stiffness of different compositions and ages using shear wave elastography (SWE). We then studied the effectiveness of ultrasound-thrombolysis on different thrombus compositions. Methods: Shear waves generated through mechanical shaker and traveled along thrombus of different hematocrit (HCT) levels, whereas 18-MHz ultrasound array used to detect wave propagation. Thrombus\u2019 stiffness was identified by the shear wave speed (SWS). In thrombolysis, a 3.2 MHz focused transducer was applied to different thrombus compositions using different powers. The thrombolysis rate was defined as the percentage of weight loss. Results: The estimated average SWS of 20%, 40%, and 60% HCT thrombus were 0.75 m/s, 0.44 m/s, and 0.32 m/s, respectively. For Thrombolysis, the percentage weight loss at 8 MPa Negative pressure for the same HCT groups were 23.1%, 35.29%, and 39.66% respectively. Conclusion: SWS is inversely related to HCT level and positively related to thrombus age. High HCT thrombus had higher weight loss compared to low HCT. However, the difference between 20% and 40% HCT was more significant than between 40% and 60% HCT in both studies. Our results suggest that thrombus with higher SWS require more power to achieve the same thrombolysis rate as thrombus with lower SWS. Significance: Characterizing thrombus elastic property undergoing thrombolysis enables evaluation of ultrasound efficacy for fractionating thrombus and reveals the appropriate ultrasound parameters selection to achieve a certain thrombolysis rate in the case of a specific thrombus stiffness.",
