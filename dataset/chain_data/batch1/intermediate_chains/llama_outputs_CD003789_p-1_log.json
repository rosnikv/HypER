The duration of the trial was two weeks and was a between-patient comparison of 25 mg t.i.d. diclofenac sodium, 25 mg t.i.d. indomethacin or placebo using a double-dummy technique. Forty-eight patients completed the trial. In the majority of parameters examined, diclofenac sodium was superior to placebo and indomethacin in therapeutic effect. One patient was withdrawn from the trial because of intolerance to indomethacin and one other because of severe joint pain under indomethacin therapy. Neither active compound caused clinically significant changes in blood picture or urine analysis.",

The drugs were given twice daily, morning and evening, during a period of two weeks. The daily dose was 100 mg for Voltaren and 500 mg for naproxen. The results indicate that Voltaren brought relief of pain and stiffness in a greater number of patients than did naproxen. The same finding was made regarding the influence on the range of joint movements, the difference reaching statistical significance. Voltaren appeared also to be better tolerated since the number of patients reporting side-effects was smaller and the complaints of less severity.",

An open tolerance study with endoscopic control employing fenclofenac in doses of 900 or 1200 mg daily in ten patients with osteoarthrosis, was carried out over an eight week period. The principal aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of fenclofenac on the gastroduodenal mucosa in a selected group of patients with osteoarthrosis and with a history of gastric intolerance to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. All patients tolerated fenclofenac well and showed clinical improvement.",

Although it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it does provide a broader context for understanding the gastrointestinal effects of NSAIDs, which is relevant to the source paper's investigation of fenclofenac's gastric tolerance. However, since it is a review paper, it does not present novel findings or hypotheses that directly depend on the source paper.",
