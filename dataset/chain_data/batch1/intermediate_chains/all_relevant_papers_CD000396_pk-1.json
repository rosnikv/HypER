        "title": "CT changes after conservative treatment for lumbar disk herniation.",
        "abstract": "In order to assess changes occurring to lumbar disk herniations and bulges and to the disk spaces after conservative treatment, a follow-up CT was carried out of 106 pathologic disks in 92 patients at a mean interval of 14 months after the initial examination. There was a strong association between the evolution of the hernias and clinical results, with a decrease in size of the majority of hernias in successfully treated patients, whereas the others essentially remained unchanged (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of large hernias diminished as compared to the smaller ones (p < 0.0001). Diffuse disk bulges were associated with a poor outcome and never regressed. There was a lower incidence of diminution of the central hernias compared to other locations. Patients with normal disk space at the initial examination had a better outcome than those with disk space narrowing. Only occasionally was a reduction of the disk space observed at follow-up.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the changes in lumbar disk herniations after conservative treatment, which is partially dependent on the understanding of the natural course of acute radiculopathy presented in the source paper. The paper's findings on the association between the evolution of hernias and clinical results can be seen as a sub-hypothesis of the source paper's findings."

        "title": "The natural history of disc herniation and the influence of intervention.",
        "abstract": "The natural history of lumbar disc herniation must be considered when evaluating the influence and outcome of intervention. The combination of clinical signs and symptoms and corresponding radiologic findings permits a more certain diagnostic conclusion compared with many other obscure back disorders. The relationship between low back pain and a herniated disc is unclear. Mechanical compression and chemical changes may be the source of nerve root symptoms. Studies have shown that the natural course of acute radiculopathy has a good prognosis. Bed rest, information, and analgesics usually are sufficient therapeutic measures. Prolongation of symptoms requires radiologic examination. The decision regarding continued conservative therapy versus surgical intervention must be evaluated. Chemonucleolysis and percutaneous nucleotomy are being used, but the indications are uncertain.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the natural history of lumbar disc herniation, which is relevant to the source paper's topic of acute sciatica with nerve root symptoms. The paper's discussion of the relationship between low back pain and herniated discs, as well as the role of conservative therapy, is inspired by the findings of the source paper."
