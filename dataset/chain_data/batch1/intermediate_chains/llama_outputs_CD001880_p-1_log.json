            "abstract": "Malnutrition has been often suggested as contributing to both the high incidence of hip fracture in elderly people and its complications. In a recent prospective controlled randomized study, the clinical outcome of elderly patients with osteoporotic fracture of the proximal femur (hip fracture) improved by giving a simple oral dietary supplement. This study, however, did not prove that protein was responsible for the clinical improvement since the supplement also contained vitamins and minerals. We addressed this question by comparing the clinical outcome and bone mineral density (BMD) changes in elderly patients with hip fracture, receiving two different dietary supplements with different protein contents. Sixty-two patients (mean age 82) admitted into the orthopedic ward for fracture of the proximal femur were randomized into two groups. One group (n = 33) received 250 ml/day of an oral nutritional supplement containing protein (20.4 g), mineral salts (Ca: 0.525 g) and vitamins A = 750 IU; D3 = 25 IU) for a mean of 38 days. A control group (n = 29) received the same supplement dose, but with no protein, for the same period of time. The clinical course was significantly better in the group receiving protein, with 79% having a favorable course as compared to 36% (p less than 0.02) in the control group during the stay in the recovery hospital. The rate of complications and deaths was also significantly lower in the protein-supplemented vs the control group (52 vs 80%, p less than 0.05) 7 months after hip fracture. The median hospital stay was significantly lower in the protein-supplemented group (69 vs 102 days, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

            "abstract": "Biological malnutrition was assessed and correlated with salivary flow rates and oral health in 99 elderly, hospitalised non-psychiatric patients. The indicators of protein malnutrition used were arm circumference and serum albumin level and the indicators of energy malnutrition the body mass-index and the triceps skin-fold thickness. Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates were measured according to Sreebny et al. Of the patients, 40% showed severely and 46% moderately reduced serum albumin levels and the anthropometric measurements indicated malnutrition in about 50%. Unstimulated hyposialia (< or = 0.1 ml/min) and stimulated hyposialia (< or = 0.5 ml/min) were observed in 17% and 26.5%, respectively. Significant associations (P < or = 0.05) were found between stimulated/unstimulated hyposialia and biological malnutrition. There was a negative relationship between the number of masticatory movements until swallowing a standard biscuit and skin fold thickness (P < or = 0.05). Current weight loss and biological malnutrition were related to poor appetite (P < or = 0.05). The study has confirmed poor general and oral health status as well as protein-energy malnutrition among elderly hospitalised patients. This situation was associated with loss of appetite, reduced salivary flow rates and a certain impairment of masticatory function which could jeopardise the reversibility of malnutrition and lead to increased morbidity and mortality.",

The nutritional status was assessed using serum albumin concentration and the body mass index. Physical dependence was assessed using the Barthel index. To identify oral health disorders associated with markers of malnutrition we performed the Pearson chi2 test separately for edentulous and dentate patients. Subjects with at least one of the identified oral disorders were classified as having compromised oral functional status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAbout two-thirds of the subjects were functionally dependent and half had either a body mass index <21 kg/m2 or serum albumin <33 g/l. Among the edentulous, wearing dentures with defective bases or not wearing dentures at all were the factors most associated with malnutrition. In dentate subjects, corresponding identifiers were the number of occluding pairs of teeth (five or fewer, either natural or prosthetic), the number of retained roots (four or more), and the presence of mobile teeth. According to these criteria, 31% of the subjects had a compromised oral functional status. This was more frequently found in dependent subjects (37%) than semi-dependent subjects (18%; odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.8). Those with compromised oral functional status had a significantly lower body mass index and serum albumin concentration.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSpecific detrimental oral conditions are associated with nutritional deficiency in very old people.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the relationship between oral health status and nutritional deficiency.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional clinical study.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\n324 institutionalized frail older adults (mean age 85).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nStructured oral examination including an evaluation of mucosa, periodontal state, caries prevalence and denture quality. The nutritional status was assessed using serum albumin concentration and the body mass index. Physical dependence was assessed using the Barthel index. To identify oral health disorders associated with markers of malnutrition we performed the Pearson chi2 test separately for edentulous and dentate patients. Subjects with at least one of the identified oral disorders were classified as having compromised oral functional status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAbout two-thirds of the subjects were functionally dependent and half had either a body mass index <21 kg/m2 or serum albumin <33 g/l. Among the edentulous, wearing dentures with defective bases or not wearing dentures at all were the factors most associated with malnutrition. In dentate subjects, corresponding identifiers were the number of occluding pairs of teeth (five or fewer, either natural or prosthetic), the number of retained roots (four or more), and the presence of mobile teeth. According to these criteria, 31% of the subjects had a compromised oral functional status. This was more frequently found in dependent subjects (37%) than semi-dependent subjects (18%; odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.8). Those with compromised oral functional status had a significantly lower body mass index and serum albumin concentration.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSpecific detrimental oral conditions are associated with nutritional deficiency in very old people.",
