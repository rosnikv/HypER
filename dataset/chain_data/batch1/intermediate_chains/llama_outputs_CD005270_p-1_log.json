            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nType 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS-DPP) has been delivered by four commercial organizations across England, to prevent people with impaired glucose tolerance developing Type 2 diabetes. Evidence reviews underpinning the NHS-DPP design specification identified 19 Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) that are the intervention \u201cactive ingredients.\u201d It is important to understand the discrepancies between BCTs specified in design and BCTs actually delivered. Purpose To compare observed fidelity of delivery of BCTs that were delivered to (a) the NHS-DPP design specification, and (b) the programme manuals of four provider organizations. Methods Audio-recordings were made of complete delivery of NHS-DPP courses at eight diverse sites (two courses per provider organization). The eight courses consisted of 111 group sessions, with 409 patients and 35 facilitators. BCT Taxonomy v1 was used to reliably code the contents of NHS-DPP design specification documents, programme manuals for each provider organization, and observed NHS-DPP group sessions. Results The NHS-DPP design specification indicated 19 BCTs that should be delivered, whereas only seven (37%) were delivered during the programme in all eight courses. By contrast, between 70% and 89% of BCTs specified in programme manuals were delivered. There was substantial under-delivery of BCTs that were designed to improve self-regulation of behavior, for example, those involving problem solving and self-monitoring of behavior. Conclusions A lack of fidelity in delivery to the underlying evidence base was apparent, due to poor translation of design specification to programme manuals. By contrast, the fidelity of delivery to the programme manuals was relatively good. Future commissioning should focus on ensuring the evidence base is more accurately translated into the programme manual contents.",

One explanation for this \u2018voltage drop', i.e. reduction in effectiveness, is a reduction in intervention fidelity, i.e. the extent to which a programme is implemented as intended. This article discusses how to optimise intervention fidelity in nationally implemented behaviour change programmes, using as an exemplar the National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS-DPP); a behaviour change intervention for adults in England at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, delivered by four independent provider organisations. We summarise key findings from a thorough fidelity evaluation of the NHS-DPP assessing design (whether programme plans were in accordance with the evidence base), training (of staff to deliver key intervention components), delivery (of key intervention components), receipt (participant understanding of intervention content), and highlight lessons learned for the implementation of other large-scale programmes. Results NHS-DPP providers delivered the majority of behaviour change content specified in their programme designs. However, a drift in fidelity was apparent at multiple points: from the evidence base, during programme commissioning, and on to providers\u2019 programme designs. A lack of clear theoretical rationale for the intervention contents was apparent in design, training, and delivery. Our evaluation suggests that many fidelity issues may have been less prevalent if there was a clear underpinning theory from the outset. Conclusion We provide recommendations to enhance fidelity of nationally implemented behaviour change programmes. The involvement of a behaviour change specialist in clarifying the theory of change would minimise drift of key intervention content. Further, as loss of fidelity appears notable at the design stage, this should be given particular attention.
