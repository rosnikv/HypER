            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a loading dose regimen of three intravenous infusions with infliximab in patients with active spondyloarthropathy. METHODS A monocentre, open-label pilot study of 21 patients with different subtypes of spondyloarthropathy was conducted. Treatment resistant patients with active disease (fulfilling inclusion criteria) received three infusions of 5 mg/kg infliximab (at weeks 0, 2, and 6). Standard clinical assessments were performed at baseline, and on days 3, 7, and 14, and from then on every two weeks. In patients who fulfilled criteria for ankylosing spondylitis, axial assessment was performed at baseline and on days 14, 42, and 84. RESULTS In all global assessments (visual analogue scale of patient global assessment, patient pain assessment, doctor global assessment), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein, a highly significant decrease could be seen already at day 3 (compared with baseline), which was maintained up to day 84. In patients with peripheral disease (n=18), tender and swollen joint count significantly decreased. In patients with axial disease (n=11), functional and disease activity indices significantly improved. Moreover in eight patients with psoriatic arthritis a significant decrease of the psoriasis area and severity index was observed. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients; no significant adverse events were seen. CONCLUSION In this open-label pilot study of a loading dose regimen of three infusions of chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 in patients with active spondyloarthropathy, there was a fast and significant improvement of axial and peripheral articular manifestations, without major adverse experiences.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effects of treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) on synovial histology in patients with spondylarthropathy (SpA) in order to confirm the effect on peripheral synovitis and to investigate the immunologic mechanisms involved in anti-TNFalpha therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with treatment-resistant SpA were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, and 6 in an open-label pilot study. In 8 patients, synovial biopsy tissues obtained at baseline, week 2, and week 12 were used for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn all 8 patients (3 with ankylosing spondylitis, 1 with undifferentiated SpA, and 4 with psoriatic arthritis), there was a clear clinical improvement in the peripheral arthritis after anti-TNFalpha therapy. Histologic analysis of the synovial biopsy tissues indicated that the synovial lining layer thickness tended to decrease, with a significant reduction of CD55+ synoviocytes, at week 12. In the sublining layer, vascularity was reduced at week 12, with a decreased endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 but not intercellular adhesion molecule 1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin. Although at week 2 and week 12, the number of neutrophils and CD68+ macrophages in the sublining layer was decreased, the overall degree of inflammatory infiltration remained unchanged. This could be related to the lymphocyte infiltration since at week 12, only CD4+ cells (but not CD3+, CD45RO+, and CD8+ cells) tended to decrease, while CD20+ lymphocytes and plasma cells were clearly increased.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe reduction in lining layer thickness, vascularity, and infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages paralleled the beneficial effect of anti-TNFalpha therapy on peripheral synovitis in 8 patients with different subtypes of SpA. The adhesion molecule expression, T cell infiltration, and, most important, B cell infiltration seemed to contrast with previous observations in RA. Although these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort, they suggest distinct immunomodulatory mechanisms of anti-TNFalpha in SpA.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effects of treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) on synovial histology in patients with spondylarthropathy (SpA) in order to confirm the effect on peripheral synovitis and to investigate the immunologic mechanisms involved in anti-TNFalpha therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with treatment-resistant SpA were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, and 6 in an open-label pilot study. In 8 patients, synovial biopsy tissues obtained at baseline, week 2, and week 12 were used for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn all 8 patients (3 with ankylosing spondylitis, 1 with undifferentiated SpA, and 4 with psoriatic arthritis), there was a clear clinical improvement in the peripheral arthritis after anti-TNFalpha therapy. Histologic analysis of the synovial biopsy tissues indicated that the synovial lining layer thickness tended to decrease, with a significant reduction of CD55+ synoviocytes, at week 12. In the sublining layer, vascularity was reduced at week 12, with a decreased endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 but not intercellular adhesion molecule 1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin. Although at week 2 and week 12, the number of neutrophils and CD68+ macrophages in the sublining layer was decreased, the overall degree of inflammatory infiltration remained unchanged. This could be related to the lymphocyte infiltration since at week 12, only CD4+ cells (but not CD3+, CD45RO+, and CD8+ cells) tended to decrease, while CD20+ lymphocytes and plasma cells were clearly increased.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe reduction in lining layer thickness, vascularity, and infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages paralleled the beneficial effect of anti-TNFalpha therapy on peripheral synovitis in 8 patients with different subtypes of SpA. The adhesion molecule expression, T cell infiltration, and, most important, B cell infiltration seemed to contrast with previous observations in RA. Although these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort, they suggest distinct immunomodulatory mechanisms of anti-TNFalpha in SpA.",

            "abstract": "Infliximab, the chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has changed our therapy of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is indicated in refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. In patients with luminal disease, a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 5 mg/kg is efficacious; in fistulizing disease, an i.v. loading therapy of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is advocated. Because the majority of patients will relapse if not re-treated, a long-term strategy is necessary. The optimal long-term approach is systematic re-treatment with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Episodic therapy on relapse also is possible but is less efficacious and frequently is associated with problems resulting from the formation of antibodies to infliximab (ATI). If treatment is episodic, maintenance therapy with immunosuppression (azathioprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or methotrexate) is mandatory. Trial data suggest that systematic maintenance with 8 weekly doses of infliximab decreases the rate of complications, hospitalizations, and surgeries. These effects probably are achieved thanks to thorough healing of the bowel. Infliximab also is indicated in treating corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease and extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. There are no data yet that support its use as first-line therapy. The data in ulcerative colitis (UC) are conflicting and we should await the results of 2 large controlled trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to position infliximab in the treatment of UC. Other anti-TNF strategies have been less effective than infliximab in the treatment of IBD until now. The results with thalidomide are promising but much more research into small molecules inhibiting TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines is necessary. Safety problems with antibody treatment mainly concern immunogenicity leading to infusion reactions, loss of response, and serum sickness-like delayed infusion reactions. The rate of opportunistic infections is increased mainly in patients treated concomitantly with immunosuppression. Other adverse events associated with anti-TNF strategies are demyelinating disease and worsening of congestive heart failure. Malignancy rates in patients treated with anti-TNF strategies do not seem to be increased.",

            "abstract": "Infliximab, the chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has changed our therapy of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is indicated in refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. In patients with luminal disease, a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 5 mg/kg is efficacious; in fistulizing disease, an i.v. loading therapy of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is advocated. Because the majority of patients will relapse if not re-treated, a long-term strategy is necessary. The optimal long-term approach is systematic re-treatment with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Episodic therapy on relapse also is possible but is less efficacious and frequently is associated with problems resulting from the formation of antibodies to infliximab (ATI). If treatment is episodic, maintenance therapy with immunosuppression (azathioprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or methotrexate) is mandatory. Trial data suggest that systematic maintenance with 8 weekly doses of infliximab decreases the rate of complications, hospitalizations, and surgeries. These effects probably are achieved thanks to thorough healing of the bowel. Infliximab also is indicated in treating corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease and extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. There are no data yet that support its use as first-line therapy. The data in ulcerative colitis (UC) are conflicting and we should await the results of 2 large controlled trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to position infliximab in the treatment of UC. Other anti-TNF strategies have been less effective than infliximab in the treatment of IBD until now. The results with thalidomide are promising but much more research into small molecules inhibiting TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines is necessary. Safety problems with antibody treatment mainly concern immunogenicity leading to infusion reactions, loss of response, and serum sickness-like delayed infusion reactions. The rate of opportunistic infections is increased mainly in patients treated concomitantly with immunosuppression. Other adverse events associated with anti-TNF strategies are demyelinating disease and worsening of congestive heart failure. Malignancy rates in patients treated with anti-TNF strategies do not seem to be increased.",

            "abstract": "Infliximab, the chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has changed our therapy of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is indicated in refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. In patients with luminal disease, a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 5 mg/kg is efficacious; in fistulizing disease, an i.v. loading therapy of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is advocated. Because the majority of patients will relapse if not re-treated, a long-term strategy is necessary. The optimal long-term approach is systematic re-treatment with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Episodic therapy on relapse also is possible but is less efficacious and frequently is associated with problems resulting from the formation of antibodies to infliximab (ATI). If treatment is episodic, maintenance therapy with immunosuppression (azathioprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or methotrexate) is mandatory. Trial data suggest that systematic maintenance with 8 weekly doses of infliximab decreases the rate of complications, hospitalizations, and surgeries. These effects probably are achieved thanks to thorough healing of the bowel. Infliximab also is indicated in treating corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease and extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. There are no data yet that support its use as first-line therapy. The data in ulcerative colitis (UC) are conflicting and we should await the results of 2 large controlled trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to position infliximab in the treatment of UC. Other anti-TNF strategies have been less effective than infliximab in the treatment of IBD until now. The results with thalidomide are promising but much more research into small molecules inhibiting TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines is necessary. Safety problems with antibody treatment mainly concern immunogenicity leading to infusion reactions, loss of response, and serum sickness-like delayed infusion reactions. The rate of opportunistic infections is increased mainly in patients treated concomitantly with immunosuppression. Other adverse events associated with anti-TNF strategies are demyelinating disease and worsening of congestive heart failure. Malignancy rates in patients treated with anti-TNF strategies do not seem to be increased.",

There have been a number of reports of PG responding to infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor \u03b1. Aim: In the first randomised placebo controlled trial of any drug for the treatment of PG, we have studied the role of infliximab in this disorder. Subjects: Patients 18 years of age or older with a clinical diagnosis of PG were invited to take part. Methods: Patients were randomised to receive an infusion of infliximab at 5 mg/kg or placebo at week 0. Patients were then assessed at week 2 and non-responders were offered open labelled infliximab. The primary end point was clinical improvement at week 2, with secondary end points being remission and improvement at week 6. Results: Thirty patients were entered into the study. After randomisation, 13 patients received infliximab and 17 patients received placebo.

Disorders classically associated with pyoderma gangrenosum include rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, paraproteinemia and myeloproliferative disorders. There have been some reports of the occurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum in Africa, and in Nigeria, but only one specifically reported pyoderma gangrenosum in association with ulcerative colitis. We report on a 45-year-old man who presented with pyoderma gangrenosum associated with ulcerative colitis; the second report in Nigeria. The skin lesions were managed with daily honey wound dressings. Oral dapsone and prednisolone were started. The frequency of the bloody diarrhea decreased, and was completely resolved by the second week after admission. The ulcers also showed accelerated healing. The goal of therapy is directed towards the associated systemic disorder, if present.",

Is this difference based on real demographic susceptibilities or a reflection of lower level of healthcare delivery? Three cases of ulcerative colitis and one case of Crohn's disease diagnosed in a tertiary institution in northern Nigeria in the span of three years are reported. Their presentation coincided with the creation of the Gastrointestinal Surgery Unit of our hospital and with it the availability of endoscopic diagnostic procedures. All four patients were indigenous Nigerians. Our findings suggest that IBD may be more common in this part of the world than previously thought. With an increased awareness of the disease in our population, a greater utilization of modern medicine as against alternative medicine and with wider availability of diagnostic tools in our hospitals, it is our guess that more cases may be found in the future to dispel the belief that Africans are somewhat immune to this affliction.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory bowel disorder characterized by an unpredictable course of alternating cycles of relapse and remission. Traditionally viewed as a disease of Western countries, the prevalence of ulcerative colitis is reported to be increasing in the developing world. In these regions, there is the potential to further explore the etiology of the disease, mainly through genetic studies. With this in mind, we consider available data relating to the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and disease course of ulcerative colitis in Africa and the Middle East. Current treatment approaches in these countries are also reviewed and discussed in the context of new, small molecule, orally administered therapies. Areas covered: Available data on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of ulcerative colitis in Africa and the Middle East are reviewed using a PubMed database search. Expert commentary: Epidemiologic studies from African and Middle Eastern countries suggest disease trends similar to the West, and an important health and economic burden. The management of ulcerative colitis within these developing countries is challenging, with the need to improve early diagnosis, access to healthcare, and patient education, along with facilitation of access to treatment options and improvement of medication adherence.",
