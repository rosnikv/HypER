            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe investigated the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GcRs) in the intrahepatic biliary epithelium and the role of corticosteroids in the regulation of cholangiocyte secretion.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGcR was studied by immunohistochemistry, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blots. The effects of dexamethasone and budesonide on biliary bicarbonate excretion and H+/HCO3- transport processes were investigated in bile fistula rats, isolated intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDUs), and purified cholangiocytes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGcRs were expressed by rat cholangiocytes. Although acute administration of corticosteroids showed no effect, treatment for 2 days with dexamethasone or budesonide increased (P < 0.05) biliary bicarbonate concentration and secretion, which were blocked by the specific GcR antagonist, RU-486. IBDUs isolated from rats treated with dexamethasone or budesonide showed an increased (P < 0.05) activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE2 member), which was blocked by RU-486. Protein expression of NHE1 and AE2 and messenger RNA for NH1 but not AE2 were increased (P < 0.05) in isolated cholangiocytes by dexamethasone treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe intrahepatic biliary epithelium expresses GcR and responds to corticosteroids by increasing bicarbonate excretion in bile. This is caused by corticosteroid-induced enhanced activities and protein expression of transport processes driving bicarbonate excretion in the biliary epithelium.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the stimulatory effects of estrogens on cholangiocyte proliferation. We investigated the tyrosine kinase\u2013receptor pathway by evaluating the protein expression of total and phosphorylated mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform p44/p42 (e.g., extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase [ERK]1/2), the steroid\u2010receptor coactivator Src and Shc (Src\u2010homology/collagen protein). The study was performed in 3\u2010week\u2010old bile duct\u2013ligated (BDL) rats, BDL rats treated with the antiestrogens, tamoxifen or Ici 182,780, and normal control rats. Proliferation was also evaluated in normal purified cholangiocytes treated with 17\u03b2 estradiol in the presence or absence of tamoxifen, Ici 182,780, ERK, or Src inhibitors. After bile duct ligation, cholangiocyte proliferation was associated with a marked immunohistochemical nuclear positivity for phosphorylated (p)\u2010ERK1/2, which was inhibited by in vivo treatment with tamoxifen or Ici 182,780. Protein expression of total and p\u2010ERK1/2, and Shc in cholangiocytes isolated from BDL rats was markedly increased compared with controls and was inhibited by in vivo treatment with antiestrogens. In vitro, 17\u03b2 estradiol\u2013induced proliferation of isolated normal cholangiocyte was associated with increased (P < .01) protein expression of p\u2010ERK1/2, Src, and Shc. Specific inhibitors of ER (Ici 182,780), ERK (U0125), and Src (PP2) inhibited in vitro 17\u03b2 estradiol\u2013induced cholangiocyte proliferation. In conclusion, this study showed that estrogens induced cholangiocyte proliferation by activating the Src/Shc/ERK pathway. This might suggest that pharmacologic modulation of ER, ERK, and/or Src could be proposed for the treatment of human pathology characterized by dysregulation of cholangiocyte proliferation.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe evaluated the expression of neurotrophins in rat cholangiocytes and the role and mechanisms by which nerve growth factor (NGF) modulates cholangiocyte proliferation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe expression of neurotrophins and their receptors was investigated by immunohistochemistry in liver sections and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblots in isolated cholangiocytes. In vitro, the effect of NGF on cholangiocyte proliferation and signal transduction was investigated by immunoblotting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), phosphorylated c-jun-N-terminal kinase, and phosphorylated p38. In vivo, rats that had undergone bile duct ligation (BDL) were treated with an anti-NGF antibody to immunoneutralize NGF and bile duct mass, proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation were investigated by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNGF and its TrkA receptor were expressed by normal rat cholangiocytes and up-regulated following BDL. Cholangiocytes secrete NGF, and secretion is increased in proliferating BDL cholangiocytes. In vitro, NGF stimulated cholangiocyte proliferation, which was associated with enhanced p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 expression. NGF proliferation in vitro was partially blocked by the MEK inhibitor (UO126) and completely ablated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin). In vitro, NGF and estrogens have an additive effect on cholangiocyte proliferation by acting on phosphorylated TrkA and p-ERK1/2. In vivo, immunoneutralization of NGF decreased bile duct mass in BDL rats, which was associated with depressed proliferation and enhanced apoptosis and with increased portal inflammation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCholangiocytes secrete NGF and express NGF receptors. NGF induces cholangiocyte proliferation by activating the ERK and, predominantly, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and exerts an additive effect in combination with estrogens on proliferation.",

Fourteen days following constitution of bile duct ligation, all groups were compared in terms of serum tests, histopathologic parameters, and tissue levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe parameters representing both the injury and/or the reactive response and healing were more pronounced in groups 1 and 2 (c2 = 17.2, c2 = 10.20; c2 = 12.4, P < 0.05). In the sham operated or E2 administered groups significantly lower tissue levels of IFN-gamma and higher IL-6 levels were found.

Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines were simultaneously measured using a multiplexed human cytokine assay. Serum concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were measured as vascular inflammation markers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth oral ET and transdermal ET significantly decreased serum interleukin (IL)-7 concentrations at 12 months (P=0.020 and P=0.015 respectively). Transdermal ET decreased serum concentrations of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta (P=0.05, P=0.019, and P=0.029), but oral ET increased IL-8 level (P=0.025). There were significant differences in percentage changes in IL-8 and MIP-1beta between the oral and transdermal ET groups. Oral ET significantly decreased E-selectin level after 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTransdermal ET reduces circulating levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1beta, while both oral ET and transdermal ET reduce circulating level of IL-7.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the different effects of oral estrogen therapy (ET) and transdermal ET on changes in circulating levels of cytokines and chemokines in relationship to changes in markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty-five postmenopausal women with hysterectomy were randomly assigned in open, parallel-group fashion to an oral ET group and a transdermal ET group. Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines were simultaneously measured using a multiplexed human cytokine assay. Serum concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were measured as vascular inflammation markers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth oral ET and transdermal ET significantly decreased serum interleukin (IL)-7 concentrations at 12 months (P=0.020 and P=0.015 respectively). Transdermal ET decreased serum concentrations of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta (P=0.05, P=0.019, and P=0.029), but oral ET increased IL-8 level (P=0.025). There were significant differences in percentage changes in IL-8 and MIP-1beta between the oral and transdermal ET groups. Oral ET significantly decreased E-selectin level after 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTransdermal ET reduces circulating levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1beta, while both oral ET and transdermal ET reduce circulating level of IL-7.",

            "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease where lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines that accelerate its initiation and progression. Estrogen has been proven to be vasoprotective against atherosclerosis; however, the anti-inflammatory function of estrogen in the vascular system remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effect of estrogen on LPS-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; listed as CCL2 in the MGI database) production in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). LPS significantly enhances MCP-1 production and this is dependent on nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling, since the use of NFkappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or the silencing of NFkappaB subunit p65 expression with specific siRNA largely impairs LPS-enhanced MCP-1 production. On the contrary, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) inhibits LPS-induced MCP-1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which is related to the suppression of p65 translocation to nucleus. Furthermore, p38 MAPK is rapidly activated in response to LPS, while E(2) markedly inhibits p38 MAPK activation. Transfection with p38 MAPK siRNA or the use of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 markedly attenuates LPS-stimulated p65 translocation to nucleus and MCP-1 production, suggesting that E(2) suppresses NFkappaB signaling by the inactivation of p38 MAPK signaling. LPS promotes VSMCs migration and this is abrogated by MCP-1 antibody, implying that MCP-1 may play a major role as an autocrine factor in atherosclerosis. In addition, E(2) inhibits LPS-promoted cell migration by downregulation of MCP-1 production. Overall, our results demonstrate that E(2) exerts anti-inflammatory property antagonistic to LPS in VSMCs by reducing MCP-1 production, and this effect is related to the inhibition of p38 MAPK/NFkappaB cascade.",

            "abstract": "Clinical observations and basic studies show that progesterone and progestins have a variable influence on endothelial function. Dydrogesterone (DG) is a widely used progestin, but its endothelial actions have not been thoroughly assessed. In this study, we investigated the effects of DG and its metabolite 20-\u03b1-dihydro-dydrogesterone (DHD), natural progesterone as well as medroxyprogesterone acetate, on the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells using an in vitro experimental endothelial inflammation system. Our findings show that all progestins significantly suppress endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) induced by bacterial lypopolysaccharide (LPS). These inhibitory effects of DG and DHD require activation of progesterone receptor. DG and DHD decrease adhesion molecule expression associated with LPS administration by preventing nuclear translocation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB. In addition, DG and DHD do not alter the anti-inflammatory effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol. In conclusion, DG and DHD decrease endothelial inflammatory responses induced by LPS, via reduced expression of the pro-atherogenic adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. These actions may be relevant for the vascular effects of DG.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Successful oocyte implantation and a favorable pregnancy outcome rely on optimal progesterone levels. Therefore, progesterone deficiencies associated with infertility and miscarriage have commonly been treated with progestogens that mimic the activity of progesterone. Among those is dydrogesterone, an oral retrosteroid with a structure closely related to that of progesterone yet with a greater bioavailability and higher selectivity for the progesterone receptor. This review describes the efficacy of dydrogesterone for the treatment of threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and infertility due to luteal phase insufficiency. Data from clinical trials evaluating dydrogesterone in assisted reproductive technology are also discussed. Prospective clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that dydrogesterone significantly improves pregnancy outcomes in women with threatened miscarriage or with a history of miscarriage. Although this is not yet a registered indication, dydrogesterone was as effective as vaginal micronized progesterone for luteal phase support in the setting of assisted reproductive technology. The safety and tolerability of dydrogesterone treatment in pregnant women are also briefly addressed and the data support a well-established and favorable benefit\u2013risk profile.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Successful oocyte implantation and a favorable pregnancy outcome rely on optimal progesterone levels. Therefore, progesterone deficiencies associated with infertility and miscarriage have commonly been treated with progestogens that mimic the activity of progesterone. Among those is dydrogesterone, an oral retrosteroid with a structure closely related to that of progesterone yet with a greater bioavailability and higher selectivity for the progesterone receptor. This review describes the efficacy of dydrogesterone for the treatment of threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and infertility due to luteal phase insufficiency. Data from clinical trials evaluating dydrogesterone in assisted reproductive technology are also discussed. Prospective clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that dydrogesterone significantly improves pregnancy outcomes in women with threatened miscarriage or with a history of miscarriage. Although this is not yet a registered indication, dydrogesterone was as effective as vaginal micronized progesterone for luteal phase support in the setting of assisted reproductive technology. The safety and tolerability of dydrogesterone treatment in pregnant women are also briefly addressed and the data support a well-established and favorable benefit\u2013risk profile.",

            "abstract": "Abstract STUDY QUESTION Is oral dydrogesterone 30 mg daily (10 mg three times daily [TID]) non-inferior to micronized vaginal progesterone (MVP) 600 mg daily (200 mg TID) for luteal support in in vitro fertilization (IVF), assessed by the presence of fetal heartbeats determined by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks of gestation? SUMMARY ANSWER Non-inferiority of oral dydrogesterone versus MVP was demonstrated at 12 weeks of gestation, with a difference in pregnancy rate and an associated confidence interval (CI) that were both within the non-inferiority margin. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY MVP is routinely used in most clinics for luteal support in IVF, but it is associated with side effects, such as vaginal irritation and discharge, as well as poor patient acceptance. Dydrogesterone may be an alternative treatment due to its patient-friendly oral administration. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Lotus I was an international Phase III randomized controlled trial, performed across 38 sites, from August 2013 to March 2016. Subjects were premenopausal women (>18 to <42 years of age; body mass index (BMI) \u226518 to \u226430 kg/m2) with a documented history of infertility who were planning to undergo IVF. A centralized electronic system was used for randomization, and the study investigators, sponsor's study team, and subjects remained blinded throughout the study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS In total, 1031 subjects were randomized to receive either oral dydrogesterone (n = 520) or MVP (n = 511). Luteal support was started on the day of oocyte retrieval and continued until 12 weeks of gestation (Week 10), if a positive pregnancy test was obtained at 2 weeks after embryo transfer. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In the full analysis set (FAS), 497 and 477 subjects in the oral dydrogesterone and MVP groups, respectively, had an embryo transfer. Non-inferiority of oral dydrogesterone was demonstrated, with pregnancy rates at 12 weeks of gestation of 37.6% and 33.1% in the oral dydrogesterone and MVP treatment groups, respectively (difference 4.7%; 95% CI: \u22121.2\u201310.6%). Live birth rates of 34.6% (172 mothers with 213 newborns) and 29.8% (142 mothers with 158 newborns) were obtained in the dydrogesterone and MVP groups, respectively (difference 4.9%; 95% CI: \u22120.8\u201310.7%). Oral dydrogesterone was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to MVP. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The analysis of the results was powered to consider the clinical pregnancy rate, but the live birth rate may be of greater clinical interest. Conclusions relating to the differences between treatments in live birth rate, observed in this study, should therefore be made with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Oral dydrogesterone may replace MVP as the standard of care for luteal phase support in IVF, owing to the oral route being more patient-friendly than intravaginal administration, as well as it being a well tolerated and efficacious treatment.

            "abstract": "Objective To identify, appraise, and summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral dydrogesterone to vaginal progesterone capsules for luteal-phase support (LPS) in women offered fresh or frozen embryo transfers following in vitro fertilization. Methods Two independent authors screened the literature for papers based on titles and abstracts, then selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Dydrogesterone and progesterone were compared based on risk ratios (RR) and the precision of the estimates was assessed through the 95% confidence interval (CI). Results An electronic search performed on June 7, 2017 retrieved 376 records, nine of which were papers deemed eligible and included in this systematic review and quantitative analysis. Good quality evidence indicates that oral dydrogesterone provided at least similar results than vaginal progesterone capsules on live birth/ongoing pregnancy (RR=1.08, 95%CI=0.92-1.26, I2=29%, 8 RCTs, 3,386 women) and clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.27; I2=43%; 9 RCTs; 4,061 women). Additionally, moderate quality evidence suggests there is no relevant difference on miscarriage rates (RR=0.92, 95%CI=0.68-1.26, I2=6%, 8 RCTs, 988 clinical pregnancies; the quality of the evidence was downgraded because of imprecision). Conclusions Good quality evidence from RCTs suggest that oral dydrogesterone provides at least similar reproductive outcomes than vaginal progesterone capsules when used for LPS in women undergoing embryo transfers. Dydrogesterone is a reasonable option and the choice of either of the medications should be based on cost and side effects.",
