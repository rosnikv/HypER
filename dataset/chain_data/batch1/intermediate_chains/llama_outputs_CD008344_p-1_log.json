            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nResection of hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Since intensive nutritional support can reduce the catabolic response and improve protein synthesis and liver regeneration, we performed a prospective study to investigate whether perioperative nutritional support could improve outcome in patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 124 patients undergoing resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Sixty-four patients (39 with cirrhosis, 18 with chronic active hepatitis, and 7 with no associated liver disease) were randomly assigned to receive perioperative intravenous nutritional support in addition to their oral diet, and 60 patients (33 with cirrhosis, 12 with chronic active hepatitis, and 15 with no associated liver disease) were randomly assigned to a control group. The perioperative nutritional therapy consisted of a solution enriched with 35 percent branched-chain amino acids, dextrose, and lipid emulsion (50 percent medium-chain triglycerides) given intravenously for 14 days perioperatively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a reduction in the overall postoperative morbidity rate in the perioperative-nutrition group as compared with the control group (34 percent vs. 55 percent; relative risk, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.96), predominantly because of fewer septic complications (17 percent vs. 37 percent; relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.96). There were also a reduction in the requirement for diuretic agents to control ascites (25 percent vs. 50 percent; relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.87), less weight loss after hepatectomy (median loss, 0 kg vs. 1.4 kg, P = 0.01), and less deterioration of liver function as measured by the change in the rate of clearance of indocyanine green (-2.8 percent vs. -4.8 percent at 20 minutes, P = 0.05). These benefits were seen predominantly in the patients with underlying cirrhosis who underwent major hepatectomy. There were five deaths during hospitalization in the perioperative-nutrition group, and nine in the control group (P not significant).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPerioperative nutritional support can reduce complications after major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUpregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen in response to the T-cell lymphokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is central to T cell-macrophage cooperation and immune homeostasis. We evaluated this property in malnourished surgical patients and assessed the impact of nutrition repletion with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-two patients were studied: 37 malnourished and 25 controls. Whole blood was cultured with or without IFN-gamma (100 U mL-1), dual-labeled with anti-CD14 (monocyte) and anti-human leukocyte antigen-DR antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis was measured by flow cytometry. In a second study, 10 severely malnourished patients received 5 days of TPN and MHC class II expression was measured at the end of this period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe magnitude of the increase in monocyte MHC class II expression in response to IFN-gamma was significantly increased in the control group compared with the malnourished group (107% vs 53%; p < .05). This impairment directly correlated with severity of malnutrition, but did not correlate with age or disease type. The number of bacteria phagocytozed per cell was significantly decreased (p < .05) in the malnourished group. In study 2, there was a significant increase in MHC class II induction with IFN-gamma after short-term TPN (58% before vs 173% after, p < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMHC class II induction in response to IFN-gamma is significantly impaired in malnourished patients, correlating with the severity of malnutrition. This defect is reversed by short-term TPN. These data identify the reversible loss of a key mechanism, fundamental to host defense, that may enhance the risk of infection in malnourished patients.",

The target population was malnourished children aged from 6 to 59 months old with a history of three HBV vaccine doses in infancy. According to the World Health Organization\u2019s definition of malnutrition, 121 malnourished children were enrolled in the study. Data of malnourished children were collected using a pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire. Two milliliters of venous blood were taken, and anti-HBs was then tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. An anti-HBs level of at least 10 IU/L was considered a successful response to the vaccine.Results: The coverage rate of HBV vaccine among malnourished children was 89.3%, being higher among girls (52.1%) than boys (37.2%). Response to HBV vaccine (\u226510 IU/L) was observed in 72.2% (78/108) of children while 27.8% (30/108) of children failed to respond to the vaccine, with a statistically significant difference (p <0.001).Conclusions: A good HBV vaccine coverage rate was found among malnourished Yemeni children, with a moderate rate of protection. Therefore, re-vaccination or administration of booster doses to a substantial proportion of vaccinated children should be considered.",

Objectives. This study was conducted to determine the coverage rate of HBV vaccine and assess the vaccine protective response among children under five years old in rural areas of Yemen. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2015 in four districts of countryside Yemen. The target population was children aged from 6 to 59 months. 227 children were enrolled in the study. Questionnaire was used to collect of data. Serum samples were tested for anti-HBs antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-HBs level \u2265 10\u2009IU/L was considered a protective response to the vaccine. Results. The coverage rate of HBV vaccine among children was 87.3%. A total of 143 (72.2%) children responded to the vaccine with anti-HBs level \u2265 10\u2009IU/L, while 55 (27.8%) of the children had nonprotective anti-HBs levels of <10\u2009IU/L (P = 0.003). Conclusion. This study revealed a good coverage rate of HBV vaccine in rural areas but the protective rate against HBV infection was moderate. A considerable proportion of vaccinated children should be considered for either revaccination or booster doses.",

            "abstract": "Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection poses a major health problem worldwide. approximately 1 million deaths annually due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Objectives. This study was conducted to determine the coverage rate of HBV vaccine and assess the vaccine protective response among children under five years old in rural areas of Yemen. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2015 in four districts of countryside Yemen. The target population was children aged from 6 to 59 months. 227 children were enrolled in the study. Questionnaire was used to collect of data. Serum samples were tested for anti-HBs antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-HBs level \u2265 10\u2009IU/L was considered a protective response to the vaccine. Results. The coverage rate of HBV vaccine among children was 87.3%. A total of 143 (72.2%) children responded to the vaccine with anti-HBs level \u2265 10\u2009IU/L, while 55 (27.8%) of the children had nonprotective anti-HBs levels of <10\u2009IU/L (P = 0.003). Conclusion. This study revealed a good coverage rate of HBV vaccine in rural areas but the protective rate against HBV infection was moderate. A considerable proportion of vaccinated children should be considered for either revaccination or booster doses.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination leads to both humoral and cellular immune responses and results in protecting levels of specific antibodies. The immune response to the vaccine and production of T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines vary among the individuals. Thus we aimed to investigate the relationship between Th1/Th2 cytokine serum levels and antibody production after HBV vaccination, hoping to improve the effectiveness of vaccination. A total of 90 health care workers had been vaccinated with triple doses of HB vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months intervals. Two months after the third dose, anti-HBs titer, interferon gamma (INF-\u03b3), and interleukin (IL)-13 serum levels were measured. There were 16 low-responders (anti-HBs = 10\u2013150 IU/L), 41 moderate-responders (anti-HBs> 150< 1000 IU/L), and 33 high-responders (anti-HBs = 1000 IU/L). IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 serum levels showed significant positive correlation with anti-HBs titer. We concluded that, decreased serum level of IFN-\u03b3 (Th1 cytokine) and IL-13 (Th2 cytokine) was associated with diminished production of anti-HBs antibodies after HB vaccination, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 could play a significant role in the immune response to HB vaccination and could be used as vaccine adjuvants.",
