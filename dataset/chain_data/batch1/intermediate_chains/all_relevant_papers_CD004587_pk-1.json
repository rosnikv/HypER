        "abstract": "Local drug delivery (LDD), the direct application of a therapeutic agent to a focal location, has been used in cardiovascular interventions to prophylactically reduce neointimal hyperplasia and relieve clot burden. LDD allows targeted use of drugs whose toxicities inhibit their systemic use while stent delivery allows for consistent and prolonged delivery. Stents eluting limus family drugs or paclitaxel inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and migration and clinical use of such stents have reduced restenosis rates after percutaneous coronary procedures. However, associated with the increased efficacy is an increased rate of late stent thrombosis associated with death and myocardial infarction. Recent innovations, including bioabsorbable polymers and completely bioabsorbable stents may expand the use of drug-eluting stents. In this review, we discuss the development, the clinical use, and the effects of LDD from balloon and stent-based platforms in the treatment of restenosis and thrombus.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with chronic kidney disease have had conflicting results between drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare-metal stents (BMS). The aim of the present study was to determine whether DES is preferable for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with renal insufficiency, and to elucidate the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on outcomes of each stent.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAs a part of the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR), 2,175 AMI patients with renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <60ml/min) comprising 208 patients with BMS and 1,967 DES implantation were selected. Primary outcome was major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as a composite of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization. In the overall population, the MACE rate at 1 year was significantly higher in the BMS group than that of DES (44% vs. 26%, P<0.05), which was mainly due to death rather than repeat intervention (44% vs. 26%, P<0.05). In the diabetic group with DES implantation, the MACE rate was higher compared with the DES group without DM, mainly due to repeat intervention (5% vs. 8%, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn AMI patients with renal insufficiency, DES implantation exhibits a favorable 1-year clinical outcome than BMS implantation, and subgroup analysis for diabetic subjects showed worse outcomes in the DM group with implanted DES.",

        "abstract": "This study describes the development and evaluation of novel polymer films that provide controlled release of two vascular-protective polyphenols for endovascular devices. Resveratrol (RESV) and quercetin (QUER) have antimigratory and antiproliferative actions on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), inhibit both platelet and inflammatory cell activation, and promote endothelial cell function. Our aim is to develop and characterize coatings that release these drugs within a therapeutic range. The most synergistic drug combination, as determined by isobolographic analysis, was incorporated into an arborescent poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene) tri-block polymer (arbIBS) and applied to stainless steel coupons using an electrospray process. Physical characterization of the resulting coating revealed a film featuring micro-scale architecture consisting of drug-containing domains. To determine drug-mediated effects, vascular cells were exposed to coatings incorporating several loadings of RESV and QUER. Results from this study indicate that arbIBS exhibits no cytotoxicity, and that the films release RESV and QUER at therapeutic levels, dose-dependently inhibiting macrophage activation, VSMC proliferation, and platelet stimulation. We conclude that RESV and QUER released from arbIBS interfere with key processes responsible for in-stent stenosis, suggesting that RESV and QUER may have utility as therapeutics in a novel coating for device-based interventions.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: We aim to explore the clinical outcome of drug\u2010eluting stents (DES) versus bare\u2010metal stents (BMS) implantation in diabetics versus nondiabetic patients. Background: Diabetic patients sustain worse long\u2010term clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) when compared with nondiabetics. The use of DES decreases the rate of repeat revascularization in this population but data concerning long\u2010term clinical benefits, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or mortality is scant. Methods: We analyzed data from a comprehensive registry of 6,583 consecutive patients undergoing PCI at our center. A propensity score was used for analysis of outcomes and for matching (DES vs. BMS). Outcome parameters were total mortality, MI, repeat target vessel revascularization (TVR) rates, and risk\u2010adjusted event\u2010free survival. Within this cohort, we identified 2,571 nondiabetic patients and these were compared with 1,826 diabetic coronary patients. Results: Mean and median follow up time was 3 and 3.25 years, respectively. Overall, diabetics had higher rates of major\u2010adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 4 years compared with nondiabetics (23.03 vs. 31.96 P > 0.001). DES use was associated with lower rates of TVR in both groups [diabetics hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42\u20130.76, P < 0.001, nondiabetics HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55\u20130.97, P = 0.03] while sustained decreased rates of both mortality and MI were evident solely among diabetics (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56\u20130.89, P = 0.004 in diabetic vs. HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.69\u20131.13, P = 0.3). Conclusions: In a \u201creal\u2010world,\u201d unselected population and extended clinical use, DES in diabetics was associated with sustained decreased rates of MI, death, TVR, and MACE while this benefit was attenuated in the nondiabetic population. \u00a9 2011 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Recently, there has been increased interest in leveraging observational studies for comparative effectiveness research. Without robust and valid risk adjustment, however, findings from these nonrandomized studies may remain biased. Previous studies examining long-term mortality with drug-eluting stents (DESs) have demonstrated discordant results between randomized trials and observational studies. To examine the impact of treatment selection bias on these findings, we used data from a prospective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) registry (EVENT [Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events]) to compare clinical outcomes between DESs and bare metal stents (BMSs) using conventional (multivariable regression and propensity matching) and novel (instrumental variable analysis) risk-adjustment techniques. Methods and Results\u2014The study population consisted of 9266 patients who underwent nonemergent PCI with stent placement at 55 US centers between 2004 and 2007. All-cause mortality and target lesion revascularization (TLR) were assessed prospectively over 1 year of follow-up. Overall, 8171 patients (88%) received DES, but this proportion substantially differed by treatment year (93% in 2004\u20132006 and 73% in 2007; P<0.001). One-year rates of death and TLR were significantly lower with DES versus BMS (death, 2.5% versus 5.6%; TLR, 4.2% versus 6.9%; P<0.001 for both), findings that persisted in both multivariable-adjusted and propensity-matched analyses. In contrast, instrumental variable analysis, using enrollment period (2004\u20132006 versus 2007) as the instrument, demonstrated no significant difference in 1-year mortality (predicted absolute difference, 2.0%; 95% CI, -1.8% to 5.7%; P=0.30) and a strong trend toward reduced TLR with DES use (predicted absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -8.8% to 0.4%; P=0.07). Conclusions\u2014Among unselected PCI patients in contemporary practice, DES use tended to be associated with a consistent reduction in TLR regardless of risk-adjustment method but showed discordant effects on mortality with conventional risk adjustment compared with instrumentable variable analysis. These findings underscore the limitations of standard risk-adjustment methods to adequately address treatment selection bias in nonrandomized studies and have important implications for comparative effectiveness research using observational data.",

Therefore, we compared an everolimus-eluting stent (EES) to a paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) for treatment of small (reference vessel diameter: RVD <2.5 mm) and larger vessels (\u22652.5 mm) in a pooled analysis from the SPIRIT III (n = 1,002) and SPIRIT IV (n = 3,687) trials (randomized 2:1, EES vs. PES).\n\n\nMETHODS\nData of 4,689 total patients were pooled for a patient level analysis. Lesion length, RVD, and percent diabetics were matched between stent types.

We aimed to investigate the one-year clinical outcomes, including major adverse cardiac events (MACE), of the use of the ultra long Apollo paclitaxel-eluting stent in patients with long atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions. Methods According to a retrospective review of the Tehran Heart Center Registry of Interventional Cardiology, a single-center nonrandomized computerized data registry in which all adult patients who undergo single or multi-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are enrolled without any specific exclusion criteria, the mixed use of long Apollo paclitaxel-eluting stents and other types of the DES as well as myocardial infarction within forty-eight hours prior to the procedure was excluded. In total, 122 patients were enrolled in the study, and their baseline clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics were obtained. In addition, the patients\u2019 follow-up data and, most importantly, MACE during a one-year period after intervention were recorded. Results The mean follow-up duration was 14.1 \u00b1 3.8 months. The one-year clinical follow-up data were obtained in 95.9 % of all the patients. The incidence of MACE was 5.7% during the entire study period. There was 1 death, which occurred during the initial days after PCI. The incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction was 2.5% (3 cases), including one patient who underwent target vessel revascularization seven months later. Also, 3 patients with single-vessel disease and in-stent restenosis underwent coronary artery bypass grafting between five to ten months later. Conclusions Our results showed that the Apollo paclitaxel-eluting stent might be regarded as a safe and effective treatment for long coronary lesions.",

A polymer-free dual-drug sirolimus- and probucol-eluting stent and a new generation permanent polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent are recently developed technologies demonstrating encouraging results.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nIn a clinical trial with minimal exclusion criteria, we randomly assigned 3002 patients to treatment with sirolimus- and probucol-eluting stents versus zotarolimus-eluting stents. The trial was designed to demonstrate noninferiority of the sirolimus- and probucol-eluting stents. The primary end point was the combined incidence of cardiac death, target-vessel-related myocardial infarction, or target-lesion revascularization at 1-year follow-up. Follow-up angiography was scheduled at 6 to 8 months. The sirolimus- and probucol-eluting stent was noninferior to the zotarolimus-eluting stent in terms of occurrence of the primary end point (13.1% versus 13.5%, respectively, P(noninferiority)=0.006; hazard ratio=0.97, 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.19; P(superiority)=0.74).

        "abstract": "Randomized clinical trials of new coronary devices, as with other novel therapies, are generally conducted in a homogeneous and usually low-risk population. There is valid statistical and methodological justification for this approach, including lower variances (resulting in increased statistical power) and increased probability that observed differences are due only to the study therapy. Although such trial designs generally increase the chances of a positive result, they result in a limited ability to generalize the findings to the broader population of patients encountered in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the quality of evidence required for reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the benchmark for regulatory approval of a new device, is necessarily in equilibrium with the desire to bring novel designs to market and meet the clinical needs of the population for whom the therapy may be beneficial as expeditiously as possible. The resulting limited complexity of the study population and relatively short duration of follow-up after study therapy increase the risk of failing to detect important safety concerns in the premarket period.\n\nArticle see p 2819\n\nThe short history of drug-eluting stents (DES) is a classic example of this paradigm.

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Long-term comparative data of first-generation drug-eluting stents are scarce. We investigated clinical and angiographic outcomes of sirolimus-eluting (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) at 5 years as part of the Sirolimus-Eluting Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents for Coronary Revascularization (SIRTAX) LATE study. Methods and Results\u2014 A total of 1012 patients were randomly assigned to SES or PES. Repeat angiography was completed in 444 of 1012 patients (43.8%) at 5 years. Major adverse cardiac events occurred in 19.7% of SES- and 21.4% of PES-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17; P=0.39) at 5 years. There were no differences between SES and PES in terms of cardiac death (5.8% versus 5.7%; P=0.35), myocardial infarction (6.6% versus 6.9%; P=0.51), and target lesion revascularization (13.1% versus 15.1%; P=0.29). Between 1 and 5 years, the annual rate of target lesion revascularization was 2.0% (95% confidence interval, 1.4% to 2.6%) for SES and 1.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.9% to 2.0%) for PES. Among patients undergoing paired angiography at 8 months and 5 years, delayed lumen loss amounted to 0.37\u00b10.73 mm for SES and 0.29\u00b10.59 mm for PES (P=0.32). The overall rate of definite stent thrombosis was 4.6% for SES and 4.1% for PES (P=0.74), and very late definite stent thrombosis occurred at an annual rate of 0.65% (95% confidence interval, 0.40% to 0.90%). Conclusions\u2014 Long-term follow-up of first-generation drug-eluting stents shows no significant differences in clinical and angiographic outcomes between SES and PES. The continuous increase in late lumen loss in conjunction with the ongoing risk of very late stent thrombosis suggests that vascular healing remains incomplete up to 5 years after implantation of first-generation drug-eluting stents.

        "abstract": "Objectives: The TAXUS OLYMPIA registry is a prospective, global, post\u2010approval program designed to collect clinical outcome data through 1 year from patients receiving the TAXUS Libert\u00e9 paclitaxel\u2010eluting stent in routine interventional cardiology practice. Background: The thin\u2010strut TAXUS Libert\u00e9 stent has been studied in ongoing clinical trials with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Methods: Between September 2005 and April 2007, a total of 21,954 patients from 365 sites in 57 countries eligible to receive a TAXUS Libert\u00e9 stent were enrolled in the TAXUS OLYMPIA registry. Baseline characteristics and procedure patterns were collected and clinical follow\u2010up is available for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the composite cardiac event (cardiac death, MI, and reintervention of the target vessel) rate related to the TAXUS Libert\u00e9 stent at 1 year. All cardiac events were monitored and all endpoints were independently adjudicated. Results: Complex patients and lesions were prevalent, including: 27% medically\u2010treated diabetes, 58% ACC/AHA type B2/C lesions, 32% multiple stenting, 13% long lesions (>28 mm), and 10% small vessels (<2.5 mm). At 1 year, the composite cardiac event rate was 4.4%, including 1.4% cardiac death, 1.0% MI, and 3.2% TVR. Stent thrombosis (ST, angiographically confirmed) occurred in 0.8% of patients, with 0.4% ST occurring >30 days postprocedure. The composite cardiac event rate related to the TAXUS Libert\u00e9 stent was 3.8% at 1 year. Conclusions: Low 1\u2010year cardiac event rates were reported with TAXUS Libert\u00e9 in a broad spectrum of patients, thereby confirming the technical and clinical performance of this stent in a \u201creal\u2010world\u201d setting. \u00a9 2010 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nTo compare the angiographic and clinical performance of a paclitaxel-eluting stent using reservoirs technology and a bioabsorbable polymer, without surface coating (CoStar), vs. an equivalent bare metal stent (BMS) using an identical metallic platform.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThree hundred and three (303) patients (335 lesions) with de novo coronary artery stenosis suitable for elective percutaneous treatment were randomised in an international multicentre single-blind trial to receive the CoStar stent (n=152) or the equivalent BMS (n=151). At eight months, the primary endpoint of in-segment binary restenosis was significantly lower in the CoStar than in the BMS group (17.6 vs. 30.3%, p=0.029). In-stent late loss (0.41 vs. 0.81 mm; p<0.0001) and all the other angiographic secondary endpoints also favoured CoStar. The composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction related to the target vessel and target lesion revascularisation was significantly lower at eight months in the CoStar arm (19.7 vs. 29.1%; hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.87; p=0.010), mainly due to lower incidence of target lesion revascularisation (15.1 vs. 26.5%; 95% CI: hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27-0.76; p=0.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with a bare metal stent of identical design, the paclitaxel elution from reservoirs results in significantly less binary restenosis, less late loss and lower revascularisation rates at eight months. Therefore, based on these data, the CoStar paclitaxel-eluting stent was found to be effective and safe.",

Patients were enrolled at procedure start with no mandated inclusion/exclusion criteria; all cardiac events were monitored with independent adjudication of end-points. Compared to simple use (single vessel/single stent) patients undergoing native intervention (N = 2,698), MVS patients had significantly more baseline comorbidities. Both groups had higher 2-year rates of mortality (7.3%[MVS] and 7.5%[bifurcation] vs. 4.2%[simple-use], P < 0.001), myocardial infarction (5.5% and 4.6% vs. 2.2%, P < 0.001 and P = 0.002), target vessel revascularization (15.5% and 14.8% vs. 7.7%, P < 0.001), and Academic Research Consortium definite/probable stent thrombosis (4.3% and 4.4% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.001) than the simple-use group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nARRIVE multivessel and bifurcation stenting patients have significantly higher clinical risk through 2 years compared to simple-use patients.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExperimental and clinical studies have shown that paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) attenuates the effect of diabetes on re-stenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Although impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a pre-diabetic phase characterized as post-prandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, the efficacy of PES in these pre-diabetic patients remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was therefore to compare the efficacy of PES in IGT patients with that of sirolimus-eluting stent (SES).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nA total of 370 IGT patients with coronary artery disease were examined (SES, n=229; PES, n=141). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization) was compared between the 2 groups. The PES group had lower body mass index, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction than the SES group. The incidence of repeat revascularization in the PES group was similar to that in the SES group (22% vs. 19%, P=0.71). The incidence of hard cardiac events such as all-cause death and non-fatal myocardial infarction were also similar between the 2 groups. Finally, there were no significant differences in MACE between the SES and PES groups (23% vs. 21%, P=0.76).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with IGT, the efficacy of PES was similar to that of SES, and any advantage of PES over SES was not observed in these pre-diabetic patients.",

In addition, 16 (13.7%) developed new ISRs from 95 residual SFs without ISR prior to the second follow-up. Overall, 38 (32.5%) of all 117 SFs developed ISR, and 16 (42.1%) of 38 SFs occurred in a late phase beyond the first 8 months follow-up. A higher risk of ISR in the SF site was associated with the chronic total occlusion (ISR vs. no ISR: 34.2% vs. 16.5%, P = 0.0304), calcified lesions (55.3% vs. 34.2%, P = 0.0299), and correspondence 89.5% versus 43.0%, P < 0.0001 (SF site occurring at the original target lesion site) in the univariate analysis.

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough edge stenosis (ES) is a main limitation of drug-eluting stents, the predictors for ES are not well known. We evaluated the predictors for ES after paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation. MethodsOne hundred and eleven angina patients (64 men; 62.2\u00b18.4 years of age) were divided into ES (n=9) and non-ES groups (n=102). The clinical findings, procedural factors, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) parameters were analyzed. ResultsAlthough clinical characteristics were not different between groups, diabetes mellitus (DM) was more common in the ES group (P=0.002). The vessel, plaque, and lumen areas of the lesions were not different between groups; however, the vessel area of the proximal and distal reference artery was smaller in the ES group. Lesions with positive remodeling were more common in the ES group (P=0.015). On the basis of univariate analysis, predictors of ES included DM, lesions with positive remodeling, IVUS parameters, and procedural factors. After adjusting for clinical findings, angiographic factors, and IVUS parameters, the presence of DM [odds ratio (OR): 9.20; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40\u201360.62, P=0.021] and lesions with positive remodeling (OR: 5.93; 95% CI: 1.13\u201331.02, P=0.035) were independent predictors of ES.

It is unclear whether these differences endure over the medium\u2010 to long\u2010term. We compared the five\u2010year clinical efficacy and safety of sirolimus\u2010eluting stents (SES) and paclitaxel\u2010eluting stents (PES) in a population of high\u2010risk patients. Methods: The patient cohorts of the ISAR\u2010DESIRE, ISAR\u2010DIABETES, and ISAR\u2010SMART\u20103 randomized trials were followed up for five years and data were pooled. The primary efficacy endpoint of the analysis was the need for target lesion revascularization (TLR) during a five\u2010year follow\u2010up period. The primary safety endpoint was the combination of death or myocardial infarction (MI) after five years. Results: A total of 810 patients (405 patients in the SES group and 405 patients in the PES group) was included. Over five years TLR was reduced by 39% with SES compared with PES stent (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44\u20130.85; P = 0.004). No difference was observed according to death or MI rates between the two groups (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.80\u20131.50; P = 0.57). Definite stent thrombosis occurred in 0.2% (n = 1) in the SES group and in 1.6% (n = 6) in the PES group (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.02\u20131.34; P = 0.12). Conclusions: In high\u2010risk patient subsets the lower rate of 12\u2010month TLR observed with SES in comparison PES is maintained out to five years. In terms of safety, although there was no difference in the overall incidence of death or MI, there was a trend towards more frequent stent thromboses with PES. \u00a9 2011 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

Objectives: We sought to prospectively determine the safety of selective DES implantation for long lesions (>20 mm), small vessels (<2.5 mm) and diabetic patients in patients with STEMI using a prospective single\u2010center registry. Methods: A total of 252 patients who underwent primary PCI between January 2005 and December 2006 were included: 126 consecutive patients receiving DES were compared with 126 age\u2010, sex\u2010, and vessel\u2010matched controls with STEMI who received bare\u2010metal stents. Composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (death, AMI, and target vessel revascularization) were used as the primary outcome measure. Results: Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics and outcomes were similar between groups except for the prespecified diabetes, lesion length, and maximum stent diameter. Long\u2010term outcomes at a median follow up of 34 \u00b1 6 months showed significant reductions in reinfarction (2% vs. 11%, P = 0.03), target vessel revascularization (TVR) (10% vs. 24%, P = 0.02), and composite MACE (18% vs. 31%, P = 0.03) with DES, with no excess of death (9% vs. 7%, P = NS) or LaST (2% vs. 1%, P = NS). In a Cox multivariate model, clopidogrel cessation at long\u2010term follow\u2010up was the most powerful predictor of hierarchical MACE (HR: 5.165; 95%CI: 2.019\u201313.150, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Selective DES implantation in patients with high\u2010risk STEMI appears safe, and exposes fewer patients to the risk of LaST.
