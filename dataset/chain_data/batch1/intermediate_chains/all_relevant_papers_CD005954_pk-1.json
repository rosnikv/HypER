        "abstract": "The study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of hydrotherapy on \u201cfailed back surgery syndrome\u201d. Eight participants were assigned to an aquatic exercise group. The analgesic medication was withdrawn during the study. Evaluation parameters included the results of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and spine mobility. The patients were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 6-week follow-up period. The results showed that hydrotherapy had a positive impact on the outcome of chronic post-surgical low back pain. After 6 weeks of hydrotherapy, without analgesic medication, the overall mobility of the spine improved and back pain decreased. We conclude that aquatic exercises may positively impact the outcome of \u201cfailed back surgery syndrome\u201d, probably remaining one of the few successful measures in the management of this kind of patient.",
