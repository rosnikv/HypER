            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate whether, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, the addition of metformin to insulin and standard diabetes management results in 1) higher insulin sensitivity and 2) lower HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin dosage (units per kilogram per day) and BMI.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis was a randomized, placebo-controlled 3-month trial of metformin therapy in 27 adolescents with type 1 diabetes, high insulin dosage (>1 unit. kg(-1). day(-1)), and HbA1c >8%, with measurements of insulin sensitivity (by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test [FSIGT]), HbA1c, insulin dosage, and BMI at the onset and end of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt t = 0, HbA1c was 9.2 +/- 0.9%, insulin dosage was 1.2 +/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1), fasting glucose was 10.6 +/- 2.4 mmol/l, and BMI was 24.2 +/- 3.9 kg/m2 (means +/- SD), with no difference between the metformin and placebo groups. At the end of the study, HbA1c was 0.6% lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). This was achieved at lower daily insulin dosages (metformin group -0.14 +/- 0.1 vs. placebo group 0.02 +/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1); P < 0.05), with no significant change in BMI. Fasting glucose levels improved significantly in the metformin group (P < 0.05). Change in insulin sensitivity, measured by FSIGT, was not significantly different between the two groups at study end. Mild hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in the metformin-treated than in the placebo subjects (1.75 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.4 events. patient(-1). week(-1); P = 0.03). There were no differences in frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes or gastrointestinal complaints between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin treatment lowered HbA1c and decreased insulin dosage with no weight gain in teens with type 1 diabetes in poor metabolic control. Changes in insulin sensitivity were not documented in this study using the FSIGT. Long-term studies will determine whether these improvements are sustained and whether certain subgroups accrue greater benefit from this therapy.",

Metformin has been used as a therapeutic agent in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and in T1D patients without hyperandrogenism. This study sought to determine the effect of metformin on hyperandrogenism and ovarian function in adolescents with T1D. Methods: We recruited 24 girls with T1D. The participants had hyperandrogenism and displayed suboptimal metabolic control. The patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One group received metformin (850 mg bid) and the other group received a placebo. Treatment was administered for 9 months. Ovulation, steroids and gonadotropin levels were evaluated. Results: Metformin treatment was associated with decreases in testosterone, free androgen index, androstenedione, 17-OH progesterone and estradiol levels. The girls who were treated with placebo showed stable steroid, gonadotropin and sex hormone-binding globulin levels during the analysis. No differences were observed in the Ferriman-Gallwey scores, ovulation rates, HbA1c levels or daily insulin doses of the girls treated with metformin compared with the placebo group. Conclusion: Treating hyperandrogenic T1D adolescents with metformin significantly decreased the serum androgens compared to the placebo, but metformin therapy did not significantly affect clinical parameters, such as hirsutism, ovulation and metabolic control.",

            "abstract": "Context Insulin resistance has been proposed as one of the causes of poor glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear. Objective To compare the effect of metformin vs. placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and other parameters in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Hypothesis Adjunctive metformin therapy will improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Design, Setting, and Participants A 9-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of metformin and placebo in 28 subjects (13m/15f) of ages 10-20years (y), with HbA1c >8% (64 mmol/mol), BMI >85%, and T1D > 12 months was conducted at a university outpatient facility. The metformin group consisted of 15 subjects (8 m/ 7f), of age 15.0 \u00b1 2.5 y; while the control group was made up of 13 subjects (5m/ 8f), of age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1y. All participants employed a self-directed treat-to-target insulin regimen based on a titration algorithm of (-2)-0-(+2) units to adjust their long-acting insulin dose every 3rd day from -3 mo through +9 mo to maintain fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 90\u2013120 mg/dL (5.0\u20136.7 mmol/L). Pubertal maturation was determined by Tanner stage. Results Over the course of the 9 months of observation, the between-treatment differences in HbA1c of 0.4% (9.85% [8.82 to 10.88] for placebo versus 9.46% [8.47 to 10.46] for metformin) was not significant (p = 0.903). There were non-significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (189.4 mg/dL [133.2 to 245.6] for placebo versus 170.5 mg/dL [114.3 to 226.7] for metformin), (p = 0.927); total daily dose (TDD) of short-acting insulin per kg body weight/day(p = 0.936); and the TDD of long-acting insulin per kg body weight per day (1.15 units/kg/day [0.89 to 1.41] for placebo versus 0.90 units/kg/day [0.64 to 1.16] for metformin) (p = 0.221). There was no difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between the groups. Conclusions This 9-month RCT of adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight and obese youth with T1D resulted in a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group.

            "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and relates strongly to insulin resistance (IR). Lean and obese adolescents with T1DM have marked IR. Metformin improves surrogate markers of IR in T1DM, but its effect on directly measured IR and vascular health in youth with T1DM is unclear. We hypothesized that adolescents with T1DM have impaired vascular function and that metformin improves this IR and vascular dysfunction. Methods: Adolescents with T1DM and control participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the ascending (AA) and descending aorta to assess pulse wave velocity, relative area change, and maximal (WSSMAX) and time-averaged (WSSTA) wall shear stress. Participants with T1DM also underwent assessment of carotid intima-media thickness by ultrasound, brachial distensibility by DynaPulse, fat and lean mass by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, fasting laboratories after overnight glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (glucose infusion rate/insulin). Adolescents with T1DM were randomized 1:1 to 3 months of 2000 mg metformin or placebo daily, after which baseline measures were repeated. Results: Forty-eight adolescents with T1DM who were 12 to 21 years of age (40% body mass index [BMI] \u226590th percentile; 56% female) and 24 nondiabetic control participants of similar age, BMI, and sex distribution were enrolled. Adolescents with T1DM demonstrated impaired aortic health compared with control participants, including elevated AA and descending aorta pulse wave velocity, reduced AA and descending aorta relative area change, and elevated AA and descending aorta WSSMAX and WSSTA. Adolescents with T1DM in the metformin versus placebo group had improved glucose infusion rate/insulin (12.2\u00b13.2 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22122.4\u00b13.6 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.005; 18.6\u00b14.8 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22123.4\u00b15.6 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.005) and reduced weight (\u22120.5\u00b10.5 kg versus 1.6\u00b10.5 kg; P=0.004), BMI (\u22120.2\u00b10.15 kg/m2 versus 0.4\u00b10.15 kg/m2; P=0.005), and fat mass (\u22120.7\u00b10.3 kg versus 0.6\u00b10.4 kg; P=0.01). Glucose infusion rate/insulin also improved in normal-weight participants (11.8\u00b14.4 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22124.5\u00b14.4 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.02; 17.6\u00b16.7 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22127.0\u00b16.7 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.02). The metformin group had reduced AA WSSMAX (\u22120.3\u00b10.4 dyne/cm2 versus 1.5\u00b10.5 dyne/cm2; P=0.03), AA pulse wave velocity (\u22121.1\u00b11.20 m/s versus 4.1\u00b11.6 m/s; P=0.04), and far-wall diastolic carotid intima-media thickness (\u22120.04\u00b10.01 mm versus \u22120.00\u00b10.01 mm; P=0.049) versus placebo.

Adolescents with T1DM in the metformin versus placebo group had improved glucose infusion rate/insulin (12.2\u00b13.2 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22122.4\u00b13.6 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.005; 18.6\u00b14.8 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22123.4\u00b15.6 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.005) and reduced weight (\u22120.5\u00b10.5 kg versus 1.6\u00b10.5 kg; P=0.004), BMI (\u22120.2\u00b10.15 kg/m2 versus 0.4\u00b10.15 kg/m2; P=0.005), and fat mass (\u22120.7\u00b10.3 kg versus 0.6\u00b10.4 kg; P=0.01). Glucose infusion rate/insulin also improved in normal-weight participants (11.8\u00b14.4 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22124.5\u00b14.4 [mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.02; 17.6\u00b16.7 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L versus \u22127.0\u00b16.7 [mg\u00b7lean kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121]/&mgr;IU/&mgr;L, P=0.02). The metformin group had reduced AA WSSMAX (\u22120.3\u00b10.4 dyne/cm2 versus 1.5\u00b10.5 dyne/cm2; P=0.03), AA pulse wave velocity (\u22121.1\u00b11.20 m/s versus 4.1\u00b11.6 m/s; P=0.04), and far-wall diastolic carotid intima-media thickness (\u22120.04\u00b10.01 mm versus \u22120.00\u00b10.01 mm; P=0.049) versus placebo. Conclusions: Adolescents with T1DM demonstrate IR and impaired vascular health compared with control participants. Metformin improves IR, regardless of baseline BMI, and BMI, weight, fat mass, insulin dose, and aortic and carotid health in adolescents with T1DM. Metformin may hold promise as a cardioprotective intervention in T1DM. Clinical Trial Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01808690.",

            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nType 1 diabetes in adolescence is characterized by insulin deficiency and insulin resistance (IR), both thought to increase cardiovascular disease risk. We previously demonstrated that adolescents with type 1 diabetes have adipose, hepatic, and muscle IR, and that metformin lowers daily insulin dose, suggesting improved IR. However, whether metformin improves IR in muscle, hepatic, or adipose tissues in type 1 diabetes was unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nMeasure peripheral, hepatic, and adipose insulin sensitivity before and after metformin or placebo therapy in youth with obesity with type 1 diabetes.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nMulti-center at eight sites of the T1D Exchange Clinic Network.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA subset of 12- to 19-year-olds with type 1 diabetes (inclusion criteria: body mass index \u226585th percentile, HbA1c 7.5% to 9.9%, insulin dosing \u22650.8 U/kg/d) from a larger trial (NCT02045290) were enrolled.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nParticipants were randomized to 3 months of metformin (N = 19) or placebo (N = 18) and underwent a three-phase hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess tissue-specific IR before and after treatment.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPeripheral insulin sensitivity, endogenous glucose release, rate of lipolysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween-group differences in change in insulin sensitivity favored metformin regarding whole-body IR [change in glucose infusion rate 1.3 (0.1, 2.4) mg/kg/min, P = 0.03] and peripheral IR [change in metabolic clearance rate 0.923 (-0.002, 1.867) dL/kg/min, P = 0.05]. Metformin did not impact insulin suppression of endogenous glucose release (P = 0.12). Adipose IR was not assessable with traditional methods in this highly IR population.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin appears to improve whole-body and peripheral IR in youth who are overweight/obese with type 1 diabetes.",

Patients and methods A total of 65 adults with T1DM were enrolled and subjected to physical examination, fasting laboratory tests, and continuous glucose monitoring, and subsequently randomized 1:1 to 3 months of 1000\u20132000 mg metformin daily add-on insulin (MET group, n = 34) or insulin (non-MET group, n\u2009=\u200931).

            "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) individuals is increasing. Overweight people with T1DM may be insulin resistant. Glycaemic variability (GV) is an emerging measure of glycaemic control. The aim of this study is to investigate whether metformin, in adjunct to insulin, would have any favourable effect on GV. Methods: This was a multi-centre, open-label randomised crossover study. Twenty-four overweight/obese T1DM patients aged \u2a7e18\u2009years old with HbA1c\u2009\u2a7e\u20097.0% (53\u2009mmol/mol) were recruited and randomised into two study arms. For first 6-week, one arm remained on standard of care (SOC), the other arm received metformin, adjunctive to SOC. After 2-week washout, patients crossed over and continued for another 6\u2009weeks. Glycaemic variability, other glycaemic parameters and metabolic profile were monitored. Results: There were significant reduction in metformin group for GV: mean (0.18\u2009\u00b1\u20091.73 vs \u22120.95\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24, p\u2009=\u20090.014), %CV (\u221215.84 (18.92) vs \u221219.08 (24.53), p\u2009=\u20090.044), glycemic risk assessment of diabetes equation (\u22120.69 (3.83) vs \u22121.61 (3.61), p\u2009=\u20090.047), continuous overlapping net glycaemic action (0.25\u2009\u00b1\u20091.62 vs \u22120.85\u2009\u00b1\u20091.22, p\u2009=\u20090.013), J-index (\u22120.75 (21.91) vs \u22127.11 (13.86), p\u2009=\u20090.034), time in range (1.13\u2009\u00b1\u200914.12% vs 10.83\u2009\u00b1\u200915.47%, p\u2009=\u20090.032); changes of systolic blood pressure (2.78\u2009\u00b1\u200911.19\u2009mmHg vs \u22124.30\u2009\u00b1\u20099.81\u2009mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.027) and total daily dose (TDD) insulin (0.0 (3.33)\u2009units vs \u22122.17 (11.45)\u2009units, p\u2009=\u20090.012). Hypoglycaemic episodes were not significant in between groups. Conclusion: Metformin showed favourable effect on GV in overweight/obese T1DM patients and reduction in systolic blood pressure, TDD insulin, fasting venous glucose and fructosamine.",
