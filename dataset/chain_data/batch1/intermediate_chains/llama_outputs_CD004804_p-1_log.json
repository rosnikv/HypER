            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare medication adherence calculated from four different data sources including a pill count and self-report obtained during a home medication history, as well as calculations based on refill frequency derived from a provincial prescription claims database (manual and electronic). DESIGN: Baseline medication adherence was collected as part of a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Mean medication adherence results obtained from the four data sources were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple range test. SETTING: A pharmacy consultation service located at an interdisciplinary wellness center for noninstitutionalized elderly. PATIENTS: 65 years or older, noninstitutionalized, taking one or more prescribed or nonprescribed medications. Clients would either present to the wellness center or be referred by the Provincial Home Care program. RESULTS: When calculated from self-report or manual or electronic prescription claims data, mean percent adherence by drug was high and not statistically different (95.8% \u00b1 17.1%, 107.6% \u00b1 40.3%, and 94.6% \u00b1 24.0%, respectively), whereas the pill count adherence was significantly lower at 74.0% \u00b1 41.5% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An unexpected finding was that the pill count technique used in this study of elderly clients using chronic, repeat medications appeared to underestimate medication adherence. Numerous other limitations of pill count, self-report, and a province-wide prescription claims database in estimating medication adherence are presented. When using medication adherence as a process measure, the researcher and practitioner should be aware of the limitations unique to the data source they choose, and interpret data cautiously.",

DESIGN A cross-sectional study of consecutive patients from a university-based HIV clinic in Rome, Italy, was conducted. One hundred and forty HIV-infected patients were prescribed regimens containing ritonavir or indinavir. A patient questionnaire assessing knowledge of treatment regimen, adherence behavior, reasons for taking and missing therapy, factors influencing adherence, and health behaviors was administered. A predose PI plasma level was measured concurrently. RESULTS By patient report, 12% missed at least one dose \"yesterday,\" and 24% missed doses in the last 3 days; 14% had a predose plasma concentration below the assay limit of quantitation (2 ritonavir and 18 indinavir samples). Confusion, poor psychological well-being, long office wait, running out of drugs between visits, having relatives to remind the patient to take medication, children, and alteration of sense of taste were related to unquantifiable predose levels of PI. In multivariable analysis, reported nonadherence (odds ratio [OR], 15.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-63.3) and confusion (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.4-69.6) were related to unquantifiable predose levels of PI.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To compare self-reported nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART) with predose plasma levels of protease inhibitor (PI). DESIGN A cross-sectional study of consecutive patients from a university-based HIV clinic in Rome, Italy, was conducted. One hundred and forty HIV-infected patients were prescribed regimens containing ritonavir or indinavir. A patient questionnaire assessing knowledge of treatment regimen, adherence behavior, reasons for taking and missing therapy, factors influencing adherence, and health behaviors was administered. A predose PI plasma level was measured concurrently. RESULTS By patient report, 12% missed at least one dose \"yesterday,\" and 24% missed doses in the last 3 days; 14% had a predose plasma concentration below the assay limit of quantitation (2 ritonavir and 18 indinavir samples). Confusion, poor psychological well-being, long office wait, running out of drugs between visits, having relatives to remind the patient to take medication, children, and alteration of sense of taste were related to unquantifiable predose levels of PI. In multivariable analysis, reported nonadherence (odds ratio [OR], 15.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-63.3) and confusion (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.4-69.6) were related to unquantifiable predose levels of PI. CONCLUSION Self-report of missing a dose of antiretroviral medication \"yesterday\" was related to an unmeasurable plasma PI level.",

            "abstract": "AbstractOBJECTIVE: Adherence to complex antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for HIV treatment but difficult to achieve. The development of interventions to improve adherence requires detailed information regarding barriers to adherence. However, short follow-up and inadequate adherence measures have hampered such determinations. We sought to assess predictors of long-term (up to 1 year) adherence to newly initiated combination ART using an accurate, objective adherence measure.\n DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 140 HIV-infected patients at a county hospital HIV clinic during the year following initiation of a new highly active ART regimen.\n MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured adherence every 4 weeks, computing a composite score from electronic medication bottle caps, pill count and self-report. We evaluated patient demographic, biomedical, and psychosocial characteristics, features of the regimen, and relationship with one\u2019s HIV provider as predictors of adherence over 48 weeks. On average, subjects took 71% of prescribed doses with over 95% of patients achieving suboptimal (<95%) adherence. In multivariate analyses, African-American ethnicity, lower income and education, alcohol use, higher dose frequency, and fewer adherence aids (e.g., pillboxes, timers) were independently associated with worse adherence. After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, those actively using drugs took 59% of doses versus 72% for nonusers, and those drinking alcohol took 66% of doses versus 74% for nondrinkers. Patients with more antiretroviral doses per day adhered less well. Participants using no adherence aids took 68% of doses versus 76% for those in the upper quartile of number of adherence aids used.\n CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all patients\u2019 adherence levels were suboptimal, demonstrating the critical need for programs to assist patients with medication taking.

Electronic monitors (MEMS) were used to measure antiretroviral adherence. Median adherence among women was 27% lower than among men (46% vs. 73%; P<.05). In gender-stratified multivariate models, factors associated with worse adherence in men included not belonging to an HIV support group (P<.0001), crack/cocaine use (P<.005), and medication side effects (P=.01). Among women, alcohol use (P=.005), heroin use (P<.05), and significant medication side effects (P<.005) were independently associated with worse adherence.

            "abstract": "Objective:We examined the independent effect of alcohol and combined effects of drug and alcohol use on antiretroviral (ART) utilization, adherence, and viral suppression in an urban cohort of HIV-infected individuals. Methods:In an observational clinical cohort, alcohol use, active drug use, and adherence were prospectively assessed at 6-month intervals. We classified hazardous alcohol use as >7 drinks/week or >3 drinks/occasion in women, and >14 drinks/week or >4 drinks/occasion in men and active drug use as any use in the previous 6 months. Our outcomes included ART utilization, 2-week adherence, and viral suppression. We used generalized estimating equations to analyze the association between independent variables and outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, years on ART, and clinic enrollment time. Results:Between 1998 and 2003, 1711 individuals participated in 5028 interviews. 1433 of these individuals received ART accounting for 3761 interviews. The prevalence of any alcohol use at the first interview was 45%, with 10% classified as hazardous drinkers. One-third of the sample used illicit drugs. In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, sex, race, active drug use, years on ART, and clinic enrollment time, hazardous alcohol use was independently associated with decreased ART utilization (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.82), 2-week adherence (AOR, 0.46; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.63), and viral suppression (AOR, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.99) compared to no alcohol use. Concurrent injection drug use (IDU) exacerbated this negative effect on ART use, adherence, and suppression. Conclusions:Hazardous alcohol use alone and combined with IDU was associated with decreased ART uptake, adherence, and viral suppression. Interventions targeting alcohol use may improve HIV outcomes in individuals with hazardous alcohol use.",

Methods:We prospectively assessed CD4 cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and alcohol consumption for up to 7 years in 595 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems recruited between 1997 and 2003. We investigated the relation of these markers of HIV disease progression to alcohol consumption using longitudinal regression models controlling for known prognostic factors, including adherence and depressive symptoms, and stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results:Among subjects who were not on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a lower CD4 cell count (adjusted mean decrease of 48.6 cells/\u03bcL compared with abstinence; P = 0.03) but not with higher log10 HIV RNA. Among subjects who were on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was not associated with a lower CD4 cell count or higher log10 HIV RNA. Conclusions:Heavy alcohol consumption has a negative impact on the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected persons not receiving ART.

            "abstract": "Abstract We evaluated the association of alcohol consumption and depression, and their effects on HIV disease progression among women with HIV. The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993\u20131995 in four US cities. The participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, CD4+T-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until March 2000. Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. There was no significant association between level of alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell counts. When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, the association between alcohol and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance. The association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). Depression had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. Moreover, depression is associated with HIV disease progression. Our findings have implications for the provision of alcohol use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with HIV.",

High perceived stigma was strongly associated with poor psychological quality of domain among both female and male groups with [AOR = 2.89(1.69,4.96)] and [AOR = 2.5(1.4,4.4)], respectively. Conclusion. There was statistically significant gender difference in all quality of life domains. Public health interventions to improve HRQOL of PLHIV should take in to account the physical, psychological, social, environmental, and spiritual health of PLHIV during treatment, care, and support.",

            "abstract": "Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a major global public health problem with more than 35 million people worldwide infected so far. Evidence shows that HIV has been compromising the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLWH) even in this era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). There has been little research into the quality of life of PLWH receiving HAART in Ethiopia. Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life among PLWH attending anti-retroviral therapy at public health facilities of Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia, in 2019. Patients and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study design on 391 randomly selected PLWH who were attending HAART. We used a systematic random sampling technique to select participants in public health facilities of Arba Minch town from February 16 to April 26, 2019. The interviewers administered a structured questionnaire consisting of the WHOQOL-HIV BREF tool to measure the quality of life. Socio-demographic variables of study participants were collected, together with variables related to their clinical status extracted from their clinical records. Percentage mean scores were calculated and the mean of percentage mean scores was taken as the cutoff to categorize participants into two groups representing poor and good quality of life. Simple binary logistic regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine significant variables. All variables with p-value \u2264 0.25 in simple binary logistic regression were considered as eligible variables for multivariable logistic regression. Variables with p-value \u2264 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were considered as predictor variables. Results Out of the 391 enrolled adult PLWH, 184 of them (47.1%) had poor of overall quality of life status, as estimated by the WHOQOL-HIV BREF tool. Good quality of life was positively associated with recent CD4 count greater than or equal to 500 cell/mm3 (AOR=1.96, 95% CI; 1.18\u20133.27), absence of depression (AOR=10.59, 95% CI; 6.16\u201318.21), normal body mass index (AOR=2.66, 95% CI; 1.18\u20133.27), social support (AOR= 6.18, 95% CI; 3.56\u201310.75) and no perceived stigma (AOR=2.75, 95% CI; 1.62\u20134.67). Conclusion Nearly half of the adult PLWH receiving HAART at Arba Minch town had poor quality of life. High CD4 count, lack of social support, depression, and perceived stigma were associated with poor quality of life of PLWH. PLWH should be encouraged to be part of structured social support systems, such as associations of people living with HIV and mother support groups, in order to improve their social and psychological health. The health system should give attention to counseling on chronic care adherence and nutritional support to improve the quality of life of PLWH receiving HAART.",

            "abstract": "Background Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) is a standard of HIV management to suppress viral load and delay progression to AIDS. However, questions have been raised about the use of antiretroviral therapy and how it affects quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The study hence aimed to assess the QoL of PLWHA who were taking HAART at Mizan\u2013Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH) and identify factors associated with QoL. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among PLWHA receiving HAART at MTUTH from March 04-April 1, 2018. Patients were recruited consecutively and interviewed with structured questionnaire. A data abstraction tool was used to extract data from patient medical records. Quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV- BREF (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF) standard tool. Data was entered to Epi-Info version 3.5.3 and analyzed using SPSS version 22 for windows. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify factors associated with QoL. A statistical significance was established at a p value <0.05. Results A total of 240 participants with the mean age of 35.11 (SD = 9.08) years were included in the study. This study found that 57.1% of the patients had high global score of QoL. Patients with normal current health (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.56\u20137.31)) and having family support (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.51\u20136.46) were positively associated with high global score of QoL, while patients with low HAART adherence (AOR = 0.40, 95%, CI = 0.19\u20130.86) were negatively associated with high global score of QoL. Conclusion The study revealed that more than half of the participants had high global score of QoL. Normal current health and family support were associated with better global score of QoL, while low HAART adherence was found to be associated with the lower global score of QoL.",

Methods This is a prospective cohort study conducted at the Medication Dispensing Unit of a university hospital (MDU-UH) located in southeastern Brazil. Study population comprised HIV/AIDS patients starting antiretroviral treatment at MDU. The final sample comprised 99 participants. Patients were followed up for 24 months from their recruitment. We used a face-to-face questionnaire to determine sociodemographic and behavioural variables. Quality of life (QoL) and coping strategies (CS) were measured through validated instruments. Results Regarding the QoL dimensions, the general perception of QoL among these participants was considered good. Regarding CS, the adherent patients scored higher than the nonadherents. Conclusions The present study revealed that the perceived QoL can be maintained in individuals treated for HIV/AIDS. There is an association between high score of coping strategies and adherence to HAART.",

A cross-sectional study with a sample of 385 patients followed-up on an outpatient basis. Interviews were conducted using the Sociodemographic, Epidemiological and Clinical Form, the World Health Organization\u2019s Quality of Life in PLWH Instrument, the Assessment of Adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. The odds ratio and confidence interval were calculated, considering P\u2009<\u20090.05 as statistically significant. Of the 385 PLWH, 134 (34.8%) had unsatisfactory QOL which was associated with unemployment (P\u2009=\u20090.0037), monthly income less than the minimum wage (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), sleep disorders (P\u2009=\u20090.0039) and not doing regular exercise (P\u2009=\u20090.0032). Inadequate adherence to ART occurred in 24 patients (6.23%) and was associated with detectable viral load (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) and unsatisfactory QOL (P\u2009=\u20090.0033). QOL was more unsatisfactory for those unemployed and with low income, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle. People with detectable viral load and unsatisfactory QOL had more inadequate adherence to ART.",
