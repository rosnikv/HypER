Outcomes included the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, patient's and physician's overall assessments of disease activity, and concurrent corticosteroid dosages (which were adjusted as clinically indicated).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the patients who were receiving DHEA, the SLEDAI score, patient's and physician's overall assessment of disease activity, and concurrent prednisone dosage decreased, while in the patients taking placebo, small increases were seen. The difference in patient's assessment between the groups was statistically significant (P = 0.022, adjusted). Lupus flares occurred more frequently in the placebo group (P = 0.053). Mild acne was a frequent side effect of DHEA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDHEA may be useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE. Further studies of DHEA in the treatment of SLE are warranted.",

            "abstract": "This study examines whether changes in the cytokine milieu of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are associated with abnormal levels of sex hormone levels in serum. The concentration of 17b-estradiol (E2), progesterone (Pg) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) was monitored in sera from 128 lupus patients and 96 controls, and correlated with the activity of their cytokine secreting cells. Results indicate that SLE patients have (i) significantly fewer cells secreting IFNg, (ii) increased serum E2 and Pg levels, and (iii) reduced serum DHEAS levels compared to normal controls. However, the observed abnormalities in the cytokine milieu of SLE patients did not correlate with abnormalities in serum sex hormone levels. Instead, the association between IFNg production and DHEAS levels evident in healthy controls is absent in SLE patients, suggesting that cells from lupus patients are defective in their ability to produce IFNg in response to physiologic stimuli. Similarly, the normal correlation between IL-4 production and E2 levels was lost in patients with severe disease. Thus, while it remains possible that increased E2 and reduced DHEAS levels in lupus patients may help induce cytokine abnormalities early in disease, the subsequent cytokine imbalance does not correlate with sex hormone levels.",
