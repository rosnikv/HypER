            "abstract": "Encopresis is characterized by the voluntary or involuntary passage of stool into the underwear after the age of 4 years. In most patients, encopresis is the result of constipation. However, in our practice, 20% of children experience encopresis as an isolated complaint, without any signs of constipation. These children have normal defecation frequency, no palpable abdominal or rectal fecal mass on physical examination, and normal colonic transit time. Laxatives have no or an adverse effect in these children (1). Recently, encopresis in the absence of signs of fecal retention has been classified as functional non-retentive fecal soiling by the new pediatric Rome-II criteria (2). The treatment of these children is often disappointing, with only 29% of patients cured after 2 years of intensive treatment (3). In contrast to earlier reports (4), recent data show that 24% of children with functional non-retentive fecal soiling do not outgrow their encopresis during puberty and still experience encopresis when reaching adulthood (5). This large number of patients with encopresis after the age of 18 justifies the search for treatment options for this patient group. The symptoms of children with functional nonretentive fecal soiling resembles those of adults with idiopathic fecal incontinence, incontinence without a known underlying cause. In most adult patients, however, fecal incontinence is a result of trauma (after delivery) or by the aging processes. In adulthood fecal incontinence, loperamide is a well-known and frequently used medication. A study in adults with chronic diarrhea and fecal incontinence showed that the oral administration of loperamide, an opioid agonist, resulted in significant improvement of continence (6). Here, we describe a 20-year-old male with childhoodonset, longstanding functional non-retentive fecal soiling who dramatically improved after rectal application of loperamide.",

            "abstract": "In the 19th century, academics and clinicians travelled to Europe to learn the latest advances in medical science and clinical practice. German medicine was at its zenith, and its stars \u2014 Koch, Billroth, Virchow and others \u2014 were the drawcards at international medical congresses, events which regularly attracted up to 10000 delegates from over 50 countries. Those attending a congress usually spent their time visiting laboratories and clinics in European capitals, such as Berlin, Paris or London. But this was also the era of difficult travel over land and sea, so decisions to attend a conference were not taken lightly. Thankfully, the choice of conferences was limited. No more. Most international destinations can now be reached within a day, and the choice of conferences is overwhelming. One has only to enter \u201cinternational medical congress\u201d into Google and more than a quarter of a million sites spew forth. This burgeoning of meetings has practical consequences, such as depleting the numbers of academics present in faculties at any given time. Indeed, this regular absenteeism has prompted the pejorative, \u201cabsent professors\u201d, and given rise to riddles with a particular sting: \u201cWhy is the Medical Faculty like the US Strategic Air Command?\u201d \u201cBecause 30% or more of its professors are in the air at any one time.\u201d Does all this matter? The absence of professors while they attend conferences or sit on research committees reflects the reality in academic medicine \u2014 that research is valued far more than teaching. Paradoxically, the word \u201cprofessor\u201d means to profess \u2014 to teach. The absence of professors means that this task is delegated to junior staff. Surely this behaviour makes a mockery of the title \u201cProfessor\u201d. Perhaps a new academic adage \u2014 \u201ctravel rather than teach\u201d \u2014 should now be added to \u201cpublish or perish\u201d.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo review both the scientific literature and lay literature on toilet training, covering parents' expectations, the methods available for achieving bladder and bowel control and associated morbidities.\n\n\nSOURCES\nArticles published between 1960 and 2007, identified via the MEDLINE, Cochrane Collaboration, ERIC, Web of Science, LILACS and SciELO databases plus queries on the Google search engine; a search of related articles, references of articles, by author and of pediatrics societies. A total of 473 articles were examined and 85 of these were selected for this review.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS\nParents have unrealistic expectations about the age at which diapers can be withdrawn, not taking child development into account. Toilet training strategies have not changed over recent decades, and in the majority of countries the age at which children are trained has been postponed. Training methods are rarely used. Starting toilet training prematurely and stressful events during this period can extend the training process. Children who have not been trained correctly present with enuresis, urinary infection, voiding dysfunction, constipation, encopresis and refusal to go to the toilet more frequently. Literature intended for lay parents is both abundant and adequate, available in book form and on the Internet, but it is not widely available to the Brazilian population. Just three international pediatrics societies have published guidelines on toilet training.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nToilet training is occurring later in the majority of countries. The training methods that exist are the same from decades ago and are rarely used by mothers and valued little by pediatricians; incorrect training can be a causative factor for bladder and bowel disorders, which in turn cause problems for children and their families.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo review both the scientific literature and lay literature on toilet training, covering parents' expectations, the methods available for achieving bladder and bowel control and associated morbidities.\n\n\nSOURCES\nArticles published between 1960 and 2007, identified via the MEDLINE, Cochrane Collaboration, ERIC, Web of Science, LILACS and SciELO databases plus queries on the Google search engine; a search of related articles, references of articles, by author and of pediatrics societies. A total of 473 articles were examined and 85 of these were selected for this review.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS\nParents have unrealistic expectations about the age at which diapers can be withdrawn, not taking child development into account. Toilet training strategies have not changed over recent decades, and in the majority of countries the age at which children are trained has been postponed. Training methods are rarely used. Starting toilet training prematurely and stressful events during this period can extend the training process. Children who have not been trained correctly present with enuresis, urinary infection, voiding dysfunction, constipation, encopresis and refusal to go to the toilet more frequently. Literature intended for lay parents is both abundant and adequate, available in book form and on the Internet, but it is not widely available to the Brazilian population. Just three international pediatrics societies have published guidelines on toilet training.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nToilet training is occurring later in the majority of countries. The training methods that exist are the same from decades ago and are rarely used by mothers and valued little by pediatricians; incorrect training can be a causative factor for bladder and bowel disorders, which in turn cause problems for children and their families.",

Methods: The study was a case control study between two groups in a tertiary care children hospital in Dhaka city. In group-1 (n=45) those children having history of constipation and in group-2 (n=78) as a control group having no history of constipation were included in this study. Growths of a single species of organism with colony count of >10 5 /ml in a clean-catch midstream single urine sample was considered as evidence of urinary tract infection. Results: Positive urine culture was found in 8.9% (4/45) cases in children who had history of constipation and 1.3% (1/78) in children who had no history of constipation. Though the number of positive urine culture was seven times more in children with constipation than those who were not constipated but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=0.059) . Conclusion: Culture documented UTI in children with constipation is seven times more than without constipation showing impact of constipation on urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.
