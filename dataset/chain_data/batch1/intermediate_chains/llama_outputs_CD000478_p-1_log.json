DESIGN--One year placebo controlled double blind trial of withdrawal or continuation of azathioprine. SETTING--Outpatient clinics of five hospitals. SUBJECTS--79 patients with ulcerative colitis who had been taking azathioprine for six months or more. Patients in full remission for two months or more (67), and patients with chronic low grade or corticosteroid dependent disease (12) were randomised separately. 33 patients in remission received azathioprine and 34 placebo; five patients with chronic stable disease received azathioprine and seven placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of relapse. Relapse was defined as worsening of symptoms or sigmoidoscopic appearance. RESULTS--For the remission group the one year rate of relapse was 36% (12/33) for patients continuing azathioprine and 59% (20/34) for those taking placebo (hazard rate ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.0). For the subgroup of 54 patients in long term remission (greater than six months before entry to trial) benefit was still evident, with a 31% (8/26) rate of relapse with azathioprine and 61% (17/28) with placebo (p less than 0.01). For the small group of patients with chronic stable colitis (six were corticosteroid dependent and six had low grade symptoms) no benefit was found from continued azathioprine therapy. Adverse events were minimal. CONCLUSIONS--Azathioprine maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis is beneficial for at least two years if patients have achieved remission while taking the drug. Demonstration of the relapse preventing properties of azathioprine has implications for a large number of patients with troublesome ulcerative colitis, who may benefit from treatment with azathioprine.",

However, use of these drugs has been limited by concerns about their toxicity. Colonic delivery of azathioprine may reduce its systemic bioavailability and limit toxicity. AIM: To determine the bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine after administration of azathioprine via three colonic delivery formulations. METHODS: Twenty four healthy human subjects each received 50 mg of azathioprine by one of four delivery formulations (each n = 6): oral; delayed release oral; hydrophobic rectal foam; and hydrophilic rectal foam. All subjects also received a 50 mg dose of intravenous azathioprine during a separate study period. Plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The bioavailabilities of 6-mercaptopurine after colonic azathioprine administration via delayed release oral, hydrophobic rectal foam, and hydrophilic rectal foam (7%, 5%, 1%; respectively) were significantly lower than the bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine after oral azathioprine administration (47%) by Wilcoxon rank sum pairwise comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine delivered to the colon by delayed release oral and rectal foam formulations considerably reduced systemic 6-mercaptopurine bioavailability. The therapeutic potential of these colonic delivery methods, which can potentially limit toxicity by local delivery of high doses of azathioprine, should be investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

The pharmacology, patient response in controlled trials, new formulations and routes of administration and safety for these agents are reviewed. Pharmacology : AZA is rapidly converted to 6MP, which is then further metabolized to the active metabolites, the 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN). The half-life of 6TGN in erythrocytes is prolonged and weeks to months may be required to reach steady state. This prolonged time to 6TGN steady state may help explain the clinical observation that prolonged treatment (3-4 months) with 6MP/AZA for IBD is required before a therapeutic response occurs. Clinical response: Controlled trials of 6MP (1.5 mg/kg/d) or AZA (1.0-3.0 mg/kg/d) support the following treatment indications for 6MP/AZA: inflammatory Crohn's disease; fistulizing Crohn's disease; steroid-sparing; and remission maintenance. Controlled trials of AZA (1.5-2....",

            "abstract": "Introduction: The use of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased in recent years. The pharmacology, patient response in controlled trials, new formulations and routes of administration and safety for these agents are reviewed. Pharmacology : AZA is rapidly converted to 6MP, which is then further metabolized to the active metabolites, the 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN). The half-life of 6TGN in erythrocytes is prolonged and weeks to months may be required to reach steady state. This prolonged time to 6TGN steady state may help explain the clinical observation that prolonged treatment (3-4 months) with 6MP/AZA for IBD is required before a therapeutic response occurs. Clinical response: Controlled trials of 6MP (1.5 mg/kg/d) or AZA (1.0-3.0 mg/kg/d) support the following treatment indications for 6MP/AZA: inflammatory Crohn's disease; fistulizing Crohn's disease; steroid-sparing; and remission maintenance. Controlled trials of AZA (1.5-2....",

However, the onset of the clinical response is delayed, requiring combination with other active medication in the early phase of treatment. Maintenance therapy with AZA/6-MP is also effective in the prevention of relapses in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Indications for AZA/6-MP therapy further include refractory, fistulizing and steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. It is not known whether or when AZA/6-MP can be withdrawn in patients in long-term remission, but most clinicians discontinue therapy after 3-5 years. Although fewer data are available, AZA/6-PM appears to be effective also in the therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis. Side effects of AZA/6-MP occur in about 15% of patients and include skin rash, pancreatitis and hepatitis, dose-related neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and risk of increased occurrence and severity of infections.

            "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease presents in various forms. Its increasing incidence indicates that modern lifestyle triggers disease in genetically susceptible individuals. We present a model for inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology and review the new biological therapies available. These biological agents have been developed to antagonise the processes of pathogenic inflammation, such as the reduction in T\u2010lymphocyte apoptosis, increase in T\u2010lymphocyte proliferation and increase in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking into the intestinal mucosa. Inhibitors of various inflammatory cytokines, including some antagonists to tumour necrosis factor, are effective therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. However, this class is associated with the risk of rare, but serious, side\u2010effects, such as opportunistic infections and demyelinating diseases. The administration of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin\u201010 and interleukin\u201011, may theoretically be effective in reducing inflammation, although the clinical development of some of these therapies has been terminated. The selective inhibition of the adhesion molecules involved in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking can be effective in reducing gut inflammation. Of the selective adhesion molecule inhibitors under investigation, natalizumab has demonstrated efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease. The future of biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease shows promise.",

            "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease presents in various forms. Its increasing incidence indicates that modern lifestyle triggers disease in genetically susceptible individuals. We present a model for inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology and review the new biological therapies available. These biological agents have been developed to antagonise the processes of pathogenic inflammation, such as the reduction in T\u2010lymphocyte apoptosis, increase in T\u2010lymphocyte proliferation and increase in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking into the intestinal mucosa. Inhibitors of various inflammatory cytokines, including some antagonists to tumour necrosis factor, are effective therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. However, this class is associated with the risk of rare, but serious, side\u2010effects, such as opportunistic infections and demyelinating diseases. The administration of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin\u201010 and interleukin\u201011, may theoretically be effective in reducing inflammation, although the clinical development of some of these therapies has been terminated. The selective inhibition of the adhesion molecules involved in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking can be effective in reducing gut inflammation. Of the selective adhesion molecule inhibitors under investigation, natalizumab has demonstrated efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease. The future of biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease shows promise.",

They are also involved in local lymphocyte stimulation and antigen presentation within the intestinal mucosa. In intestinal inflammation, many adhesion molecules are upregulated, but alpha4-integrins most likely hold a key position in directing leukocytes into the inflamed bowel wall. Therapeutic compounds directed against trafficking of leukocytes have been designed and are being developed as a novel class of drugs in the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This review deals with the immunological aspects of leukocyte trafficking focused on gut homing of T cells. Second, the changes in adhesion molecules and T cell trafficking during intestinal inflammation are discussed. Finally, we review the clinical data that have been gathered with respect to the therapeutic potential and the safety of antiadhesion molecule treatment. Antegren, or natalizumab, a humanized anti-alpha4 integrin IgG4 antibody, has been most extensively evaluated and may be close to registration. A more specific humanized alpha4beta7-integrin MLN-02 has shown preliminary clinical efficacy in ulcerative colitis, and both antergren and MLN-02 appear to be very safe. Trials with the anti-ICAM-1 antisense oligonucleotide ISIS-2302 in steroid refractory Crohn's disease have provided conflicting efficacy data. In the near future, some of these novel biological agents may prove valuable therapeutic tools in the management of refractory inflammatory bowel disease, although it is too early to define the patient population that will benefit most from these agents.",

            "abstract": "Background: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with disturbances in vascular physiology, including permeability and angiogenesis, that are in part regulated by the endothelial intercellular junctions. These junctions are composed of several adhesion molecules including the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (PECAM\u20101, CD31) and the more recently described CD146 (S\u2010Endo1 Ag, MUC18). Aim: To study the expression of tissue and soluble form of CD146 in patients with CD or UC in relation to disease activity and location. This study was made in comparison with the soluble form of CD31 (sCD31). Results: In active disease, a high expression of CD146 was observed on endothelial cells in intestinal biopsies from both CD and UC. In addition, we observed a decrease of sCD146 in relation to active disease and extensive location of CD and UC. Lower levels of sCD31 were also detected in active and extensive location of UC, but no difference could be observed in CD. Conclusion: sCD146 is a novel marker of the endothelial intercellular junction that reflects endothelial remodeling more effectively than soluble CD31. Further studies are warranted to determine whether sCD146 will provide a serological assay reflecting alterations in vascular permeability and vessel proliferation in the inflamed IBD intestine.",

            "abstract": "Background: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with disturbances in vascular physiology, including permeability and angiogenesis, that are in part regulated by the endothelial intercellular junctions. These junctions are composed of several adhesion molecules including the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (PECAM\u20101, CD31) and the more recently described CD146 (S\u2010Endo1 Ag, MUC18). Aim: To study the expression of tissue and soluble form of CD146 in patients with CD or UC in relation to disease activity and location. This study was made in comparison with the soluble form of CD31 (sCD31). Results: In active disease, a high expression of CD146 was observed on endothelial cells in intestinal biopsies from both CD and UC. In addition, we observed a decrease of sCD146 in relation to active disease and extensive location of CD and UC. Lower levels of sCD31 were also detected in active and extensive location of UC, but no difference could be observed in CD. Conclusion: sCD146 is a novel marker of the endothelial intercellular junction that reflects endothelial remodeling more effectively than soluble CD31. Further studies are warranted to determine whether sCD146 will provide a serological assay reflecting alterations in vascular permeability and vessel proliferation in the inflamed IBD intestine.",

            "abstract": "Transendothelial migration of circulating leukocytes into the colonic wall is a key step in the development of the inflammatory infiltrate in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 PECAM-1 (CD31) is expressed in the tight junction area of endothelial cells, where it is supposed to support the transmigration process. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PECAM-1 in experimental IBD and to show whether blockade of PECAM-1 has therapeutic effects. Chronic colitis was induced in female BALB/c mice by cyclic oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) 3% (wt/vol). Expression of PECAM-1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. In the treatment group animals received 1 mg/kg anti-PECAM-1 (2H8) ip daily starting on day 26. On day 30 leukocyte adhesion and migration was measured during N(2)O-isoflurane anesthesia in the distal colon by intravital microscopy. Disease activity index (DAI), histology, and MPO levels were compared with healthy and diseased controls. PECAM-1 was expressed in colitic mice. Chronic DSS colitis was characterized by a marked increase in rolling, adherent, and transmigrated leukocytes compared with healthy controls. Immunoblockade of PECAM-1 reduced leukocyte transmigration significantly and also diminished leukocyte rolling and sticking in an indirect manner. It also resulted in a significantly diminished DAI and MPO levels, as well as an amelioration of the histological inflammation score. PECAM-1 plays an important role in transendothelial leukocyte migration in DSS colitis. PECAM-1 could be a novel target for antibody-based treatment in IBD.",

            "abstract": "Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have shown benefit in clinical trials of patients with liver disease. Efficient delivery of cells to target organs is critical to improving their effectiveness. This requires an understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular engraftment into the liver. Binding of hMSCs to normal/injured liver tissue, purified extracellular matrices, and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) were quantified in static and flow conditions. To define the mechanisms underpinning hMSC interactions, neutralizing adhesion molecule antibodies were used. Fluorescently labelled hMSCs were infused intraportally into CCl4\u2013injured mice with and without neutralizing antibodies. hMSCs expressed high levels of CD29/\u03b21\u2010integrin and CD44. Using liver tissue binding assays, hMSC adhesion was greatest in diseased human liver versus normal liver (32.2 cells/field versus 20.5 cells/field [P = 0.048]). Neutralizing antibodies against CD29 and CD44 reduced hMSC binding to diseased liver by 34% and 35%, respectively (P = 0.05). hMSCs rolled at 528 \u03bcm/second on HSECs in flow assays. This rolling was abolished by CD29 blockade on hMSCs and vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (VCAM\u20101) blockade on HSECs. Firm adhesion to HSECs was reduced by CD29 (55% [P = 0.002]) and CD44 (51% [P = 0.04]) blockade. Neutralizing antibodies to CD29 and CD44 reduced hepatic engraftment of hMSCs in murine liver from 4.45 cells/field to 2.88 cells/field (P = 0.025) and 2.35 cells/field (P = 0.03), respectively. hMSCs expressed modest levels of chemokine receptors including CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3, but these made little contribution to hMSC adhesion in this setting. Conclusion: hMSCs bind preferentially to injured liver. Rolling of hMSCs is regulated by CD29/VCAM\u20101, whereas CD29/CD44 interactions with VCAM\u20101, fibronectin, and hyaluronan on HSECs determine firm adhesion both in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated using a murine model of liver injury.

Efficient delivery of cells to target organs is critical to improving their effectiveness. This requires an understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular engraftment into the liver. Binding of hMSCs to normal/injured liver tissue, purified extracellular matrices, and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) were quantified in static and flow conditions. To define the mechanisms underpinning hMSC interactions, neutralizing adhesion molecule antibodies were used. Fluorescently labelled hMSCs were infused intraportally into CCl4\u2013injured mice with and without neutralizing antibodies. hMSCs expressed high levels of CD29/\u03b21\u2010integrin and CD44.

            "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal cells that have the ability to self-renew and also exhibit multilineage differentiation into both mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal lineages. The intrinsic properties of these cells make them an attractive candidate for clinical applications. MSCs are of keen interest because they can be isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow or adipose tissues and can be easily expanded in vitro. Moreover, their ability to modulate immune responses makes them an even more attractive candidate for regenerative medicine as allogeneic transplant of these cells is feasible without a substantial risk of immune rejection. MSCs secrete various immunomodulatory molecules which provide a regenerative microenvironment for a variety of injured tissues or organ to limit the damage and to increase self-regulated tissue regeneration. Autologous/allogeneic MSCs delivered via the bloodstream augment the titers of MSCs that are drawn to sites of tissue injury and can accelerate the tissue repair process. MSCs are currently being tested for their potential use in cell and gene therapy for a number of human debilitating diseases and genetic disorders. This paper summarizes the current clinical and nonclinical data for the use of MSCs in tissue repair and potential therapeutic role in various diseases.",

Among the different human MSC origins exploited, umbilical cord represents an attractive and readily available source of MSC that involves a non-invasive collection procedure. In order to achieve relevant cell numbers of human MSC for clinical applications, it is crucial to develop scalable culture systems that allow bioprocess control and monitoring, combined with the use of serum/xenogeneic (xeno)-free culture media. In the present study, we firstly established a spinner flask culture system combining gelatin-based Cultispher(\u00ae) S microcarriers and xeno-free culture medium for the expansion of umbilical cord matrix (UCM)-derived MSC. This system enabled the production of 2.4 (\u00b11.1) x10(5) cells/mL (n = 4) after 5 days of culture, corresponding to a 5.3 (\u00b11.6)-fold increase in cell number. The established protocol was then implemented in a stirred-tank bioreactor (800 mL working volume) (n = 3) yielding 115 million cells after 4 days. Upon expansion under stirred conditions, cells retained their differentiation ability and immunomodulatory potential. The development of a scalable microcarrier-based stirred culture system, using xeno-free culture medium that suits the intrinsic features of UCM-derived MSC represents an important step towards a GMP compliant large-scale production platform for these promising cell therapy candidates.",

            "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are becoming increasingly involved in the regenerative medicine field, particularly to treat diseases that are not effectively curable with the current therapies. Two scientific barriers are nevertheless responsible for MSC use and commercialization limitations. On one side, large amounts of cells are needed to reach the high cell dose requirements. On the other side, cells being the final product themselves, directly injected into the patient, their quality have to be controlled (stem cell phenotype, differentiation capability). MSC cultivation on microcarriers in a stirred bioreactor seems to meet these challenges. However, a precise knowledge about the impact of the technologies and the hydrodynamics generated, on the physiological cell response, is necessary to improve the scale-up of MSC cultures in bioreactors. In this context, present work is dedicated to the study of the impact of the agitation mode (orbital or mechanical) on the cell attachment, expansion and detachment on various microcarrier types, in the case of MSC derived from the Wharton\u2019s jelly (WJ-MSC) of umbilical cords. To quantify more precisely cell distribution and expansion on microcarriers, an automatic and in situ counting method was developed, which need no detachment step. This allowed the identification of commercial microcarriers suitable for WJ-MSC cultures, which were then compared to home-made microcarriers, synthesized by a partner laboratory, in terms of cell attachment and expansion, and detachment efficiency. In parallel to these works, the impact of the impeller design on the microcarrier suspension in stirred tank bioreactors was investigated. Based on a dimensional analysis and CFD simulations, it resulted in the establishment of two models relating the minimal agitation rate to ensure all particle suspension (Njs) with the impeller geometrical characteristics (design, size, off-bottom clearance) and the material properties of both the solid and the liquid phases. CFD models validation allowed then to develop a strategy to optimize the geometrical configuration of an impeller, dedicated to MSC cultures on microcarriers in a minibioreactor. Parameters characterizing the hydromechanical stress encountered by the solid phase were wisely chosen and integrated into CFD simulations. Based on a design of experiments, and the hydrodynamics data recovered from simulations, response surfaces were built and a multiobjective optimization was achieved in order to determine the geometry minimizing the particle stress, and also by adhered cells. WJ-MSC cultures in minibioreactors equipped with impellers displaying various geometries were finally validated, with a preliminary comparison of the impact of these geometries on the cell expansion",

            "abstract": "Scaling bioprocesses remains a major challenge. Since it is physically impossible to increase all process parameters equally, a suitable scale-up strategy must be selected for a successful bioprocess. One of the most widely used criteria when scaling up bioprocesses is the specific power input. However, this represents only an average value. This study aims to determine the Kolmogorov length scale distribution by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and to use it as an alternative scale-up criterion for geometrically non-similar bioreactors for the first time. In order to obtain a comparable Kolmogorov length scale distribution, an automated geometry and process parameter optimization was carried out using the open-source tools OpenFOAM and DAKOTA. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test statistic was used for optimization. A HEK293-F cell expansion (batch mode) from benchtop (Infors Minifors 2 with 4 L working volume) to pilot scale (D-DCU from Sartorius with 30 L working volume) was carried out. As a reference cultivation, the classical scale-up approach with constant specific power input (233 W m\u22123) was used, where a maximum viable cell density (VCDmax) of 5.02\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121 was achieved (VCDmax at laboratory scale 5.77\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121). Through the automated optimization of the stirrer geometry (three parameters), position and speed, comparable cultivation results were achieved as in the small scale with a maximum VCD of 5.60\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121. In addition, even on the pilot scale, cell aggregate size distribution was seen to strictly follow a geometric distribution and can be predicted with the help of CFD with the previously published correlation.",
