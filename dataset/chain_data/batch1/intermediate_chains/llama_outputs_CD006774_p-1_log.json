            "abstract": "There have been several reports implying a benefit for heparin therapy in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Although this effect has been attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of heparin, other mechanisms have not been excluded. Heparin is a potent modulator of receptor binding of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), that play a role in wound repair. We examined the effect of heparin on the functional levels of FGF and HB-EGF in a model of experimental colitis. Fifty-six Wistar rats were divided into four groups: group 1 was the control group, group 2 received s.c. heparin 50 units/kg/d, group 3 underwent induction of 3% iodoacetamide colitis, and group 4 underwent induction of colitis and heparin treatment. Rats were killed and evaluated for severity of colitis by macroscopic and microscopic colitis scores, area of inflammation, and myeloperoxidase levels. FGF and HB-EGF levels were functionally assessed in colonic tissue in each group. Heparin therapy resulted in significant improvement in macroscopic and microscopic features of colitis (p < 0.05), accompanied by a partial reduction in myeloperoxidase levels. FGF receptor binding activity was identical in groups 1 and 2 but increased more than 3-fold after colitis induction in group 3 (p < 0.05). Treatment with heparin caused a significant decrease in FGF concentration. Levels of HB-EGF binding activity were similar in groups 1 and 2 and decreased in group 3 (p < 0.01). Heparin caused a significant increase in HB-EGF content in group 4 (p < 0.05). Levels of growth factors are altered differently in experimental colitis. Colonic FGF binding activity increases with colitis, whereas HB-EGF binding decreases with colitis. These trends were reversed by heparin, concomitant with a clinical and pathologic improvement in colitis. We suggest that one mechanism of heparin-mediated improvement in colitis may involve tissue healing associated with changes in functional levels of colonic growth factors.",

            "abstract": "Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) have been shown to be efficient in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Parenteral heparin therapy, however, may cause hemorrhagic adverse effects. To reduce this risk, epithelial LMWH delivery in combination with a system ensuring selective drug release to the inflamed tissue was tested here. Enoxaparin loaded microspheres (MS) were administered orally to male BALB mice suffering from a pre-existing experimental colitis, whereas control groups received subcutaneous or rectal LMWH solution. Colon weight/length index and alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase activities were assessed to determine the inflammation. Tissue penetration experiments elucidated the processes involved in the proposed new therapeutic approach. Oral LMWH-MS proved to be equally efficient in mitigating experimental colitis as rectally administered LMWH solution when quantified by myeloperoxidase activity (MS, 10.2 \u00b1 1.5 U/mg tissue; rectal, 9.2 \u00b1 1.6 U/mg) and to be superior to subcutaneous LMWH (s.c., 21.6 \u00b1 5.6 U/mg; untreated colitis control, 30.0 \u00b1 3.8 U/mg). Pharmacokinetic studies found a notably low systemic availability of oral LMWH delivered from MS (<5%) indicating a low potential for adverse effects. The tissue permeability was selectively enhanced in the inflamed regions where a 9-fold higher LMWH penetration was found compared with healthy tissue. Epithelial LMWH delivery has been found a promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic approach. The use of LMWH-MS in this context offers a promising tool for IBD therapy by enhancing specifically drug availability at inflamed tissue sites while reducing the risk for systemic adverse effects to a negligibly low level.",

            "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study is to develop colon targeted drug delivery of chitosan microspheres with celecoxib as a model drug. Materials and Methods: Mucoadhesive microspheres were prepared using chitosan as a core polymer and coated with Eudragit S-100 by a solvent evaporation technique. The effect of different microsphere formulations was studied. Results: In vitro release study, core microspheres are found to show burst release in the first 1 h, whereas coated microspheres exhibit a controlled release, and thus suitable for colon target drug delivery. Through an in vivo study, we investigated the effect of the coated microspheres in rats exposed to experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in rats by rectal instillation of acetic acid. Rats experienced hemorrhagic diarrheic, body weight loss, rise in myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reduction of reduced glutathione (r-GSH) activity by cyclooxygenase (COX), after 5 days administration of acetic acid. Oral administration of coated microspheres (5 mg/kg) twice-a-day to rats after induction of colitis significantly attenuated the severity of the colonic injury. In addition, there was a significant reduction of MPO and COX levels but arises in the levels of GSH. Conclusion: Thus, the study provided the evidence that coated microspheres are beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with minimal side effects.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study is using the targeted approach and anti-inflammatory action of the probiotic biomass to lessen the side effects of therapeutic agents of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the present study is to prepare mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles by spray drying method. The in-vitro release of the optimized formulation was 90.55\u2009\u00b1\u20092.42 in 24\u2009hr, which display controlled drug release of mesalamine at a particular region. Mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles (F12) presented average particle size of 4.91\u2009\u00b5m. The statistical analysis was done by one way ANOVA and then comparison test of Bonferroni was done and p values <.05 were considered as significant. The effects of spray dried microparticles over inflamed Caco-2 cell were also evaluated by determining the concentration of IL-8. From in-vivo study it was seen that pretreatment of mesalamine with probiotic prevents DNBS (Dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) induced colitis in rats and represents protective action against ulcerative colitis because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The results give the foundation for a combination of targeted approach along with the anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic which might help to decrease the problems which are seen with the traditional cure and management of ulcerative colitis.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study is using the targeted approach and anti-inflammatory action of the probiotic biomass to lessen the side effects of therapeutic agents of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the present study is to prepare mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles by spray drying method. The in-vitro release of the optimized formulation was 90.55\u2009\u00b1\u20092.42 in 24\u2009hr, which display controlled drug release of mesalamine at a particular region. Mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles (F12) presented average particle size of 4.91\u2009\u00b5m. The statistical analysis was done by one way ANOVA and then comparison test of Bonferroni was done and p values <.05 were considered as significant. The effects of spray dried microparticles over inflamed Caco-2 cell were also evaluated by determining the concentration of IL-8. From in-vivo study it was seen that pretreatment of mesalamine with probiotic prevents DNBS (Dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) induced colitis in rats and represents protective action against ulcerative colitis because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The results give the foundation for a combination of targeted approach along with the anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic which might help to decrease the problems which are seen with the traditional cure and management of ulcerative colitis.",

            "abstract": "Mesalamine is the first-line choice of drug for ulcerative colitis management. However, due to the nontargeted delivery of mesalamine, it shows side effects. The possible impact of mesalamine can be improved by coated microparticles in combination with S. boulardii for targeted delivery to the colon with the prevention of unwanted side effects. In this work, pectin-based mesalamine and S. boulardii loaded microparticles were prepared by dehydration technique and coated by an oil-in-oil solvent evaporation method and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and zeta analysis. 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was used for the induction of colitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of coated microparticles on Caco-2 cells were assessed by the determination of interleukin (IL)-8 concentration. In addition, the impact of coated microparticles on the concentration of colonic enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), lipid peroxides, and glutathione (GSH), were also evaluated. Moreover, hematological parameters, including white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were assessed. SEM data revealed that all the prepared coated microparticles had an almost spherical shape. The X-ray powder diffraction analysis of uncoated and coated microparticles showed maximum stability without any interaction. The particle size of uncoated and coated microparticles was 9.14 and 15.61\u2009\u03bcm, respectively. The zeta potential of uncoated and coated microparticles was observed to be -26.78 and -29.36\u2009mV, respectively. The prepared coated microparticles decreased the levels of lipid peroxides, MPO, and GSH significantly in colitis. In the Caco-2 cell culture model, the concentration of IL-8 is decreased significantly. The hematological observations confirmed that the prepared formulation showed a promising decrease in the levels of WBC, CRP, and ESR in diseased animals. Animal experiments revealed that cellulose acetate phthalate coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii significantly improved the colitis disease conditions of Wistar rats. Hence, cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii could be recommended as adjuvant therapy to achieve a synergistic effect in the management of UC. Lay summary Mesalamine is the drug of choice for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), which inhibits mediators responsible for inflammation. We investigated the in vivo effects of cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine with Saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic) for their efficacy against UC. Our findings evidenced that the combination of mesalamine with S. boulardii showed a synergistic effect in the 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis model by reducing the inflammation and maintains the macroscopic features. From the observed results, it can be concluded that S. boulardii can be used to enhance the individual drug's effect in the therapeutic management of UC.",

Our aim was to investigate their effect on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory, healing and angiogenetic factors during the healing process of a standardized excisional wound model in rats. Rats subjected to six dorsal skin wounds were allocated to Control; L. plantarum; combined formula of L. rhamnosus plus B. longum; L. rhamnosus; and B. longum treatments, applied every two days, along with tissue collection. The pro-inflammatory, wound-healing, and angiogenetic factors of mRNA expression were assessed by qRT-PCR. We found that L. plantarum exerts a strong anti-inflammatory effect in relation to L. rhamnosus\u2013B. longum, given alone or in combination; the combined regime of L. rhamnosus\u2013B. longum, works better, greatly promoting the expression of healing and angiogenic factors than L. plantarum. When separately tested, L. rhamnosus was found to work better than B. longum in promoting the expression of healing factors, while B. longum seems stronger than L. rhamnosus in the expression of angiogenic factors. We, therefore, suggest that an ideal probiotic treatment should definitively contain more than one probiotic strain to speed up all three healing phases.",
