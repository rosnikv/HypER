            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness (changes in health behaviors, health status, and health service utilization) of a self-management program for chronic disease designed for use with a heterogeneous group of chronic disease patients. It also explored the differential effectiveness of the intervention for subjects with specific diseases and comorbidities.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was a six-month randomized, controlled trial at community-based sites comparing treatment subjects with wait-list control subjects. Participants were 952 patients 40 years of age or older with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of heart disease, lung disease, stroke, or arthritis. Health behaviors, health status, and health service utilization, as determined by mailed, self-administered questionnaires, were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment subjects, when compared with control subjects, demonstrated improvements at 6 months in weekly minutes of exercise, frequency of cognitive symptom management, communication with physicians, self-reported health, health distress, fatigue, disability, and social/role activities limitations. They also had fewer hospitalizations and days in the hospital. No differences were found in pain/physical discomfort, shortness of breath, or psychological well-being.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn intervention designed specifically to meet the needs of a heterogeneous group of chronic disease patients, including those with comorbid conditions, was feasible and beneficial beyond usual care in terms of improved health behaviors and health status. It also resulted in fewer hospitalizations and days of hospitalization.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Two hundred sixty-eight Samoan participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited from a community health center in American Samoa and were randomly assigned by village clusters to the nurse-CHW team intervention or to a wait-list control group that received usual care. RESULTS Participants had a mean age of 55 years, 62% were female, mean years of education were 12.5 years, 41% were employed, and mean HbA1c was 9.8% at baseline. At 12 months, mean HbA1c was significantly lower among CHW participants, compared with usual care, after adjusting for confounders (b = \u22120.53; SE = 0.21; P = 0.03). The odds of making a clinically significant improvement in HbA1c of at least 0.5% in the CHW group was twice the odds in the usual care group after controlling for confounders (P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in blood pressure, weight, or waist circumference at 12 months between groups.

Training was provided in six \"face-to-face\" sessions with the CHWs using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CHW Training Resource on Heart Disease and Stroke.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SAMPLE\nThis is a quality improvement program guided by the Model for Improvement: Plan, Do, Study, Act and using a pre-post evaluation design. Ten AI CHWs were recruited for the training.\n\n\nMEASURES\nKnowledge and attitudes, participation rates, and participant satisfaction were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKnowledge increased overall with largest changes in diabetes, depression and cholesterol. Diabetes attitudes were high and consistent with those found in caregivers who support patient-centered care. Participants reported learning, liking the class, and finding the materials helpful.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis QI program provided by a public health nurse improved CHW's knowledge of diabetes and the management of diabetes. Next steps include formalizing the Reservation's CHW training program, expanding this training to other AI Health Service areas, and measuring the impact of CHWs in the community.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: In South Africa (SA), home-based carers (HBCs) play a crucial role at the community level for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including diabetes mellitus (DM) public health care. The work of HBCs requires them to be knowledgeable about diabetes, and lack of knowledge has implications on their roles for the provision of health information and dietary advice. HBCs need to be provided with specific training to develop their knowledge and skills necessary to enable them to provide care to people with diabetes (PWD) because organizations need to benefit from a pool of well-trained HBCs. Therefore, a training program was developed to improve care for chronic conditions based on local needs. Aim: To implement and evaluate the training program for the HBCs for PWD in Ga-Dikgale village. Methods: HBCs working at Ga- Dikgale villages in four clinics\u2014namely, Dikgale, Seobi Dikgale, Sebayeng, and Makotopong\u2014participated voluntarily. Fifty-five (55) HBCs who attended the training program completed satisfaction survey tools, and furthermore, 45 HBCs completed both pre-training and post-training knowledge questionnaires. Training divided into two sessions which each lasted for two days was conducted. Satisfaction with the training, improvement of knowledge, and perceived impact on daily practice were evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Results: Quantitative results indicate that 72% had poor knowledge of pre-training and only 9% post-training. They scored more in a post-test with the following differences: Post-test (mean = 6.00, SD = 1.26); pre-test (mean = 3.31, SD = 1.77). The t-test results indicated the difference to be significant, t = \u22129.241, p = 0.000. From the qualitative results, the themes that emerged during data analysis from group discussions were HBCs\u2019 achievements from the training, challenges related to diabetes and diet, and suggestions for further training. Conclusions: A context-specific training increased diabetes knowledge among the HBCs for PWD. The results highlighted the importance of training in improving the knowledge of HBCs about the care of PWD. The improvement in diabetes knowledge among HBCs needs to be maintained and sustained to achieve major health benefits for PWD.",
