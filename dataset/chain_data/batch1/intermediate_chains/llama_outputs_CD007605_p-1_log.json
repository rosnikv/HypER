Thirty-one patients completed the study. Resting energy expenditure, nitrogen balance, and grip strength were measured on days 2, 4, 7, and 12 after liver transplantation. Calorie and protein intakes were calculated for 12 days posttransplant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTube feeding was tolerated in the TF group (n = 14). The TF patients had greater cumulative 12-day nutrient intakes (22,464 +/- 3554 kcal, 927 +/- 122 g protein) than did the control patients (15,474 +/- 5265 kcal, 637 +/- 248 g protein) (p < .002). Nitrogen balance was better in the TF group on posttransplant day 4 than in the control group (p < .03). There was a rise in the overall mean resting energy expenditure in the first two posttransplant weeks from 1487 +/- 338 to 1990 +/- 367 kcal (p = .0002). Viral infections occurred in 17.7% of control patients compared with 0% of TF patients (p = .05). Although other infections tended to occur more frequently in the control group vs the TF group (bacterial, 29.4% vs 14.3%; overall infections, 47.1% vs 21.4%), these differences were not statistically significant. Early posttransplant tube feeding did not influence hospitalization costs, hours on the ventilator, lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, rehospitalizations, or rejection during the first 21 posttransplant days.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly posttransplant tube feeding was tolerated and promoted improvements in some outcomes and should be considered for all liver transplant patients.",

Starting 6 hours after operation, the first group received a standard enteral formula (standard group; n = 87); the second, the same enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA (immunonutrition group; n = 87); and the third, total parenteral nutrition (parenteral group; n = 86). The 3 regimens were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. The nutritional goal was 105 kJ/kg per day.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nImmune response by phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor levels, and delayed hypersensitivity response; protein synthesis by IL-6 and prealbumin; tolerance of enteral feeding; incidence of postoperative complications; and length of hospital stay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe immunonutrition group had a significantly better recovery of the immune parameters on postoperative day 8 compared with the other groups. Linear regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between IL-6 and preambulin levels (r = 0.766) only in the immunonutrition group. Only 11 patients (6.3%) in both enteral groups did not reach the nutritional goal.
