Methods and Results\u2014Patients with successful intracoronary stent implantation were randomly assigned to therapy with ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Loading doses were administered immediately after the procedure, and the drugs were prescribed for 2 weeks. One thousand sixteen patients were enrolled: 522 patients were randomly assigned to ticlopidine therapy and 494 to clopidogrel. High-risk characteristics included recent myocardial infarction in 41.4% of the cases, angiographically evident thrombus in 20.9%, and abrupt or threatened closure in 3.64%. An intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was used in 48.2% of the cases, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 1.43% of these patients. Failure to complete 2 weeks of therapy occurred in 3.64% of the patients treated with ticlopidine and in 1.62% of the patients treated with clopidogrel (P =0.043). Within 30 days, thrombosis of the stent occurred in 1.92% of the patients in the ticlopidine group and in 2.02% of the clopidogrel group (P =0.901). A major adverse cardiac event occurred in 4.60% of patients receiving ticlopidine and in 3.85% of patients receiving clopidogrel (P =0.551). Conclusions\u2014Clopidogrel is better tolerated than ticlopidine during a 2-week regimen after intracoronary stent implantation. Combining either thienopyridine with an intravenous platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitor appears to be safe. When applied to a broad spectrum of patients receiving stent implantation, clopidogrel confers similar protection as ticlopidine against subacute stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac events.",

            "abstract": "Background\u2014 Aspirin (ASA) has been shown to reduce postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) mortality and ischemic events; however, the timing of chronic ASA discontinuation before surgery is controversial because of concern about postoperative bleeding. We evaluated the effect of the timing of ASA discontinuation before CABG on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes and postoperative bleeding using the Cleveland Clinic Cardiovascular Information Registry database. Methods and Results\u2014 At the Cleveland Clinic between January 1, 2002, and January 31, 2008, 4143 patients undergoing CABG were taking preoperative chronic ASA. Of these, 2298 discontinued ASA 6 or more days before surgery (early discontinuation), and 1845 took ASA within 5 days of the surgery (late use). Because of substantial differences between these 2 groups, propensity score analysis, and matching based on 31 variables were used for fair comparison of outcomes. This resulted in 1519 well-matched pairs of patients (73%). There was no significant difference between those with early discontinuation and late ASA use with regard to the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke (1.7% versus 1.8%, P=0.80). Late use was associated with more intraoperative transfusions (23% versus 20%, P=0.03) and postoperative transfusions (30% versus 26%, P=0.009) but a similar number of reoperations for bleeding (3.4% versus 2.4% P=0.10). Conclusions\u2014 Among patients undergoing isolated CABG, late discontinuation of ASA resulted in no difference in postoperative cardiovascular outcomes; however, there was an increased transfusion requirement. Thus, we recommend weighing the risks and benefits of late ASA use in these patients.",

            "abstract": "We read with great interest the recently published multicentre cohort study by Kremke et al. [1]. Patients exposed to antiplatelet therapy (APT) at the time of coronary artery surgery (CAS) had greater postoperative bleeding volumes and greater transfusion requirements [1]. Exposure to clopidogrel, but not aspirin, was associated with greater reoperation rates and was an independent risk factor for severe postoperative bleeding, although mean bleeding volumes were not significantly different in the aspirin and clopidogrel subgroups [1]. Despite current guidelines, it is apparent that many patients are proceeding with CAS without the 5-day delay off clopidogrel. The efficacy of platelet inhibition with clopidogrel varies widely among patients, from intensive platelet inhibition to poor platelet response [2], and these variations could, to some degree, explain the non-significant differences in mean bleeding volumes in the aspirin and clopidogrel subgroups [1]. The effect of clopidogrel on bleeding mainly depends on two factors: (i) observed platelet inhibition, which depends on inherent platelet activity prior to clopidogrel administration and platelet inhibitory response to clopidogrel and (ii) newborn platelets ability to restore normal aggregation after clopidogrel discontinuation. Therefore, the use of suitable point-of-care platelet function analysers seems to be reasonable in this field. Recently, we found aspirin(P = 0.014) and clopidogrel(P = 0.003) sensitive platelet function tests to be predictive of excessive postoperative bleeding in patients following CAS [2]. Of note, 76.3% patients were transfused with no significant differences among the groups with regard to the preoperative APT administration regime (P = 0.636) [2]. However, transfused patients had significantly lower values of aspirin-sensitive platelet function tests (P = 0.002) [2]. In our opinion, the study cohort is somehow heterogeneous. Eligible procedures were either isolated CAS or CAS combined with aortic valve replacement (AVR) [1]. AVR certainly extends the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, which was recently described as a predictor of transfusion requirements [3]. After matching, authors reported a slightly greater use of antifibrinolytic drugs in the APT group [1]. Both on-pump and off-pump procedures were included [1]. Authors reported that off-pump surgery and perioperative use of tranexamic acid were associated with a lower risk of severe postoperative bleeding [1]. The use of antifibrinolytic drugs should be equally balanced since there is evidence that antifibrinolytic therapy reduces bleeding and transfusion outcomes [4]. It would be interesting to see if exclusion of CAS + AVR and off-pump CAS patients would bring different results. During the study period, thromboelastometry-guided blood component therapy became available at two of three participating centres [1]. At the same time, multivariate analysis revealed that surgery at one of the participating centres was one of independent risk factors for severe postoperative bleeding [1]. Spiess et al. [5] reported thromboelastography-guided haemostatic management to have significantly reduced the incidence of overall transfusion and mediastinal re-exploration due to excessive bleeding. Thus, perhaps one could assume that one centre, which was found to be independent risk factor for severe postoperative bleeding, was in fact the one without thromboelastometry guided transfusion therapy available. The largest extent of chest tube output together with the greatest transfusion rates, was observed in the subgroup of patients exposed to dual APT [1]. Those results are in line with the results recently published by Miceli et al. [6]. Further incremental platelet inhibition may be observed in the group of patients receiving dual APT. Therefore, the role of aspirin and clopidogrel administration management should be separately assessed by drug-specific platelet function tests, thus facilitating an individual therapeutic approach for discontinuation management of each antiplatelet agent preoperatively.",

            "abstract": "Background Postoperative bleeding in patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may increase due to preoperative anticoagulant therapy indicative of their disease - acute coronary syndrome or implanted coronary artery stent. Increased bleeding in many cases requires the use of blood and blood derivatives, and sometimes even reoperation. Their use poses the risk of complications, may extend the hospitalization. Methods Our observation retrospective study included 131 patients, 41 treated with aspirin and 90 treated with aspirin and clopidogrel. All underwent for the first time elective on-pump isolated CABG surgery at Clinic for cardiovascular surgery of Clinical Center University of Sarajevo, in period June 2016 to September 2017. The data were collected from patient\u2019s records. Results Out of 131 patients,73.3% were male. The average age was 62. The average total drainage during the first 48 postoperative hours in ASA group was 1027.4\u00b1404.9ml and 1049.8\u00b1371.3ml in DAPT group. The mean number of whole blood transfusions in the DAPT group washigher compared to ASAgroup. The average number of fresh frozen plasma were higher in the DAPT group 0.84\u00b10.51 compared to the group ASA 0.39\u00b10.07, as well the average thrombocytes transfusions were slightly higher in the DAPT group. Statistical analysis suggests that there is no significant difference between the observed groups (p>0.05). Also, our study did not show a statistically significant difference between arrhythmia onset, the length of mechanical ventilation, use of protamineand tranexamic acid. Reoperation due to postoperative bleeding was recorded in 2 cases in the DAPT group as well as 2 lethal cases. Conclusion In our study, we could not demonstrate less postoperative bleeding and use of blood and blood products in a group of patients who were preoperatively treated with aspirin compared to patients with dual antiplatelet therapy in the elective isolated CABG surgery.",
