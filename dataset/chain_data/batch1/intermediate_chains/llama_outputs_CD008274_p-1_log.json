            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 1-year diet intervention, exercise intervention and both combined on blood pressure (BP) in normotensives and mild hypertensives. Two hundred and nineteen sedentary middle aged men and women with slightly deranged coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors were randomised to a control, a diet, an exercise and a diet + exercise group. Based on baseline diastolic BP, participants were divided into tertiles, giving baseline average BP of 141.4/96.7 in tertile 1, 130.7/87.6 in tertile 2 and 121.9/79.0 in tertile 3. The 1-year net-difference in BP between the intervention groups and the control group decreased across the tertiles; in tertile 1 being -11.2/-6.7 (p < 0.05), -11.3/-6.7 (p < 0.05 for systolic BP only) and -7.0/-5.1 (NS) in the combined, diet and exercise group respectively. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and insulin variables were significantly and favourably changed, the changes being most marked in the combined group. The results show that diet and diet + exercise are about equally effective in reducing BP, and the effects may be dependent on the baseline level. Within the upper tertile of baseline BP, the decline in BP in the combined intervention and the diet group are almost comparable to those obtained with drug treatment. In addition, other important CHD risk factors were all changed in a beneficial direction.",

The trial comprised 219 men and women with diastolic blood pressure of 86\u201399 mmHg, HDL cholesterol < 1.20 mmol/l, triglycerides > 1.4 mmol/l, total cholesterol of 5.20\u20137.74 mmol/l, and BMI > 24 kg/m2. Participants were randomly allocated to diet group (n = 35), diet and exercise group (n = 67), exercise group (n = 54), and control group (n = 43). The diet included increased intake of fish and reduced total fat intake. The exercise program entailed supervised endurance exercise three times a week. Baseline cross-sectional changes and 1-year changes in insulin resistance, fasting serum levels of insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, glucose, and lipids as well as weight, mean blood pressure, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) values were recorded. RESULTS The cross-sectional results at baseline showed significant correlations between the calculated insulin resistance and BMI (r = 0.54) and correlations between the mean blood pressure (mBP) (r = 0.26) and PAI-1 (r = 0.40). The 1-year diet intervention gave a significant decrease in the calculated insulin resistance from 4.6 to 4.2 and a positive correlation between the changes in insulin resistance and changes in BMI (r = 0.40). The diet and exercise intervention also led to significantly decreased insulin resistance (from 5.0 to 4.0). The exercise intervention did not significantly change insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS The cross-sectional and 1-year intervention results supported each other and underscored the important connection between increased BMI and the development leading toward the insulin resistance syndrome.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Maintenance of glycemic control during and after exercise remains a major challenge for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Glycemic responses to exercise may differ by exercise type (aerobic, interval, or resistance), and the effect of activity type on glycemic control after exercise remains unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Type 1 Diabetes Exercise Initiative (T1DEXI) was a real-world study of at-home exercise. Adult participants were randomly assigned to complete six structured aerobic, interval, or resistance exercise sessions over 4 weeks. Participants self-reported study and nonstudy exercise, food intake, and insulin dosing (multiple daily injection [MDI] users) using a custom smart phone application and provided pump (pump users), heart rate, and continuous glucose monitoring data. RESULTS A total of 497 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean age \u00b1 SD 37 \u00b1 14 years; mean HbA1c \u00b1 SD 6.6 \u00b1 0.8% [49 \u00b1 8.7 mmol/mol]) assigned to structured aerobic (n = 162), interval (n = 165), or resistance (n = 170) exercise were analyzed. The mean (\u00b1 SD) change in glucose during assigned exercise was \u221218 \u00b1 39, \u221214 \u00b1 32, and \u22129 \u00b1 36 mg/dL for aerobic, interval, and resistance, respectively (P < 0.001), with similar results for closed-loop, standard pump, and MDI users. Time in range 70\u2013180 mg/dL (3.9\u201310.0 mmol/L) was higher during the 24 h after study exercise when compared with days without exercise (mean \u00b1 SD 76 \u00b1 20% vs. 70 \u00b1 23%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Adults with type 1 diabetes experienced the largest drop in glucose level with aerobic exercise, followed by interval and resistance exercise, regardless of insulin delivery modality. Even in adults with well-controlled type 1 diabetes, days with structured exercise sessions contributed to clinically meaningful improvement in glucose time in range but may have slightly increased time below range.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Maintenance of glycemic control during and after exercise remains a major challenge for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Glycemic responses to exercise may differ by exercise type (aerobic, interval, or resistance), and the effect of activity type on glycemic control after exercise remains unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Type 1 Diabetes Exercise Initiative (T1DEXI) was a real-world study of at-home exercise. Adult participants were randomly assigned to complete six structured aerobic, interval, or resistance exercise sessions over 4 weeks. Participants self-reported study and nonstudy exercise, food intake, and insulin dosing (multiple daily injection [MDI] users) using a custom smart phone application and provided pump (pump users), heart rate, and continuous glucose monitoring data. RESULTS A total of 497 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean age \u00b1 SD 37 \u00b1 14 years; mean HbA1c \u00b1 SD 6.6 \u00b1 0.8% [49 \u00b1 8.7 mmol/mol]) assigned to structured aerobic (n = 162), interval (n = 165), or resistance (n = 170) exercise were analyzed. The mean (\u00b1 SD) change in glucose during assigned exercise was \u221218 \u00b1 39, \u221214 \u00b1 32, and \u22129 \u00b1 36 mg/dL for aerobic, interval, and resistance, respectively (P < 0.001), with similar results for closed-loop, standard pump, and MDI users. Time in range 70\u2013180 mg/dL (3.9\u201310.0 mmol/L) was higher during the 24 h after study exercise when compared with days without exercise (mean \u00b1 SD 76 \u00b1 20% vs. 70 \u00b1 23%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Adults with type 1 diabetes experienced the largest drop in glucose level with aerobic exercise, followed by interval and resistance exercise, regardless of insulin delivery modality. Even in adults with well-controlled type 1 diabetes, days with structured exercise sessions contributed to clinically meaningful improvement in glucose time in range but may have slightly increased time below range.",
