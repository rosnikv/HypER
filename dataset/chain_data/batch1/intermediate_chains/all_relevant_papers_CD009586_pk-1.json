        "title": "Anticoagulant management in patients with atrial fibrillation.",
        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with a high risk of embolic stroke (cause in 15% of all strokes and 30% of strokes in those >75 years of age). Anticoagulation with warfarin will reduce stroke risk by about two thirds. The main risks of anticoagulation, namely bleeding, can be minimized by maintaining anticoagulation control within the international normalized range range of 2.0 to 3.0 (target: 2.5). To have a public health impact, patients with AF need efficient and correct identification, with appropriate treatment directed at those patients at most risk from the condition.",

        "title": "Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation: Report From a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Workshop",
        "abstract": "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened an expert panel April 28 to 29, 2008, to identify gaps and recommend research strategies to prevent atrial fibrillation (AF). The panel reviewed the existing basic scientific, epidemiological, and clinical literature about AF and identified opportunities to advance AF prevention research. After discussion, the panel proposed the following recommendations: (1) enhance understanding of the epidemiology of AF in the population by systematically and longitudinally investigating symptomatic and asymptomatic AF in cohort studies; (2) improve detection of AF by evaluating the ability of existing and emerging methods and technologies to detect AF; (3) improve noninvasive modalities for identifying key components of cardiovascular remodeling that promote AF, including genetic, fibrotic, autonomic, structural, and electrical remodeling markers; (4) develop additional animal models reflective of the pathophysiology of human AF; (5) conduct secondary analyses of already-completed clinical trials to enhance knowledge of potentially effective methods to prevent AF and routinely include AF as an outcome in ongoing and future cardiovascular studies; and (6) conduct clinical studies focused on secondary prevention of AF recurrence, which would inform future primary prevention investigations.",
