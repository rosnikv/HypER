The trial was unmasked after a mean of 12 (SD 2) months for the cyclosporin A group (n = 12) and a mean of 10 (SD 3) months for the cyclophosphamide group (n = 11). During the initial 6 months the visual acuity significantly improved (p < 0.001) in the cyclosporin A group whereas this was not observed in the cyclophosphamide group. The subsequent follow-up of patients up to 24 months suggested that the initial improvement in visual acuity with cyclosporin A was not sustained. More extensive and especially long-term studies of cyclosporin A in the uveitis of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome are warranted.",

            "abstract": "Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder. The patients have repeated exacerbations and remissions of the symptoms. This disease may produce a wide variety of symptoms. In mild cases, mucocutaneous lesions are only the symptoms during the whole clinical course, whereas ocular lesions, which occur in about 70% of the patients, can cause blindness. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, CNS and large vessels is less frequent, but sometimes life-threatening. Colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are employed for the treatment of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease with therapies tailored to individual patients depending on clinical manifestations. Cyclosporin A is the most effective drug for ocular lesions at the present, but its neurotoxicity, which occurs in 20 - 30% of patients receiving cyclosporin A, restricts usage of the agent. Many patients are still suffering from a severe form of uveitis and serious neurological symptoms, which are resistant to any conventional therapies. New drugs have been investigated for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. IFN-\u03b1 therapy has shown significant efficacy for common symptoms including ocular lesions without any serious adverse effects. Thalidomide and its analogues also appear to be applicable to this disease. Monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 is now in clinical trials. These novel therapeutic approaches may provide much needed treatment options for patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.",

            "abstract": "Thalidomide (Thd), a potent teratogen, was shown to have therapeutic potential in cancer, primarily in multiple myeloma (MM), yet its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. It was recently suggested that its teratogenicity is derived from interference in expression of genes regulated by GC-rich promoters by blocking the binding of SP1 transcription factor to its motif. We explored the validation of the proposed model by focusing on potential molecular targets associated with MM pathogenesis. Cell lines RPMI 8226, U266, and ARH-77 were exposed for 24 h to racemic Thd and analyzed for apoptosis, membranal expression of CD29 and CD63, transcript level of hTERT, CD63, and IGFI-R (characterized by GC-rich motifs) and telomerase activity. Analysis of an hTERT core promoter reporter gene expression [enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)] in transiently transfected RPMI 8226 incubated with racemic and steric (+/-)-enantiomers of Thd was performed. A consistent reduction ( approximately 10-40%) in transcript levels of all three assayed genes in all three cell lines was demonstrated in the presence of racemic Thd. Significant reduction of EGFP was demonstrated in cells transfected with hTERT reporter gene and treated with racemic and (S)-Thd. Our results show that Thd's antimyeloma activity can be ascribed to the same mechanism responsible for its teratogenic effect and that the inhibition of GC-rich promoter genes is mostly attributed to the S-racemate. Indeed, this selectivity delineates GC-rich promoter genes as a unique group eligible for specific drug targeting.",

            "abstract": "Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to investigate the binding of 13 alkaloids to two GC-rich DNA duplexes which are critical sequences in human survivin promoter. Negative ion ESI-MS was first applied to screen the binding of the alkaloids to the duplexes. Six alkaloids (including berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine) show complexation with the target DNA sequences. Relative binding affinities were estimated from the negative ion ESI data, and the alkaloids show a binding preference to the duplex with higher GC content. Positive ion ESI mass spectra of the complexes were also recorded and compared with those obtained in negative ion mode. Only the 1 : 1 complex with berbamine was observed with lower abundance in the positive ion mass spectrum while complexes with the other alkaloids were absolutely absent. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments indicate that the complexes with the protoberberine alkaloids (berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine) dissociate via base loss and covalent cleavage. In contrast, product ion spectra of the complexes with the alkaloids reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine show the predominant loss of a neutral alkaloid molecule, accompanied by base loss and covalent cleavage to a lesser extent. A comparison of the gas-phase behaviors of complexes with the alkaloids to those with the traditional DNA binders has suggested an intercalative binding mode of these alkaloids to the target DNA duplexes.",

Various changes in the double helical structure of DNA after addition of vincristine have been examined. It is evident from Fourier transform infrared results that vincristine-DNA interaction occurs through guanine and cytosine base pairs. External binding of vincristine with phosphate backbone of the DNA is also observed. Vincristine perturbs guanine band at 1714 cm(-1), cytosine band at 1488 cm(-1), and the phosphate vibrations at 1225 and 1086 cm(-1). The UV-visible spectra of vincristine-DNA complex show hypochromic and bathochromic shifts, indicating the intercalation of vincristine into the double helical structure of DNA. Both intercalative and external binding modes are observed for vincristine binding with DNA, with an estimated binding constant K = 1.0 \u00d7 10(3) M(-1).",

            "abstract": "Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in children worldwide and in the Middle East. Although there have been major advances in treatment approaches for childhood ALL, serious toxicities do occur but with significant inter-individual variability. The aim of this study is to measure the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) disposition in a combined cohort of Middle Eastern Children with ALL, and evaluate whether these polymorphisms predict 6-MP intolerance and toxicity during ALL maintenance therapy. Methods: The study includes children treated for ALL on two treatment protocols from two cohorts; one from Lebanon (N = 136) and another from Kurdistan province of Iran (N = 74). Genotyping for the following six candidate genetic polymorphisms: ITPA 94C > A (rs1127354) and IVS2+21A > C (rs7270101), TPMT*2 238G > C (rs1800462), TPMT*3B 460G > A (rs1800460) and *3C 719A > G (rs1142345), and NUDT15 415C > T (rs116855232) was performed and analyzed in association with 6-MP dose intensity and toxicity. Results: As expected, TPMT and NUDT15 variants were uncommon. As for ITPA, both polymorphisms were more common in the Lebanese as compared to the Kurdish cohort with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 for 94C > A and 0.14 for IVS2+21A > C in the Lebanese only (N = 121), and of 0.01 for either ITPA polymorphism in Kurds. The most significant toxic effects were depicted with the NUDT15 polymorphism with a median 6-MP dose intensity of 33.33%, followed by 46.65% for TPMT*3A polymorphism, followed by 65.33% for two ITPA risk allele carriers and 74% for one ITPA risk allele carriers, in comparison to a median of 100% for the homozygous wild type in the combined cohort (P < 0.001). In addition, the onset of febrile neutropenia was significantly higher in variant allele carriers in the combined cohorts. Conclusions: These data confirm the predictive role of TPMT, NUDT15, and ITPA in 6-MP intolerance in Middle Eastern children with ALL. Given the relatively high frequency of ITPA variants in our study and their significant association with 6-MP dose intensity, we recommend that physicians consider genotyping for ITPA variants in conjunction with TPMT and NUDT15 prior to 6-MP therapy in these children.",

            "abstract": "Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in children worldwide and in the Middle East. Although there have been major advances in treatment approaches for childhood ALL, serious toxicities do occur but with significant inter-individual variability. The aim of this study is to measure the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) disposition in a combined cohort of Middle Eastern Children with ALL, and evaluate whether these polymorphisms predict 6-MP intolerance and toxicity during ALL maintenance therapy. Methods: The study includes children treated for ALL on two treatment protocols from two cohorts; one from Lebanon (N = 136) and another from Kurdistan province of Iran (N = 74). Genotyping for the following six candidate genetic polymorphisms: ITPA 94C > A (rs1127354) and IVS2+21A > C (rs7270101), TPMT*2 238G > C (rs1800462), TPMT*3B 460G > A (rs1800460) and *3C 719A > G (rs1142345), and NUDT15 415C > T (rs116855232) was performed and analyzed in association with 6-MP dose intensity and toxicity. Results: As expected, TPMT and NUDT15 variants were uncommon. As for ITPA, both polymorphisms were more common in the Lebanese as compared to the Kurdish cohort with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 for 94C > A and 0.14 for IVS2+21A > C in the Lebanese only (N = 121), and of 0.01 for either ITPA polymorphism in Kurds. The most significant toxic effects were depicted with the NUDT15 polymorphism with a median 6-MP dose intensity of 33.33%, followed by 46.65% for TPMT*3A polymorphism, followed by 65.33% for two ITPA risk allele carriers and 74% for one ITPA risk allele carriers, in comparison to a median of 100% for the homozygous wild type in the combined cohort (P < 0.001). In addition, the onset of febrile neutropenia was significantly higher in variant allele carriers in the combined cohorts. Conclusions: These data confirm the predictive role of TPMT, NUDT15, and ITPA in 6-MP intolerance in Middle Eastern children with ALL. Given the relatively high frequency of ITPA variants in our study and their significant association with 6-MP dose intensity, we recommend that physicians consider genotyping for ITPA variants in conjunction with TPMT and NUDT15 prior to 6-MP therapy in these children.",

            "abstract": "Thiopurines are in widespread clinical use for the treatment of immunological disorders and certain cancers. However, treatment failure due to resistance or adverse drug reactions are common, asking for new therapeutic strategies. We investigated the potential of 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (6sGMP) prodrugs to overcome resistance to 6-thioguanine. We successfully developed synthetic routes toward diverse 6sGMP prodrugs, tested their proliferation inhibitory potential in different cell lines, and examined their mode of action. Our results show that 4-acetyloxybenzyl- and cycloSaligenyl-derivatized 6sGMP prodrugs are effective antiproliferative compounds in cells that are resistant to thiopurines. We find that resistance is related to the expression of salvage pathway enzyme HGPRT. Using TUC-seq DUAL, we demonstrate the intracellular conversion of 6sGMP prodrugs into bioactive 6sGTPs. Thus, our study offers a promising strategy for thiopurine therapy by using 6sGMP prodrugs, and it suggests TUC-seq DUAL as a simple and fast method to measure the success of thiopurine therapy.",

            "abstract": "Thiopurines are in widespread clinical use for the treatment of immunological disorders and certain cancers. However, treatment failure due to resistance or adverse drug reactions are common, asking for new therapeutic strategies. We investigated the potential of 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (6sGMP) prodrugs to overcome resistance to 6-thioguanine. We successfully developed synthetic routes toward diverse 6sGMP prodrugs, tested their proliferation inhibitory potential in different cell lines, and examined their mode of action. Our results show that 4-acetyloxybenzyl- and cycloSaligenyl-derivatized 6sGMP prodrugs are effective antiproliferative compounds in cells that are resistant to thiopurines. We find that resistance is related to the expression of salvage pathway enzyme HGPRT. Using TUC-seq DUAL, we demonstrate the intracellular conversion of 6sGMP prodrugs into bioactive 6sGTPs. Thus, our study offers a promising strategy for thiopurine therapy by using 6sGMP prodrugs, and it suggests TUC-seq DUAL as a simple and fast method to measure the success of thiopurine therapy.",
