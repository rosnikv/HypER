To assess the organisation of endoscopy services for AUGIB in the UK. To examine the relationship between outcomes and out of hours (OOH) service provision. Design Multi-centre cross sectional clinical audit. Setting All UK hospitals accepting admissions with AUGIB. Patients All adults (\u226516\u2005yrs) presenting with AUGIB between 1st May and 30th June 2007. Data Collection A custom designed web-based reporting tool was used to collect data on patient characteristics, comorbidity and haemodynamic status at presentation to calculate the Rockall score, use and timing of endoscopy, treatment including endoscopic, rebleeding and in-hospital mortality. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect data on facilities and service organisation. Results Data on 6750 patients (median age 68\u2005years) were analysed from 208 hospitals. 74% underwent inpatient endoscopy; of these 50% took place within 24\u2005h of presentation, 82% during normal working hours and 3% between midnight and 8\u2005am. Of patients deemed high-risk (pre-endoscopy Rockall score \u22655) only 55% were endoscoped within 24\u2005h and 14% waited \u226572\u2005h for endoscopy. Lesions with a high risk of rebleeding were present in 28% of patients of whom 74% received endoscopic therapy. Further bleeding was evident in 13% and mortality in those endoscoped was 7.4% (95% CI 6.7% to 8.1%). In 52% of hospitals a consultant led out of hours (OOH) endoscopy rota existed; in these hospitals 20% of first endoscopies were performed OOH compared with 13% in those with no OOH rota and endoscopic therapy was more likely to be administered (25% vs 21% in hospitals with no OOH rota). The risk adjusted mortality ratio was higher (1.21, p=0.10, (95%CI 0.96 to 1.51)) in hospitals without such rotas. Conclusions This audit has found continuing delays in performing endoscopy after AUGIB and underutilisation of standard endoscopic therapy particularly for variceal bleeding. In hospitals with a formal OOH endoscopy rota patients received earlier endoscopy, were more likely to receive endoscopic therapy and may have a lower mortality.",

To assess the organisation of endoscopy services for AUGIB in the UK. To examine the relationship between outcomes and out of hours (OOH) service provision. Design Multi-centre cross sectional clinical audit. Setting All UK hospitals accepting admissions with AUGIB. Patients All adults (\u226516\u2005yrs) presenting with AUGIB between 1st May and 30th June 2007. Data Collection A custom designed web-based reporting tool was used to collect data on patient characteristics, comorbidity and haemodynamic status at presentation to calculate the Rockall score, use and timing of endoscopy, treatment including endoscopic, rebleeding and in-hospital mortality. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect data on facilities and service organisation. Results Data on 6750 patients (median age 68\u2005years) were analysed from 208 hospitals. 74% underwent inpatient endoscopy; of these 50% took place within 24\u2005h of presentation, 82% during normal working hours and 3% between midnight and 8\u2005am. Of patients deemed high-risk (pre-endoscopy Rockall score \u22655) only 55% were endoscoped within 24\u2005h and 14% waited \u226572\u2005h for endoscopy. Lesions with a high risk of rebleeding were present in 28% of patients of whom 74% received endoscopic therapy. Further bleeding was evident in 13% and mortality in those endoscoped was 7.4% (95% CI 6.7% to 8.1%). In 52% of hospitals a consultant led out of hours (OOH) endoscopy rota existed; in these hospitals 20% of first endoscopies were performed OOH compared with 13% in those with no OOH rota and endoscopic therapy was more likely to be administered (25% vs 21% in hospitals with no OOH rota). The risk adjusted mortality ratio was higher (1.21, p=0.10, (95%CI 0.96 to 1.51)) in hospitals without such rotas. Conclusions This audit has found continuing delays in performing endoscopy after AUGIB and underutilisation of standard endoscopic therapy particularly for variceal bleeding. In hospitals with a formal OOH endoscopy rota patients received earlier endoscopy, were more likely to receive endoscopic therapy and may have a lower mortality.",

To assess the organisation of endoscopy services for AUGIB in the UK. To examine the relationship between outcomes and out of hours (OOH) service provision. Design Multi-centre cross sectional clinical audit. Setting All UK hospitals accepting admissions with AUGIB. Patients All adults (\u226516\u2005yrs) presenting with AUGIB between 1st May and 30th June 2007. Data Collection A custom designed web-based reporting tool was used to collect data on patient characteristics, comorbidity and haemodynamic status at presentation to calculate the Rockall score, use and timing of endoscopy, treatment including endoscopic, rebleeding and in-hospital mortality. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect data on facilities and service organisation. Results Data on 6750 patients (median age 68\u2005years) were analysed from 208 hospitals. 74% underwent inpatient endoscopy; of these 50% took place within 24\u2005h of presentation, 82% during normal working hours and 3% between midnight and 8\u2005am. Of patients deemed high-risk (pre-endoscopy Rockall score \u22655) only 55% were endoscoped within 24\u2005h and 14% waited \u226572\u2005h for endoscopy. Lesions with a high risk of rebleeding were present in 28% of patients of whom 74% received endoscopic therapy. Further bleeding was evident in 13% and mortality in those endoscoped was 7.4% (95% CI 6.7% to 8.1%). In 52% of hospitals a consultant led out of hours (OOH) endoscopy rota existed; in these hospitals 20% of first endoscopies were performed OOH compared with 13% in those with no OOH rota and endoscopic therapy was more likely to be administered (25% vs 21% in hospitals with no OOH rota). The risk adjusted mortality ratio was higher (1.21, p=0.10, (95%CI 0.96 to 1.51)) in hospitals without such rotas. Conclusions This audit has found continuing delays in performing endoscopy after AUGIB and underutilisation of standard endoscopic therapy particularly for variceal bleeding. In hospitals with a formal OOH endoscopy rota patients received earlier endoscopy, were more likely to receive endoscopic therapy and may have a lower mortality.",

The most frequently identified source of bleeding is peptic ulcer disease, but other important causes exist, particularly oesophageal or gastric varices, which are classically associated with more severe bleeding. A large audit in the UK in 20071 indicated that the rate of mortality from acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (about 7%) has not changed much over the past 50 years, and that service provision varies considerably across the UK. This article summarises the most recent recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.2\n\nNICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the best available evidence and explicit consideration of cost effectiveness. When minimal evidence is available, recommendations are based on the Guideline Development Group\u2019s experience and opinion of what constitutes good practice. Evidence levels for the recommendations are given in italic in square brackets.\n\n### Risk assessment\n\nAt presentation with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, assess for risk of serious adverse events or need for intervention. To do this use the following formal risk assessment scoring systems for all patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding: the Blatchford scoring system3 at first assessment and the full Rockall scoring system4 after endoscopy (tables 1\u21d3 and 2\u21d3).

Tranexamic acid (TXA) may help control the bleeding by counterbalancing cirrhosis-related hyperfibrinolysis. Still, there is a lack of unbiased data to conclude on its efficacy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TXA in the early treatment of acute UGIB in patients with cirrhosis. Methods and analysis This study is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, for adult patients with cirrhosis presenting with an acute UGIB and allocated to one of two arms: TXA or placebo (saline). Physicians from emergency mobile services, emergency departments (EDs) or intensive care units (ICUs) can include patients. Besides study intervention, standard care for UGIB will be performed as recommended. Intervention will consist an intravenous infusion of 10\u2009mL of TXA (1\u2009g) or saline, immediately followed by three identical intravenous infusions over 8\u2009hours each (total dose of 4\u2009g of TXA or 40\u2009mL of placebo over 24\u2009hours). Main analyses will be conducted in intention to treat on every patient included, then in modified intention to treat on patients with underlying lesion of portal hypertension visualised by endoscopy. The main objective is to show efficacy of TXA until day 5 on a composite criterion (bleeding control, rebleeding episodes and mortality). Secondary objectives aim at showing the efficacy of TXA on each individual component of the main outcome measure and others at 6 weeks and later (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure, cirrhosis-specific complications, length of stay in ICU and in hospital, safety and tolerance of TXA, liver transplantation). Included patients will be followed up to 1\u2009year after inclusion. 500 patients will be necessary to show a reduction in the prevalence of the primary outcome from 30% to 18% with a bilateral alpha risk of 5% and a power of 80%. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France 1 (CPP-IDF1). Results will be disseminated via publications in peer-review medical journals and scientific forums.

            "abstract": "Introduction The management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is challenging in patients with cirrhosis, as it is responsible for severe complications and high mortality rates. Tranexamic acid (TXA) may help control the bleeding by counterbalancing cirrhosis-related hyperfibrinolysis. Still, there is a lack of unbiased data to conclude on its efficacy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TXA in the early treatment of acute UGIB in patients with cirrhosis. Methods and analysis This study is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, for adult patients with cirrhosis presenting with an acute UGIB and allocated to one of two arms: TXA or placebo (saline). Physicians from emergency mobile services, emergency departments (EDs) or intensive care units (ICUs) can include patients. Besides study intervention, standard care for UGIB will be performed as recommended. Intervention will consist an intravenous infusion of 10\u2009mL of TXA (1\u2009g) or saline, immediately followed by three identical intravenous infusions over 8\u2009hours each (total dose of 4\u2009g of TXA or 40\u2009mL of placebo over 24\u2009hours). Main analyses will be conducted in intention to treat on every patient included, then in modified intention to treat on patients with underlying lesion of portal hypertension visualised by endoscopy. The main objective is to show efficacy of TXA until day 5 on a composite criterion (bleeding control, rebleeding episodes and mortality). Secondary objectives aim at showing the efficacy of TXA on each individual component of the main outcome measure and others at 6 weeks and later (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure, cirrhosis-specific complications, length of stay in ICU and in hospital, safety and tolerance of TXA, liver transplantation). Included patients will be followed up to 1\u2009year after inclusion. 500 patients will be necessary to show a reduction in the prevalence of the primary outcome from 30% to 18% with a bilateral alpha risk of 5% and a power of 80%. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France 1 (CPP-IDF1). Results will be disseminated via publications in peer-review medical journals and scientific forums. Protocol version This protocol is based on the latest version, as established on 11 October 2017 and validated by the IRB CPP Ile-de-France 1. Trial registration number NCT03023189.",

We aimed to investigate the coagulation system in ascitic fluid and plasma of patients with cirrhosis. We determined coagulation parameters and performed clotting and fibrinolysis experiments in ascitic fluid and plasma of thoroughly characterized patients with cirrhosis and ascites (n\u2009=\u200925) and in plasma of patients with cirrhosis but without ascites (n\u2009=\u200925), matched for severity of portal hypertension. We also investigated plasma D-dimer levels in an independent cohort of patients (n\u2009=\u2009317) with clinically significant portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 10\u2009mmHg), grouped according to ascites severity. Ascitic fluid was procoagulant in a clotting assay. The procoagulant potential of ascitic fluid was abolished by depletion of extracellular vesicles from ascitic fluid by filtration or by addition of a tissue factor-neutralizing antibody. Compared with plasma, extracellular vesicle-associated tissue factor activity was high in ascitic fluid, while activities of other coagulation factors were low. The extracellular vesicle-depleted fraction of ascitic fluid induced fibrinolysis, which was prevented by aprotinin, indicating the presence of plasmin in ascitic fluid. Plasma peak thrombin generation and parameters reflecting fibrinolysis were independently associated with the presence of ascites. Finally, plasma D-dimer levels were independently linked to ascites severity in our second cohort comprising 317 patients. In conclusion, coagulation and fibrinolysis become activated in ascites of patients with cirrhosis. While tissue factor-exposing extracellular vesicles in ascitic fluid seem unable to pass the peritoneal membrane, fibrinolytic enzymes get activated in ascitic fluid and may re-enter the systemic circulation and induce systemic fibrinolysis.",
