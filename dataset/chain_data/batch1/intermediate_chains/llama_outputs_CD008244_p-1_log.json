A 27-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared milnacipran 100 and 200 mg/day with placebo in the treatment of 888 patients with FM. Two composite responder definitions were used to classify each patient\u2019s individual response to therapy. \u201cFM responders\u201d concurrently satisfied response criteria for improvements in pain (visual analog scale 24-h morning recall), patient global impression of change (PGIC), and physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Component Summary); while \u201cFM pain responders\u201d concurrently satisfied response criteria for improvements in pain and PGIC. Results. At the primary endpoint, after 3-month stable dose treatment, a significantly higher percentage of milnacipran-treated patients met criteria as FM responders versus placebo (milnacipran 200 mg/day, p = 0.017; milnacipran 100 mg/day, p = 0.028). A significantly higher percentage of patients treated with milnacipran 200 mg/day also met criteria as FM pain responders versus placebo (p = 0.032). Significant pain reductions were observed after Week 1 with both milnacipran doses. At 15 weeks, milnacipran 200 mg/day led to significant improvements over placebo in pain (realtime, daily and weekly recall; all measures, p < 0.05), PGIC (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.016), cognition (p = 0.025), and multiple SF-36 domains. Milnacipran was safe and well tolerated by the majority of patients during 27 weeks of treatment; nausea and headache were the most common adverse events. Conclusion.

There were no other active comparators or studies in other neuropathic pain conditions. Study quality was generally good, although the imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect.Both doses of milnacipran provided moderate levels of pain relief to about 40% of those treated, compared to 30% with placebo, giving a number needed to treat of 8 to 10. Adverse events were common in both milnacipran (87%) and placebo (78%) groups, but serious adverse events (< 2%) did not differ between groups. Nausea and constipation were the most common events showing the greatest difference between groups (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome of 7 and 13 respectively, compared with placebo).Withdrawals for any reason were more common with milnacipran than placebo, and more common with 200 mg than 100 mg (NNH of 23 and 8.8 respectively, compared with placebo). This was largely driven by adverse event withdrawals, where the NNH compared with placebo was 14 for 100 mg, and 7.0 for 200 mg). Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were more common with milnacipran than placebo but did not differ between doses (number needed to treat to prevent an additional unwanted outcome of 45 and 41 respectively).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence available indicates that milnacipran 100 mg or 200 mg is effective for a minority in the treatment of pain due to fibromyalgia, providing moderate levels of pain relief (at least 30%) to about 40% of participants, compared with about 30% with placebo. There were insufficient data to assess substantial levels of pain relief (at least 50%), and the use of last observation carried forward imputation may overestimate drug efficacy. Milnacipran is associated with increased adverse events and adverse event withdrawals, which were significantly greater for the higher dose.

            "abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) is widely used in clinical practice to relieve migraine pain. 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) has been reported to play an excitatory role in neuronal systems and regulate hyperalgesic pain and neurogenic inflammation. 5-HT7R could influence phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA)- or extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2)-mediated signaling pathways, which mediate sensitization of nociceptive neurons via interacting with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In this study, we evaluated the role of 5-HT7R in the antihyperalgesic effects of EA and the underlying mechanism through regulation of PKA and ERK1/2 in trigeminal ganglion (TG) and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). Hyperalgesia was induced in rats with dural injection of inflammatory soup (IS) to cause meningeal neurogenic inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture was applied for 15 min every other day before IS injection. Von Frey filaments, tail-flick, hot-plate, and cold-plated tests were used to evaluate the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Neuronal hyperexcitability in TNC was studied by an electrophysiological technique. The 5-HT7R antagonist (SB269970) or 5-HT7R agonist (AS19) was administered intrathecally before each IS application at 2-day intervals during the 7-day injection protocol. The changes in 5-HT7R and 5-HT7R-associated signaling pathway were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses. When compared with IS group, mechanical and thermal pain thresholds of the IS + EA group were significantly increased. Furthermore, EA prevented the enhancement of both spontaneous activity and evoked responses of second-order trigeminovascular neurons in TNC. Remarkable decreases in 5-HT7R mRNA expression and protein levels were detected in the IS + EA group. More importantly, 5-HT7R agonist AS19 impaired the antihyperalgesic effects of EA on p-PKA and p-ERK1/2. Injecting 5-HT7R antagonist SB-269970 into the intrathecal space of IS rats mimicked the effects of EA antihyperalgesia and inhibited p-PKA and p-ERK1/2. Our findings indicate that 5-HT7R mediates the antihyperalgesic effects of EA on IS-induced migraine pain by regulating PKA and ERK1/2 in TG and TNC.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Xiongmatang (XMT) extract on rats with migraine induced by inflammatory soup and the underlying mechanisms. First, 1 week after dural catheterization, inflammatory soup was injected through a microsyringe to stimulate the dura of rats for 6 times (12 days), once every 2 days, 10 \u03bcL each time, to establish a migraine model. According to pain threshold analysis, behavioral change detection, and pathological analysis, the effects of XMT extract on rats with migraine were evaluated. The positive, mRNA and protein expression of related factors were detected by immunohistochemistry, RT-QPCR, and Western blot analysis to elucidate the underlying mechanism. XMT extract improved the behavioral performance of rats, and improve the pathological changes in the trigeminal nerve in rats. Further experimental results show that XMT extract regulated the expression of migraine-related factors in the trigeminal nerve, manifested as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) positive expression, mRNA expression, and protein expression reduction. XMT extract can significantly improved the behavioral performance of rats with migraine, and its mechanism of action might involve regulating the activity of TRPV1-CGRP/CGRP-R pathway.",

            "abstract": "Background Migraine is a widespread and prevalent disease with a complex pathophysiology, of which neuroinflammation and increased pain sensitivity have been suggested to be involved. Various studies have investigated the presence of different inflammatory markers in migraineurs and investigated the role of inflammation in inflammatory models with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or inflammatory soup added to the dura mater. Objective The aim of the current study was to examine whether application of CFA to the dura mater would cause behavioral alterations that are migraine relevant. In addition, we investigated the potential mitigating effects of fremanezumab, a CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) specific antibody, following CFA application. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: fresh (n = 7), fresh + carprofen (n = 6), fresh + anti-CGRP (n = 6), sham (n = 7), CFA (n = 16), CFA + anti-CGRP (n = 8). CFA was applied for 15 min on a 3 \u00d7 3 mm clearing of the skull exposing the dura mater of male Sprague-Dawley rats. We applied the Light/Dark box and Open Field test, combined with the electronic von Frey test to evaluate outcomes. Finally, we observed CGRP immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglion. Results No differences were observed in the Light/Dark box test. The Open Field test detected behavior differences, notably that sham rats spend less time in the central zone, reared less and groomed more than fresh + carprofen rats. The other groups were not significantly different compared to sham rats, indicating that activation of the TGVS is present in sham surgery and cannot be exacerbated by CFA. However, for the allodynia, we observed specific periorbital sensitization, not observed in the sham animals. This could not be mitigated by fremanezumab, although it clearly reduced the amount of CGRP positive fibers. Conclusion CFA surgically administered to the dura causes periorbital allodynia and increases CGRP positive fibers in the trigeminal ganglion. Fremanezumab does not reduce periorbital allodynia even though it reduces CGRP positive fibers in the TG. Further work is needed to investigate whether CFA administered to the dura could be used as a non-CGRP inflammatory migraine model.",
