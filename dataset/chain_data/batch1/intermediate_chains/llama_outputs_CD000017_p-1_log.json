We report on exercise-induced changes in neutrophil activation, soluble P-selectin and von Willebrand factor in 34 patients with intermittent claudication and 12 matched controls. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) showed a cyclical pattern of response to exercise in control subjects (rising from 103 \u00b1 8 to 119 \u00b1 7 U/dl); claudicants did not show this pattern but had higher levels of vWF throughout (p <0.03). There was no consistent pattern of response in neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production to exercise in either claudicants or control subjects. Soluble P-selectin levels increased after exercise, but this only reached statistical significance after repeated exercise in claudicants (rising from 320 \u00b1 28 to 357 \u00b1 28 ng/ml). This rise in soluble P-selectin after exercise may indicate progressive platelet activation which may contribute to the excess cardiovascular mortality that claudicants are prone to.",

            "abstract": "Background Previous studies have reported conflicting results about the effect of sevoflurane on platelet aggregation. To clarify this point, we investigated the effects of sevoflurane on platelet antigen expression and function in vitro. Methods Human whole blood was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 and 1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane, 21% O2, and 5% CO2. A control sample was kept at the same conditions without sevoflurane. After stimulation with adenosine diphosphate or thrombin receptor agonist peptide 6, samples were stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies, and the expression of platelet glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb, and P-selectin, as well as activated GPIIb/IIIa, were measured with two-color flow cytometry. In addition, platelet function was assessed by means of thromboelastography and using the platelet function analyzer 100. Results Already in subanesthetic concentrations, sevoflurane inhibits unstimulated and agonist-induced GPIIb/IIIa surface expression and activated GPIIb/IIIa expression on platelets in whole blood. The agonist-induced redistribution of GPIb into the open canalicular system was also impaired by sevoflurane, whereas no effect on P-selectin expression in activated platelets could be found. Sevoflurane significantly reduced the maximum thromboelastographic amplitude. Furthermore, platelet function analyzer 100 closure times were significantly prolonged. Conclusion The results show that sevoflurane significantly impairs platelet antigen expression in vitro. It is especially the inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa expression and activation that impairs bleeding time as reflected in thromboelastographic measurements and platelet function analyzer 100 closure times. The exact inhibitory mechanism remains unclear.",

Previous studies have reported the inhibitory effects of sevoflurane on platelet aggregation. We investigated whether sevoflurane alters the expression of P-selectin on platelets and the formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates. Twenty-five patients undergoing minor extremity surgery received sevoflurane-based general anesthesia, with mask induction and laryngeal mask airway anesthesia maintenance. Whole blood was obtained before and 40 min after sevoflurane anesthesia. Unstimulated and adenosine diphosphate-stimulated samples of whole blood and platelet rich plasma were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. The expression of P-selectin on platelets and the formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates were measured using flow cytometry. Sevoflurane inhibited platelet P-selectin expression. It also reduced the formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates, both in unstimulated and adenosine diphosphate-stimulated blood samples at 3%\u20134% end-expiratory sevoflurane concentrations used to maintain anesthesia.",

We tested whether low-dose sevoflurane inhalation provides sustained inhibition of detrimental granulocyte-platelet aggregation in humans. METHODS:Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled in this crossover study. Each subject inhaled sevoflurane for 1 h at 0.5\u20131 vol % end-tidal concentration in oxygen (50 vol %). Inhaling oxygen (50 vol %) alone served as control. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline before inhalation, immediately after inhalation, and 24 h thereafter, and were used for flow cytometry to determine platelet surface marker (CD41, CD42b, CD62P/P-selectin, and PAC-1) on platelets and granulocytes and for kaolin-induced clot formation, as assessed by thromboelastography. In flow cytometry experiments, platelets were stimulated with arachidonic acid (AA, 30 &mgr;M), adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 1 &mgr;M), and thrombin receptor agonist peptide-6 (TRAP-6, 6 &mgr;M). RESULTS:AA, ADP, and TRAP-6 markedly increased the expression of CD62P on platelets, whereas CD42b (shedding) and PAC-1 (heterotypic conjugates) expression decreased. The amount of granulocyte-platelet aggregates increased upon agonist stimulation. Low-dose sevoflurane inhalation reduced ADP-induced CD62P expression on platelets 24 h after inhalation, and inhibited the formation of granulocyte-platelet aggregates under stimulation with AA and ADP after 1 and 24 h, and with TRAP-6 after 24 h compared with control. Inhibition of granulocyte-platelet aggregates was accompanied by reduced clot firmness 24 h after sevoflurane inhalation compared with control. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrated for the first time that inhaling low-dose sevoflurane (<1 vol % end-tidal) inhibits agonist-induced granulocyte-platelet interactions 24 h after administration and thus counteracts thromboinflammatory processes.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo explore the protective mechanisms of sevoflurane against acute lung injury (ALI) induced by one-lung ventilation (OLV) in view of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways.\n\n\nMETHOD\nEighteen healthy Japanese white rabbits were randomized into sham-operated group (S group), OLV group (O group) and OLV + sevoflurane group (OS group). COX2 and 5-LOX protein and mRNA expressions in the lungs were detected by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and leukotrienes B2 (LTB2) in the lung tissues were quantified with ELISA. Histological scores and lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratios were determined for lung injury assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCOX2 and 5-LOX protein and mRNA expressions and the contents of LTB2, TXA2 and PGI2 in the lungs, lung W/D ratio and histological scores were significantly higher while PGI2/TXA2 ratio was significantly lower in O group and OS group than in S group (P<0.05). Compared with those in O group, COX2 and 5-LOX expressions, pulmonary contents of LTB2, TXA2 and PGI2, and lung W/D ratio all decreased significantly but PGI2/TXA2 ratio was significantly elevated in OS group (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOLV may activate COX2 and 5-LOX pathways to result in increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites. Sevoflurane protects against OLV-induced ALI probably by reducing AA metabolites and regulating PGI2/TXA2 ratio through inhibitions of COX2 and 5-LOX pathways.",

            "abstract": "Acute traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) results in a lifetime of paralysis associated with a host of medical complications. The developing secondary complications of tSCI may result in further chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Sevoflurane preconditioning (SF-PreCon) has shown guaranteed protective effects in myocardial or cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. However, the role of SF-PreCon in tSCI still remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that SF-PreCon ameliorated the developing secondary complications through reducing the apoptosis rate and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in injured spinal cord tissues, and therefore enhancing the recovery after tSCI. Notably, we demonstrated that SF-PreCon ameliorates tSCI through inhibiting Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). Importantly, we verified that SF-PreCon inhibits the expression of COX-2 and reduces the apoptosis rate after tSCI via the induction of Caveolin-3 (Cav-3). Taken together, our results suggest that SF-PreCon ameliorates tSCI via Cav-3-dependent COX-2 inhibition and provide an economical and practical method against the secondary injury after tSCI.",

            "abstract": "Preconditioning of sevoflurane (Sevo) has been demonstrated to protect the liver from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, it is unknown whether it has hepatoprotective when given at the onset of reperfusion (postconditioning), a protocol with more clinical impact. The present study aimed to explore the hepatoprotective effects of Sevo postconditioning against hepatic IR injury in vivo and in vitro and the possible mechanisms. Using a mouse model of hepatic I/R, Sevo postconditioning significantly improved hepatic injury after reperfusion, as demonstrated by reduced AST, ALT, and LDH serum levels and reduced histologic damage in liver tissues. Furthermore, Sevo postconditioning could suppress the apoptosis, inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory response in liver tissue of HIRI mice, as well as improve the survival rate of HIRI mice. Through analyzing GSE72314 from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, it was demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-142 is downregulated by HIRI, which was reversed by Sevo treatment. Further investigation showed that agomiR-142 injection could enhance the hepatoprotective effects of Sevo postconditioning on I/R injury, while antagomiR-142 reversed these effects in mice. Notably, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an important inflammatory factor, was directly targeted by miR-142 in hepatic cells, and we further found that Sevo could inhibit the expression of HMGB1 through up-regulating miR-142 expression in HIRI mice model. In addition, we found that I/R injury induced the activation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB inflammatory pathway was partially suppressed by Sevo postconditioning, and miR-142 mediated the regulatory role of Sevo postconditioning. In line with the in vivo results, Sevo treatment improved the cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response in vitro HIRI model, while these effects were reversed by antagomiR-142 transfection. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that Sevo postconditioning counteracts the downregulation of miR-142 provoked by I/R, in turn decreased the expression of HMGB1, blocking TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway activation, thus improving hepatic I/R injury. Our data suggest that Sevo may be a valuable alternative anaesthetic agent in liver transplantation and major liver surgeries.",

            "abstract": "Background: D-carvone is a monoterpene that exists in the essential oils of several plant species. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (Hep I/R) takes place clinically during different scenarios of liver pathologies. The aim of the current investigation is to disclose the hepato-protective actions of carvone against Hep I/R-induced damage and to reveal the underlying mechanism. Material and methods: Rats were assigned into five groups: sham and carvone plus sham groups, in which rats were administered either saline or carvone orally for three weeks prior to the induction of Hep I/R. In the Hep I/R group, rats were administered saline orally prior to the Hep I/R induction operation. The carvone 25 plus Hep I/R and Carvone 50 plus Hep I/R groups were administered carvone (25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively) for three weeks, followed by the induction of Hep I/R. Results: Liver ischemic animals demonstrated impaired liver function, several histopathological variations, and reduced levels of antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, the Hep I/R groups showed the elevated gene expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), and LR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLP3), with subsequent escalated adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), neutrophil infiltration, and several inflammatory mediators, including interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), as well as apoptotic markers. Pretreatment with D-carvone alleviated ischemia/reperfusion-induced impaired liver function, diminished the histopathological deviations, and augmented the antioxidant enzymes. In addition, D-carvone mitigated the gene expression of HMGB1, TLR4, NF\u03baB, and NLP3, with a subsequent reduction in ICAM-1, neutrophils infiltration, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic markers. Conclusion: Rats pretreated with D-carvone exhibited hepato-protective actions against Hep I/R-induced damage via the downregulation of HMGB1, TLR4, NF\u03baB, NLP3, associated inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic markers.",

            "abstract": "Background: D-carvone is a monoterpene that exists in the essential oils of several plant species. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (Hep I/R) takes place clinically during different scenarios of liver pathologies. The aim of the current investigation is to disclose the hepato-protective actions of carvone against Hep I/R-induced damage and to reveal the underlying mechanism. Material and methods: Rats were assigned into five groups: sham and carvone plus sham groups, in which rats were administered either saline or carvone orally for three weeks prior to the induction of Hep I/R. In the Hep I/R group, rats were administered saline orally prior to the Hep I/R induction operation. The carvone 25 plus Hep I/R and Carvone 50 plus Hep I/R groups were administered carvone (25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively) for three weeks, followed by the induction of Hep I/R. Results: Liver ischemic animals demonstrated impaired liver function, several histopathological variations, and reduced levels of antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, the Hep I/R groups showed the elevated gene expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), and LR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLP3), with subsequent escalated adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), neutrophil infiltration, and several inflammatory mediators, including interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), as well as apoptotic markers. Pretreatment with D-carvone alleviated ischemia/reperfusion-induced impaired liver function, diminished the histopathological deviations, and augmented the antioxidant enzymes. In addition, D-carvone mitigated the gene expression of HMGB1, TLR4, NF\u03baB, and NLP3, with a subsequent reduction in ICAM-1, neutrophils infiltration, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic markers. Conclusion: Rats pretreated with D-carvone exhibited hepato-protective actions against Hep I/R-induced damage via the downregulation of HMGB1, TLR4, NF\u03baB, NLP3, associated inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic markers.",
