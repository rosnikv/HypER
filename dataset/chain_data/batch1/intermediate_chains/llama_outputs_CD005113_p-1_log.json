            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that mediates inflammatory synovitis and articular matrix degradation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the ability of adalimumab, a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, to inhibit the progression of structural joint damage, reduce the signs and symptoms, and improve physical function in patients with active RA receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 619 patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week (n = 207), adalimumab 20 mg subcutaneously every week (n = 212), or placebo (n = 200) plus concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy end points were radiographic progression at week 52 (total Sharp score by a modified method [TSS]), clinical response at week 24 (improvements of at least 20% in the American College of Rheumatology core criteria [ACR20]), and physical function at week 52 (disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 52, there was statistically significantly less radiographic progression, as measured by the change in TSS, in the patients receiving adalimumab either 40 mg every other week (mean +/- SD change 0.1 +/- 4.8) or 20 mg weekly (0.8 +/- 4.9) as compared with that in the placebo group (2.7 +/- 6.8) (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). In addition, there were statistically significant changes in the components of the TSS. At week 24, ACR20 responses were achieved by 63% and 61% of patients in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly groups, respectively, versus 30% of patients in the placebo group (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, ACR20 responses were achieved by 59% and 55% of patients taking adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly, respectively, versus 24% of patients taking placebo (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, physical function as measured by the HAQ demonstrated statistically significant improvement with adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly compared with placebo (mean change in HAQ score -0.59 and -0.61, respectively, versus -0.25; P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). A total of 467 patients (75.4%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated. Discontinuations occurred in 22.0% of adalimumab-treated patients and in 30.0% of placebo-treated patients. The rate of adverse events (both serious and nonserious) was comparable in the adalimumab and placebo groups, although the proportion of patients reporting serious infections was higher in patients receiving adalimumab (3.8%) than in those receiving placebo (0.5%) (P < or = 0.02), and was highest in the patients receiving 40 mg every other week.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this 52-week trial, adalimumab was more effective than placebo at inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage, reducing the signs and symptoms, and improving physical function in patients with active RA who had demonstrated an incomplete response to MTX.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that mediates inflammatory synovitis and articular matrix degradation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the ability of adalimumab, a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, to inhibit the progression of structural joint damage, reduce the signs and symptoms, and improve physical function in patients with active RA receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 619 patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week (n = 207), adalimumab 20 mg subcutaneously every week (n = 212), or placebo (n = 200) plus concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy end points were radiographic progression at week 52 (total Sharp score by a modified method [TSS]), clinical response at week 24 (improvements of at least 20% in the American College of Rheumatology core criteria [ACR20]), and physical function at week 52 (disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 52, there was statistically significantly less radiographic progression, as measured by the change in TSS, in the patients receiving adalimumab either 40 mg every other week (mean +/- SD change 0.1 +/- 4.8) or 20 mg weekly (0.8 +/- 4.9) as compared with that in the placebo group (2.7 +/- 6.8) (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). In addition, there were statistically significant changes in the components of the TSS. At week 24, ACR20 responses were achieved by 63% and 61% of patients in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly groups, respectively, versus 30% of patients in the placebo group (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, ACR20 responses were achieved by 59% and 55% of patients taking adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly, respectively, versus 24% of patients taking placebo (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, physical function as measured by the HAQ demonstrated statistically significant improvement with adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly compared with placebo (mean change in HAQ score -0.59 and -0.61, respectively, versus -0.25; P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). A total of 467 patients (75.4%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated. Discontinuations occurred in 22.0% of adalimumab-treated patients and in 30.0% of placebo-treated patients. The rate of adverse events (both serious and nonserious) was comparable in the adalimumab and placebo groups, although the proportion of patients reporting serious infections was higher in patients receiving adalimumab (3.8%) than in those receiving placebo (0.5%) (P < or = 0.02), and was highest in the patients receiving 40 mg every other week.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this 52-week trial, adalimumab was more effective than placebo at inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage, reducing the signs and symptoms, and improving physical function in patients with active RA who had demonstrated an incomplete response to MTX.",

All serious infections, stratified by site and organism, were included in the analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween December 2001 and September 2005, there were 525 serious infections in the anti-TNF-treated cohort and 56 in the comparison cohort (9,868 and 1,352 person-years of followup, respectively). The incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted for baseline risk, for the anti-TNF-treated cohort compared with the comparison cohort was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.68-1.57). However, the frequency of serious skin and soft tissue infections was increased in anti-TNF-treated patients, with an adjusted IRR of 4.28 (95% confidence interval 1.06-17.17). There was no difference in infection risk between the 3 main anti-TNF drugs. Nineteen serious bacterial intracellular infections occurred, exclusively in patients in the anti-TNF-treated cohort.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with active RA, anti-TNF therapy was not associated with increased risk of overall serious infection compared with DMARD treatment, after adjustment for baseline risk. In contrast, the rate of serious skin and soft tissue infections was increased, suggesting an important physiologic role of TNF in host defense in the skin and soft tissues beyond that in other tissues.",

Administrative data were used to identify hospitalizations with possible bacterial infections; corresponding medical records were abstracted and reviewed by infectious disease specialists for evidence of definite infections. Proportional hazards models evaluated time-dependent infection risks associated with TNFalpha antagonists.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHospital medical records with claims-identified suspected bacterial infections were abstracted (n=187) among RA patients who received TNFalpha antagonists (n=2,393; observation time 3,894 person-years) or MTX (n=2,933; 4,846 person-years). Over a median followup time of 17 months, the rate of hospitalization with a confirmed bacterial infection was 2.7% among the patients treated with TNFalpha antagonists compared with 2.0% among the patients treated with MTX only. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of infection among the patients who received TNFalpha antagonists was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3-2.8) compared with patients who received MTX only. The incidence of infections was highest within 6 months after initiating TNFalpha antagonist therapy (2.9 versus 1.4 infections per 100 person-years; multivariable-adjusted HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0-8.8).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe multivariable-adjusted risk of hospitalization with a physician-confirmed definite bacterial infection was approximately 2-fold higher overall and 4-fold higher in the first 6 months among patients receiving TNFalpha antagonists versus those receiving MTX alone.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the risk of serious bacterial infections associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antagonists among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective cohort study of US RA patients enrolled in a large health care organization identified patients who received either TNFalpha antagonists or methotrexate (MTX). Administrative data were used to identify hospitalizations with possible bacterial infections; corresponding medical records were abstracted and reviewed by infectious disease specialists for evidence of definite infections. Proportional hazards models evaluated time-dependent infection risks associated with TNFalpha antagonists.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHospital medical records with claims-identified suspected bacterial infections were abstracted (n=187) among RA patients who received TNFalpha antagonists (n=2,393; observation time 3,894 person-years) or MTX (n=2,933; 4,846 person-years). Over a median followup time of 17 months, the rate of hospitalization with a confirmed bacterial infection was 2.7% among the patients treated with TNFalpha antagonists compared with 2.0% among the patients treated with MTX only. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of infection among the patients who received TNFalpha antagonists was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3-2.8) compared with patients who received MTX only. The incidence of infections was highest within 6 months after initiating TNFalpha antagonist therapy (2.9 versus 1.4 infections per 100 person-years; multivariable-adjusted HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0-8.8).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe multivariable-adjusted risk of hospitalization with a physician-confirmed definite bacterial infection was approximately 2-fold higher overall and 4-fold higher in the first 6 months among patients receiving TNFalpha antagonists versus those receiving MTX alone. RA patients were at increased risk of serious infections, irrespective of the method used to define an infectious outcome. Patients and physicians should vigilantly monitor for signs of infection when using TNFalpha antagonists, particularly shortly after treatment initiation.",

A total of 24,530 patients were included in the RA cohort; a random sample of non-RA patients served as a comparison cohort (n = 500,000). Rates of hospitalized infection were compared between the cohorts. A nested case-control analysis was performed within the RA cohort to assess the effect of current RA medication use on hospitalized infection risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1,993 patients with RA and 11,977 non-RA patients experienced a hospitalized infection. The rate of first hospitalized infection was higher in the RA cohort [adjusted hazard ratio = 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-2.13]. In the case-control analysis, the current use of biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) was associated with slightly increased risk of hospitalized infection [rate ratio (RR) = 1.21; 95% CI 1.02-1.43]. Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine were associated with decreased risk.

The adjusted rate of infections per 100 person-years was increased among users of MTX (30.9, 95% CI 29.2 to 32.7), TNF antagonists (40.1, 95% CI 37.0 to 43.4) and a combination of MTX and TNF antagonists (37.1, 95% CI 34.9 to 39.3) compared with users of other non-biological DMARDs (24.5, 95% CI 21.8 to 27.5). The adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) was increased in patients treated with MTX (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.50) and TNF antagonists (IRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.78) compared with those treated with other DMARDs. TNF antagonist use was associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections (IRR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.94). Prednisone use was associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections (IRR 1.63, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.21) and an increased risk of overall infection at doses >10 mg daily (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53). Conclusions: MTX, TNF antagonists and prednisone at doses >10 mg daily were associated with increased risks of overall infections. Low-dose prednisone and TNF antagonists (but not MTX) increased the risk of opportunistic infections.",

TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and nonbiologic regimens were compared in disease-specific propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts using Cox regression models with nonbiologics as the reference. Baseline glucocorticoid use was evaluated as a separate covariate.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nInfections requiring hospitalization (serious infections) during the first 12 months after initiation of TNF-\u03b1 antagonists or nonbiologic regimens.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStudy cohorts included 10,484 RA, 2323 IBD, and 3215 psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies matched pairs using TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and comparator medications. Overall, we identified 1172 serious infections, most of which (53%) were pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections. Among patients with RA, serious infection hospitalization rates were 8.16 (TNF-\u03b1 antagonists) and 7.78 (comparator regimens) per 100 person-years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91-1.21]). Among patients with IBD, rates were 10.91 (TNF-\u03b1 antagonists) and 9.60 (comparator) per 100 person-years (aHR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.83-1.46]). Among patients with psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies, rates were 5.41 (TNF-\u03b1 antagonists) and 5.37 (comparator) per 100 person-years (aHR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.76-1.45]). Among patients with RA, infliximab was associated with a significant increase in serious infections compared with etanercept (aHR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.07-1.47]) and adalimumab (aHR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.02-1.48]). Baseline glucocorticoid use was associated with a dose-dependent increase in infections.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients with autoimmune diseases, compared with treatment with nonbiologic regimens, initiation of TNF-\u03b1 antagonists was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations for serious infections.",

            "abstract": "RA is known to be associated with an increased risk of serious infection. Even more than 50 years ago, observational studies showed a greater than 2-fold increased risk of serious infection in RA. This was reinforced by various subsequent cohort studies. The elevated susceptibility of patients with RA can be explained by the pathobiology of the disease itself, the impact of chronic comorbid conditions, as well as sequelae of immunosuppressive treatment. It has been suggested that premature ageing of the immune system in RA contributes to weakened protection against infectious organisms. In addition, chronic comorbid conditions such as diabetes or chronic lung or kidney disease, disease-related functional disability, as well as lifestyle factors such as smoking, increase the risk in individual patients. For a long time glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used as potent immunosuppressive drugs in RA. There is evidence that they increase the risk of serious infections up to 4-fold in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors increase the serious infection risk up to 2-fold. They have, however, the potential to outweigh their risk when higher GC doses can be tapered down. If patients need higher dosages of GCs in addition to treatment with biologic agents, their risk of infection is substantial. This combination should be used carefully and, if possible, avoided in patients with additional risk factors such as older age or comorbid conditions.",

Even more than 50 years ago, observational studies showed a greater than 2-fold increased risk of serious infection in RA. This was reinforced by various subsequent cohort studies. The elevated susceptibility of patients with RA can be explained by the pathobiology of the disease itself, the impact of chronic comorbid conditions, as well as sequelae of immunosuppressive treatment. It has been suggested that premature ageing of the immune system in RA contributes to weakened protection against infectious organisms. In addition, chronic comorbid conditions such as diabetes or chronic lung or kidney disease, disease-related functional disability, as well as lifestyle factors such as smoking, increase the risk in individual patients. For a long time glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used as potent immunosuppressive drugs in RA. There is evidence that they increase the risk of serious infections up to 4-fold in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors increase the serious infection risk up to 2-fold. They have, however, the potential to outweigh their risk when higher GC doses can be tapered down. If patients need higher dosages of GCs in addition to treatment with biologic agents, their risk of infection is substantial. This combination should be used carefully and, if possible, avoided in patients with additional risk factors such as older age or comorbid conditions.",

In study A, tofacitinib-naive patients were randomised to tofacitinib 10\u2005mg twice daily or placebo, stratified by background methotrexate and vaccinated 4\u2005weeks later. In study B, patients already receiving tofacitinib 10\u2005mg twice daily (with or without methotrexate) were randomised into two groups: those continuing (\u2018continuous\u2019) or interrupting (\u2018withdrawn\u2019) tofacitinib for 2\u2005weeks, and then vaccinated 1\u2005week after randomisation.

Methods In this prospective randomised parallel-group trial, patients with RA taking stable dose of MTX were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to continue MTX (group 1), suspend MTX for 4 weeks before vaccination (group 2), suspend MTX for 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after vaccination (group 3) or suspend MTX for 4 weeks after vaccination (group 4). All participants were vaccinated with trivalent influenza vaccine containing H1N1, H3N2 and B-Yamagata. The primary outcome was frequency of satisfactory vaccine response (\u22654-fold titre increase 4 weeks postvaccination). Secondary endpoints included fold change in antibody titres from baseline. Results The per-protocol population consisted of 199 patients (n=54, 44, 49 and 52 in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Group 3 achieved higher satisfactory vaccine response against all three antigens than group 1 (51.0% vs 31.5%, p=0.044). The anti-H3N2 antibody fold increase (95%\u2009CI) was significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 (12.2 (8.4 to 17.5), p <0.001\u2009and 10.0 (6.8 to 14.8), p=0.043, respectively) than group 1 (5.9 (4.3 to 8.1)).

            "abstract": "Introduction To assess the incidence and risk factors for breakthrough COVID-19 infection in a vaccinated cohort of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) and determine whether antibodies to receptor binding domain of spike protein (anti-RBD) serve as a reliable predictor of susceptibility to such infections. Methods Patients with AIRDs who had completed two doses of SARS-CoV2 vaccines were included and anti-RBD antibodies were determined 4\u20136 weeks post the second vaccine dose and stratified into good responders (GR) (>212 IU), inadequate responders (IR) (0.8\u2013212 IU) and non-responders (NR) (<0.8 IU). Patients who had completed a minimum of 8 weeks interval after the second dose of vaccine were followed up every 2 months to identify breakthrough infections. All sero converted patients who had contact with COVID-19 were also analysed for neutralising antibodies. Results We studied 630 patients of AIRDs (mean age 55.2 (\u00b111.6) years, male to female ratio of 1:5.2). The majority of patients had received AZD1222 (495, 78.6%) while the remaining received the BBV152 vaccine. The mean antibody titre was 854.1 (\u00b1951.9), and 380 (60.3%) were GR, 143 (22.7%) IR and 107 (16.9%) NR. Breakthrough infections occurred in 47 patients (7.4%) at a mean follow-up of 147.3 (\u00b153.7) days and were proportionately highest in the NR group (19; 17.75%), followed by the IR group (13; 9.09%) and least in the GR group (15; 3.95%). On log-rank analysis, antibody response (p<0.00001), vaccine(p=0.003) and mycophenolate mofetil (p=0.007) were significant predictors of breakthrough infections. On multivariate Cox regression, only NR were significantly associated with breakthrough infections (HR: 3.6, 95% CI 1.58 to 8.0, p=0.002). In sero converted patients with contact with COVID-19, neutralisation levels were different between those who developed and did not develop an infection. Conclusion Breakthrough infections occurred in 7.4% of patients and were associated with seronegativity following vaccination. This provides a basis for exploring postvaccination antibody titres as a biomarker in patients with AIRD.",

Methods Patients with AIRDs who had completed two doses of SARS-CoV2 vaccines were included and anti-RBD antibodies were determined 4\u20136 weeks post the second vaccine dose and stratified into good responders (GR) (>212 IU), inadequate responders (IR) (0.8\u2013212 IU) and non-responders (NR) (<0.8 IU). Patients who had completed a minimum of 8 weeks interval after the second dose of vaccine were followed up every 2 months to identify breakthrough infections. All sero converted patients who had contact with COVID-19 were also analysed for neutralising antibodies. Results We studied 630 patients of AIRDs (mean age 55.2 (\u00b111.6) years, male to female ratio of 1:5.2). The majority of patients had received AZD1222 (495, 78.6%) while the remaining received the BBV152 vaccine. The mean antibody titre was 854.1 (\u00b1951.9), and 380 (60.3%) were GR, 143 (22.7%) IR and 107 (16.9%) NR. Breakthrough infections occurred in 47 patients (7.4%) at a mean follow-up of 147.3 (\u00b153.7) days and were proportionately highest in the NR group (19; 17.75%), followed by the IR group (13; 9.09%) and least in the GR group (15; 3.95%). On log-rank analysis, antibody response (p<0.00001), vaccine(p=0.003) and mycophenolate mofetil (p=0.007) were significant predictors of breakthrough infections. On multivariate Cox regression, only NR were significantly associated with breakthrough infections (HR: 3.6, 95% CI 1.58 to 8.0, p=0.002). In sero converted patients with contact with COVID-19, neutralisation levels were different between those who developed and did not develop an infection. Conclusion Breakthrough infections occurred in 7.4% of patients and were associated with seronegativity following vaccination. This provides a basis for exploring postvaccination antibody titres as a biomarker in patients with AIRD.",
