            "abstract": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation in one or more joints; it affects children and adolescents up to 18 years of age. This disease may cause significant skeletal joint destruction, and the temporomandibular joint, like other joints, may become severely affected resulting in aberrant mandibular growth, abnormal dentofacial development, and/or altered orofacial muscle function. Methotrexate is the most common remittive agent used in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis to modify the course of inflammatory destruction of peripheral joints. The purpose of this study was: (1) to evaluate the effect of methotrexate therapy on the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and aberration in craniofacial development in children afflicted with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; (2) to further examine the relationship between the temporomandibular joint/cephalometric findings and rheumatologic data (ie, age at onset, duration of disease); and (3) to evaluate further pauciarticular- and polyarticular-onset disease in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and facial dysmorphology. The following information was obtained from 45 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: (1) routine rheumatologic clinical examination data; (2) anamnestic temporomandibular joint evaluation data; (3) clinical temporomandibular joint examination data; (4) lateral cephalometric measurement data; (5) posteroanterior cephalometric measurement data; and (6) individually corrected axial tomographic data. The results demonstrated the following: (1) radiographic evidence of condylar degeneration was apparent in 63% of all patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pauciarticular patients showing less temporomandibular involvement than polyarticular patients; (2) polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving methotrexate showed less severe temporomandibular joint involvement than the polyarticular patients not receiving methotrexate; (3) the craniofacial structure was affected to a greater extent in the polyarticular form of the disease; (4) the craniomandibular index scores were significantly greater in the polyarticular group; (5) vertical height asymmetry and chin deviation were noted in more than 50% of the patients; and (6) there was a correlation between the severity of condylar lesions and cephalometric findings (ie, mandibular retroposition, posterior rotation, smaller ramus and mandibular dimensions) and the onset and duration of the disease. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, methotrexate therapy was effective in minimizing temporomandibular joint destruction and craniofacial dysmorphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients with the polyarticular form of the disease.",

Jaw pain or dysfunction and maximal incisal opening (MIO) distance were assessed before and after injection. Fourteen patients had followup MRI studies of the TMJ 6-12 months after injection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 13 patients with symptoms of jaw pain prior to corticosteroid treatment, 10 (77%) had complete resolution of pain (P < 0.05). Prior to corticosteroid injection, MIO in all 23 patients was below age-matched normal values. After injection, the MIO was improved by at least 0.5 cm in 10 patients (43%) (P = 0.0017). Patients under 6 years of age at the time of injection showed the best response, with a postinjection MIO similar to that in age-matched controls (P = 0.2267).

Approximately half the patients experienced significant improvement in MIO and TMJ effusion. These data suggest that corticosteroid injection may be a useful procedure for the prevention and treatment of morbidities associated with TMJ arthritis in JIA.",

            "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThis review explores the prevalence, clinical and radiographic signs, and treatment of temporomandibular joint arthritis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Recent findingsTemporomandibular joint arthritis seems to be a more frequent manifestation in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis than previously believed, in part due to the paucity of clinical symptoms and poor sensitivity of conventional radiographs used for diagnosis. Antinuclear antibody positivity, early onset of disease, and presence of systemic or polyarticular disease are all risk factors for temporomandibular joint arthritis but may underpredict temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging enhanced with gadolinium is currently the gold standard in detection of temporomandibular joint arthritis, and treatment with intra-articular corticosteroids has been shown to be effective and safe, with minimal side effects. SummaryGiven the paucity of clinical symptoms in temporomandibular joint arthritis, detection of temporomandibular joint inflammation using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is essential for instituting appropriate therapy in a timely fashion. The use of intra-articular corticosteroids holds promise for control of temporomandibular joint inflammation and prevention of associated morbidities.",

The TMJs of all patients were imaged with MRI and US within 8 weeks of diagnosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 32 patients enrolled, 78% were female, and the median age was 8.6 years (range 1.5-17.2 years). Acute TMJ arthritis was diagnosed in 75% of the children by MRI and in none by US; chronic arthritis was diagnosed in 69% by MRI and in 28% by US.

Rheumatological, orthodontic and US examinations correctly diagnosed 11 (58%), 9 (47%) and 6 (33%) patients, respectively, with active TMJ arthritis, but misdiagnosed 8 (42%), 10 (53%) and 12 (67%) patients, respectively, as having no signs of inflammation. The best predictor for active arthritis on MRI was a reduced maximum mouth opening. Conclusion. None of the methods tested was able to reliably predict the presence or absence of MRI-proven inflammation in the TMJ in our cohort of JIA patients. US was the least useful of all methods tested to exclude active TMJ arthritis.",

Twenty patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and 10 healthy control subjects underwent measurement of S100A12 serum concentrations by sandwich ELISA. Temporomandibular Joints (TMJs); clinical and post contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations were performed. MRI findings were scored. Results showed that TMJ arthritis was detected in 80% of JIA patients using MRI. Serum S100A12 levels were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. Serum concentrations of S100A12 and total MRI scores were significantly higher in JIA patients with active disease compared to those without activity. Systemic and polyarticular JIA patients showed significant increase in S100A12 levels and total MRI scores compared to those with oligoarticular JIA. The MRI TMJ abnormalities revealed significant association with clinical signs of TMJ inflammation but not with symptoms. A significant correlation was found between serum S100A12 concentrations and MRI score as well as between each of them and different clinical, laboratory disease parameters. Serum S100A12 levels showed significant positive correlation with synovial enhancement score. To conclude TMJ arthritis could be detected in most cases of JIA patients using contrast enhanced MRI. Increased S100A12 levels may point to synovial inflammation. Clinical signs of TMJ arthritis may be used as filter for MRI examination. Further studies on larger scale of JIA patients are needed for monitoring TMJ inflammation and S100A12 may be a potential target of future anti-inflammatory therapy.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The neutrophil activation marker S100A12 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine and a potential biomarker for a range of inflammatory diseases. This study aims to investigate whether serum S100A12 concentrations are associated with angiographic coronary lesion complexity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We enrolled 240 CAD and 68 healthy controls. Coronary lesion complexity was assessed by coronary angiography (CAG). Serum S100A12 concentrations were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We demonstrated that serum S100A12 concentrations were independently associated with the presence of complex lesion in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) (Odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.04; p < 0.01). In addition, among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who had significantly higher serum S100A12 concentrations than SAP patients (140.8 [interval 109.4\u2013208.6] vs. 120.8 [interval 96.1\u2013145.9] \u03bcg/L, respectively, p < 0.01), those with multi-complex lesions had significantly higher serum S100A12 concentrations than those with no or one complex lesion (156.3 [interval 116.2\u2013247.4] vs. 129.2 [interval 99.8\u2013165.2] \u03bcg/L, respectively, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that S100A12 in serum might be a potential biomarker for providing valuable information regarding coronary plaque vulnerability in patients with CAD.",

Baseline characteristics, including co- morbidities and medications, were recorded and serum S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and C- reactive protein levels were measured besides routine laboratory tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 90 patients (63.00 [56.00-73.00] years, 62.89% male) have been included. None of the groups differed from each other regarding baseline characteristics (p > 0.05). S100A9 levels were elevated in ACS when compared with the normal coronary arteries (p = 0.033) and S100A12 levels were found to be elevated in ACS when compared with both patients with normal coronary arteries and stable coronary artery disease (p = 0.001). S100A12 was identified as an independent associate of ACS (p = 0.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that S100A12 may serve as a marker of coronary plaque instability, and may have a therapeutic implication in ACS treatment.",

Material/Methods A total of 303 patients were enrolled in this study, with 110 having acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 110 having coronary heart disease (CHD), and 83 subjects served as healthy blood donors. The concentrations of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and S100A8/A9 protein were determined in the sera of the participants and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a rat carotid artery thrombosis model and in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs).

Results The levels of COX-2, TLR-4, and S100A8/A9 in the sera of patients with ACS and CHD were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P<0.05).

            "abstract": "Objective Inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between microRNA-146b-3p (miR-146b-3p) and inflammatory factors in thrombosis. Method THP-1 cells were cultured in vitro, Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of COX-2 and p38MAPK in the cells, and real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of miRNA-146b-3p and COX-2. A lentiviral expression vector of miRNA-146b-3p and its inhibitor were constructed to transfect THP-1 cells. COX-2 and p38MAPK expression in transfected cells was detected by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Results Ang II and TNF-\u03b1 could elevate the expression of COX-2 in monocytes. The expression of COX-2 was upregulated by p38MAPK, which could be phosphorylated by Ang II, while there was an increasing tendency of p38MAPK phosphorylation after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. In addition, COX-2 expression and P38MAPK phosphorylation could be downregulated by miRNA-146b-3p and upregulated by the miRNA-146b-3p inhibitor. Ang II could increase miR-146b-3p expression, although there was no significant difference; however, the expression of miR-146b-3p was enhanced significantly by TNF-\u03b1. Conclusion Our data implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p was closely related to the progression of inflammation mediating the P38MAPK/COX-2 pathway. We suggest that the miR-146b-3p/p38MAPK/COX-2 pathway plays a key role in inflammation and arterial thrombosis.",

            "abstract": "Objective Inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between microRNA-146b-3p (miR-146b-3p) and inflammatory factors in thrombosis. Method THP-1 cells were cultured in vitro, Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of COX-2 and p38MAPK in the cells, and real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of miRNA-146b-3p and COX-2. A lentiviral expression vector of miRNA-146b-3p and its inhibitor were constructed to transfect THP-1 cells. COX-2 and p38MAPK expression in transfected cells was detected by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Results Ang II and TNF-\u03b1 could elevate the expression of COX-2 in monocytes. The expression of COX-2 was upregulated by p38MAPK, which could be phosphorylated by Ang II, while there was an increasing tendency of p38MAPK phosphorylation after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. In addition, COX-2 expression and P38MAPK phosphorylation could be downregulated by miRNA-146b-3p and upregulated by the miRNA-146b-3p inhibitor. Ang II could increase miR-146b-3p expression, although there was no significant difference; however, the expression of miR-146b-3p was enhanced significantly by TNF-\u03b1. Conclusion Our data implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p was closely related to the progression of inflammation mediating the P38MAPK/COX-2 pathway. We suggest that the miR-146b-3p/p38MAPK/COX-2 pathway plays a key role in inflammation and arterial thrombosis.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT MicroRNAs are crucial regulators in the phenotype switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Nonetheless, the role of miR-146b-3p in VSMCs remains unclear. In the present study, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) at different concentrations was employed to stimulate VSMCs for different times, to establish the model of VSMC dysfunction. The relative expression of miR-146b-3p was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The proliferation of VSMCs was measured by BrdU assay. Flow cytometry analysis was employed for the analysis of cell cycle. VSMC migration was detected by Transwell assay. Phosphoinositide-3 kinase catalytic subunit-gamma (PIK3CG) and markers of VSMC differentiation, including \u03b1-SMA, SM-22\u03b1, SMMHC, and Calponin were examined employing Western blot. The targeting relationship between miR-146b-3p and PIK3CG 3\u02b9-UTR was affirmed by dual-luciferase gene assay. We report that the reduction of miR-146b-3p expression was induced by PDGF-BB in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). The overexpression of miR-146b-3p counteracted the effects of PDGF-BB on the proliferation and migration of VSMCs and increased the expressions of differentiation markers (P < 0.05). Additionally, PIK3CG expression was negatively regulated by miR-146b-3p, and the restoration of PIK3CG partly eliminated the effects of miR-146b-3p on VSMCs (P < 0.05). In summary, miR-146b-3p represses the proliferation, migration, and phenotype switch of VSMCs induced by PDGF-BB via targeting PIK3CG. Therefore, miR-146b-3p/PIK3CG may be a potential target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Graphical Abstract",

Therefore, it is vital to identify the risk factors and pathogenesis for EH with carotid plaque. Methods Based on our previous microarray analysis, we selected four circRNAs as the candidate circRNAs and detected their expression levels in blood of 192 subjects (64 healthy controls, 64 EH patients, and 64 EH patients with carotid plaque) by qRT-PCR analysis. The regulatory mechanism of circRNAs involved in carotid plaque was predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Results The level of hsa_circ_0124782 increased significantly and the levels of hsa_circ_0131618 and hsa_circ_0127342 decreased significantly in the EH group and EH with carotid plaque group compared with the control group (P < .05). Functional enrichment analysis showed that three circRNAs might be implicated in pathogenesis for carotid plaque. Conclusion Our study revealed the relationship between three circRNAs and carotid plaque, suggesting that they may serve as potential biomarkers for EH with carotid plaque.",
