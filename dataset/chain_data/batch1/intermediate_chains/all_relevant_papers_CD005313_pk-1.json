        "abstract": "Several studies have shown that stent implantations in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) result in better short\u2010 and long\u2010term outcomes than primary balloon angioplasty. These results, however, have not been ascertained in randomized trials. We randomized 136 patients out of 208 patients with AMI within 12 hr from onset into two groups: 69 patients with primary balloon angioplasty (POBA group) and 67 patients with primary stent implantation (STENT group). We compared the incidences of major cardiac events (repeat MI, target lesion revascularization, and cardiac death) and angiographic parameters during hospitalization and follow\u2010up periods up to 12 months in these two groups. There was no significant difference in the reperfusion success rates. The incidences of major cardiac events were lower in the STENT group than in the POBA group during hospitalization, the first 6 months and 12 months (6% vs. 19%, P\u2009=\u20090.023; 21% vs. 46%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001; 22% vs. 49%, P\u2009=\u20090.0011). Minimum lumen diameters were significantly bigger in the STENT group than the POBA group at predischarge angiogram and 6\u2010month follow\u2010up (2.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62 vs. 2.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.82 mm, P\u2009<\u20090.0001; 2.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64 vs. 1.72\u2009\u00b1\u20090.76, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Restenosis rates at 6\u2010month follow\u2010up were significantly lower in the STENT group than in the POBA group (17% vs. 37.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.02). In selected patients with AMI, primary stent implantation results in a lower incidence of major cardiac events during the first 12 months, postprocedure, and less frequent 6\u2010month restenosis than primary balloon angioplasty.

        "abstract": "Direct percutaneous transcatheter revascularization (PTCR) is becoming an acceptable therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Stenting in the setting of AMI, once consid ered contraindicated, is emerging as a suitable option in this situation. Coronary stenting without predilation (SWOP) may potentially shorten the procedure and radiation time, reduce costs, and decrease procedural complications such as coronary dissection and distal embolization. It is expected to cause less vascular injury, with a reduction in the rate of in-stent restenosis. In this preliminary study the authors evaluated the feasibility of the SWOP procedure in 22 selected patients with AMI. Indications for catheter-based myocardial reperfusion were the following: extensive anterior wall MI (68%), inferior wall and right ventricular MI (23%), and inferior wall MI with contraindication for thrombolytic therapy (9%). Patients with cardiogenic shock or with contraindications for aspirin or ticlopidine were excluded. SWOP was successful in 21 attempts (95%), and final procedural success was achieved in all. Proximal or distal dissections were seen in three cases and were treated by additional three stents. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow 3 was restored in all patients. There were no distal embolizations, side branch occlusions, coronary perforations, procedure-related emergency bypass operations, or deaths. It is concluded that in selected patients with AMI, coronary artery stenting without predilation is feasible and safe and does not introduce additional risk to the patients.",

        "title": "Coronary stenting during rescue angioplasty after failed thrombolysis",
        "abstract": "Compared with primary angioplasty [percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)], rescue PTCA is associated with lower angiographic success and higher reocclusion rates, especially after thrombolysis with tissue\u2010type plasminogen activator (tPA). Although stent placement during primary PTCA has been demonstrated to be safe and even to improve the angiographic results achieved by balloon\u2010alone PTCA, there are few data on stent placement during rescue PTCA after failed thrombolysis. This study sought to assess the feasibility and safety of stent implantation during rescue angioplasty in myocardial infarction after failed thrombolysis. The study population consisted of 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction referred for rescue PTCA after failed thrombolysis consecutively treated with coronary stenting. The thrombolytic agent was tPA in 15 patients (75%), streptokinase in 1 (5%), and anisoylated streptokinase plasminogen activator complex (APSAC) in 1 (5%); 3 patients (15%) were included in the INTIME II study (tPA vs. lanoteplase). After stenting, aspirin 200 mg daily plus ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. were administered. Thirty stents (1.5 \u00b1 1.0 per patient) were implanted. Angiographic success was achieved in 19 patients (95%). Two patients (10%) died, both because of severe bleeding complications. One patient (5%) suffered a reinfarction, but no patients suffered postinfarction angina or needed new target vessel revascularization. Eighteen patients (90%) were discharged alive and free of events. All these patients remained asymptomatic and free of target vessel revascularization at 6\u2010month follow\u2010up. Stent placement during rescue PTCA after failed thrombolysis is feasible and safe and is associated with a good angiographic result and clinical outcome. Bleeding complications seem to be, however, the main limitation of this reperfusion strategy. Cathet. Cardiovasc. Intervent. 47:1\u20135, 1999. \u00a9 1999 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

Routine (primary) stent implantation after PTCA has the potential to further improve late outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPrimary stenting was performed as part of a prospective study in 236 consecutive patients without contraindications who presented with AMI of <12 hours' duration at 9 international centers. A mean of 1.4+/-0.7 stents were implanted per patient (97% Palmaz-Schatz) at 17.3+/-2.4 atm. During a clinical follow-up period of 7.4+/-2.6 months, death occurred in 4 patients (1.7%), reinfarction occurred in 5 patients (2.1%), and TVR was required in 26 patients (11.1%). By Cox regression analysis, small reference-vessel diameter and the number of stents implanted were the strongest determinants of TVR. Angiographic restenosis occurred in 27.5% of lesions. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the number of stents implanted and the absence of thrombus on the baseline angiogram were independent determinants of binary restenosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA strategy of routine stent implantation during mechanical reperfusion of AMI is safe and is associated with favorable event-free survival and low rates of restenosis compared with primary PTCA alone.",

        "abstract": "Most randomized trials comparing primary stenting with primary coronary angioplasty (PTCA) excluded patients at high risk from enrollment, thus arising the important question about the generalizability of the randomized trial results to all patients with AMI. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a primary infarct\u2010related artery (IRA) stenting strategy using a second\u2010generation tubular stent in nonselected patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). All patients with AMI were considered eligible for primary IRA stenting. No restriction was made based on age or clinical status on presentation, or coronary anatomy, except in cases of a reference IRA diameter < 2.5 mm. The primary endpoint of the study was clinical target vessel failure defined as death, reinfarction, or repeat TVR due to restenosis or reocclusion of the IRA. Between June 1998 and March 1999, 201 consecutive patients with AMI underwent mechanical recanalization of the IRA. The mean age was 64 \u00b1 12, and 16% of patients were aged 75 years or over. The incidence of shock was 9%. Primary IRA stenting was performed in 89% of the patients. Patients who underwent PTCA alone had a smaller IRA diameter as compared to patients with a stented IRA (2.48 \u00b1 0.46 mm vs. 3.15 \u00b1 0.37 mm; P < 0.001). There were no stent deployment failures. The 6\u2010month primary endpoint rate was 15% (2 deaths, 27 repeat TVR, 0 reinfarctions), while the 6\u2010month angiographic restenosis rate was 22%.
