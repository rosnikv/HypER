        "abstract": "Social cognition models of health behavior are commonly understood as being universal, which implies that they are applicable to groups varying in age or cultural background, for example. Cultural uniqueness and characteristics of life-span development, however, necessitate the study of differential effects. Accordingly, the health action process approach (HAPA) was examined in younger and middle-aged/older adults from South Korea (N = 697) who participated in a longitudinal health screening study with a 6-month time lag. The HAPA model had a good fit within the middle-aged/older adult sample. Physical activity was predicted by planning, coping self-efficacy, and intention, which were, in turn, predicted by action self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and risk perceptions. Conversely, the results indicated a poor model fit in the younger adult sample. The results suggest a different motivation for the involvement in physical activity as a function of age.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines the differential age effects on physical exercise of two planning interventions, action planning (when, where, how) and coping planning (anticipating barriers, mental simulation of success scenarios), and examines the mediating mechanisms of the interventions. Methods: The study assigned the participants, 205 cardiac rehabilitation patients, to one of the intervention groups (action-planning only or combined-planning group) or to a control group. Baseline measurement and follow-up took place 2 months apart. Results: The interventions enhanced physical exercise independently of age. Pretreatment coping planning was higher in older (65-82 years) than in younger (38-54 years) or middle-aged (55-64 years) participants. At Time 2, older participants were the only ones without further increase in coping planning. Advancement in coping planning partially mediated the effect of the intervention. Conclusion: Coping planning facilitates improvement of physical exercise. Implications of age differences in planning are discussed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nMost studies examine associations between social-cognitive variables and self-regulated behavioural change across two or three occasions only. This study adopts an innovative perspective by analysing associations across 11 occasions, which allows examining patterns of associations both on the between- and within-person levels.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThirty initially untrained participants of a running training programme completed 11 monthly questionnaires. All questionnaires assessed motivational and volitional variables and self-reported running. Additionally, net running time of marathon, or half-marathon distance at the end of programme, was available.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSelf-efficacy turned out to be associated with intentions on the between- and within-person levels. Individual differences in change patterns and within-person fluctuations in volitional variables, intentions, and self-efficacy turned out to be consistently associated with change patterns and within-person fluctuations in self-regulated running training over time and with successfully running marathon or half-marathon distance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn contrast to examining only one facet of change, this study is the first to differentiate two components of change in health behaviour self-regulation: a systematic trend component, and a component representing within-person unsystematic fluctuations. Thus, results of the present study provide a comprehensive picture of the dynamic relations between motivational, volitional, and behavioural characteristics which occur between and within persons.",

        "abstract": "Although considerable evidence suggests that forming an implementation intention increases rates of goal attainment, less research has examined the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The present research investigated the role of deliberative processes and accessibility of plan components as explanation for the relationship between implementation intentions and goal achievement. Study 1 used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of implementation intentions on goal intentions and self-efficacy. The results of 66 tests suggested that forming implementation intentions had negligible effects on both variables. Study 2 focused on the accessibility of plan components and found that the effect of implementation intentions on goal achievement was mediated simultaneously by the accessibility of specified situational cues and by the strength of the association forged between these cues and the intended response. These findings suggest that implementation intention effects are not explained by increased deliberation, but rather accrue from heightened accessibility of specified opportunities and strong opportunity-response links.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to test the direct predictors of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), action planning and coping planning as predictors of changes in physical activity (PA) in 157 adolescents (mean age: 12). TPB measures, the Action Planning and Coping Planning Scales (APCPS) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaires were measured at baseline, 2- and 5-month follow-up. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted regressing PA at Time 2 or Time 3 onto TPB and APCPS at baseline or Time 2, respectively. Past behaviour accounted for a significant 25-51% of the variance in PA in Step 1 of all three analyses. In Step 2, TPB accounted for an additional 3-10% with intention as a significant predictor. While no main effects for action planning or coping planning (Step 3) were found, all three analyses resulted in a significant amount of incremental variance accounted for by the interaction of action planning and coping planning (Step 4). Results suggest that the combination of high levels of action planning and coping planning is associated with increases in PA. Implications for theory of behaviour change in adolescents are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Although home-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs have been shown to produce significant increases in exercise capacity, obtaining patient adherence to these programs has been challenging. It is therefore critical to identify key theoretical determinants of exercise during home-based CR in order to inform the development of behavioural interventions that improve adherence. The present study examined the utility of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) in explaining exercise behaviour during home-based CR. Seventy-six patients who were receiving 6 months of home-based CR completed a TPB questionnaire at the beginning and mid-point of the program and a physical activity scale at the mid-point and end of the program. Path analyses showed that attitude and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted intention for both time intervals (baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months), whereas subjective norm only predicted intention within the 1st 3 months. Intention significantly predicted implementation intention, which, in turn, significantly predicted exercise for both time intervals. Finally, several underlying accessible beliefs were significantly related to exercise for both time intervals. Therefore, results suggest that the TPB is a potentially useful framework for understanding exercise behaviour during home-based CR.",

        "title": "Adherence to health-related behaviors: effectiveness of implementation intentions and posthypnotic suggestion in college students",
        "abstract": "On the basis of Gollwitzer\u2019s (1993, 1999) implementation intentions\u2019 concept, and Kirsch & Lynn\u2019s (1997) response set theory, this dissertation tested the effectiveness of a combined intervention of implementation intentions with hypnosis with posthypnotic suggestions in enhancing adherence to a simple (mood report) and a difficult (physical activity) health-related task. Participants were enrolled in a university in New Jersey (N=124, Study 1, USA) and in two universities in Lisbon (N=323, Study 2, Portugal). In both studies participants were selected from a broader sample based on their suggestibility scores using the Waterloo-Stanford Group C (WSGC) scale of hypnotic susceptibility and then randomly assigned to the experimental groups. Study 1 used a 2x2x3 factorial design (instruction x hypnosis x level of suggestibility) and Study 2 used a 2 x 2x 2 x 4 factorial design (task x instructions x hypnosis x level of suggestibility). In Study 1 participants were asked to run in place for 5 minutes each day for a three-week period, to take their pulse rate before and after the activity, and to send a daily email report to the experimenter, thus providing both a self-report and a behavioral measure of adherence. Participants in the goal intention condition were simply asked to run in place and send the e-mail once a day. Those in the implementation intention condition were further asked to specify the exact place and time they would perform the physical activity and send the e-mail. In addition, half of the participants were given a post-hypnotic suggestion indicating that the thought of running in place would come to mind without effort at the appropriate moment. The other half did not receive a posthypnotic suggestion. Study 2 followed the same procedure, but additionally half of the participants were instructed to send a mood report by SMS (easy task) and half were assigned to the physical activity task described above (difficult task). Adherence to health-related behaviors vii Study 1 result\u2019s showed a significant interaction between participant\u2019s suggestibility level and posthypnotic suggestion (p<.01) indicating that posthypnotic suggestion enhanced adherence among highly suggestible participants, but lowered it among low suggestible individuals. No differences between the goal intention and the implementation intentions groups were found. In Study 2, participants adhered significantly more (p<.001) to the easy task than to the difficult task. Results did not revealed significant differences between the implementation intentions, hypnosis and the two conditions combined, indicating that implementation intentions was not enhanced by hypnosis with posthypnotic suggestion, neither was effective as single intervention in enhancing adherence to any of the tasks. Hypnosis with posthypnotic suggestion alone significantly reduced adherence to both tasks in comparison with participants that did not receive hypnosis. Since there were no instruments in Portuguese language to asses hypnotic suggestibility, the Waterloo-Stanford Group C (WSGC) scale of hypnotic susceptibility was translated and adapted to Portuguese and was used in the screening of a sample of college students from Lisbon (N=625). Results showed that the Portuguese sample has distribution shapes and difficulty patterns of hypnotic suggestibility scores similar to the reference samples, with the exception of the proportion of Portuguese students scoring in the high range of hypnotic suggestibility, that was found lower than the in reference samples. In order to shed some light on the reasons for this finding participant\u2019s attitudes toward hypnosis were inquired using a Portuguese translation and adaptation of the Escala de Valencia de Actitudes y Creencias Hacia la Hipnosis, Versi\u00f3n Cliente, and compared with participants with no prior hypnosis experience (N=444). Significant differences were found between the two groups with participants without hypnosis experience scoring higher in factors indicating misconceptions and negative attitudes about hypnosis. Adherence to health-related behaviors viii Resumo Com base no conceito de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de inten\u00e7\u00f5es (Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999) e na teoria do contexto de resposta de Kirsch & Lynn (1997), o presente trabalho testou a efic\u00e1cia de uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o combinada de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de inten\u00e7\u00f5es com hipnose e sugest\u00e3o p\u00f3shipn\u00f3tica na promo\u00e7\u00e3o da ades\u00e3o a uma tarefa simples (avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do humor) e uma tarefa dif\u00edcil (actividade f\u00edsica). Os participantes s\u00e3o estudantes universit\u00e1rios de uma universidade na Nova J\u00e9rsia, (N=124, Estudo 1, EUA) e em Lisboa (N=323, Estudo 2, Portugal). Em ambos os estudos os participantes foram seleccionados a partir de uma amostra mais vasta baseado num escrut\u00ednio da sua sugestibilidade hipn\u00f3tica avaliada por meio da Escala de Grupo de Sugestibilidade Hipn\u00f3tica de Waterloo-Stanford (WSGC): Forma C. O Estudo 1 usou um desenho factorial do tipo 2x2x3 (tipo de inten\u00e7\u00e3o formada x hipnose x n\u00edvel de sugestionabilidade) e o Estudo 2 usou um desenho factorial do tipo 2 x 2x 2 x 4 (tipo de tarefa x tipo de inten\u00e7\u00e3o formada x hipnose x n\u00edvel de sugestionabilidade). No Estudo 1 foi pedido aos participantes que corressem todos os dias e durante tr\u00eas semanas durante 5 minutos, que medissem a sua pulsa\u00e7\u00e3o antes e depois da actividade f\u00edsica e que mandassem um e-mail ao experimentador, fornecendo assim uma medida comportamental e uma medida de auto-relato. Aos participantes no grupo de inten\u00e7\u00f5es de meta foi apenas pedido que corressem todos os dias. Aos participantes no grupo de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de inten\u00e7\u00f5es foi pedido que especificasses com exactid\u00e3o quando e onde iriam correr e enviar o e-mail. Para al\u00e9m disso, cerca de metade dos participantes foram hipnotizados e receberam uma sugest\u00e3o p\u00f3s-hipn\u00f3tica em que lhes foi sugerido que o pensamento de correr todos os dias lhes viria \u00e0 mente sem esfor\u00e7o no momento apropriado. A outra metade dos participantes n\u00e3o recebeu qualquer sugest\u00e3o hipn\u00f3tica. No Estudo 2 foi seguido o mesmo procedimento, mas a cerca de metade dos participantes foi atribu\u00edda uma tarefa f\u00e1cil (enviar um Adherence to health-related behaviors ix SMS com a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o di\u00e1ria do seu estado de humor naquele momento) e \u00e0 outra metade da amostra foi atribu\u00edda a tarefa de exerc\u00edcio f\u00edsico atr\u00e1s descrita (tarefa dif\u00edcil). Os resultados do estudo 1 mostraram uma interac\u00e7\u00e3o significativa entre o n\u00edvel de sugestionabilidade dos participantes e a sugest\u00e3o p\u00f3s-hipn\u00f3tica (p<.01) indicando que a administra\u00e7\u00e3o da sugest\u00e3o p\u00f3s-hipn\u00f3tica aumentou a ades\u00e3o nos participantes muito sugestion\u00e1veis, mas baixou a ades\u00e3o nos participantes pouco sugestion\u00e1veis. N\u00e3o se encontraram diferen\u00e7as entre os grupos que formaram inten\u00e7\u00f5es de meta e os que formaram implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de inten\u00e7\u00f5es. No Estudo 2 os resultados indicaram que os participantes aderiram significativamente mais \u00e0 tarefa f\u00e1cil do que \u00e0 tarefa dif\u00edcil (p<.001). Os resultados n\u00e3o revelaram diferen\u00e7as significativas entre as condi\u00e7\u00f5es implementa\u00e7\u00f5es de inten\u00e7\u00f5es, hipnose e as duas estrat\u00e9gias combinadas, indicando que a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de inten\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o foi eficaz no aumento da ades\u00e3o \u00e0s duas tarefas propostas e n\u00e3o beneficiou da combina\u00e7\u00e3o com as sugest\u00f5es p\u00f3s-hipn\u00f3ticas. A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da hipnose com sugest\u00e3o p\u00f3s-hipn\u00f3tica significativamente reduziu a ades\u00e3o a ambas as tarefas. Dado que n\u00e3o existiam instrumentos em Portugu\u00eas destinados a avaliar a sugestionabilidade hipn\u00f3tica, traduziu-se e adaptou-se para Portugu\u00eas Escala de Grupo de sugestibilidade hipn\u00f3tica de Waterloo-Stanford (WSGC): Forma C. A amostra Portuguesa (N=625) apresentou resultados semelhantes aos encontrados nas amostras de refer\u00eancia em termos do formato da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos padr\u00f5es da pontua\u00e7\u00e3o e do \u00edndice de dificuldade dos itens. Contudo, a propor\u00e7\u00e3o de estudantes portugueses encontrada que pontuaram na zona superior de sugestionabilidade foi significativamente inferior \u00e0 propor\u00e7\u00e3o de participantes na mesma zona encontrada nas amostras de refer\u00eancia. No sentido de lan\u00e7ar alguma luz sobre as raz\u00f5es para este resultado, inquiriu-se alguns dos participantes acerca das suas atitudes face \u00e0 hipnose utilizando uma vers\u00e3o portuguesa da Escala de Val\u00eancia de Atitudes e Cren\u00e7as face \u00e0 Hipnose e comparou-se com a opini\u00e3o de Adherence to health-related behaviors x estudantes que nunca experimentaram a hipnose nem tinham qualquer conhecimento sobre ela. (N=444). Encontrou-se diferen\u00e7as significativas entre os dois grupos, com os participantes sem experi\u00eancia pr\u00e9via de hipnose a demonstrarem mais atitudes e cren\u00e7as negativas do que os estudantes com experi\u00eancia de hipnose.
