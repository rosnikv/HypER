        "title": "Milnacipran: Beyond a Role of Antidepressant",
        "abstract": "Milnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with negligible effects on any presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors. Milnacipran has unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that distinguish it from the other marketed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine such as equipotent serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and a linear dose-concentration trend at therapeutic doses. The half-life of milnacipran is approximately 8 hours. In addition, milnacipran does not inhibit the cytochrome P 450 system, indicating minimal propensity for drug-drug interactions. The antidepressant efficacy of milnacipran has been clearly established in a number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, and it has been widely used for treating major depressive disorder. Moreover, evidence suggests that milnacipran is effective and tolerable in the treatment of fibromyalgia and may have usefulness for fatigue and anxiety symptoms. The current paper reviews researches conducted to date that is relevant to the efficacy, tolerability, and mechanism of action of milnacipran in the treatment of depression, fibromyalgia, and other psychiatric syndromes. Future directions of research are also identified.",

        "title": "Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors for Pain Control: Premise and Promise",
        "abstract": "The precise mechanisms of pain perception and transmission in the central nervous system have not been fully elucidated. However, extensive data support a role for the monoamine neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine, in the modulation of pain. Experiments with animal models of pain indicate that noradrenergic interventions, and to a lesser extent serotonergic interventions, reduce pain-related behavior. This is supported by data from clinical trials in humans in which antidepressants have been shown to reduce pain and functional impairment in central and neuropathic pain conditions. These effects are particularly well-studied in trials with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which have provided a useful tool in the clinician\u2019s arsenal, particularly considering the limitations of other classes of pain medications such as opioids, anti-inflammatories, and anticonvulsants (i.e., limited efficacy, safety and tolerability issues). Moreover, painful physical symptoms are frequently comorbid with major psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. This paper reviewed and summarized the rationale and potential role of SNRIs for the control of pain including clinical and preclinical background. Currently evidence does not definitely support a role of the SNRIs, while limited data propose a putative promise of SNRIs in the treatment of pain related disorders including fibromyalgia and depressed patients with multiple somatic complaints. More researches are warranted to generalize currently available preliminary evidences.",

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic and debilitating musculoskeletal pain disorder of unknown aetiology with usual accompanying features of fatigue, sleep disturbances and stiffness. Its place in medical textbooks was controversial with rheumatologists holding the helm of its management for many years. Over the last decade, abnormalities have been identified at multiple levels in the peripheral, central, and sympathetic nervous systems as well as the hypothalomo-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response system. With the elucidation of these pathways of pain, FMS is known more as a central sensitivity syndrome. This led to tremendous increment in interest in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of FMS. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also successively approved 3 drugs for the management of fibromyalgia--pregabalin, duloxetine and milnacipran. Non-pharmacological modalities showed aerobic exercise, patient education and cognitive behavioural therapy to be most effective. Overall, management of FMS requires a multi-disciplinary approach.",

        "title": "Functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) in fibromyalgia and the response to milnacipran",
        "abstract": "Functional imaging has been used to study response to pain in fibromyalgia patients. Functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) which tracks local changes in blood flow has a higher spatial and temporal resolution than other techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single\u2010photon emission tomography (SPECT). fMRI studies in fibromyalgia patients suggest that similar levels of subjective pain result in similar central nervous system (CNS) activation in both fibromyalgia patients and controls. For a similar stimulus, however, fibromyalgia patients have a greater subjective sensation of pain. This increased sensitivity is accompanied with a decreased activity in brain regions implicated in the descending pain inhibitory pathways. The hypothesis that increased sensitivity to pain is due to decreased activity of the descending inhibitory pathways is supported by results with milnacipran. Fibromyalgia patients treated with the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, milnacipran, exhibited a reduction in pain sensitivity and a parallel increase in activity in brain regions implicated in the descending pain inhibitory pathways compared to placebo\u2010treated patients.

        "abstract": "Objective. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of milnacipran, a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM). Methods. A 27-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared milnacipran 100 and 200 mg/day with placebo in the treatment of 888 patients with FM. Two composite responder definitions were used to classify each patient\u2019s individual response to therapy. \u201cFM responders\u201d concurrently satisfied response criteria for improvements in pain (visual analog scale 24-h morning recall), patient global impression of change (PGIC), and physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Component Summary); while \u201cFM pain responders\u201d concurrently satisfied response criteria for improvements in pain and PGIC. Results. At the primary endpoint, after 3-month stable dose treatment, a significantly higher percentage of milnacipran-treated patients met criteria as FM responders versus placebo (milnacipran 200 mg/day, p = 0.017; milnacipran 100 mg/day, p = 0.028). A significantly higher percentage of patients treated with milnacipran 200 mg/day also met criteria as FM pain responders versus placebo (p = 0.032). Significant pain reductions were observed after Week 1 with both milnacipran doses. At 15 weeks, milnacipran 200 mg/day led to significant improvements over placebo in pain (realtime, daily and weekly recall; all measures, p < 0.05), PGIC (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.016), cognition (p = 0.025), and multiple SF-36 domains. Milnacipran was safe and well tolerated by the majority of patients during 27 weeks of treatment; nausea and headache were the most common adverse events. Conclusion. Milnacipran is safe and effective for the treatment of multiple symptoms of FM.",

        "title": "Role and rationale for the use of milnacipran in the management of fibromyalgia",
        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain which is often accompanied by multiple other symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, decreased physical functioning, and dyscognition. Due to these multiple symptoms, as well as high rates of comorbidity with other related disorders, patients with FM often report a reduced quality of life. Although the pathophysiology of FM is not completely understood, patients with FM experience pain differently from the general population, most likely due to dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous system leading to both hyperalgesia and allodynia. In many patients with FM, this aberrant pain processing, or central sensitization, appears to involve decreased pain inhibition within the spinal tract, which is mediated by descending pathways that utilize serotonin, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters. The reduced serotonin and norepinephrine levels observed in patients with FM suggest that medications which increase the levels of these neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), may have clinically beneficial effects in FM and other chronic pain conditions. Milnacipran is an SNRI that has been approved for the management of FM. In clinical trials, treatment with milnacipran for up to 1 year has been found to improve the pain and other symptoms of FM. Because FM is characterized by multiple symptoms that all contribute to the decreased quality of life and ability to function, the milnacipran pivotal trials implemented responder analyses. These utilized a single composite endpoint to identify the proportion of patients who reported simultaneous and clinically significant improvements in pain, global disease status, and physical function. Other domains assessed during the milnacipran trials include fatigue, multidimensional functioning, mood, sleep quality, and patient-reported dyscognition. This review article provides information intended to help clinicians make informed decisions about the use of milnacipran in the clinical management of patients with FM. It draws primarily on results from 2 of the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis of approval of milnacipran in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.",

In this double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010 and active drug\u2010controlled study (N = 100), effects of supratherapeutic doses of milnacipran on cardiac repolarization were evaluated in healthy volunteers. The primary outcome was the largest mean difference between milnacipran and placebo in time\u2010matched baseline\u2010adjusted QT interval corrected for heart rate using an individual correction formula (QTcNi). In addition, data were analyzed using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) and a post hoc piecewise QTcNi analysis based on a dichotomous cut of RR interval data at 800 ms. Moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) was used to establish assay sensitivity. Using the QTcNi method, the largest difference in baseline\u2010adjusted QTcNi between milnacipran 300 mg bid and placebo was \u22124.7 ms (90% confidence interval [CI]: \u22129.4 to \u22120.1), indicating no QT prolongation. Analysis using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) showed a maximum adjusted mean change of +7.7 ms, but QTcF versus RR interval plots indicated overcorrection with this method. The piecewise QTcNi correction method demonstrated a more accurate correction for drug\u2010induced heart rate increase; mean baseline\u2010adjusted between\u2010group difference was +0.9 ms (90% CI: \u22126.6 to 8.3).
