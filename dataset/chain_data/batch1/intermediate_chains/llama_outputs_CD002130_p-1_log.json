Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPlatelets are believed to play a part in the ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty, such as abrupt closure of the coronary vessel during or soon after the procedure. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

One major bleeding event occurred in the abciximab group (0.7 percent); none occurred in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with placebo, early administration of abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction improves coronary patency before stenting, the success rate of the stenting procedure, the rate of coronary patency at six months, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes.",

When used in combination with PTCA, coronary stenting and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may further improve outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 2082 patients with acute myocardial infarction to undergo PTCA alone (518 patients), PTCA plus abciximab therapy (528), stenting alone with the MultiLink stent (512), or stenting plus abciximab therapy (524).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNormal flow was restored in the target vessel in 94.5 to 96.9 percent of patients and did not vary according to the reperfusion strategy. At six months, the primary end point - a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel - had occurred in 20.0 percent of patients after PTCA, 16.5 percent after PTCA plus abciximab, 11.5 percent after stenting, and 10.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab (P<0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups in the rates of death, stroke, or reinfarction; the difference in the incidence of the primary end point was due entirely to differences in the rates of target-vessel revascularization (ranging from 15.7 percent after PTCA to 5.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab, P<0.001). The rate of angiographically established restenosis was 40.8 percent after PTCA and 22.2 percent after stenting (P<0.001), and the respective rates of reocclusion of the infarcted-related artery were 11.3 percent and 5.7 percent (P=0.01), both independent of abciximab use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt experienced centers, stent implantation (with or without abciximab therapy) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAs compared with thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in acute myocardial infarction reduces the rates of death, reinfarction, and stroke, but recurrent ischemia, restenosis, and reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. When used in combination with PTCA, coronary stenting and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may further improve outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 2082 patients with acute myocardial infarction to undergo PTCA alone (518 patients), PTCA plus abciximab therapy (528), stenting alone with the MultiLink stent (512), or stenting plus abciximab therapy (524).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNormal flow was restored in the target vessel in 94.5 to 96.9 percent of patients and did not vary according to the reperfusion strategy. At six months, the primary end point - a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel - had occurred in 20.0 percent of patients after PTCA, 16.5 percent after PTCA plus abciximab, 11.5 percent after stenting, and 10.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab (P<0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups in the rates of death, stroke, or reinfarction; the difference in the incidence of the primary end point was due entirely to differences in the rates of target-vessel revascularization (ranging from 15.7 percent after PTCA to 5.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab, P<0.001). The rate of angiographically established restenosis was 40.8 percent after PTCA and 22.2 percent after stenting (P<0.001), and the respective rates of reocclusion of the infarcted-related artery were 11.3 percent and 5.7 percent (P=0.01), both independent of abciximab use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt experienced centers, stent implantation (with or without abciximab therapy) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of coronary artery stents in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nThe review was conducted following accepted guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials that include comparisons of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) versus PTCA with stent, stent versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and drug-eluting stents (DES) versus non-DES in patients with CAD in native or graft vessels and those with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and unstable angina were also included. Data on the following outcome measures were included in the review: combined event rate or event-free survival, death, acute myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation, repeat treatment (PTCA, stent or CABG) and binary restenosis. An economic model was developed based on extrapolation of trends in mortality and revascularisation from clinical trials data to a 5-year time horizon.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 50 studies comparing the use of stents with PTCA, six comparing stents with CABG and 12 comparing DES eluting stents with non-DES. No studies were identified that compared DES with PTCA or DES with CABG. Existing quality of life data suggest that revascularisation procedures reduce the patient's quality of life for a short period only. Stents were found to be more effective than PTCA in preventing adverse events and revascularisations. In multiple-vessel disease there was no evidence of a difference in mortality (at 1 year) between patients treated surgically and those receiving a stent. Patients treated surgically required fewer revascularisations. There is no evidence of a difference in mortality between patients receiving DES and those treated with bare metal stents at 1 year. A reduction in event rate at 9 and 12 months was found in patients treated with DES. This event rate is primarily made up of increased revascularisation rates in patients treated with bare metal stents. Two-year outcome data from one study indicate that this benefit of DES continues over the longer term. The economic model proved sufficient to indicate long-term trends in cost-effectiveness. CABG was found initially to be more expensive than bare metal stenting in multivessel disease and may have higher immediate risks, but over time the cost differential is reduced and long-term outcomes favour CABG over stenting. A similar situation was found for DES versus CABG in multiple-vessel disease. However, DES may not generally be considered a cost-effective alternative to bare metal stenting in single-vessel disease by policy makers as substantially higher costs are involved with a very small outcome benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDES might be considered cost-effective if the additional cost (compared with ordinary stents) was substantially reduced, the outcome benefits from the use of DES were much improved, and/or its use were targeted on the subgroups of patients with the highest risks of requiring reintervention. Long-term clinical studies are needed that focus on significant outcomes such as mortality. Further research should consider: the differences among plain stents; head-to-head comparisons within DES, CABG compared with DES; and the evaluation of newer non-DES against DES. Evaluation of the effects of revascularisation procedures and especially repeat revascularisation procedures on the patient's quality of life would also be useful, as would the development and testing of risk assessment tools to identify patients likely to need further revascularisations.",

Design: Cost\u2013utility analysis of audit based patient subgroups by means of a simple economic model. Setting: Tertiary care. Participants: 12 month audit data for 2884 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting at the Cardiothoracic Centre Liverpool between January 2000 and December 2002. Main outcome measures: Risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months of index procedure and reduction in risk from use of DES. Economic modelling was used to estimate the cost\u2013utility ratio and threshold price premium. Results: Four factors were identified for patients undergoing elective surgery (n \u200a=\u200a 1951) and two for non-elective surgery (n \u200a=\u200a 933) to predict risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months. Most patients fell within the subgroup with lowest risk (57% of the elective surgery group with 5.6% risk and 91% of the non-elective surgery group with 9.9% risk). Modelled cost\u2013utility ratios were acceptable for only one group of high risk patients undergoing non-elective surgery (only one patient in audit data). Restricting the number of DES for each patient improved results marginally: 4% of stents could then be drug eluting on economic grounds. The threshold price premium justifying 90% substitution of conventional stents was estimated to be \u00a3112 (US$212, \u20ac162) (sirolimus stents) or \u00a389 (US$167, \u20ac130) (paclitaxel stents). Conclusions: At current UK prices, DES are not cost effective compared with conventional stents except for a small minority of patients.

            "abstract": "No recent pharmaceutical or medical device has generated as much ongoing and expanding attention as drug-eluting stents (DES). In fact there has been an explosion of published reports on the topic within cardiology, medical, surgical and subspecialty journals. The device industry has repeatedly sent their own summaries of information directly to physicians, while mainstream media has kept the consumer and Wall Street appraised of safety concerns, often with sensational headlines. The Food and Drug Administration has also taken notice by convening a meeting on DES in late 2006. What have we learned through all this dissemination of data?\n\nArticle p 745 \n\nThe introduction of DES was greeted with intense enthusiasm in a \u201cperfect storm\u201d sort of way. Device representatives were eager to promote this new product that could dramatically reduce restenosis.1 Patients expected to be treated with this new and \u201cbetter\u201d technology. Lastly, cardiologists had a potent new tool at their disposal that they increasingly incorporated into practice until it became the default revascularization device instead of bare-metal stents in many parts of the world. This quick and widespread adoption in DES resulted in its frequent use in relatively untested and off-label indications. At the Cleveland Clinic, the use of DES mirrored the community and many interventional practices throughout the world, where the penetration of this device peaked at >90%.\n\nWhile DES use was increasing, McFadden and colleagues sounded an alarm with the publication of a report on 4 patients who experienced late stent thrombosis.2 Although this could have been a chance finding, DES were systematically shown to confer an increased risk of late thrombosis relative to bare-metal stents.3 This safety issue has been confirmed by several independent analyses with patient-level data from the pivotal randomized trials.1,4,5\n\nStent thrombosis is uncommon, although when it occurs it \u2026",

            "abstract": "No recent pharmaceutical or medical device has generated as much ongoing and expanding attention as drug-eluting stents (DES). In fact there has been an explosion of published reports on the topic within cardiology, medical, surgical and subspecialty journals. The device industry has repeatedly sent their own summaries of information directly to physicians, while mainstream media has kept the consumer and Wall Street appraised of safety concerns, often with sensational headlines. The Food and Drug Administration has also taken notice by convening a meeting on DES in late 2006. What have we learned through all this dissemination of data?\n\nArticle p 745 \n\nThe introduction of DES was greeted with intense enthusiasm in a \u201cperfect storm\u201d sort of way. Device representatives were eager to promote this new product that could dramatically reduce restenosis.1 Patients expected to be treated with this new and \u201cbetter\u201d technology. Lastly, cardiologists had a potent new tool at their disposal that they increasingly incorporated into practice until it became the default revascularization device instead of bare-metal stents in many parts of the world. This quick and widespread adoption in DES resulted in its frequent use in relatively untested and off-label indications. At the Cleveland Clinic, the use of DES mirrored the community and many interventional practices throughout the world, where the penetration of this device peaked at >90%.\n\nWhile DES use was increasing, McFadden and colleagues sounded an alarm with the publication of a report on 4 patients who experienced late stent thrombosis.2 Although this could have been a chance finding, DES were systematically shown to confer an increased risk of late thrombosis relative to bare-metal stents.3 This safety issue has been confirmed by several independent analyses with patient-level data from the pivotal randomized trials.1,4,5\n\nStent thrombosis is uncommon, although when it occurs it \u2026",

Methods and Results\u2014 Consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for ULMD had prospective platelet reactivity assessment by light transmittance aggregometry after a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel. The primary end point of the study was cardiac mortality, and the secondary end point was stent thrombosis. From January 2005 to September 2008, 215 consecutive patients were treated with DES for ULMD. The incidence of HRPR after clopidogrel loading was 18.6%. The median follow-up was 19.3 months. The overall estimated 1-, 2- and 3-year cardiac mortality rate was 3.9\u00b11.3%, 7.5\u00b12.2%, and 12.2\u00b13.4%, respectively. The 3-year cardiac mortality rate was 8.0\u00b13.1% in the low residual platelet reactivity (LRPR) group and 28.3\u00b110.4% in the HRPR group (P=0.005). The 3-year stent thrombosis rate was 4.2\u00b11.8% in the low residual platelet reactivity group and 16.0\u00b17.3% in the HRPR group (P=0.021). By forward stepwise regression analysis, HRPR after clopidogrel loading was the only independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio, 3.82; 95% confidence interval,1.38 to 10.54; P=0.010) and stent thrombosis (hazard ratio, 3.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 12.09; P=0.031). Conclusions\u2014 HRPR after 600-mg clopidogrel loading is a strong marker of increased risk of cardiac death and DES thrombosis in patients receiving DES stenting for ULMD. Routine assessment of in vitro residual platelet reactivity after clopidogrel loading in patients with ULMD potentially suitable for DES-supported percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered to guide patient care decisions.",

A key pharmacodynamic end point was the rate of persistently high on-treatment reactivity at 30 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 6 months, the primary end point had occurred in 25 of 1109 patients (2.3%) receiving high-dose clopidogrel compared with 25 of 1105 patients (2.3%) receiving standard-dose clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.76; P = .97). Severe or moderate bleeding was not increased with the high-dose regimen (15 [1.4%] vs 25 [2.3%], HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.31-1.11; P = .10).

It has not been well-studied in patients who have neurovascular stent-placement procedures. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between antiplatelet drug resistance and neurovascular stent-placement complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective data base of all patients treated at our institution was used to identify patients with neurovascular stent-placement procedures. During a 4.5-year period, all patients undergoing neurovascular stent placement were evaluated for aspirin and clopidogrel resistance by using the VerifyNow assay. During an observational phase, all patients received 75 mg of clopidogrel and aspirin (group A). During the intervention phase (group B), patients were given additional clopidogrel on the basis of the clopidogrel resistance assay. We assessed the development of thromboembolic complications within 30 days of the procedure in patients who were resistant-versus-nonresistant to clopidogrel. RESULTS: Of 96 patients who had neurovascular stent placement, 5.2% were resistant to aspirin and 36.5% were resistant to clopidogrel. Periprocedural thromboembolic complications were seen in 7 patients (7.3%). In a multivariate logistic regression model, clopidogrel resistance, higher diastolic blood pressure, and lack of statin use were significantly associated with periprocedural thromboembolic complication. There was a nonsignificant decrease in thromboembolic complications in patients whose clopidogrel dosage was tailored to the assay. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, clopidogrel resistance was associated with increased periprocedural thromboembolic complications from neurovascular stent-placement procedures. Targeting the clopidogrel dose to platelet inhibition assays may improve clinical outcomes and requires further study.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiplatelet drug resistance has been associated with thromboembolic complications in patients after coronary stent placement. It has not been well-studied in patients who have neurovascular stent-placement procedures. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between antiplatelet drug resistance and neurovascular stent-placement complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective data base of all patients treated at our institution was used to identify patients with neurovascular stent-placement procedures. During a 4.5-year period, all patients undergoing neurovascular stent placement were evaluated for aspirin and clopidogrel resistance by using the VerifyNow assay. During an observational phase, all patients received 75 mg of clopidogrel and aspirin (group A). During the intervention phase (group B), patients were given additional clopidogrel on the basis of the clopidogrel resistance assay. We assessed the development of thromboembolic complications within 30 days of the procedure in patients who were resistant-versus-nonresistant to clopidogrel. RESULTS: Of 96 patients who had neurovascular stent placement, 5.2% were resistant to aspirin and 36.5% were resistant to clopidogrel. Periprocedural thromboembolic complications were seen in 7 patients (7.3%). In a multivariate logistic regression model, clopidogrel resistance, higher diastolic blood pressure, and lack of statin use were significantly associated with periprocedural thromboembolic complication. There was a nonsignificant decrease in thromboembolic complications in patients whose clopidogrel dosage was tailored to the assay. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, clopidogrel resistance was associated with increased periprocedural thromboembolic complications from neurovascular stent-placement procedures. Targeting the clopidogrel dose to platelet inhibition assays may improve clinical outcomes and requires further study.",

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the relationship between antiplatelet resistance and clinically silent thromboembolic complications using DWI in patients who underwent coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2011 and May 2013, 58 patients with 62 unruptured aneurysms who were measured for antiplatelet response using VerifyNow assay and underwent elective coil embolization for an unruptured aneurysm with posttreatment DWI were enrolled.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Procedure-related thromboembolism is a major limitation of coil embolization, but the relationship between thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet resistance is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to verify the association between immediate postprocedural thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet drug resistance after endovascular coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 338 aneurysms between October 2012 and March 2015. All patients underwent postprocedural MR imaging within 48 hours after endovascular coil embolization. Antiplatelet drug resistance was checked a day before the procedure by using the VerifyNow system. Abnormal antiplatelet response was defined as >550 aspirin response units and >240 P2Y12 receptor reaction units. In addition, we explored the optimal cutoff values of aspirin response units and P2Y12 receptor reaction units. The primary outcome was radiologic infarction based on postprocedural MR imaging. RESULTS: Among 338 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 134 (39.6%) showed diffusion-positive lesions on postprocedural MR imaging, and 32 (9.5%) and 105 (31.1%) had abnormal aspirin response unit and P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values, respectively. Radiologic infarction was associated with advanced age (65 years and older, P = .024) only with defined abnormal antiplatelet response (aspirin response units \u2265 550, P2Y12 receptor reaction units \u2265 240). P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values in the top 10th percentile (>294) were associated with radiologic infarction (P = .003). With this cutoff value, age (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.28\u20134.08), P2Y12 receptor reaction units (>294; OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.53\u20137.71), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04\u20134.02) were associated with radiologic infarction in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic infarction after coiling for unruptured aneurysm was closely associated with age. Only very high P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values (>294) predicted postprocedural infarction. Further controlled studies are needed to determine the precise cutoff values, which could provide information regarding the optimal antiplatelet regimen for aneurysm coiling.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Procedure-related thromboembolism is a major limitation of coil embolization, but the relationship between thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet resistance is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to verify the association between immediate postprocedural thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet drug resistance after endovascular coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 338 aneurysms between October 2012 and March 2015. All patients underwent postprocedural MR imaging within 48 hours after endovascular coil embolization. Antiplatelet drug resistance was checked a day before the procedure by using the VerifyNow system. Abnormal antiplatelet response was defined as >550 aspirin response units and >240 P2Y12 receptor reaction units. In addition, we explored the optimal cutoff values of aspirin response units and P2Y12 receptor reaction units. The primary outcome was radiologic infarction based on postprocedural MR imaging. RESULTS: Among 338 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 134 (39.6%) showed diffusion-positive lesions on postprocedural MR imaging, and 32 (9.5%) and 105 (31.1%) had abnormal aspirin response unit and P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values, respectively. Radiologic infarction was associated with advanced age (65 years and older, P = .024) only with defined abnormal antiplatelet response (aspirin response units \u2265 550, P2Y12 receptor reaction units \u2265 240). P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values in the top 10th percentile (>294) were associated with radiologic infarction (P = .003).

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is routinely used to decrease ischemic complications during neurointerventional procedures. However, the efficacy may be limited by antiplatelet resistance. PURPOSE: Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the cerebrovascular field. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of 2 large databases was performed for studies published from 2000 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting treatment-related outcomes of patients undergoing neurointerventional procedures under prasugrel, and studies comparing prasugrel and clopidogrel. DATA ANALYSIS: Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the overall rate of complications, ischemic and hemorrhagic events, and influence of the dose of prasugrel. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the 7 included studies, 682 and 672 unruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated under prasugrel (cases) and clopidogrel (controls), respectively. Low-dose (20 mg/5 mg; loading and maintenance doses) prasugrel compared with the standard dose of clopidogrel (300 mg/75 mg) showed a significant reduction in the complication rate (OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17\u201374, P = .006; I2 = 0%). Overall, the ischemic complication rate was significantly higher in the clopidogrel group (40/672 = 6%; 95% CI, 3%\u201313%; I2 = 83% versus 16/682 = 2%; 95% CI, 1%\u20135%; I2 = 73%; P = .03). Low and high loading doses of prasugrel were associated with 0.6% (5/535; 95% CI, 0.1%\u20131.6%; I2 = 0%) and 9.3% (13/147; 95% CI, 0.2%\u201318%; I2 = 60%) intraperiprocedural hemorrhages, respectively (P = .001), whereas low and high maintenance doses of prasugrel were associated with 0% (0/433) and 0.9% (2/249; 95% CI, 0.3%\u20132%; I2 = 0%) delayed hemorrhagic events, respectively (P = .001). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective series and heterogeneous endovascular treatments were limitations. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, low-dose prasugrel compared with clopidogrel premedication was associated with an effective reduction of the ischemic events with an acceptable rate of hemorrhagic complications.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is routinely used to decrease ischemic complications during neurointerventional procedures. However, the efficacy may be limited by antiplatelet resistance. PURPOSE: Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the cerebrovascular field. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of 2 large databases was performed for studies published from 2000 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting treatment-related outcomes of patients undergoing neurointerventional procedures under prasugrel, and studies comparing prasugrel and clopidogrel. DATA ANALYSIS: Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the overall rate of complications, ischemic and hemorrhagic events, and influence of the dose of prasugrel. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the 7 included studies, 682 and 672 unruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated under prasugrel (cases) and clopidogrel (controls), respectively. Low-dose (20 mg/5 mg; loading and maintenance doses) prasugrel compared with the standard dose of clopidogrel (300 mg/75 mg) showed a significant reduction in the complication rate (OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17\u201374, P = .006; I2 = 0%). Overall, the ischemic complication rate was significantly higher in the clopidogrel group (40/672 = 6%; 95% CI, 3%\u201313%; I2 = 83% versus 16/682 = 2%; 95% CI, 1%\u20135%; I2 = 73%; P = .03). Low and high loading doses of prasugrel were associated with 0.6% (5/535; 95% CI, 0.1%\u20131.6%; I2 = 0%) and 9.3% (13/147; 95% CI, 0.2%\u201318%; I2 = 60%) intraperiprocedural hemorrhages, respectively (P = .001), whereas low and high maintenance doses of prasugrel were associated with 0% (0/433) and 0.9% (2/249; 95% CI, 0.3%\u20132%; I2 = 0%) delayed hemorrhagic events, respectively (P = .001).

            "abstract": "Background Thromboembolic complications (TECs) are frequent during the endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms. To prevent TECs, dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for the perioperative period. In patients with a poor response, clopidogrel is a risk factor for TECs. To prevent TECs, our study assessed the stratified use of prasugrel. Methods Patients who underwent endovascular therapy for unruptured cerebral aneurysms from April 2017 to August 2019 were enrolled in this clinical study and given premedication with aspirin and clopidogrel for 2 weeks prior to the procedure. P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) were measured using the VerifyNow assay on the day before the procedure (tailored group). In subgroups with PRU <240, the clopidogrel dose was maintained (CPG subgroup). In subgroups with PRU \u2265240, clopidogrel was changed to prasugrel (PSG subgroup). We compared the occurrence of TECs with retrospective consecutive cases from January 2015 to March 2017 without PRU assessments (non-tailored group). The frequency of TECs within 30 days was assessed as the primary endpoint. Results The tailored and non-tailored groups comprised 167 and 50 patients, respectively. TECs occurred in 11 (6.6%) and 8 (16%) patients in the tailored and non-tailored groups (P=0.048), respectively. The HR for TECs was significantly reduced in the tailored group (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.81); P=0.017) compared with the non-tailored group. Conclusion The results suggest that tailored dual antiplatelet therapy medication with PRU significantly reduces the frequency of TECs without increasing hemorrhagic complications.",

This nationwide registry study evaluated the effect and safety of tailored antiplatelet therapy in stent assisted coiling for unruptured aneurysms compared with conventional therapy using a standard regimen. Methods This study enrolled 1686 patients in 44 participating centers who received stent assisted coiling for unruptured aneurysms between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. The standard regimen (aspirin and clopidogrel) was used for all patients in the conventional group (924, 19 centers). The regimen was selected based on platelet function testing (standard regimen for clopidogrel responders; adding cilostazol or replacing clopidogrel with other thienopyridines (ticlopidine, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for clopidogrel non-responders) in the tailored group (762, 25 centers). The primary outcome was thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes were bleeding and poor outcomes (increase in modified Rankin Scale score). Outcomes within 30 days after coiling were compared using logistic regression analysis. Results The thromboembolic event rate was lower in the tailored group than in the conventional group (30/762 (3.9%) vs 63/924 (6.8%), adjusted OR 0.560, 95% CI 0.359 to 0.875, P=0.001). The bleeding event rate was not different between the study groups (62/762 (8.1%) vs 73/924 (7.9%), adjusted OR 0.790, 95%\u2009CI 0.469 to 1.331, P=0.376). Poor outcomes were less frequent in the tailored group (12/762 (1.6%) vs 34 (3.7%), adjusted OR 0.252, 95%\u2009CI 0.112 to 0.568, P=0.001).
