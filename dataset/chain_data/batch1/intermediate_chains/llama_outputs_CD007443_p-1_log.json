            "abstract": "Background and aim: Evidence exists for the pathogenic role of the enteric flora in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics contain living microorganisms which exert health effects on the host. We compared the efficacy in maintaining remission of the probiotic preparation Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and established therapy with mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients and methods: In total, 327 patients were recruited and assigned to a double blind, double dummy trial to receive either the probiotic drug 200 mg once daily (n\u200a=\u200a162) or mesalazine 500 mg three times daily (n\u200a=\u200a165). The study lasted for 12 months and patients were assessed by clinical and endoscopic activity indices (Rachmilewitz) as well as by histology. The primary aim of the study was to confirm equivalent efficacy of the two drugs in the prevention of relapses. Results: The per protocol analysis revealed relapses in 40/110 (36.4%) patients in the E coli Nissle 1917 group and 38/112 (33.9%) in the mesalazine group (significant equivalence p\u200a=\u200a0.003). Subgroup analyses showed no differences between the treatment groups in terms of duration and localisation of disease or pretrial treatment. Safety profile and tolerability were very good for both groups and were not different. Conclusions: The probiotic drug E coli Nissle 1917 shows efficacy and safety in maintaining remission equivalent to the gold standard mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. The effectiveness of probiotic treatment further underlines the pathogenetic significance of the enteric flora.",

Probiotics contain living microorganisms which exert health effects on the host. We compared the efficacy in maintaining remission of the probiotic preparation Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and established therapy with mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients and methods: In total, 327 patients were recruited and assigned to a double blind, double dummy trial to receive either the probiotic drug 200 mg once daily (n\u200a=\u200a162) or mesalazine 500 mg three times daily (n\u200a=\u200a165). The study lasted for 12 months and patients were assessed by clinical and endoscopic activity indices (Rachmilewitz) as well as by histology. The primary aim of the study was to confirm equivalent efficacy of the two drugs in the prevention of relapses. Results: The per protocol analysis revealed relapses in 40/110 (36.4%) patients in the E coli Nissle 1917 group and 38/112 (33.9%) in the mesalazine group (significant equivalence p\u200a=\u200a0.003). Subgroup analyses showed no differences between the treatment groups in terms of duration and localisation of disease or pretrial treatment. Safety profile and tolerability were very good for both groups and were not different. Conclusions: The probiotic drug E coli Nissle 1917 shows efficacy and safety in maintaining remission equivalent to the gold standard mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT A genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in Escherichia coli. Colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. The origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. We therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the Enterobacteriaceae by PCR for the presence of this DNA element. The island was detected not only in E. coli but also in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter koseri isolates. It was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. Structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. In E. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of phylogenetic group B2 and inserted at the asnW tRNA locus. Interestingly, in K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, C. koseri, and three E. coli strains of phylogenetic group B1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements ICEEc1 and ICEKp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. Different asn tRNA genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ICE-associated colibactin determinant: asnU in the three E. coli strains of ECOR group B1, and different asn tRNA loci in K. pneumoniae. The detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ICE-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.",

The pks-encoded machinery harbors an atypical essential protein, ClbP. ClbP crystal structure and mutagenesis experiments revealed a serine-active site and original structural features compatible with peptidase activity, which was detected by biochemical assays. Ten ClbP homologs were identified in silico in NRP genomic islands of closely and distantly related bacterial species. All tested ClbP homologs were able to complement a clbP-deficient E. coli mutant. ClbP is therefore a prototype of a new subfamily of extracytoplasmic peptidases probably involved in the maturation of NRP compounds. Such peptidases will be powerful tools for the manipulation of NRP biosynthetic pathways.",

            "abstract": "Precolibactins and colibactins represent a family of natural products that are encoded by the clb gene cluster and are produced by certain commensal, extraintestinal, and probiotic E. coli. clb+ E. coli induce megalocytosis and DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells, but paradoxically, this gene cluster is found in the probiotic Nissle 1917. Evidence suggests precolibactins are converted to genotoxic colibactins by colibactin peptidase (ClbP)-mediated cleavage of an N-acyl-d-Asn side chain, and all isolation efforts have employed \u0394clbP strains to facilitate accumulation of precolibactins. It was hypothesized that colibactins form unsaturated imines that alkylate DNA by cyclopropane ring opening (2 \u2192 3). However, as no colibactins have been isolated, this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Additionally, precolibactins A-C (7-9) contain a pyridone that cannot generate the unsaturated imines that form the basis of this hypothesis. To resolve this, we prepared 13 synthetic colibactin derivatives and evaluated their DNA binding and alkylation activity. We show that unsaturated imines, but not the corresponding pyridone derivatives, potently alkylate DNA. The imine, unsaturated lactam, and cyclopropane are essential for efficient DNA alkylation. A cationic residue enhances activity. These studies suggest that precolibactins containing a pyridone are not responsible for the genotoxicity of the clb cluster. Instead, we propose that these are off-pathway fermentation products produced by a facile double cyclodehydration route that manifests in the absence of viable ClbP. The results presented herein provide a foundation to begin to connect metabolite structure with the disparate phenotypes associated with clb+ E. coli.",

            "abstract": "Precolibactins and colibactins represent a family of natural products that are encoded by the clb gene cluster and are produced by certain commensal, extraintestinal, and probiotic E. coli. clb+ E. coli induce megalocytosis and DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells, but paradoxically, this gene cluster is found in the probiotic Nissle 1917. Evidence suggests precolibactins are converted to genotoxic colibactins by colibactin peptidase (ClbP)-mediated cleavage of an N-acyl-d-Asn side chain, and all isolation efforts have employed \u0394clbP strains to facilitate accumulation of precolibactins. It was hypothesized that colibactins form unsaturated imines that alkylate DNA by cyclopropane ring opening (2 \u2192 3). However, as no colibactins have been isolated, this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Additionally, precolibactins A-C (7-9) contain a pyridone that cannot generate the unsaturated imines that form the basis of this hypothesis. To resolve this, we prepared 13 synthetic colibactin derivatives and evaluated their DNA binding and alkylation activity. We show that unsaturated imines, but not the corresponding pyridone derivatives, potently alkylate DNA. The imine, unsaturated lactam, and cyclopropane are essential for efficient DNA alkylation. A cationic residue enhances activity. These studies suggest that precolibactins containing a pyridone are not responsible for the genotoxicity of the clb cluster. Instead, we propose that these are off-pathway fermentation products produced by a facile double cyclodehydration route that manifests in the absence of viable ClbP. The results presented herein provide a foundation to begin to connect metabolite structure with the disparate phenotypes associated with clb+ E. coli.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Colibactins are hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides produced by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae harboring the pks genomic island. These genotoxic metabolites are produced by pks-encoded peptide-polyketide synthases as inactive prodrugs called precolibactins, which are then converted to colibactins by deacylation for DNA-damaging effects. Colibactins are bona fide virulence factors and are suspected of promoting colorectal carcinogenesis when produced by intestinal E. coli. Natural active colibactins have not been isolated, and how they induce DNA damage in the eukaryotic host cell is poorly characterized. Here, we show that DNA strands are cross-linked covalently when exposed to enterobacteria producing colibactins. DNA cross-linking is abrogated in a clbP mutant unable to deacetylate precolibactins or by adding the colibactin self-resistance protein ClbS, confirming the involvement of the mature forms of colibactins. A similar DNA-damaging mechanism is observed in cellulo, where interstrand cross-links are detected in the genomic DNA of cultured human cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. The intoxicated cells exhibit replication stress, activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and recruitment of the DNA cross-link repair Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) protein. In contrast, inhibition of ATR or knockdown of FANCD2 reduces the survival of cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. These findings demonstrate that DNA interstrand cross-linking is the critical mechanism of colibactin-induced DNA damage in infected cells. IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is the third-most-common cause of cancer death. In addition to known risk factors such as high-fat diets and alcohol consumption, genotoxic intestinal Escherichia coli bacteria producing colibactin are proposed to play a role in colon cancer development. Here, by using transient infections with genotoxic E. coli, we showed that colibactins directly generate DNA cross-links in cellulo. Such lesions are converted into double-strand breaks during the repair response. DNA cross-links, akin to those induced by metabolites of alcohol and high-fat diets and by widely used anticancer drugs, are both severely mutagenic and profoundly cytotoxic lesions. This finding of a direct induction of DNA cross-links by a bacterium should facilitate delineating the role of E. coli in colon cancer and engineering new anticancer agents.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Colibactins are hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides produced by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae harboring the pks genomic island. These genotoxic metabolites are produced by pks-encoded peptide-polyketide synthases as inactive prodrugs called precolibactins, which are then converted to colibactins by deacylation for DNA-damaging effects. Colibactins are bona fide virulence factors and are suspected of promoting colorectal carcinogenesis when produced by intestinal E. coli. Natural active colibactins have not been isolated, and how they induce DNA damage in the eukaryotic host cell is poorly characterized. Here, we show that DNA strands are cross-linked covalently when exposed to enterobacteria producing colibactins. DNA cross-linking is abrogated in a clbP mutant unable to deacetylate precolibactins or by adding the colibactin self-resistance protein ClbS, confirming the involvement of the mature forms of colibactins. A similar DNA-damaging mechanism is observed in cellulo, where interstrand cross-links are detected in the genomic DNA of cultured human cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. The intoxicated cells exhibit replication stress, activation of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and recruitment of the DNA cross-link repair Fanconi anemia protein D2 (FANCD2) protein. In contrast, inhibition of ATR or knockdown of FANCD2 reduces the survival of cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. These findings demonstrate that DNA interstrand cross-linking is the critical mechanism of colibactin-induced DNA damage in infected cells. IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is the third-most-common cause of cancer death. In addition to known risk factors such as high-fat diets and alcohol consumption, genotoxic intestinal Escherichia coli bacteria producing colibactin are proposed to play a role in colon cancer development. Here, by using transient infections with genotoxic E. coli, we showed that colibactins directly generate DNA cross-links in cellulo. Such lesions are converted into double-strand breaks during the repair response. DNA cross-links, akin to those induced by metabolites of alcohol and high-fat diets and by widely used anticancer drugs, are both severely mutagenic and profoundly cytotoxic lesions. This finding of a direct induction of DNA cross-links by a bacterium should facilitate delineating the role of E. coli in colon cancer and engineering new anticancer agents.

            "abstract": "Bacterial warhead targets DNA The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane \u201cwarhead\u201d breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli. Science, this issue p. eaar7785; see also p. 689 DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin. INTRODUCTION Members of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin\u2019s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association. RATIONALE Over the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin\u2019s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin\u2019s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli. RESULTS Using untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\u2013based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli\u2013mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin\u2019s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal. CONCLUSION Our results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin. (Top) The cyclopropane ring found in pks-dependent metabolites led us to hypothesize that colibactin alkylates DNA. Me, methyl.

            "abstract": "Bacterial warhead targets DNA The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane \u201cwarhead\u201d breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli. Science, this issue p. eaar7785; see also p. 689 DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin. INTRODUCTION Members of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin\u2019s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association. RATIONALE Over the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin\u2019s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin\u2019s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli. RESULTS Using untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\u2013based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli\u2013mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin\u2019s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal. CONCLUSION Our results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans.

            "abstract": "Bacterial warhead targets DNA The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane \u201cwarhead\u201d breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli. Science, this issue p. eaar7785; see also p. 689 DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin. INTRODUCTION Members of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin\u2019s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association. RATIONALE Over the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin\u2019s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin\u2019s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli. RESULTS Using untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\u2013based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli\u2013mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin\u2019s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal. CONCLUSION Our results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin.

(Bottom) Untargeted DNA adductomics revealed colibactin-derived DNA adducts in human cells exposed to colibactin-producing E. coli. These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer. Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin\u2019s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Bacterial warhead targets DNA The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane \u201cwarhead\u201d breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli. Science, this issue p. eaar7785; see also p. 689 DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin. INTRODUCTION Members of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin\u2019s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association. RATIONALE Over the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin\u2019s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin\u2019s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli. RESULTS Using untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\u2013based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli\u2013mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin\u2019s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal. CONCLUSION Our results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin.

(Bottom) Untargeted DNA adductomics revealed colibactin-derived DNA adducts in human cells exposed to colibactin-producing E. coli. These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer. Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin\u2019s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Bacterial warhead targets DNA The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane \u201cwarhead\u201d breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli. Science, this issue p. eaar7785; see also p. 689 DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin. INTRODUCTION Members of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin\u2019s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association. RATIONALE Over the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin\u2019s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin\u2019s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli. RESULTS Using untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\u2013based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli\u2013mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin\u2019s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal. CONCLUSION Our results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin.

These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer. Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin\u2019s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Bacterial warhead targets DNA The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane \u201cwarhead\u201d breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli. Science, this issue p. eaar7785; see also p. 689 DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin. INTRODUCTION Members of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin\u2019s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association. RATIONALE Over the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin\u2019s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin\u2019s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli. RESULTS Using untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\u2013based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli\u2013mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin\u2019s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal. CONCLUSION Our results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin. (Top) The cyclopropane ring found in pks-dependent metabolites led us to hypothesize that colibactin alkylates DNA. Me, methyl. (Bottom) Untargeted DNA adductomics revealed colibactin-derived DNA adducts in human cells exposed to colibactin-producing E. coli. These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer. Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin\u2019s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Extraintestinal pathologies caused by highly virulent strains of E. coli amount to clinical implications with high morbidity and mortality rates. Pathogenic E. coli strains are evolving with the horizontal acquisition of mobile genetic elements, including pathogenicity islands such as the pks island, which produces the genotoxin colibactin, resulting in severe clinical outcomes, including colorectal cancer progression. ABSTRACT The genotoxin colibactin is a secondary metabolite produced by the polyketide synthase (pks) island harbored by extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae that has been increasingly reported to have critical implications in human health. The present study entails a high-throughput whole-genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis of such pathogenic E. coli isolates to gain insights into the patterns of distribution, horizontal transmission, and evolution of the island. For the current study, 23 pks-positive ExPEC genomes were newly sequenced, and their virulome and resistome profiles indicated a preponderance of virulence encoding genes and a reduced number of genes for antimicrobial resistance. In addition, 4,090 E. coli genomes from the public domain were also analyzed for large-scale screening for pks-positive genomes, out of which a total of 530 pks-positive genomes were studied to understand the subtype-based distribution pattern(s). The pks island showed a significant association with the B2 phylogroup (82.2%) and a high prevalence in sequence type 73 (ST73; n\u2009=\u2009179) and ST95 (n\u2009=\u2009110) and the O6:H1 (n\u2009=\u2009110) serotype. Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogeny of the core genome and intergenic regions (IGRs) of the ST95 model data set, which was selected because it had both pks-positive and pks-negative genomes, displayed clustering in relation to their carriage of the pks island. Prevalence patterns of genes encoding RM systems in the pks-positive and pks-negative genomes were also analyzed to determine their potential role in pks island acquisition and the maintenance capability of the genomes. Further, the maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on the core genome and pks island sequences from 247 genomes with an intact pks island demonstrated horizontal gene transfer of the island across sequence types and serotypes, with few exceptions. This study vitally contributes to understanding of the lineages and subtypes that have a higher propensity to harbor the pks island-encoded genotoxin with possible clinical implications.
