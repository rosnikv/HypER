            "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for recurrent hepatitis C after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We therefore performed two randomized, controlled trials\u2014a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial\u2014to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a in patients who had undergone OLT. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 54 patients within 3 weeks after OLT, and the treatment trial enrolled 67 patients 6 to 60 months after OLT. In each trial, patients were randomized to treatment with once weekly injections of 180 \u03bcg peginterferon alfa\u20102a or no antiviral treatment for 48 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks thereafter. Peginterferon alfa\u20102a treated patients had significantly lower hepatitis C virus RNA levels and more favorable changes in hepatic histological features compared with untreated controls. However, only 2 treated patients in the prophylaxis trial (8%) and 3 in the treatment trial (12%) achieved a sustained virological response. In the prophylaxis trial, 8 patients (31%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 9 (32%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely; whereas in the treatment trial, 10 patients (30%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 6 (19%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely. The incidence of acute rejection was similar in the treated and untreated groups in both the prophylaxis (12% vs. 21%; P = .5) and treatment (12% vs. 0%; P = .1) trials. In conclusion, peginterferon alfa\u20102a treatment for 48 weeks is safe and tolerable and offers some efficacy in the post\u2010OLT setting. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients who have undergone OLT. (HEPATOLOGY 2005;41:289\u2013298.)",

We therefore performed two randomized, controlled trials\u2014a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial\u2014to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a in patients who had undergone OLT. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 54 patients within 3 weeks after OLT, and the treatment trial enrolled 67 patients 6 to 60 months after OLT. In each trial, patients were randomized to treatment with once weekly injections of 180 \u03bcg peginterferon alfa\u20102a or no antiviral treatment for 48 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks thereafter. Peginterferon alfa\u20102a treated patients had significantly lower hepatitis C virus RNA levels and more favorable changes in hepatic histological features compared with untreated controls. However, only 2 treated patients in the prophylaxis trial (8%) and 3 in the treatment trial (12%) achieved a sustained virological response. In the prophylaxis trial, 8 patients (31%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 9 (32%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely; whereas in the treatment trial, 10 patients (30%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 6 (19%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely. The incidence of acute rejection was similar in the treated and untreated groups in both the prophylaxis (12% vs. 21%; P = .5) and treatment (12% vs. 0%; P = .1) trials. In conclusion, peginterferon alfa\u20102a treatment for 48 weeks is safe and tolerable and offers some efficacy in the post\u2010OLT setting.

            "abstract": "Hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) is universal, and frequently leads to cirrhosis and death. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 48\u2010weeks of full\u2010dose peg\u2010interferon\u2010\u03b1\u20102a (n = 4) or \u03b1\u20102b (n = 51) plus ribavirin (>11 mg/kg/day) in a multicentric cohort of 55 patients \u226512 months after LT. All subjects had histologically proven HCV recurrence, excluding severe cholestatic recurrence. Mean age was 54.3 \u00b1 9.7, 77% male, 90.9% genotype 1, 32.7% cirrhotics. All but 5 patients received monotherapy with tacrolimus (54.5%), cyclosporine (30.7%) or mycophenolate mofetil (5.5%). The rates of end\u2010of\u2010treatment response and sustained virological response (SVR) were 66.7% and 43.6%, respectively. Low baseline HCV\u2010RNA (p = 0.005) and a length from LT to therapy between 2\u20134 years (p = 0.011) were predictors of SVR. The lack of achieving a viral load decrease \u22651\u2010log10 at week 4 and/or 2\u2010log10 at week 12 was 100% predictive of failure. The most frequent side effects were neutropenia (76,4%), anemia (60%) and infectious complications (30.9%). Toxicity led to peg\u2010interferon withdrawal in 16 (29%) subjects. In 15 patients with post\u2010treatment biopsy, the histological activity index was significantly improved (p = 0.006), whereas fibrosis did not change (p = 0.14). Three patients died (cholangitis, hepatic artery thrombosis and lung cancer). In conclusion, HCV therapy after LT was very effective, although it led to a significant rate of toxicity.",

            "abstract": "Hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) is universal, and frequently leads to cirrhosis and death. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 48\u2010weeks of full\u2010dose peg\u2010interferon\u2010\u03b1\u20102a (n = 4) or \u03b1\u20102b (n = 51) plus ribavirin (>11 mg/kg/day) in a multicentric cohort of 55 patients \u226512 months after LT. All subjects had histologically proven HCV recurrence, excluding severe cholestatic recurrence. Mean age was 54.3 \u00b1 9.7, 77% male, 90.9% genotype 1, 32.7% cirrhotics. All but 5 patients received monotherapy with tacrolimus (54.5%), cyclosporine (30.7%) or mycophenolate mofetil (5.5%). The rates of end\u2010of\u2010treatment response and sustained virological response (SVR) were 66.7% and 43.6%, respectively. Low baseline HCV\u2010RNA (p = 0.005) and a length from LT to therapy between 2\u20134 years (p = 0.011) were predictors of SVR. The lack of achieving a viral load decrease \u22651\u2010log10 at week 4 and/or 2\u2010log10 at week 12 was 100% predictive of failure. The most frequent side effects were neutropenia (76,4%), anemia (60%) and infectious complications (30.9%). Toxicity led to peg\u2010interferon withdrawal in 16 (29%) subjects. In 15 patients with post\u2010treatment biopsy, the histological activity index was significantly improved (p = 0.006), whereas fibrosis did not change (p = 0.14). Three patients died (cholangitis, hepatic artery thrombosis and lung cancer). In conclusion, HCV therapy after LT was very effective, although it led to a significant rate of toxicity.",

We evaluated the effect of antiviral therapy on disease progression in 81 HCV-infected liver transplantation recipients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with mild hepatitis C recurrence (fibrosis stage F0 to F2, n = 54) were randomized to no treatment (group A, n = 27) or peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin for 48 weeks (group B, n = 27). Patients with severe recurrence (F3 to F4, cholestatic hepatitis) were treated (group C, n = 27). All patients (n = 81) underwent a liver biopsy at baseline and after follow-up; paired hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements were available in 51 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen (48%) patients of group B and 5 (18.5%) of group C achieved sustained virological response. Liver fibrosis progressed > or =1 stage in 40 (49%) of 81 patients: 19 (70%) of group A versus 7 (26%) of group B (P = .001) and in 14 (54%) of group C. HVPG increased (6.5 to 13 mm Hg, P < .01) in patients in whom fibrosis worsened, whereas it decreased (5 to 3.5 mm Hg, P = .017) or remained unchanged in those with fibrosis improvement or stabilization, respectively. The only variable independently associated with fibrosis improvement/stabilization was treatment (odds ratio [OR] =3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 10, P = .009). Among treated patients, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization and viral clearance were independently associated with histological or hemodynamic improvement/stabilization (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 18, P < .01; OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 38, P = .01; respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data demonstrate that in liver transplantation recipients, antiviral therapy slows disease progression (particularly in sustained virological responders), as shown by its effects on liver histology and on HVPG.",

            "abstract": "Pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin eradicates hepatitis C virus (HCV) in one third of liver recipients with recurrent disease. Side effects are frequent and potentially life threatening. Our aim was to define the long\u2010term benefits of antiviral therapy in recurrent HCV. Eighty\u2010nine (89) recipients (genotype 1: 86.5%) were treated with IFN (n = 31) or pegIFN (n = 58) plus ribavirin and 75 untreated contemporaneous disease\u2010matched controls. The major end point was survival from transplantation. Survival, progression to cirrhosis and clinical decompensation since start of therapy were compared between sustained virologic responders (SVRs) and nonresponders (NRs). Results revealed 44 patients died during the follow\u2010up (20% treated vs. 35% controls; p = 0.05). Patient survival was higher in treated compared to controls (7 years: 74% vs. 62%; p = 0.04). Among treated patients, an SVR was achieved in 37% (IFN 16% vs. peg\u2010IFN 48%; p = 0.03). About 2/33 SVRs and 16/56 NRs died (p = 0.01) due to HCV\u2010disease (56%), IFN\u2010induced rejection (11%), both causes (11%) or others (22%). Five\u2010year survival was greater in SVRs than in NRs (93% vs. 69%, p = 0.032). In patients without baseline cirrhosis, progression to cirrhosis occurred more frequently in NRs (27/42 vs. 6/16; p = 0.06). The 5\u2010year risk of graft decompensation was higher in NRs (33% vs. 16%; p = 0.04). Antiviral therapy is associated with improved long\u2010term outcome in recurrent HCV.",

Side effects are frequent and potentially life threatening. Our aim was to define the long\u2010term benefits of antiviral therapy in recurrent HCV. Eighty\u2010nine (89) recipients (genotype 1: 86.5%) were treated with IFN (n = 31) or pegIFN (n = 58) plus ribavirin and 75 untreated contemporaneous disease\u2010matched controls. The major end point was survival from transplantation. Survival, progression to cirrhosis and clinical decompensation since start of therapy were compared between sustained virologic responders (SVRs) and nonresponders (NRs). Results revealed 44 patients died during the follow\u2010up (20% treated vs. 35% controls; p = 0.05). Patient survival was higher in treated compared to controls (7 years: 74% vs. 62%; p = 0.04). Among treated patients, an SVR was achieved in 37% (IFN 16% vs. peg\u2010IFN 48%; p = 0.03). About 2/33 SVRs and 16/56 NRs died (p = 0.01) due to HCV\u2010disease (56%), IFN\u2010induced rejection (11%), both causes (11%) or others (22%). Five\u2010year survival was greater in SVRs than in NRs (93% vs. 69%, p = 0.032). In patients without baseline cirrhosis, progression to cirrhosis occurred more frequently in NRs (27/42 vs. 6/16; p = 0.06). The 5\u2010year risk of graft decompensation was higher in NRs (33% vs. 16%; p = 0.04). Antiviral therapy is associated with improved long\u2010term outcome in recurrent HCV.",

The objective of this study was to determine the most cost\u2010effective timing for pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy in patients with advanced liver disease infected with genotype 1 HCV. A Markov model was constructed to compare treatment strategies: (1) no treatment, (2) antiviral therapy in patients with compensated cirrhosis, (3) antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and (4) antiviral therapy in patients with progressive fibrosis due to recurrent HCV post\u2010transplantation. Outcomes of interest included the total cost per patient, number of quality\u2010adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, cost per QALY saved, number of deaths and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and number of transplants required. Compared to the no\u2013antiviral treatment strategy, treatment during compensated cirrhosis increased QALYs by 0.950 and saved $55,314. Treatment during decompensated cirrhosis increased QALYs by 0.044 and saved $5511. Treatment during posttransplant advanced recurrence increased QALYs by 0.061 and saved $3223. Treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis resulted in 119 fewer deaths, 54 fewer HCCs, and 66 fewer transplants with respect to the no\u2010treatment strategy. The model was sensitive to the rate of graft failure in patients with and without sustained virological response. The model was otherwise robust to all variables tested in sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis was found to be the most cost\u2010effective strategy and resulted in improved survival and decreased cost in comparison with all other strategies.

Outcomes of interest included the total cost per patient, number of quality\u2010adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, cost per QALY saved, number of deaths and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and number of transplants required. Compared to the no\u2013antiviral treatment strategy, treatment during compensated cirrhosis increased QALYs by 0.950 and saved $55,314. Treatment during decompensated cirrhosis increased QALYs by 0.044 and saved $5511. Treatment during posttransplant advanced recurrence increased QALYs by 0.061 and saved $3223. Treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis resulted in 119 fewer deaths, 54 fewer HCCs, and 66 fewer transplants with respect to the no\u2010treatment strategy. The model was sensitive to the rate of graft failure in patients with and without sustained virological response. The model was otherwise robust to all variables tested in sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis was found to be the most cost\u2010effective strategy and resulted in improved survival and decreased cost in comparison with all other strategies. This study provides pharmacoeconomic evidence in support of treating HCV in patients with compensated cirrhosis before progression to more advanced liver disease.

Here, cost\u2010effectiveness of antiviral therapy was assessed. A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression and calculate outcome and costs of treatment. In the baseline analysis, Peg\u2010IFN/RBV treatment prevented organ loss/death, gained quality\u2010adjusted life\u2010years (QALYs) and undercut the limit of cost\u2010effectiveness of \u20ac50 000/QALY with an incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio of approximately \u20ac40 400/QALY and \u20ac21 000/QALY for HCV genotype 1 and 2/3 patients, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis testing modified model parameters according to extreme data described in the literature confirmed cost\u2010effectiveness for a lower or higher rate of fibrosis progression, increased non\u2010HCV\u2010related mortality, lower limits of utilities, a time horizon of 30 years, and additional costs in the year of death. On the other hand, cost\u2010effectiveness was lost for patients with genotype 1 in case of doubled antiviral or life\u2010time costs or an increased discount rate of 7%. New treatment strategies for HCV genotype 1 infected patients remained on the same level cost\u2010effective, if additional costs did not exceed \u20ac10 774 per 10% sustained virologic response gain.

            "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the most common indication for liver transplantation (LT). Aggressive treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection before cirrhosis development or decompensation may reduce LT need and risk of HCV recurrence post-LT. Factors associated with increased HCV risk or severity of recurrence include older age, immunosuppression, HCV genotype 1 and high viral load at LT. HCV recurrence post-LT leads to accelerated liver disease and cirrhosis development with reduced graft and patient survival. Currently, interferon (IFN)-based regimens can be used in dual-agent regimens with ribavirin, in triple-agent antiviral strategies with direct-acting antivirals (e.g., protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir), or before transplant in compensated patients to reduce HCV viral load to prevent or reduce the risk of post-LT recurrence and complications; they cannot be used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. IFN-based regimens are used in less than half of HCV-infected patients waiting for LT due to extremely low efficacy and poor tolerability. However, antiviral therapy is indicated after LT in patients with histologically confirmed CHC despite tolerability issues. Improvements in side effect management have increased survival in patients achieving therapeutic targets. HCV treatment pre- and post-LT results in significant health care costs especially when lack of efficacy leads to disease worsening, although studies have shown sofosbuvir treatment before LT vs conventional post-LT dual antiviral is cost effective. The suboptimal efficacy and tolerability of IFN-based therapies, plus the significant economic burden, means the need for effective and well tolerated IFN-free anti-HCV therapy for pre- and post-LT remains high.",

Factors associated with increased HCV risk or severity of recurrence include older age, immunosuppression, HCV genotype 1 and high viral load at LT. HCV recurrence post-LT leads to accelerated liver disease and cirrhosis development with reduced graft and patient survival. Currently, interferon (IFN)-based regimens can be used in dual-agent regimens with ribavirin, in triple-agent antiviral strategies with direct-acting antivirals (e.g., protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir), or before transplant in compensated patients to reduce HCV viral load to prevent or reduce the risk of post-LT recurrence and complications; they cannot be used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. IFN-based regimens are used in less than half of HCV-infected patients waiting for LT due to extremely low efficacy and poor tolerability. However, antiviral therapy is indicated after LT in patients with histologically confirmed CHC despite tolerability issues. Improvements in side effect management have increased survival in patients achieving therapeutic targets. HCV treatment pre- and post-LT results in significant health care costs especially when lack of efficacy leads to disease worsening, although studies have shown sofosbuvir treatment before LT vs conventional post-LT dual antiviral is cost effective. The suboptimal efficacy and tolerability of IFN-based therapies, plus the significant economic burden, means the need for effective and well tolerated IFN-free anti-HCV therapy for pre- and post-LT remains high.",

            "abstract": "Background The efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) depends on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 (GT4) subtype which are used in the treatment of HCV. We aimed to retrospectively investigate the baseline prevalence of HCV NS5A and NS5B polymorphisms and their impact on virological outcome in GT4-infected patients treated with various DAA regimens. Patients and methods Available plasma samples from HCV GT4-infected patients treated with different DAA regimens were analyzed at baseline and after treatment failure, where applicable. Sanger sequencing of patient-derived NS5A and NS5B regions was performed on all available samples, while ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) of NS5A and NS5B regions was performed only on samples from treatment failures at different time points. Results Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved by 96% (48/50) of patients. Of 16 patients with baseline NS5A sequence, polymorphisms at amino acid positions associated with drug resistance were detected only at position 58: P58 (69.2%) and T58 (30.8%). Of 21 patients with baseline NS5B sequence, N142S was detected only in the two treatment failures, both with GT4d were treated with sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens, suggesting a potential involvement in SOF efficacy. Two patients (patient 1 [Pt1] and patient 2 [Pt2]) relapsed. In Pt1, NS5A-T56I and NS5A-Y93H/S emerged. In Pt2, NS5A-L28F emerged and a novel NS5B resistance-associated substitution (RAS), L204F, representing 1.5% of the viral population at baseline, enriched to 71% and 91.6% during and after treatment failure, respectively. UDPS of NS5B from Pt2 indicated a mixed infection of approximately 1:5, GT1a:GT4d, at baseline and GT4d during failure. Phylogenetic analysis of NS5A sequences indicated no clustering of HCV strains from patients achieving SVR vs patients who relapsed. The mean genetic distance in NS5A sequences was 5.8%, while a lower genetic distance (3.1%) was observed in NS5B sequences. Conclusion Results from these analyses confirm the importance of UDPS in the analysis of viral quasispecies variability and the identification of novel RASs potentially associated with DAA treatment failure in HCV GT4-infected patients.",
