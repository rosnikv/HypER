            "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether a short course of prednisolone is superior to placebo for improving pain, function, and range of motion in adhesive capsulitis. Design: Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. Setting: Community based rheumatology practice in Australia. Participants: 50 participants (24 active, 26 placebo); 46 completed the 12 week protocol. Entry criteria were age \u2a7e18 years, pain and stiffness in predominantly one shoulder for \u2a7e3 weeks, and restriction of passive motion by >30\u00b0 in two or more planes. Interventions: 30 mg oral prednisolone/day for three weeks or placebo. Main outcome measures: Overall, night, and activity related pain, SPADI, Croft shoulder disability questionnaire, DASH, HAQ, SF-36, participant rated improvement, and range of active motion measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Results: At 3 weeks, there was greater improvement in overall pain in the prednisolone group than in the placebo group (mean (SD) change from baseline, 4.1 (2.3) v 1.4 (2.3); adjusted difference in mean change between the two groups, 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.8)). There was also greater improvement in disability, range of active motion, and participant rated improvement (marked or moderate overall improvement in 22/23 v 11/23; RR\u200a=\u200a2 (1.3 to 3.1), p\u200a=\u200a0.001). At 6 weeks the analysis favoured the prednisolone group for most outcomes but none of the differences was significant. At 12 weeks, the analysis tended to favour the placebo group. Conclusions: A three week course of 30 mg prednisolone daily is of significant short term benefit in adhesive capsulitis but benefits are not maintained beyond six weeks.",

            "abstract": "Background: Adhesive capsulitis often is difficult to diagnose in its early stage and to differentiate from other commonly seen shoulder disorders with the potential to cause pain and limited range of movement. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to establish consensus among a group of experts regarding the clinical identifiers for the first or early stage of primary (idiopathic) adhesive capsulitis. Design: A correspondence-based Delphi technique was used in this study. Methods: Three sequential questionnaires, each building on the results of the previous round, were used to establish consensus. Results: A total of 70 experts from Australia and New Zealand involved in the diagnosis and treatment of adhesive capsulitis completed the 3 rounds of questionnaires. Following round 3, descriptive statistics were used to screen the data into a meaningful subset. Cronbach alpha and factor analysis then were used to determine agreement among the experts. Consensus was achieved on 8 clinical identifiers. These identifiers clustered into 2 discrete domains of pain and movement. For pain, the clinical identifiers were a strong component of night pain, pain with rapid or unguarded movement, discomfort lying on the affected shoulder, and pain easily aggravated by movement. For movement, the clinical identifiers included a global loss of active and passive range of movement, with pain at the end-range in all directions. Onset of the disorder was at greater than 35 years of age. Conclusions: This is the first study to use the Delphi technique to establish clinical identifiers indicative of the early stage of primary (idiopathic) adhesive capsulitis. Although limited in differential diagnostic ability, these identifiers may assist the clinician in recognizing early-stage adhesive capsulitis and may inform management, as well as facilitate future research.",

            "abstract": "Background: Adhesive capsulitis often is difficult to diagnose in its early stage and to differentiate from other commonly seen shoulder disorders with the potential to cause pain and limited range of movement. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to establish consensus among a group of experts regarding the clinical identifiers for the first or early stage of primary (idiopathic) adhesive capsulitis. Design: A correspondence-based Delphi technique was used in this study. Methods: Three sequential questionnaires, each building on the results of the previous round, were used to establish consensus. Results: A total of 70 experts from Australia and New Zealand involved in the diagnosis and treatment of adhesive capsulitis completed the 3 rounds of questionnaires. Following round 3, descriptive statistics were used to screen the data into a meaningful subset. Cronbach alpha and factor analysis then were used to determine agreement among the experts. Consensus was achieved on 8 clinical identifiers. These identifiers clustered into 2 discrete domains of pain and movement. For pain, the clinical identifiers were a strong component of night pain, pain with rapid or unguarded movement, discomfort lying on the affected shoulder, and pain easily aggravated by movement. For movement, the clinical identifiers included a global loss of active and passive range of movement, with pain at the end-range in all directions. Onset of the disorder was at greater than 35 years of age. Conclusions: This is the first study to use the Delphi technique to establish clinical identifiers indicative of the early stage of primary (idiopathic) adhesive capsulitis. Although limited in differential diagnostic ability, these identifiers may assist the clinician in recognizing early-stage adhesive capsulitis and may inform management, as well as facilitate future research.",

Throughout the study clinicand home-based adherence were measured, and at the end participants completed questionnaires evaluating the HAPA volitional variables (maintenance and recovery self-efficacy, and adherence), knowledge and shoulder function.
