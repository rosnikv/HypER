            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD.",

            "abstract": "We report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated with interstitial pneumonia that deteriorated after the administration of abatacept. A 55-year-old man developed RA and interstitial pneumonia. Although interstitial pneumonia was improved by high-dose glucocorticoids, various disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including infliximab were ineffective for his arthritis. Tacrolimus was effective but was discontinued due to refractory itching and diarrhea. After 2 months, he was registered on the Phase III trial of abatacept in Japan because of worsening of arthritis. From 2 days after the abatacept administration, frothy sputum frequently appeared, but sputum culture was negative. On 13 days after the administration, the interstitial shadow was deteriorated by chest CT as compared with that of 2 months before, and he was dropped out from the trial. On 27 days after the administration, the dose of prednisolone was increased from 2 to 10 mg/day for his arthritis. On 44 days after the administration, the interstitial pneumonia improved. Abatacpet might be the cause of the deterioration of the interstitial pneumonia, but other possibilities such as discontinuation of tacrolimus, flare-up of RA itself or viral infection should be considered. This is the first report of deteriorated interstitial pneumonia after the abatacept administration in the literature. Further cases are needed to identify the relation between abatacept and interstitial pneumonia, however this possibility should be always kept in mind when we use abatacept.",

Accompanying the increased number of reports on the development or exacerbation of ILD in RA patients following therapy with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) has aroused renewed interest. Although such cases have been reported mainly in association with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the use of other biological DMARDs has also become a matter of concern. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between the use of biological DMARDs and either the development or exacerbation of ILD. Such pulmonary complications may occur in the natural course of RA regardless of the use of biological DMARDs. Since rheumatologists currently aim to achieve remission in RA patients, the administration of biological DMARDs is increasing, even for those with RA-ILD. However, there are no reliable, evidence-based guidelines for deciding whether biological DMARDs can be safely introduced and continued in RA-ILD patients. A standardized staging system for pulmonary conditions of RA-ILD patients is needed when making therapeutic decisions at baseline and monitoring during biological DMARD therapy. Based on the available information regarding the safety of biological DMARDs and the predictive factors for a worse prognosis, this review discusses candidate parameters for risk evaluation of ILD in RA patients who are scheduled to receive biological antirheumatic therapy.",

In CTDs, acute respiratory events may be related to any respiratory compartment including the airways, lung parenchyma, alveolar capillaries, lung vessels, pleura, and ventilatory muscles. Acute respiratory events may also precipitate disease-specific extrapulmonary organ involvement such as aspiration pneumonia and lead to digestive tract involvement and heart-related respiratory events. Finally, antirheumatic drug-related acute respiratory toxicity as well as lung infections related to the rheumatic disease and/or to immunosuppression complete the spectrum of acute respiratory events. Overall, in CTDs the lungs significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality, since they constitute a common site of disease involvement; a major site of infections related to the \u2018mater' disease; a major site of drug-related toxicity, and a common site of treatment-related infectious complications. The extreme spectrum of the abovementioned events, as well as the \u2018vicious' coexistence of most of the aforementioned manifestations, requires skills, specific diagnostic and therapeutic means, and most of all a multidisciplinary approach of adequately prepared and expert scientists. Avoiding lung disease might represent a major concern for future advancements in the treatment of autoimmune disorders.",

Methods A single-center retrospective study of 58 rheumatic patients who were admitted to ICU due to suspected pneumonia with acute respiratory failure if they underwent both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen mNGS and combined microbiological tests (CMTs) was conducted to compare their diagnostic performance, using clinical composite diagnosis as the gold standard. Treatment modifications based on mNGS results were also reviewed. Results Forty-three patients were diagnosed with microbiologically confirmed pneumonia and 15 were considered as a non-infectious disease. mNGS outperformed CMTs in the accurate diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious lung infiltration (98.1% [57/58] vs. 87.9% [51/58], P = 0.031). A total of 94 causative pathogens were defined by the gold standard and 27 patients had polymicrobial pneumonia. The sensitivity of pathogen detection and complete concordance with the gold standard by mNGS exceeded those by CMTs (92.6% [87/94] vs. 76.6% [72/94], P < 0.001 and 72.1% [31/43] vs. 51.2% [22/43], P = 0.004, respectively). Moreover, 22 pathogens were detected only by mNGS and confirmed by orthogonal test. Accordingly, the etiological diagnosis changed in 19 cases, and the empirical treatment improved in 14 cases, including 8 cases of rescue treatment and 11 of antibiotics de-escalation. At the pathogen-type level, both methods were comparable for bacteria, but mNGS was advantageous to identify viruses (accuracy: 100% vs. 81%, P = 0.004). For Pneumocystis jirovecii detection, mNGS improved the sensitivity compared with Gomori\u2019s methenamine silver stain (91.7% vs. 4.2%, P < 0.001) and was higher than polymerase chain reaction (79.2%), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.289). In terms of Aspergillus, the better sensitivity with a combination of culture and galactomannan test than that with mNGS was found (100% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.033). Conclusions mNGS has an excellent accuracy in etiological diagnosis and pathogen detection of suspected pneumonia in critically rheumatic patients, which has potential significance for clinical decision-making. Its superiority to different types of pathogens depends on the comprehensiveness of CMTs.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The identification of Aspergillus by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of nucleic acid extraction. The objective of this study was to determine whether mNGS could provide an accurate and efficient method for detecting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in immunocompromised patients (ICP). Methods A total of 133 ICP admitted to the ICU between January 2020 and September 2022 were enrolled in the study, of which 46 were diagnosed with IPA and 87 were non-IPA cases. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed for the presence of Aspergillosis and other co-pathogens using mNGS, and its diagnostic performance was compared to conventional microbial tests (CMTs) that included smear, cultures, serum and BALF galactomannan (GM) test. Clinical composite diagnosis was used as the reference standard Results mNGS had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 82.6%, 97.7%, and 92.5%, respectively, in diagnosing IPA. These findings were comparable to those of the combination of multiple CMTs. Interestingly, the sensitivity of mNGS was superior to that of any single CMT method, as demonstrated by comparisons with smears (8.7%, P < 0.001), culture (39.1%, P < 0.001), serum GM (23.9%, P < 0.001) and BALF GM (69.6%, P = 0.031). mNGS was capable of accurately distinguish strains of Aspergillus genus, with a consistency of 77.8% with culture. Furthermore, mNGS also identified A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terrestris, A. oryzae and Mucor spp. in culture-negative cases. The sequencing reads of Aspergillus by mNGS exhibited extensive variation, ranging from 11 to1702. A positive correlation was observed between the optical density index of BALF GM and unique reads by mNGS (r = 0.607, P = 0.001) in BALF-GM positive patients. Notably, mNGS was able to diagnose 35 out of 37 cases with mixed infection, with P. jirovecii and cytomegalovirus being the most common co-pathogens. Conclusions mNGS presents a feasible and remarkably sensitive approach for detecting Aspergillus in ICP, thereby serving as a valuable adjunctive tool to CMT. Furthermore, mNGS\u2019s ability to accurately identify fungal species and co-pathogens can assist in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy.",
