            "abstract": "A survey in general practice1 has shown that 90% of patients with previously identified coronary heart disease have at least one and usually two or more lifestyle related cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. These risk factors are likely to have contributed to their heart disease and, following a myocardial infarction (MI), may inhibit recovery and increase the chance of reinfarction. It is easy to be unduly pessimistic about lifestyle change. Many people change their lifestyle for health reasons. There are more ex-smokers than smokers in the UK and most of these ex-smokers stopped without professional help. On the other hand a sizeable proportion of the population are aware of the dangers of a high fat diet without apparently being either willing or able to do much about it.\n\nIt has been know for some time that many smokers stop smoking after an MI; perhaps as many as 45% of patients, which is between two and four times the success rate of antismoking clinics for the public in general. However the position is less satisfactory for other risk factors. Patients might become less active after an MI (partly because of the consequent physical impairments and change in work patterns). While there is some evidence that patients reduce self reported saturated fat intake in the year following an MI these changes can be small and are often not reflected in changes in lipid levels. Despite this, immediately after an MI is a good time to attempt to change behaviour. People change their behaviour because of some significant change in their life or their thinking. An MI is for most patients a major life threatening event that \u2026",

Out of 144 eligible male patients recently treated with percantaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 132 were randomized into this study. All interventions covered a 12-month active intervention, intense during the first months and subsequently leveled out. Main assessments were performed before randomization and after the intervention. Patients offered behavioral rehabilitation showed improved selfreported healthy diet habits and exercise frequency, and higher internal locus of control. Although blood lipids, exercise capacity, body mass, anxiety, depression, and Type A scores were changed in the expected direction, no significant difference emerged between active intervention and the standard care condition. Standard care of today appears to have great potential in particular if supplemented with some kind of stress management.",

Patients recently treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized to an intervention with an aggressive focus on lifestyle changes (smoking, diet, exercise, and stress; n=46) or to a standard-care control group (n=42). Results showed that the intervention group had significantly larger overall lifestyle changes than the control group after 12, 24, 36, and 60 months. The intervention group had significantly lower rates of all coronary events (acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, PCI, cardiac death; 30.4% vs. 53.7%), and of cardiovascular mortality (2.2% vs. 14.6%). The need for future large-scale and long-term evaluations of lifestyle-oriented secondary prevention interventions of this kind is emphasized.",

The authors compared psychological distress, anger, hostility, and perceived social support by group (intervention group, n = 28; control group, n = 20) and time (baseline, 1 year, 5 years) and examined the relationships of lifestyle changes to cardiac variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReductions in psychological distress and hostility in the experimental group (compared with controls) were observed after 1 year (p < .05). By 5 years, improvements in hostility tended to be maintained relative to the control group, but reductions in psychological distress were reported only by experimental patients with very high 5-year program adherence. Improvements in diet were related to weight reduction and decreases in percent diameter stenosis, and improvements in stress management were related to decreases in percent diameter stenosis at both follow-ups (all p < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings illustrate the importance of targeting multiple health behaviors in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.",

The authors compared psychological distress, anger, hostility, and perceived social support by group (intervention group, n = 28; control group, n = 20) and time (baseline, 1 year, 5 years) and examined the relationships of lifestyle changes to cardiac variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReductions in psychological distress and hostility in the experimental group (compared with controls) were observed after 1 year (p < .05). By 5 years, improvements in hostility tended to be maintained relative to the control group, but reductions in psychological distress were reported only by experimental patients with very high 5-year program adherence. Improvements in diet were related to weight reduction and decreases in percent diameter stenosis, and improvements in stress management were related to decreases in percent diameter stenosis at both follow-ups (all p < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings illustrate the importance of targeting multiple health behaviors in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.",

Methods. This study employs a nonexperimental (prospective time series) design to investigate changes in cardiovascular disease in 2974 men and women from 24 socioeconomically diverse sites who participated in an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program at baseline, 12 weeks, and 1 year. Paired t-tests were used to assess differences by comparing baseline values to those after 12 weeks, baseline values to those after 1 year, and values after 12 weeks to those after 1 year. Results. Eighty-eight percent of patients remained enrolled in the program after 12 weeks, and 78.1% remained enrolled in the program after 1 year. Patients showed statistically significant improvements after 12 weeks in body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, depression, hostility, exercise, and functional capacity. These differences also remained significant after 1 year. There was additional significant improvement between 12 weeks and 1 year only in BMI, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, functional capacity, and hostility, and significant recidivism between 12 weeks and 1 year in all other measures (except triglycerides) and depression, yet improvements from baseline to 1 year remained significant in all measures (except HDL, which was unchanged) (p < .005).

Results After approximately 4\u2005years, participants with elevated biometrics at programme entry maintained significantly lowered BMI (\u22123.2%; 34.8\u00b15.4 vs 33.7\u00b15.3\u2005kg/m2, p=0.02), DBP (\u22129.4%; 89.1\u00b14.1 vs 80.8\u00b112.6\u2005mm\u2005Hg, p=0.005), TC (\u22125.5%; 6.1\u00b10.7 vs 5.8\u00b11.0\u2005mmol/L, p=0.04) and TG (\u221227.5%; 2.4\u00b10.8 vs 1.7\u00b10.7\u2005mmol/L, p=0.002). SBP, HDL, LDL and FPG were not significantly different from baseline. Participants with elevated baseline biometrics who reported being compliant to the lifestyle principles promoted in the intervention (N=71, 67% of follow-up participants) recorded further reductions in BMI (\u22124.2%; 34.8\u00b14.5 vs 33.4\u00b14.8\u2005kg/m2, p=0.02), DBP (\u221213.3%; 88.3\u00b13.2 vs 77.1\u00b112.1\u2005mm\u2005Hg, p=0.005) and FPG (\u221210.4%; 7.0\u00b11.5 vs 6.3\u00b11.3\u2005mmol/L, p=0.02). Conclusions Individuals who returned for follow-up assessment and entered the CHIP lifestyle intervention with elevated risk factors were able to maintain improvements in most biometrics for more than 3\u2005years.

            "abstract": "Lifestyle modification has been demonstrated to effectively reduce the risk factors associated with chronic disease. The Complete Health Improvement Project, a 30-day diet and lifestyle modification program, has been shown to be efficacious in the US, Australasia and Canada. The present study examined the changes in selected biometric measures of 61 participants from six programs delivered in Manila, in the Philippines (May 2013 to November 2014). Overall, significant reductions were recorded in body mass (2.2%, p<0.001), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (6.0%, p<0.001 and 3.3%, p=0.040; respectively), total cholesterol (9.1%, p<0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (6.8%, p=0.021), and fasting blood sugar (12.4%, p=0.001). Overall, triglyceride levels did not change significantly over the course of the intervention (p=0.299). Stratification of the data revealed more dramatic responses in those presenting with the greatest risk factor levels. Those presenting with cholesterol levels >5.17mmol/l recorded an average reduction of 14.4%. A mean decrease of 17.0% in low-density lipoprotein levels was observed among those who entered the program with a low-density lipoprotein level >3.35 mmol/l. Individuals who presented with triglycerides >2.26 mmol/l recorded a mean reduction of 21.8%. Individuals with systolic blood pressure above 139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure above 89 mmHg decreased levels by 10.3% and 7.1%, respectively. Finally, fasting plasma glucose decreased on average 24.8% among individuals entering the program with levels above 6.9 mmol/l. In conclusion, significant reductions in chronic disease risk factors can be achieved in a 30-day life style intervention delivered in the Philippines.",
