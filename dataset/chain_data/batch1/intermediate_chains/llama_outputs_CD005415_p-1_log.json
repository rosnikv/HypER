            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a pilot, non-randomized trial we tested the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent fibrinolytic inhibitor, as adjunctive therapy in standard treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty consecutive patients (12 male, eight female; 63+/-8 years) with 36 episodes of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding were included in the study. In 16 episodes of bleeding TXA was used (in a dosage of 20 mg intravenously, followed for the next 4 weeks by 10 mg/kg/48 h orally), whereas in 20 other cases of bleeding, TXA was not used. The decision to use TXA was left to the attending physician's clinical judgement, resulting in all the more severe cases of bleeding being treated with TXA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment including TXA was shown to be beneficial (relative to cases not treated with TXA) in terms of decreasing the rate of early re-bleeding (in the first week, 0 vs 6, P<0.05), the rate of early and late re-bleeding (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05), the rate of repeated endoscopic procedures (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05) and the number of blood transfusions needed (in the first month, 1.4+/-1.3 vs 2.6+/-1.5 units, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this pilot study suggest that TXA can be beneficial in the treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients. This remains to be definitely confirmed in a randomized study.",

            "abstract": "Summary Some previous studies suggest that activation of the fibrinolytic system may induce platelet dysfunction in haemodialysis patients. Accordingly, inhibition of fibrinolysis may improve platelet dysfunction, and speculatively increase haemoglobin levels. We tested this hypothesis. The study group comprised 22 patients (14 male, 8 female, median age 62), who had been on maintenance haemodialysis for more than one year. Patients were treated for three months with low-dose tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent anti-fibrinolytic agent. The dosages of erythropoietin and the haemodialysis procedure were not changed significantly during the study. We primarily followed platelet function (by in vitro closure time test) and haemoglobin values. Patients were divided into those with substantially prolonged (N=9) and those with slightly delayed or normal (N=13) in vitro closure time. Treatment with TXA resulted in a significant improvement of platelet function and increased levels of haemoglobin in the first group, and no changes in either platelet function or haemoglobin values in the second group. TXA in the dosage used was biologically active, since a significant decrease in plasminogen and D-dimer were found in both groups. No significant changes in other fibrinolytic parameters or von Willebrand factor were found. No complications in terms of arterial or venous thrombosis were observed. Our pilot study suggests that long term, low-dose TXA treatment of haemodialysis patients with substantially prolonged in vitro closure time results in a significant improvement of platelet dysfunction and a significant increase in haemoglobin values. These new, promising results merit further investigation in larger studies.",

The bleeding could not be controlled by intensive conservative treatment, it became life-threatening and urgent bilateral nephrectomy was intended. Since local and systemic hyperfibrinolysis play a role in bleeding in ADPKD patients, we tried TXA treatment. In fact, the massive bleeding promptly stopped, and haematuria gradually ceased. Removal of both kidneys was prevented. After 5 days both ureters became obstructed by blood clots, but placing J-catheters in each pyelon successfully solved this complication. Our case shows that it is reasonable to try antifibrinolytic treatment with TXA in such devastating uncontrolled bleeding.",

A 42-year-old man with ADPKD and a severe persistent bleeding from his solitary left kidney was successfully treated with tranexamic acid (TXA). He also received low-dose rapamycin for 8 months, and this was associated with a 23.5% reduction in kidney volume, improvement and stabilization of renal function, and normalization of haemoglobin levels. When treatment with rapamycin was interrupted, renal function deteriorated within an 8-month period and haemodialysis (HD) became necessary. Kidney volume increased at once, and life-threatening bleeding prompted a nephrectomy 4 months after the onset of HD. These data suggest that the reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function with rapamycin could be the result of the antiangiogenic, antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.",

To address this limitation, we tested the efficacy of rapamycin in a mouse model that results from conditional inactivation of Pkd1. Mosaic deletion of Pkd1 resulted in PKD and replicated characteristic features of human PKD including aberrant mTOR activation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis, and progressive fibrosis. Treatment with rapamycin was highly effective: It reduced cyst growth, preserved renal function, inhibited epithelial cell proliferation, increased apoptosis of cyst-lining cells, and inhibited fibrosis. These data provide in vivo evidence that rapamycin is effective in a human-orthologous mouse model of PKD.",

            "abstract": "Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) lead to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a leading cause of renal failure for which no treatment is available. PC1 is an integral membrane protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that membrane-anchored PC1 activates STAT3 in a JAK2-dependent manner, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC1 can undergo proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation. Tail-cleavage abolishes the ability of PC1 to directly activate STAT3 but the cleaved PC1 tail now coactivates STAT3 in a mechanism requiring STAT phosphorylation by cytokines or growth factors. This leads to an exaggerated cytokine response. Hence, PC1 can regulate STAT activity by a dual mechanism. In ADPKD kidneys PC1 tail fragments are overexpressed, including a unique \u223c15-kDa fragment (P15). STAT3 is strongly activated in cyst-lining epithelial cells in human ADPKD, and orthologous and nonorthologous polycystic mouse models. STAT3 is also activated in developing, postnatal kidneys but inactivated in adult kidneys. These results indicate that STAT3 signaling is regulated by PC1 and is a driving factor for renal epithelial proliferation during normal renal development and during cyst growth.",

            "abstract": "Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) lead to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a leading cause of renal failure for which no treatment is available. PC1 is an integral membrane protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that membrane-anchored PC1 activates STAT3 in a JAK2-dependent manner, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC1 can undergo proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation. Tail-cleavage abolishes the ability of PC1 to directly activate STAT3 but the cleaved PC1 tail now coactivates STAT3 in a mechanism requiring STAT phosphorylation by cytokines or growth factors. This leads to an exaggerated cytokine response. Hence, PC1 can regulate STAT activity by a dual mechanism. In ADPKD kidneys PC1 tail fragments are overexpressed, including a unique \u223c15-kDa fragment (P15). STAT3 is strongly activated in cyst-lining epithelial cells in human ADPKD, and orthologous and nonorthologous polycystic mouse models. STAT3 is also activated in developing, postnatal kidneys but inactivated in adult kidneys. These results indicate that STAT3 signaling is regulated by PC1 and is a driving factor for renal epithelial proliferation during normal renal development and during cyst growth.",

            "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a most common genetic cause of chronic renal failure, is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of cysts in kidneys and other organs. The cystogenic process is highly complex and involves a high proliferative rate, increased apoptosis, altered protein sorting, changed secretory characteristics, and disorganization of the extracellular matrix. ADPKD is caused by mutations in the genes encoding polycystin-1 (PC-1) or polycystin-2 (PC-2). PC-1 undergoes multiple cleavages that intervene in several signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation mechanisms. One of these cleavages releases the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PC-1. In addition, the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of PC-1 and PC-2 interact in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature that suggests that PC-1 and PC-2 may function through a common signaling pathway necessary for normal tubulogenesis. We hope that a better understanding of PC-1 and PC-2 protein function will lead to progress in diagnosis and treatment for ADPKD.",

            "abstract": "Polycystin-1 (PC1) mutations result in proliferative renal cyst growth and progression to renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was shown to be activated in cyst-lining cells in ADPKD and PKD mouse models and may drive renal cyst growth, but the mechanisms leading to persistent STAT3 activation are unknown. A proteolytic fragment of PC1 corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail, PC1-p30, is overexpressed in ADPKD. Here, we show that PC1-p30 interacts with the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, resulting in Src-dependent activation of STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation. The PC1-p30-mediated activation of Src/STAT3 was independent of JAK family kinases and insensitive to the STAT3 inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. Signaling by the EGF receptor (EGFR) or cAMP amplified the activation of Src/STAT3 by PC1-p30. Expression of PC1-p30 changed the cellular response to cAMP signaling. In the absence of PC1-p30, cAMP dampened EGFR- or IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3; in the presence of PC1-p30, cAMP amplified Src-dependent activation of STAT3. In the polycystic kidney (PCK) rat model, activation of STAT3 in renal cystic cells depended on vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) signaling, which increased cAMP levels. Genetic inhibition of vasopressin expression or treatment with a pharmacologic V2R inhibitor strongly suppressed STAT3 activation and reduced renal cyst growth. These results suggest that PC1, via its cleaved cytoplasmic tail, integrates signaling inputs from EGFR and cAMP, resulting in Src-dependent activation of STAT3 and a proliferative response.",

Knockdown HO\u20101 expression dramatically upregulated the incidence of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell death under DOX treatment, indicating that HO\u20101 functions as a critical contributor to drug resistance in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. We further observed that DOX exposure induced a cytoprotective autophagic flux in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells, which was dependent on HO\u20101 induction. Moreover, upregulation of HO\u20101 expression required the activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and its upstream regulator, protein kinase Src. Abrogating Src/STAT3 pathway activation attenuated HO\u20101 and autophagy induction, thus increasing the chemosensitivity of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Therefore, we conclude that Src/STAT3\u2010dependent HO\u20101 induction protects MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 breast cancer cells from DOX\u2010induced death through promoting autophagy. In the following study, we further demonstrated the contribution of Src/STAT3/HO\u20101/autophagy pathway activation to DOX resistance in another breast cancer cell line, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, which bears a similar phenotype to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Therefore, activation of Src/STAT3/HO\u20101/autophagy signaling pathway might play a general role in protecting certain subtypes of breast cancer cells from DOX\u2010induced cytotoxicity. Targeting this signaling event may provide a potential approach for overcoming DOX resistance in breast cancer therapeutics.",

In this regard, HO-1 has been shown to display a dual effect with either antitumor or protumor activity, which is also true for breast cancer (BC). In this work, we address this discrepancy regarding the role of HO-1 in BC. Results: HO-1 was detected in human BC tissues, and its protein levels correlated with reduced tumor size and longer overall survival time of patients, thus suggesting the clinical importance of HO-1 in this type of cancer. Contrariwise, nuclear localization of HO-1 correlated with higher tumor grade suggesting that the effect of HO-1 is dependent on its cellular localization. In vivo experiments showed that both pharmacological activation and genetic overexpression of HO-1 reduce the tumor burden in two different animal models of BC. Furthermore, the pharmacological and genetic activation of HO-1 in several BC cell lines reduce the cellular viability by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and decrease the cellular migration and invasion rates by modulating pathways involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, HO-1 activation impaired in vivo the metastatic dissemination. Innovation and Conclusion: By using various BC cell lines and animal models as well as human tumor samples, we demonstrated that total HO-1 displays antitumor activities in BC.

            "abstract": "Menin\u2011mixed\u2011lineage leukemia (MLL) inhibitors have potential for use as therapeutic agents for MLL\u2011rearranged leukemia. They are also effective against solid cancers, such as breast cancer. The present study demonstrated that menin\u2011MLL inhibitors, such as MI\u2011463, unexpectedly induced the ferroptotic cell death of several cancer cell lines. MI\u2011463 at a double\u2011digit nM concentration markedly decreased the viable number of OVCAR\u20118 ovarian cancer cells for 3\u00a0days. Ferrostatin\u20111 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) almost completely abrogated the MI\u2011463\u2011induced decrease in viable cell numbers. Furthermore, the cancer cell\u2011killing activity was inhibited by N\u2011acetylcysteine [a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS)], deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelator), PD146176 (a specific inhibitor of arachidonate 15\u2011lipoxygenase), idebenone (a membrane\u2011permeable analog of CoQ10) and oleic acid [a monounsaturated fatty acid and one of the end products of stearoyl\u2011CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)], whereas Z\u2011VAD\u2011FMK (an apoptosis inhibitor) had a negligible effect on cell death. It was also found that MI\u2011463 in combination with auranofin (a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor) synergistically increased cancer the death of breast, ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines (88%, 14/16 cell lines). The synergistic induction of cell death was abrogated by ferroptosis inhibitor and DFO. Inhibitors of SCD1, similar to MI\u2011463, also enhanced cancer cell death synergistically with auranofin, while inhibitors of SCD1 and MI\u2011463 did not additively induce cell death. Treatment with zinc protoporphyrin\u20119, a specific inhibitor of heme oxygenase\u20111 (HO\u20111), markedly attenuated the cell death induced by MI\u2011463 plus auranofin. On the whole, these results suggest that the MI\u2011463\u2011induced decrease in cell viability may be at least partly associated with the inhibition of SCD1 activity. In addition, the potent induction of HO\u20111 contributed to the synergistic effects of MI\u2011463 plus auranofin. Therefore, menin\u2011MLL inhibitors, such as MI\u2011463, in combination with auranofin represent an effective therapeutic approach for several types of cancer via the induction of ferroptosis.",

            "abstract": "Menin\u2011mixed\u2011lineage leukemia (MLL) inhibitors have potential for use as therapeutic agents for MLL\u2011rearranged leukemia. They are also effective against solid cancers, such as breast cancer. The present study demonstrated that menin\u2011MLL inhibitors, such as MI\u2011463, unexpectedly induced the ferroptotic cell death of several cancer cell lines. MI\u2011463 at a double\u2011digit nM concentration markedly decreased the viable number of OVCAR\u20118 ovarian cancer cells for 3\u00a0days. Ferrostatin\u20111 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) almost completely abrogated the MI\u2011463\u2011induced decrease in viable cell numbers. Furthermore, the cancer cell\u2011killing activity was inhibited by N\u2011acetylcysteine [a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS)], deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelator), PD146176 (a specific inhibitor of arachidonate 15\u2011lipoxygenase), idebenone (a membrane\u2011permeable analog of CoQ10) and oleic acid [a monounsaturated fatty acid and one of the end products of stearoyl\u2011CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)], whereas Z\u2011VAD\u2011FMK (an apoptosis inhibitor) had a negligible effect on cell death. It was also found that MI\u2011463 in combination with auranofin (a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor) synergistically increased cancer the death of breast, ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines (88%, 14/16 cell lines). The synergistic induction of cell death was abrogated by ferroptosis inhibitor and DFO. Inhibitors of SCD1, similar to MI\u2011463, also enhanced cancer cell death synergistically with auranofin, while inhibitors of SCD1 and MI\u2011463 did not additively induce cell death. Treatment with zinc protoporphyrin\u20119, a specific inhibitor of heme oxygenase\u20111 (HO\u20111), markedly attenuated the cell death induced by MI\u2011463 plus auranofin. On the whole, these results suggest that the MI\u2011463\u2011induced decrease in cell viability may be at least partly associated with the inhibition of SCD1 activity. In addition, the potent induction of HO\u20111 contributed to the synergistic effects of MI\u2011463 plus auranofin. Therefore, menin\u2011MLL inhibitors, such as MI\u2011463, in combination with auranofin represent an effective therapeutic approach for several types of cancer via the induction of ferroptosis.",
