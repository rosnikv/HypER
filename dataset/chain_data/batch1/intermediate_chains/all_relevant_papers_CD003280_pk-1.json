        "abstract": "In this case report, we describe the serial evaluation of neuromuscular function of a woman with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and document the return of limb strength and hand function after plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive therapy. The assessment of muscle strength and functional abilities by physical therapists can provide timely, objective, and quantitative information that is important to the medical management of patients with neurologic disease.",

        "explanation": "This paper is a case report that documents the return of limb strength and hand function after plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive therapy in a patient with CIDP. While it discusses treatment options for CIDP, it does not build upon the hypothesis or findings of the source paper, which investigated the efficacy of combined azathioprine and prednisone therapy. However, it does explore a related topic, and the source paper's findings could be considered a sub-hypothesis for this paper's discussion of immunosuppressive therapy."
