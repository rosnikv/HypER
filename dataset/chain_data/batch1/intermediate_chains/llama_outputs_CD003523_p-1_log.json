            "abstract": "Skin wound healing requires epithelial cell migration for re-epithelialization, wound closure, and re-establishment of normal function. We believe that one of the earliest signals to initiate wound healing is the lateral electric field generated by the wound current. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes migrate towards the negative pole, representing the center of the wound, in direct currents of a physiological strength, 100 mV/mm. Virtually nothing is known about the signal transduction mechanisms used by these cells to sense the endogenous electric field. To elucidate possible protein kinase (PK) involvement in the process, PK inhibitors were utilized. Two important findings have been described. Firstly, addition of 50 nM KT5720, an inhibitor of PKA, resulted in a 53% percent reduction in the directional response of keratinocytes in the electric field, while not significantly affecting general cell motility. The reduction was dose-dependent, there was a gradual decrease in the directional response from 5 to 50 nM. Secondly, addition of 1 microM ML-7, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, resulted in an approximate 31% decrease in the distance the cells migrated without affecting directional migration. The PKC inhibitors GF109203X at 4 microM and H-7 at 20 microM and W-7, a CaM kinase inhibitor, did not significantly alter either directed migration or cell migration, although they all resulted in a slight reduction in directional migration. D-erythro-sphingosine at 15 microM, a PKC inhibitor, had virtually no effect on either migration distance or directed migration. These findings demonstrate that divergent kinase signaling pathways regulate general cell motility and sustained directional migration and highlight the complexity of the signal transduction mechanisms involved. The inhibitor studies described in this paper implicate a role for PKA in the regulation of the directional migratory response to applied electric fields, galvanotaxis.",

            "abstract": "Electric fields exceeding 1 V/cm occur during wound healing, morphogenesis, and tumor growth, and such fields have been shown to induce directional migration of a variety of different cells. However, the mechanism by which electric fields direct cell movement is not yet understood, and the effects on vascular endothelial cells are entirely unknown. We demonstrate that cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells migrate toward the cathode of an applied electric field. Time-lapse microscopic imaging shows that the field suppresses protrusive activity from anode-facing surfaces of the cells while stimulating protrusions from surfaces that face the cathode.

            "abstract": "Electric fields exceeding 1 V/cm occur during wound healing, morphogenesis, and tumor growth, and such fields have been shown to induce directional migration of a variety of different cells. However, the mechanism by which electric fields direct cell movement is not yet understood, and the effects on vascular endothelial cells are entirely unknown. We demonstrate that cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells migrate toward the cathode of an applied electric field. Time-lapse microscopic imaging shows that the field suppresses protrusive activity from anode-facing surfaces of the cells while stimulating protrusions from surfaces that face the cathode. The threshold for this response is 1\u20132 V/cm, similar to field strengths measured in vivo. In addition, fluorescence microscopy shows that lamellipodia projecting toward the cathode are rich in actin filaments. Using quantitative image analysis, we show that the electric field induces a transient 80% increase in the amount of filamentous actin in the cell.

            "abstract": "Intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is a pivotal signalling element in cell migration and is thought to be required for chemotaxis of Dictyostelium. Ca2+ signalling may also be important for electrotaxis. However this suggestion has been controversial. We show that electric fields direct Dictyostelium cells to migrate cathodally and increase [Ca2+]i in Dictyostelium cells, as determined by Fluo-3 AM imaging and 45Ca2+ uptake. Omission of extracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]e) and incubation with EGTA abolished the electric-field-stimulated [Ca2+]i rise and directional cell migration. This suggests a requirement for [Ca2+]e in the electrotactic response. Deletion of iplA, a gene responsible for chemoattractant-induced [Ca2+]i increase, had only a minor effect on the electric-field-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Moreover, iplA-null Dictyostelium cells showed the same electrotactic response as wild-type cells. Therefore, iplA-independent Ca2+ influx is necessary for electrotactic cell migration. These results suggest that the [Ca2+]i regulatory mechanisms induced by electric fields are different from those induced by cAMP and folic acid in Dictyostelium cells. Different roles of the iplA gene in chemoattractant-induced and electrically induced Ca2+ signalling, and different effects of [Ca2+]i elevation on chemotaxis and electrotaxis indicate that the chemoattractant and electric cues activate distinctive initial signalling elements.",

Here we show that the preferential direction of migration during electrotaxis in Dictyostelium cells can be reversed by genetically modulating both guanylyl cyclases (GCases) and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-binding protein C (GbpC) in combination with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases (PI3Ks). The PI3K-dependent pathway is involved in cathode-directed migration under a direct-current electric field. The catalytic domains of soluble GCase (sGC) and GbpC also mediate cathode-directed signaling via cGMP, whereas the N-terminal domain of sGC mediates anode-directed signaling in conjunction with both the inhibition of PI3Ks and cGMP production. These observations provide an identification of the genes required for directional switching in electrotaxis and suggest that a parallel processing of electric signals, in which multiple-signaling pathways act to bias cell movement toward the cathode or anode, is used to determine the direction of migration.",

The directional sensing mechanisms responsible for this response to EFs, however, remain unknown. Exposing cells to an EF causes changes in plasma membrane potentials (Vm). Exploiting the ability of Dictyostelium cells to tolerate drastic Vm changes, we investigated the role of Vm in electrotaxis and, in parallel, in chemotaxis. We used three independent factors to control Vm: extracellular pH, extracellular [K+], and electroporation. Changes in Vm were monitored with microelectrode recording techniques. Depolarized Vm was observed under acidic (pH 5.0) and alkaline (pH 9.0) conditions as well as under higher extracellular [K+] conditions. Electroporation permeabilized the cell membrane and significantly reduced the Vm, which gradually recovered over 40 min. We then recorded the electrotactic behaviors of Dictyostelium cells with a defined Vm using these three techniques. The directionality (directedness of electrotaxis) was quantified and compared to that of chemotaxis (chemotactic index). We found that a reduced Vm significantly impaired electrotaxis without significantly affecting random motility or chemotaxis. We conclude that extracellular pH, [K+], and electroporation all significantly affected electrotaxis, which appeared to be mediated by the changes in Vm. The initial directional sensing mechanisms for electrotaxis therefore differ from those of chemotaxis and may be mediated by changes in resting Vm.",

Instructive signals mediated by changes in resting potential control proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and apoptosis of stem, progenitor, and somatic cells. Of importance, however, cells are regulated not only by their own Vmem but also by the Vmem of their neighbors, forming networks via electrical synapses known as gap junctions. Spatiotemporal changes in Vmem distribution among nonneural somatic tissues regulate pattern formation and serve as signals that trigger limb regeneration, induce eye formation, set polarity of whole-body anatomical axes, and orchestrate craniofacial patterning. New tools for tracking and functionally altering Vmem gradients in vivo have identified novel roles for bioelectrical signaling and revealed the molecular pathways by which Vmem changes are transduced into cascades of downstream gene expression. Because channels and gap junctions are gated posttranslationally, bioelectrical networks have their own characteristic dynamics that do not reduce to molecular profiling of channel expression (although they couple functionally to transcriptional networks). The recent data provide an exciting opportunity to crack the bioelectric code, and learn to program cellular activity at the level of organs, not only cell types. The understanding of how patterning information is encoded in bioelectrical networks, which may require concepts from computational neuroscience, will have transformative implications for embryogenesis, regeneration, cancer, and synthetic bioengineering.",

            "abstract": "A major goal of regenerative medicine and bioengineering is the regeneration of complex organs, such as limbs, and the capability to create artificial constructs (so-called biobots) with defined morphologies and robust self-repair capabilities. Developmental biology presents remarkable examples of systems that self-assemble and regenerate complex structures toward their correct shape despite significant perturbations. A fundamental challenge is to translate progress in molecular genetics into control of large-scale organismal anatomy, and the field is still searching for an appropriate theoretical paradigm for facilitating control of pattern homeostasis. However, computational neuroscience provides many examples in which cell networks - brains - store memories (e.g., of geometric configurations, rules, and patterns) and coordinate their activity towards proximal and distant goals. In this Perspective, we propose that programming large-scale morphogenesis requires exploiting the information processing by which cellular structures work toward specific shapes. In non-neural cells, as in the brain, bioelectric signaling implements information processing, decision-making, and memory in regulating pattern and its remodeling. Thus, approaches used in computational neuroscience to understand goal-seeking neural systems offer a toolbox of techniques to model and control regenerative pattern formation. Here, we review recent data on developmental bioelectricity as a regulator of patterning, and propose that target morphology could be encoded within tissues as a kind of memory, using the same molecular mechanisms and algorithms so successfully exploited by the brain. We highlight the next steps of an unconventional research program, which may allow top-down control of growth and form for numerous applications in regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.",

            "abstract": "Gap junctions (GJs) are aqueous channels that allow cells to communicate via physiological signals directly. The role of gap junctional connectivity in determining single\u2010cell functions has long been recognized. However, GJs have another important role: the regulation of large\u2010scale anatomical pattern. GJs are not only versatile computational elements that allow cells to control which small molecule signals they receive and emit, but also establish connectivity patterns within large groups of cells. By dynamically regulating the topology of bioelectric networks in vivo, GJs underlie the ability of many tissues to implement complex morphogenesis. Here, a review of recent data on patterning roles of GJs in growth of the zebrafish fin, the establishment of left\u2010right patterning, the developmental dysregulation known as cancer, and the control of large\u2010scale head\u2010tail polarity, and head shape in planarian regeneration has been reported. A perspective in which GJs are not only molecular features functioning in single cells, but also enable global neural\u2010like dynamics in non\u2010neural somatic tissues has been proposed. This view suggests a rich program of future work which capitalizes on the rapid advances in the biophysics of GJs to exploit GJ\u2010mediated global dynamics for applications in birth defects, regenerative medicine, and morphogenetic bioengineering. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

            "abstract": "Gap junctions (GJs) are aqueous channels that allow cells to communicate via physiological signals directly. The role of gap junctional connectivity in determining single\u2010cell functions has long been recognized. However, GJs have another important role: the regulation of large\u2010scale anatomical pattern. GJs are not only versatile computational elements that allow cells to control which small molecule signals they receive and emit, but also establish connectivity patterns within large groups of cells. By dynamically regulating the topology of bioelectric networks in vivo, GJs underlie the ability of many tissues to implement complex morphogenesis. Here, a review of recent data on patterning roles of GJs in growth of the zebrafish fin, the establishment of left\u2010right patterning, the developmental dysregulation known as cancer, and the control of large\u2010scale head\u2010tail polarity, and head shape in planarian regeneration has been reported. A perspective in which GJs are not only molecular features functioning in single cells, but also enable global neural\u2010like dynamics in non\u2010neural somatic tissues has been proposed. This view suggests a rich program of future work which capitalizes on the rapid advances in the biophysics of GJs to exploit GJ\u2010mediated global dynamics for applications in birth defects, regenerative medicine, and morphogenetic bioengineering. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To understand the evolution and function of metazoan creatures\u2019 bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of the basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent larger organism.

            "abstract": "All epistemic agents physically consist of parts that must somehow comprise an integrated cognitive self. Biological individuals consist of subunits (organs, cells, and molecular networks) that are themselves complex and competent in their own native contexts. How do coherent biological Individuals result from the activity of smaller sub-agents? To understand the evolution and function of metazoan creatures\u2019 bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of the basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent larger organism. In this article, I synthesize ideas in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and developmental physiology toward a hypothesis about the origin of Individuality: \u201cScale-Free Cognition.\u201d I propose a fundamental definition of an Individual based on the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents. Any Self is demarcated by a computational surface \u2013 the spatio-temporal boundary of events that it can measure, model, and try to affect. This surface sets a functional boundary - a cognitive \u201clight cone\u201d which defines the scale and limits of its cognition. I hypothesize that higher level goal-directed activity and agency, resulting in larger cognitive boundaries, evolve from the primal homeostatic drive of living things to reduce stress \u2013 the difference between current conditions and life-optimal conditions. The mechanisms of developmental bioelectricity - the ability of all cells to form electrical networks that process information - suggest a plausible set of gradual evolutionary steps that naturally lead from physiological homeostasis in single cells to memory, prediction, and ultimately complex cognitive agents, via scale-up of the basic drive of infotaxis. Recent data on the molecular mechanisms of pre-neural bioelectricity suggest a model of how increasingly sophisticated cognitive functions emerge smoothly from cell-cell communication used to guide embryogenesis and regeneration. This set of hypotheses provides a novel perspective on numerous phenomena, such as cancer, and makes several unique, testable predictions for interdisciplinary research that have implications not only for evolutionary developmental biology but also for biomedicine and perhaps artificial intelligence and exobiology.",

            "abstract": "One of the most salient features of life is its capacity to handle novelty and namely to thrive and adapt to new circumstances and changes in both the environment and internal components. An understanding of this capacity is central to several fields: the evolution of form and function, the design of effective strategies for biomedicine, and the creation of novel life forms via chimeric and bioengineering technologies. Here, we review instructive examples of living organisms solving diverse problems and propose competent navigation in arbitrary spaces as an invariant for thinking about the scaling of cognition during evolution. We argue that our innate capacity to recognize agency and intelligence in unfamiliar guises lags far behind our ability to detect it in familiar behavioral contexts. The multi-scale competency of life is essential to adaptive function, potentiating evolution and providing strategies for top-down control (not micromanagement) to address complex disease and injury. We propose an observer-focused viewpoint that is agnostic about scale and implementation, illustrating how evolution pivoted similar strategies to explore and exploit metabolic, transcriptional, morphological, and finally 3D motion spaces. By generalizing the concept of behavior, we gain novel perspectives on evolution, strategies for system-level biomedical interventions, and the construction of bioengineered intelligences. This framework is a first step toward relating to intelligence in highly unfamiliar embodiments, which will be essential for progress in artificial intelligence and regenerative medicine and for thriving in a world increasingly populated by synthetic, bio-robotic, and hybrid beings.",

            "abstract": "One of the most salient features of life is its capacity to handle novelty and namely to thrive and adapt to new circumstances and changes in both the environment and internal components. An understanding of this capacity is central to several fields: the evolution of form and function, the design of effective strategies for biomedicine, and the creation of novel life forms via chimeric and bioengineering technologies. Here, we review instructive examples of living organisms solving diverse problems and propose competent navigation in arbitrary spaces as an invariant for thinking about the scaling of cognition during evolution. We argue that our innate capacity to recognize agency and intelligence in unfamiliar guises lags far behind our ability to detect it in familiar behavioral contexts. The multi-scale competency of life is essential to adaptive function, potentiating evolution and providing strategies for top-down control (not micromanagement) to address complex disease and injury. We propose an observer-focused viewpoint that is agnostic about scale and implementation, illustrating how evolution pivoted similar strategies to explore and exploit metabolic, transcriptional, morphological, and finally 3D motion spaces. By generalizing the concept of behavior, we gain novel perspectives on evolution, strategies for system-level biomedical interventions, and the construction of bioengineered intelligences. This framework is a first step toward relating to intelligence in highly unfamiliar embodiments, which will be essential for progress in artificial intelligence and regenerative medicine and for thriving in a world increasingly populated by synthetic, bio-robotic, and hybrid beings.",

            "abstract": "Fundamental knowledge gaps exist with respect to the plasticity of cells from adult soma and the potential diversity of body shape and behavior in living constructs derived from such genetically wild-type cells. Here we introduce Anthrobots, a spheroid-shaped multicellular biological robot (biobot) platform with diameters ranging from 30 to 500 microns. Anthrobots have an inherent capacity for motility in aqueous environments, via cilia covering their surface. Each Anthrobot starts out as a single cell, derived from the adult human lung, and self-constructs into a multicellular motile biobot after having been cultured in extra cellular matrix for 2 weeks and transferred into a minimally viscous habitat. Anthrobots exhibit a wide range of behaviors with motility patterns ranging from tight loops to straight lines and speeds ranging from 5-50 microns/second. Our anatomical investigations reveal that this behavioral diversity is significantly correlated with their morphological diversity. Anthrobots can assume diverse morphologies from fully polarized to wholly ciliated bodies with spherical or ellipsoidal shapes, each correlating with a distinct movement type. Remarkably, as a function of these different movement types, Anthrobots were found to be capable of traversing live human tissues in various ways. Furthermore, Anthrobots were able to induce rapid repair of wounds in human neural cell sheets in vitro. By controlling microenvironmental cues in bulk, entirely novel structure, behavior, and biomedically-relevant capabilities can be discovered in morphogenetic processes without direct genetic editing or manual sculpting. Significance Statement We demonstrate that normal, non-genetically-modified human tracheal cells can be induced to form a new proto-organism - Anthrobots - which exhibit spontaneous behavior, swimming around in one of several patterns, demonstrating plasticity for novel form and function inherent in even elderly human somatic cells. Moreover, Anthrobots are able to traverse over cultured neurons, settling down and causing repair under them: the nerves knit together across the wound gap due to the presence of the Anthrobot. A patient\u2019s own cells can be harnessed to make a motile biological robot that can traverse human tissue and induce repair. In the future, this platform can deliver pro-regenerative therapeutics for a range of biomedical applications that will not trigger rejection or require immune suppression.",
