            "abstract": "1 Because in ischaemia there is a critical lack of O2, it has been reasoned that increasing O2 delivery to the ischaemic myocardium could serve as adjunctive therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI). Accordingly, in the present study, the effect of early hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) on mortality and MI size after coronary occlusion was examined in rats. 2 After coronary occlusion, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive either HBO for 1 h in a hyperbaric chamber (100% O2 at 253 kPa; n = 106) or ambient O2 as the control (n = 111). The extent of myocardial necrosis was assessed (triphenyltetrazolium) immediately after treatment in the HBO (n = 50) and control (n = 47) groups. The remaining rats were evaluated 24 h after occlusion to enable calculation of MI size and mortality. 3 Immediately after therapy, the size of the MI was significantly greater in the control group compared with that in the HBO group (40 \u00b1 3 vs 27 \u00b1 2% of the left ventricle (LV), respectively; P < 0.001). The 24 h mortality of control rats was higher than that of HBO rats (34 vs 16%, respectively; P = 0.02). Control rats that survived 24 h had a larger MI than did HBO rats that survived 24 h (40 \u00b1 4 vs 29 \u00b1 3% of the LV, respectively; P = 0.005). Furthermore, large necrotic areas (> 40% of the LV) were more frequent in control than HBO rats (55 vs 27% of infarcted hearts, respectively; P = 0.01). There was less pulmonary congestion observed in HBO rats compared with control rats. 4 In conclusion, early therapy with HBO during the onset of an acute ischaemic event decreases the necrotic area and reduces acute mortality. These data support further investigation of HBO as an adjuvant therapy for acute MI.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo investigate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) chamber treatment in mouse models of retinal ischemia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUnilateral central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or optic nerve crush (ONC) was induced in 50 mice each, of which 30 were treated with 100% oxygen at 2 atm for 90 minutes immediately after injury and then daily for up to 14 days. Mice were euthanatized on days 1, 3, and 21 for histologic analysis, apoptosis assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction test. Findings were analyzed by injury and by treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHBO treatment reduced cell loss from 58% to 30% in the CRAO model and from 52% to 32% in the ONC model. In both models, it was associated with significantly increased cell survival in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Expression levels of the proapoptosis genes (bax, caspase-3) decreased minimally in the HBO-treated CRAO mice on day 1, but this trend was reversed on day 3. In the ONC group, levels of caspase-3, bax, and bcl-x increased on day 1 and dropped below baseline on day 3. The pattern of changes in the expression levels of the ischemia- and oxidative-stress-related genes (HO-1, SOD-1, GPX-1, NOX-2) and the effectiveness of HBO treatment varied by model. Overall, however, gene expression levels that increased in the untreated mice increased further with HBO treatment and levels that decreased, decreased further with treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHBO treatment protects injured neuronal cells from apoptosis.

The filament was removed after 60 minutes, and the mice were immediately given a single intraperitoneal injection of saline, bevacizumab, or sildenafil. An additional group of mice (n = 7) received bevacizumab 6\u2009h after MCAO induction. The mice were euthanized 24 hours later and evaluated for infarct area and brain edema using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and ImageJ. In the saline-treated mice (n = 16), total stroke volume was 19.20 \u00b1 6.38\u2009mm3, mean penumbra area was 4.5 \u00b1 2.03\u2009mm3, and hemispheric asymmetry was 106.5%. Corresponding values in the bevacizumab group (n = 19) were 17.79 \u00b1 5.80\u2009mm3, 7.3 \u00b1 3.5\u2009mm3, and 108.6%; in the delayed (6\u2009h) bevacizumab injected mice (n = 7) they were 9.80 \u00b1 8.00\u2009mm3, 2.4 \u00b1 2.0\u2009mm3, and 98.2%; and in the sildenafil group (n = 16) they were 18.42 \u00b1 5.41\u2009mm3, 5.7 \u00b1 2.02\u2009mm3, and 109.9%. The bevacizumab group had a significantly larger mean penumbra area when given immediately and smaller total stroke area in both groups than the saline- (p = 0.03) and sildenafil-treated (p = 0.003) groups.

In addition, evidence indicates that cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway is involved in the modulation of glial cell activity.

The objective of this chapter is to review current knowledge of NO/cGMP signaling pathways on neuroinflammation and the potential therapeutic use of PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) in neurological diseases. The extensive, while recent, literature on the effects of PDE-Is on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), and stroke has been reviewed. mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt) extended polyglutamine at huntingtin gene, intraneuronal events death. time, this either causes or contributes to neuroinflammation. downstream target BACE1, also leads to cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), contributing to the formation of A\u03b2 plaques. PDE5-Is induce a decrease in the activity of calpain, p25, and CDK5, with consequent decrease in protein aggregation. GSK3\u03b2 is a kinase involved in the hyperphosphorylation of Tau. In addition, through the downstream target, cathepsin B, GSK3\u03b2 leads to the formation of A\u03b2 plaques. pAkt is a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor, modulating the pathway. PDE-Is increase Akt phosphorylation and decrease GSK3\u03b2 activity and cathepsin B expression, which can contribute to control the protein aggregation. by PDE5-Is, which may be important for the control of leukocyte infiltration. It is possible that complex cross signaling is occurring, but although it has been demonstrated in inflammatory models, it has not been confirmed in preclinical studies with PDE5-Is in neurological diseases. For example, elevated levels of cGMP by NO may inhibit PDE3 activity, which leads to increased cAMP levels and PKA activation. PKA inhibits NF-\u03baB transcription activity and, subsequently, the expression of downstream MCP-1 and VCAM-1. stress, which activate the initiator pro-caspase-9. Proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, BH3- only members, activate other proapoptotic proteins, such as BAX, and antagonize antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2. Subsequently, the mitochondrial outer membrane is disrupted, and its permeability increases, resulting in cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) leakage into the cytosol. Cyt-c in the cytosol forms a complex with Apaf-1, called the apoptosome, which assists in auto-activation of initiator pro-caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.",

            "abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss is mainly acquired and affects an estimated 1.3 billion humans worldwide. It is related to aging, noise, infection, ototoxic drugs, and genetic defects. It is essential to identify reversible and preventable causes to be able to reduce the burden of this disease. Inflammation is involved in most causes and leads to tissue injury through vasospasm-associated ischemia. Vasospasm is reversible. This review summarized evidence linking inflammation-induced vasospasm to several forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. The link between vasospasm and sensorineural hearing loss is directly evident in subarachnoid haemorrhage, which involves the release of vasoconstriction-inducing cytokines like interleukin-1, endothelin-1, and tumour necrosis factor. These proinflammatory cytokines can also be released in response to infection, autoimmune disease, and acute or chronically increased inflammation in the ageing organism as in presbyacusis or in noise-induced cochlear injury. Evidence of vasospasm and hearing loss has also been discovered in bacterial meningitis and brain injury. Resolution of inflammation-induced vasospasm has been associated with improvement of hearing in autoimmune diseases involving overproduction of interleukin-1 from inflammasomes. There is mainly indirect evidence for vasospasm-associated sensorineural hearing loss in most forms of systemic or injury- or infection-induced local vascular inflammation. This opens up avenues in prevention and treatment of vascular and systemic inflammation as well as vasospasm itself as a way to prevent and treat most forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Future research needs to investigate interventions antagonising vasospasm and vasospasm-inducing proinflammatory cytokines and their production in randomised controlled trials of prevention and treatment of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Prime candidates for interventions are hereby inflammasome inhibitors and vasospasm-reducing drugs like nitric oxide donors, rho-kinase inhibitors, and magnesium which have the potential to reduce sensorineural hearing loss in meningitis, exposure to noise, brain injury, arteriosclerosis, and advanced age-related and autoimmune disease-related inflammation.",

It is also unclear whether all lifestyles that contribute to dementia do so through the same intermediary steps. This article will focus on three lifestyles known to be risk factors for dementia, namely obesity, sedentary behavior, and insufficient sleep, and offer a unifying hypothesis proposing that lifestyles that negatively impact cognition do so through the same sequence of events: inflammation, small vessel disease, decline in cerebral perfusion, and brain atrophy. The hypothesis will then be tested in a recently identified risk factor for dementia, namely hearing deficit. If further studies confirm this sequence of events leading to dementia, a significant change in our approach to this debilitating and costly condition may be necessary, possible, and beneficial.",

This study aimed to determine the association between MRI-visible PVS burden and the risk of incident dementia. Methods This study included community-dwelling Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants with available brain MRI-PVS ratings, free of stroke and dementia. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the association between MRI-visible PVS and incident dementia. PVS were rated using validated methods in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). The outcomes included all-cause dementia, Alzheimer dementia (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD). Results One thousand four hundred forty-nine participants 50 years or older (46% male) were included. Over a median follow-up period of 8.3 years, the incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD was 15.8%, 12.5%, and 2.5%, respectively. In models that adjusted for vascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease, the hazard for dementia increased steadily as PVS burden increased, rising 2-fold for those with grade II PVS (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.51\u20133.93) to 5-fold in participants with grade IV (HR 5.05, 95% CI 2.75\u20139.26) compared with grade I PVS in CSO. In the BG, hazards increased 1.6-fold (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15\u20132.27) for grade II to 2.6-fold (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.04\u20136.88) for grade IV compared with grade I PVS. The association remained significant for CSO but not for BG, after adjustment for white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), covert infarcts, and total brain volume. Similar findings were observed for AD, but VaD, limited by a small number of events, was not statistically significant. Discussion Higher burden of PVS in CSO was associated with increased risk of developing dementia, independent of vascular risk factors, total brain volume, WMHVs, and covert infarcts. This finding supports a role for PVS as a subclinical MRI marker to identify individuals in subclinical stages at high risk of developing dementia who may benefit from early intervention.",

The coexistence of PVS with other CSVD manifestations likely increases the risk of adverse neurological outcomes. We related PVS to other CSVD manifestations and brain volumes that are markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration. Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants with CSVD ratings on brain MRI were included. PVS were rated in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO) into grades I\u2013IV and a category reflecting high burden in single or mixed CSO-BG regions. We related PVS to covert brain infarcts (CBI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), total brain, hippocampal, and cortical gray matter volumes using adjusted multivariable regression analyses. In 2454 participants (mean age 54 \u00b1 12 years), we observed that higher PVS burden in both BG and CSO was related to CMB in lobar and deep brain regions and increased WMH. Greater CSO PVS burden was associated with decreased total cortical gray volumes. PVS are associated with ischemic markers of CSVD and neurodegeneration markers. Further studies should elucidate the causality between PVS and other CSVD manifestations.",
