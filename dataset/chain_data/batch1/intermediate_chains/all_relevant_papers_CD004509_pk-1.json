        "title": "Esterified estrogens combined with methyltestosterone improve emotional well-being in postmenopausal women with chest pain and normal coronary angiograms",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveThe cardiac syndrome X is described as the triad of angina pectoris, a positive exercise test for myocardial ischemia, and angiographically smooth coronary arteries. Although syndrome X does not result in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, the symptoms are often troublesome and unresponsive to conventional antianginal therapy. The majority of patients are postmenopausal, and estrogen therapy can alleviate anginal symptoms. We investigated the effect of esterified estrogens combined with methyltestosterone (Estratest) on quality of life in postmenopausal women with syndrome X. DesignPatients were withdrawn from antianginal therapy. Sublingual nitrates were allowed for treatment of anginal episodes. Patients underwent treadmill testing, and quality of life was assessed by using the Short Form-36 and Cardiac Health Profile questionnaires after the women had received 8 weeks of Estratest or identical placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. ResultsNineteen patients were randomized, and 16 patients completed the protocol. Plasma 17&bgr;-estradiol concentrations were significantly increased by Estratest; however, total testosterone levels were not. The \u201cemotional\u201d score of the Cardiac Health Profile questionnaire was significantly improved after Estratest use compared with placebo (p = 0.03); however, there was no significant change in the Short Form-36 questionnaire for any variable. Estratest significantly increased systolic blood pressure and rate pressure product at rest but had no effect on exercise parameters. Time to onset of chest pain during exercise was also unaffected. ConclusionsWe have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Estratest on emotional well-being in postmenopausal women with cardiological syndrome X. There was no significant treatment effect on exercise parameters, including time to onset of chest pain.",

        "title": "Androgens in Postmenopausal Women: Production, Possible Role, and Replacement Options",
        "abstract": "The physiology of normal androgen production in women has not been well understood. Aging, per se, accounts for much of the reduction in both ovarian and adrenal androgen production; and natural menopause does not result in an abrupt decline in testosterone production. Therefore, the definition of an androgen deficiency state in women, in the absence of adrenal suppression and/or bilateral oophorectomy, has been difficult. Nevertheless there are well-documented beneficial effects of androgen on many organ systems, including bone and the brain. This review focuses on the physiology of androgens in postmenopausal women and includes a discussion of the definition of an androgen deficiency state, the anticipated effects of androgen on several parameters of health, and possible ways in which androgens may be administered to women. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader will be able to explain the physiology of androgen production in women, outline the risks of androgen replacement, and summarize the treatment options for a women with relative androgen deficiency.",

        "title": "Effects of oral androstenedione administration on serum testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women.",
        "abstract": "Androstenedione is a steroid hormone and an intermediate in the synthetic pathway of both testosterone and estradiol in men and women. It is available without prescription and taken with the expectation that it may have beneficial effects on strength, general well-being, libido, and quality of life. Although studies have shown that oral androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estradiol levels in men, the hormonal effects of androstenedione in postmenopausal women are unknown. We randomly assigned 30 healthy postmenopausal women to receive 0, 50, or 100 mg androstenedione as a single oral dose. After androstenedione administration, we made hourly measurements of serum androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone concentrations during 12 h of frequent blood sampling. The mean change (+/-SD) in serum androstenedione area under the curve (AUC) was greater in both the 50-mg (79 +/- 39%) and 100-mg dose groups (242 +/- 184%) than in the control group (-29 +/- 28%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum androstenedione AUC was also greater in the 100-mg than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0026). The mean change in serum estrone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (108 +/- 72%) and 100-mg dose groups (116 +/- 119%) than in the control group (-5 +/- 19%), although the control vs. 100-mg group comparison did not quite meet statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group, P = 0.0631 controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum estradiol AUC remained stable after supplementation in all groups without any between-group differences observed (-11 +/- 17%, 2.8 +/- 34%, -11 +/- 27%, for the control, 50-mg, and 100-mg groups, respectively). The mean change in serum testosterone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (185 +/- 146%) and 100-mg dose groups (457 +/- 601%) than in the control group (-27 +/- 13%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and for controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in testosterone AUC was also greater in the 100-mg dose group than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0257). There was considerable individual variability in the changes of serum androstenedione, estrone, and testosterone levels in the treated groups with peak serum testosterone levels exceeding the upper limit of normal in 4 of 10 women in the 50-mg dose group and 6 of 10 in the 100-mg dose group. We concluded that the acute administration of both 50-mg and 100-mg of androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estrone levels, but not estradiol levels, in postmenopausal women. If these hormonal effects are sustained during long-term administration, regular use of this supplement by postmenopausal women could thus cause both beneficial and adverse effects.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of adding testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily to estrogen replacement on sexual function, psychological well-being and self-esteem in surgically postmenopausal women. Methods: A letter of invitation to participate in the study was mailed to women who had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for benign disorders during 1990-98. Fifty women, 45-60 years old, were consecutively recruited and randomly assigned to oral treatment with testosterone undecanoate 40 mg plus estradiol valerate 2 mg daily or placebo plus estradiol valerate 2 mg daily for 24 weeks. A double-blind design was chosen, with cross-over to the other regimen for another 24 weeks of treatment. Forty-four women completed the study. Outcome included scores on McCoy's sex scale questionnaire, the Psychological General Well-Being index and a self-esteem questionnaire, at baseline and after 24 weeks of either treatment. Serum concentrations of total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were analyzed at baseline and after 24 weeks of both treatment regimens. Results: After 24 weeks, both treatment regimens had significantly improved some of the sexual variables. The addition of testosterone had a significantly better effect on the sex variables 'enjoyment of sex', 'satisfaction with frequency of sexual activity' and 'interest in sex'. The total McCoy score was significantly increased by both treatments, but there was a stronger effect when testosterone was also given. Although both regimens improved psychological well-being and self-esteem, we found no significant differences between testosterone-estrogen or estrogen alone at 24 weeks. Serum levels of all androgens, with considerable individual variation, increased significantly from baseline after 24 weeks of testosterone-estrogen treatment. Supraphysiological levels were achieved in a significant proportion of the women. Increases in estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin were less marked when testosterone was also given. Both treatments reduced gonadotropin levels. Conclusions: The addition of testosterone undecanoate improved specific aspects of sexual function more than treatment with estrogen alone. Improvements in well-being and self-esteem were similar for both treatments. If testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily should be used for clinical treatment, regular monitoring of androgen serum levels is needed.",

        "abstract": "Periods of intense hormonal fluctuations have been associated with heightened prevalence and exacerbation of underlying psychiatric illness, particularly the occurrence of premenstrual dysphoria, puerperal depression and depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition. It has been speculated that sex steroids, such as estrogens, progestogens, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone, exert a significant modulation of brain functioning, possibly through interactions with various neurotransmitter systems. It is therefore intuitive that abrupt alterations of these hormones would interfere with mood and behavior. On the other hand, accumulating data suggest that hormonal interventions may also promote relief or even remission of depressive symptoms, as already demonstrated in studies on perimenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol. This article reviews the potential role of sex hormones for the treatment of depressive disorders in women. There are preliminary, but promising data on the use of estradiol and testosterone for specific subpopulations. Further studies would help to better delineate the usage of these compounds as an antidepressant strategy (monotherapy or augmenting treatment).",
