Case summary: An 87-year-old female with a history of osteoarthritis and spinal stenosis presented with a five month history of severe right hip pain. She had been seen by multiple specialists and hospitalized many times. During these encounters, she was prescribed a long list of pain medications. However, these medications did not improve her pain and added to her risk of adverse drug events. After exhausting traditional Western medical therapies, she received a referral to the UCLA Center for East\u2013West Medicine. There, clinicians treated her with a nonpharmacological integrative East-West medicine approach that included acupuncture, dry needling of trigger points, and education on self-acupressure. Her pain began improving and she was able to cut back on analgesic use under physician supervision. Ultimately, she improved to the point where she was able to discontinue all of her pain medications. Symptomatic relief was evidenced by improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Conclusions: This case study suggests that integrative East\u2013West medicine may have the potential to reduce the incidence of polypharmacy in elderly patients presenting with pain conditions and improve their quality of life.",

            "abstract": "Health care prosperity is the most challenging task for human being in the present dangerous COVID scenario and the discovery proposes an augmented reality based personalized smart diet assistance system which provides diet recommendations, appropriate time, type, quantity and method of consumption of a food item diet based on user health parameters based on location and event activities. The augmented reality based system comprises a user data input, an image processing, food consumption assistance, transmissible disease information retrieval and diet planning modules. The system incorporates an AI based camera to scan a food item before or after cooking and utilizes augmented reality to indicate the nutritional information. The proposed system provides personalized diet recommendations to the user based on personal data such as height, weight, existing medical conditions and thereof of a user. The system retrieves existing transmissible diseases data from world health organizations and data from news articles about any viral infections or diseases to suggest immunity boosting foods to the user to thereby safeguard the user against such diseases or infections.",
