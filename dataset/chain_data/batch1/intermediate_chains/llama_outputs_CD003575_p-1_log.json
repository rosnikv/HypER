            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nCollagenous colitis (CC) is a well-described entity causing chronic diarrhea and characteristic histologic findings. Several treatment options have been suggested, but no controlled data are available. We conducted a placebo-controlled trial to show the clinical and histologic effects of budesonide in CC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 14) or budesonide 9 mg daily (n = 14) for 8 weeks. Patients were evaluated clinically, and blinded biopsy specimens were analyzed from fixed locations at weeks 0 and 8. Clinical response was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in the disease activity score (number of bowel movements in the last 7 days). At week 8, nonresponders received open-label budesonide for the next 8-week period; responders discontinued treatment and were followed up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree patients discontinued the study prematurely. Intention-to-treat analysis showed clinical response in 8 of 14 patients in the budesonide group compared with 3 of 14 responders for placebo (P = 0.05) after 8 weeks of blinded therapy, together with improved stool consistency. Histologically, there was no change in the mean thickness of the collagen band but a significant decrease of the lamina propria infiltrate in the budesonide group (P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is efficacious in inducing short-term clinical response in CC with significant reduction of the histologic infiltrate in the lamina propria.",

            "abstract": "Background Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA\u20105 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB\u201012 (AB\u2010Cap\u201010) in patients with CC. Materials and Methods Patients with CC and diarrhea were in a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled study randomized (2:1) to AB\u2010Cap\u201010 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550%. Secondary end points were changes in bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal bloating and pain. Results Twenty\u2010nine patients were randomized: 21 to probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550% occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18\u201384) to 23 (range 11\u201356; P < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days (range 0\u20137 days) to 1 day (range 0\u20137 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group. Conclusions AB\u2010Cap\u201010 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease course of CC.",

            "abstract": "Background Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA\u20105 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB\u201012 (AB\u2010Cap\u201010) in patients with CC. Materials and Methods Patients with CC and diarrhea were in a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled study randomized (2:1) to AB\u2010Cap\u201010 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550%. Secondary end points were changes in bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal bloating and pain. Results Twenty\u2010nine patients were randomized: 21 to probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550% occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18\u201384) to 23 (range 11\u201356; P < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days (range 0\u20137 days) to 1 day (range 0\u20137 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group. Conclusions AB\u2010Cap\u201010 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease course of CC.",

Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.",

            "abstract": "The cytokine response of macrophages to probiotic lactobacilli varies between strains, and the balance of IL-10/IL-12 production is crucial for determination of the direction of the immune response. To clarify the mechanism whereby Lactobacillus strains differentially induce production of IL-10 and IL-12, we examined the potential relationship between cytokine production and MAPK activation. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, Lactobacillus plantarum potently induced IL-10 but weakly induced IL-12 production, whereas L. casei potently induced IL-12 but weakly induced IL-10 production. Kinetic analysis of the activation of ERK, p38, and JNK showed that L. plantarum induced a more rapid and intense activation of MAPKs, especially of ERK, than L. casei. A selective blockade of ERK activation induced by L. plantarum resulted in a decrease in IL-10 production and a simultaneous increase in IL-12 production. Interestingly, when macrophages were stimulated with a combination of L. plantarum and L. casei, IL-10 production was induced synergistically. We identified cell wall teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid as key factors for triggering the synergistic induction of IL-10 production, although these teichoic acids alone only weakly induced IL-10 production. The effect of these teichoic acids on IL-10 production was mediated by TLR2-dependent ERK activation. Our data demonstrate that activation of the ERK pathway is critical for determination of the balance of the IL-10/IL-12 response of macrophages to lactobacilli and that predominant IL-12 production induced by certain lactobacilli such as L. casei can be converted into predominant IL-10 production when stimulated in the presence of teichoic acids.",

            "abstract": "Specific intestinal microbiota has been shown to induce Foxp3+ regulatory T cell development. However, it remains unclear how development of another regulatory T cell subset, Tr1 cells, is regulated in the intestine. Here, we analyzed the role of two probiotic strains of intestinal bacteria, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve in T cell development in the intestine. B. breve, but not L. casei, induced development of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells that express cMaf, IL-21, and Ahr in the large intestine. Intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) mediated B. breve-induced development of IL-10-producing T cells. CD103+ DCs from Il10 \u2212/\u2212, Tlr2 \u2212/\u2212, and Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed defective B. breve-induced Tr1 cell development. B. breve-treated CD103+ DCs failed to induce IL-10 production from co-cultured Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 T cells. B. breve treatment of Tlr2 \u2212/\u2212 mice did not increase IL-10-producing T cells in the colonic lamina propria. Thus, B. breve activates intestinal CD103+ DCs to produce IL-10 and IL-27 via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway thereby inducing IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in the large intestine. Oral B. breve administration ameliorated colitis in immunocompromised mice given na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from wild-type mice, but not Il10 \u2212/\u2212 mice. These findings demonstrate that B. breve prevents intestinal inflammation through the induction of intestinal IL-10-producing Tr1 cells.",

However, it remains unclear how development of another regulatory T cell subset, Tr1 cells, is regulated in the intestine. Here, we analyzed the role of two probiotic strains of intestinal bacteria, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve in T cell development in the intestine. B. breve, but not L. casei, induced development of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells that express cMaf, IL-21, and Ahr in the large intestine. Intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) mediated B. breve-induced development of IL-10-producing T cells. CD103+ DCs from Il10 \u2212/\u2212, Tlr2 \u2212/\u2212, and Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed defective B. breve-induced Tr1 cell development. B. breve-treated CD103+ DCs failed to induce IL-10 production from co-cultured Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 T cells. B. breve treatment of Tlr2 \u2212/\u2212 mice did not increase IL-10-producing T cells in the colonic lamina propria. Thus, B. breve activates intestinal CD103+ DCs to produce IL-10 and IL-27 via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway thereby inducing IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in the large intestine. Oral B. breve administration ameliorated colitis in immunocompromised mice given na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from wild-type mice, but not Il10 \u2212/\u2212 mice. These findings demonstrate that B. breve prevents intestinal inflammation through the induction of intestinal IL-10-producing Tr1 cells.",

Here, we analyzed the role of two probiotic strains of intestinal bacteria, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve in T cell development in the intestine. B. breve, but not L. casei, induced development of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells that express cMaf, IL-21, and Ahr in the large intestine. Intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) mediated B. breve-induced development of IL-10-producing T cells. CD103+ DCs from Il10 \u2212/\u2212, Tlr2 \u2212/\u2212, and Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed defective B. breve-induced Tr1 cell development. B. breve-treated CD103+ DCs failed to induce IL-10 production from co-cultured Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 T cells. B. breve treatment of Tlr2 \u2212/\u2212 mice did not increase IL-10-producing T cells in the colonic lamina propria. Thus, B. breve activates intestinal CD103+ DCs to produce IL-10 and IL-27 via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway thereby inducing IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in the large intestine. Oral B. breve administration ameliorated colitis in immunocompromised mice given na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from wild-type mice, but not Il10 \u2212/\u2212 mice. These findings demonstrate that B. breve prevents intestinal inflammation through the induction of intestinal IL-10-producing Tr1 cells.",

            "abstract": "Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play important role in regulation of immune responses to self-antigens. Alterations in frequency and function of Tregs have been reported in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) subjects. Tregs have the potential to prevent destruction of pancreatic beta cells by targeting effector T-cells (Teff) and other immune cells causing inflammation. Therefore, strategies to increase Treg cell numbers and function are being explored as potential immunotherapeutic approaches in treating T1D. Today, several groups are involved in exploring different Treg cell types, sources, induction procedures and experimental systems in pursuit of generation of highly efficacious and stable Tregs for their clinical applications. Various protocols have been developed for the induction and expansion of islet antigen specific Tregs and polyclonal Tregs. Studies have shown that antigen specific Tregs are required at less number and are more efficient than polyclonal Tregs in suppressing autoimmune diabetes and they do not cause generalized immune suppression. Alternatively, generation of colonic Tregs (cTregs) has also gathered attention in recent years as an approach to limit pancreatic inflammation via gut induced tolerance. With a definitive treatment for T1D still elusive, application of Tregs as a part of combination therapy seems promising in treatment of T1D.",

The paper explores the potential of Tregs in treating Type 1 Diabetes, which is a different application but related to the immune system regulation. Therefore, the key hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the concept of Tregs, which is related to the source paper's findings."
