        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) given for up to 4 years in patients with active, longstanding rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Patients responding inadequately to MTX were entered into a 24 week, controlled study (ARMADA) with adalimumab plus MTX or placebo plus MTX, and some were enrolled in a subsequent open label extension. The efficacy and safety of treatment were evaluated. Additional analyses were made for those patients whose corticosteroid and/or MTX dosages were adjusted during the extension. Results: Of 271 patients in the original ARMADA trial, 262 received at least one dose of adalimumab and were evaluated. At the time of analysis, 162/262 (62%) patients had remained in the study and received treatment for a mean of 3.4 years. Withdrawals were for lack of efficacy (8%), adverse events (12%), and other reasons (18%). In 147 patients who completed 4 years\u2019 treatment, efficacy achieved at 6 months was maintained. At 4 years, 78%, 57%, and 31% had achieved ACR20/50/70; 43% achieved clinical remission (DAS28 <2.6); and 22% had no physical function abnormalities (HAQ\u200a=\u200a0). Results were similar for 196 patients who received treatment for 2\u20134 years. Efficacy was maintained in many patients when dosages were decreased (corticosteroids (51/81 (63%) patients), MTX (92/217 (42%)), or both (25/217 (12%))). Serious adverse events were comparable during open label treatment and the controlled phase. Serious infections occurring during open label treatment and the blinded period were similar (2.03 v 2.30 events per 100 patient-years, respectively). Conclusions: Adalimumab plus MTX sustained clinical response and remission in patients with RA during 4 years. The safety profile during the first 6 months was similar to that after 4 years\u2019 follow up. Reduction of corticosteroid and/or MTX dosages did not adversely affect long term efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To determine whether the tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) antagonist adalimumab (Humira\u00ae) can be efficacious after secondary loss of efficacy (i.e. loss of clinical response in patients who had initially demonstrated clinical response) to infliximab (Remicade\u00ae) or etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae). Patients and methods: We studied 36 patients from the Stockholm TNF\u2010\u03b1 follow\u2010up registry (STURE) who received adalimumab after secondary loss of efficacy to infliximab (group A, n = 27) or etanercept (group B, n = 9), and 26 patients who were started on adalimumab as the first TNF\u2010\u03b1 antagonist (group C). Results: In group A, the baseline disease activity score 28 (DAS28) at infliximab institution was 5.5\u00b10.2. During infliximab treatment, the mean best DAS28 was 3.7\u00b10.2 (p<0.001), but increased to 5.2\u00b10.3 when infliximab was stopped. After 3 months on adalimumab, the mean DAS28 decreased to 4.5\u00b10.3 (p<0.003), and then to 4.2\u00b10.2 at 6 months (p<0.001). In group B, the baseline DAS28 at etanercept institution was 6.6\u00b10.5. During etanercept treatment, the mean best DAS28 was 4.6\u00b10.5 (p<0.01), but increased to 5.7\u00b10.4 by the time etanercept was stopped.

After 6 months of adalimumab therapy, the DAS28 decreased to 3.5\u00b10.4 (p<0.001). ACR20 responses with adalimumab in groups A, B, and C were similar (70\u201378%). Conclusions: For patients with secondary loss of efficacy from infliximab or etanercept, switching to adalimumab can restore a good clinical response.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the safety of adalimumab in global clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Safety data for adalimumab treated patients from randomised controlled trials, open label extensions, and two phase IIIb open label trials were analysed. In addition, postmarketing spontaneous reports of adverse events in the United States were collected following Food and Drug Administration approval of adalimumab on 31 December 2002. Results: As of 15 April 2005, the RA clinical trial safety database analysed covered 10 050 patients, representing 12 506 patient-years (PYs) of adalimumab exposure. The rate of serious infections, 5.1/100 PYs, was comparable to that reported on 31 August 2002 (4.9/100 PYs), and to published reports of RA populations naive to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Following implementation of tuberculosis (TB) screening in clinical trials, the rate of TB decreased. There were 34 cases of TB as of this analysis (0.27/100 PYs). The standardised incidence ratio for lymphoma was 3.19 (95% CI 1.78 to 5.26), consistent with the observed increased incidence in the general RA population. As of 30 June 2005, there were an estimated 78 522 PYs of exposure to adalimumab in the US postmarketing period. Seventeen TB cases were spontaneously reported (0.02/100 PYs) from the US. Rates of other postmarketing events of interest, such as congestive heart failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, opportunistic infections, blood dyscrasias, lymphomas, and demyelinating disease, support observations from clinical trials. Conclusion: Analyses of these data demonstrate that long term adalimumab treatment is generally safe and well tolerated in patients with RA.",

Patients received anti-TNF therapy, and changes in scores on the Short Form 36 (SF-36), SF-6D, modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, and visual analog scales for patients' assessments of pain, fatigue, and global status from baseline to followup examinations at 3 and 6 months were compared. Data were adjusted for age, sex, and baseline values and are presented as crude estimates as well as standardized response means.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups had improvements in all measures at 3 and 6 months. At 3 months, the changes were significantly better in the AS group compared with the RA group for all measures except the SF-36 social functioning scores. At 6 months, all changes were numerically greater in the AS group. Differences were significant for the SF-36 role emotional scores and were borderline significant for the SF-36 physical functioning, role physical, and vitality scores and for the SF-6D scores.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this real-life setting, patients with AS experienced improvement in HRQOL that was comparable to, and sometimes greater than, that observed in RA patients. These results support the idea that patients with AS should have the same access to TNF-blocking agents as patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 antagonists are promising therapeutic agents for patients with severe autoimmune and rheumatologic conditions. Unfortunately, their use has been associated with an increased rate of tuberculosis, endemic mycoses, and intracellular bacterial infections. Infliximab, 1 of 3 available drugs in this novel class, appears to be associated with the greatest risk of infection, likely because of its long half-life and induction of monocyte apoptosis. Prospective trials are necessary to determine the exact risk associated with these agents, particularly the newer TNF-\u03b1 antagonists. More specific TNF-\u03b1 blockers, which reduce inflammation while maintaining adequate immunity, are needed. In the meantime, a thorough work-up is mandatory for all febrile illness occurring in TNF-\u03b1 blocker recipients. We present 4 patients who developed severe infections during TNF-\u03b1 antagonist therapy, review the literature, and discuss current guidelines for surveillance and prophylaxis.

Whereas the clinical and CRP changes among ACR20 nonresponders to infliximab plus MTX were small and much lower than among ACR20 responders to this treatment, radiographic progression among ACR20 nonresponders to infliximab plus MTX was significantly inhibited (P < 0.001) compared with ACR20 nonresponders to MTX plus placebo. Radiographic progression was much greater in patients receiving MTX plus placebo than in patients receiving infliximab plus MTX, irrespective of ACR response status (mean change in modified Sharp/van der Heijde score 6.0 in ACR20 responders and 7.2 in ACR20 nonresponders in the MTX plus placebo-treated group, versus 0.1 in ACR20 responders and 1.2 in ACR20 nonresponders in the infliximab plus MTX-treated group). Furthermore, among patients who were ACR20 nonresponders through week 54, patients who were DAS nonresponders at weeks 30 and 54, and patients without any improvement in individual clinical variables, those receiving infliximab plus MTX still demonstrated inhibition of structural damage that was statistically significant compared with inhibition in patients who received MTX plus placebo (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEven in patients without clinical improvement, treatment with infliximab plus MTX provided significant benefit with regard to the destructive process, suggesting that in such patients these 2 measures of disease are dissociated.",

        "title": "The consequences of rheumatoid arthritis: quality of life measures in the individual patient.",
        "abstract": "Despite conventional treatment, RA still has many deleterious consequences. From the patients' perspective, these include persistent pain, functional disability, fatigue, and depression modified by health beliefs and underlying psychological problems. Disability is a consequence of pain, active synovitis and joint damage. It is usually assessed by self-reported questionnaire; the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) remains the dominant disability measure, although generic health measures such as Short Form-36 and Nottingham Health Profile provide similar information. Treatment with disease modifying drugs and biologic agents improves pain, fatigue and disability. We specifically evaluated the effects of both these drugs and also disease duration on disability assessed by HAQ scores, as there is most information on this topic and it is of fundamental importance to patients. In early RA HAQ gives a 'J-shaped' curve; the initial fall is due to the immediate benefits of treatment and the subsequent gradual rise due to the inability of therapy to fully suppress the disease or prevent progressive joint damage. In established RA HAQ scores increase by about 1% annually and over 25 years average HAQ scores increase by 1.0. Disease modifying drugs and biologics both significantly reduce HAQ scores and the reduction is maintained for 2-5 years. This reduction is seen in both early and established disease. Early steroid therapy has immediate symptomatic treatment, but does not have long-term benefits. Over 5 years the impact of aggressive therapy with disease modifying drugs declines and there is evidence that insufficient treatment is given to many patients with RA. The outcome of RA is greatly improved by current treatment with disease modifying drugs and biologic agents. However, more needs to be done and achieving better results is enhanced by routinely measuring the impact of the disease in routine practice.",

However, they are associated with rare but severe adverse events such as serious infections, lymphoma, or chronic heart failure. In addition, dosing regimens and routes of administration differ substantially among biologics. In a systematic review, we assessed the comparative efficacy and safety of biologic agents for RA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched electronic databases up to May 2006. We limited evidence to controlled trials for efficacy but included observational evidence for safety. Outcomes of interest were clinical response, radiographic progression, and quality of life. Given the paucity of head-to-head evidence, we conducted adjusted, indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-six controlled trials provided efficacy data; 18 additional studies assessed safety. The only evidence directly comparing 2 biologic agents was a nonrandomized, open-label trial that found no differences in effectiveness and safety between etanercept and infliximab. Adjusted indirect comparisons indicate no significant differences in efficacy between anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs. However, anti-TNF drugs appear to be more efficacious than anakinra, although not all comparisons reached statistical significance. Because of the lack of sound longterm safety data, evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the comparative safety of biologics.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAnti-TNF drugs appear to be more efficacious than anakinra but do not differ significantly among each other.

However, their efficacy in daily practice, depending on the specific diagnosis or the use of concomitant therapy, remains to be confirmed.

        "title": "Adalimumab in the therapy of uveitis in childhood",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Chronic anterior uveitis in children often takes a serious course. Despite various immunosuppressive drugs some children do not respond sufficiently and there is a high risk of them becoming seriously disabled. Anti-TNF alpha therapy has been shown by our group and others to be mostly ineffective (Etanercept) or partly effective (Infliximab) with the risk of anaphylactic reactions. Here we report on 18 young patients treated with Adalimumab (Humira\u00ae), a complete humanised anti-TNF alpha antibody. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 18 patients, who were treated with Adalimumab (20\u201340 mg, every 2 weeks, when ineffective every week); 17 had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one was without detectable underlying disease. The age at onset of arthritis varied from 0.5\u201315 years and for uveitis from 2\u201319 years. Patients were included when the previous anti-inflammatory therapy had been ineffective. It consisted of systemic steroids (n\u200a=\u200a18), Cyclosporin A (n\u200a=\u200a18), Methotrexate (n\u200a=\u200a18), Azathioprine (n\u200a=\u200a12), Mycophenolate mofetil (n\u200a=\u200a4), Cyclophosphamide (n\u200a=\u200a2), Leflunomide (n\u200a=\u200a3), Etanercept (n\u200a=\u200a8) and Infliximab (n\u200a=\u200a5). The grading for uveitis was: (a) effective: no relapse or more than two relapses less than before treatment, (b) mild: one relapse less than before treatment, (c) no response: no change in relapse rate and (d) worsening: more relapses under treatment than before. The grading for arthritis (depending on the clinical findings), using three out of six parameters of the ACR PED Criteria, was: effective, mild, no response, worsening. Results: For arthritis (n\u200a=\u200a16) the response to Adalimumab was effective in 10 of 16 patients, mild in three patients, three did not respond. For uveitis (n\u200a=\u200a18) Adalimumab was effective in 16, mild in one child, and one patient did not show any effect. After a very good response initially a shorter application time had to be used to maintain the good anti-inflammatory effect in one child. Additional immunosuppressive treatment was used in seven of the effectively treated children. Due to elevation of liver enzymes in one patient, who also took MTX, Adalimumab had to be discontinued. No anaphylactic reactions or increased frequency of infections since start of Adalimumab treatment was reported. Conclusions: For our group of children with long lasting disease our results show that Adalimumab was effective or mildly effective against the arthritis in 81%, but in uveitis in 88%. While these results regarding arthritis are comparable with other TNF-alpha blocking drugs (Etanercept), Adalimumab seems to be much more effective against uveitis than Etanercept. Anaphylactic reactions, found in a previous study from our group after Infliximab treatment, were not seen with Adalimumab. The necessary dosage and the treatment period, which probably have to be defined individually for each patient, remain unclear.",

All serious infections, stratified by site and organism, were included in the analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween December 2001 and September 2005, there were 525 serious infections in the anti-TNF-treated cohort and 56 in the comparison cohort (9,868 and 1,352 person-years of followup, respectively). The incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted for baseline risk, for the anti-TNF-treated cohort compared with the comparison cohort was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.68-1.57). However, the frequency of serious skin and soft tissue infections was increased in anti-TNF-treated patients, with an adjusted IRR of 4.28 (95% confidence interval 1.06-17.17). There was no difference in infection risk between the 3 main anti-TNF drugs. Nineteen serious bacterial intracellular infections occurred, exclusively in patients in the anti-TNF-treated cohort.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with active RA, anti-TNF therapy was not associated with increased risk of overall serious infection compared with DMARD treatment, after adjustment for baseline risk. In contrast, the rate of serious skin and soft tissue infections was increased, suggesting an important physiologic role of TNF in host defense in the skin and soft tissues beyond that in other tissues.",

Methods: The study was carried out on 132 patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis refractory to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients were treated with infliximab (n\u200a=\u200a63), etanercept (n\u200a=\u200a35) or adalimumab (n\u200a=\u200a34). All patients completed 1 year of follow-up, and 126 were evaluable for clinical response according to the disease activity score (DAS) criteria. IgM, IgA and IgG rheumatoid factors and anti-CCP antibodies were assessed by ELISA both before anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment and 1 year later. Results: The DAS response was reached in 66% of evaluable patients (61% infliximab, 65% etanercept and 76% adalimumab; p\u200a=\u200a0.354). A significant reduction in the rheumatoid factor level was reported by all treatment groups after 1 year. The frequency of positive tests for the different antibodies did not differ between responders and non-responders at baseline; however, significantly higher IgA rheumatoid factor levels were reported by the non-responder group (130.4 U/ml (interquartile range 13.8\u2013276.7) v 24.8 U/ml (10.2\u201390.8); p\u200a=\u200a0.003). A significant decrease (p<0.001) in the levels of all rheumatoid factor isotypes in the responder group was reported after 1 year of treatment, whereas anti-CCP antibody levels were not significantly affected. Conclusions: According to the clinical response, anti-TNF\u03b1 agents seem to reduce IgM, IgG and IgA rheumatoid factor levels. More interestingly, high pretreatment levels of IgA rheumatoid factor are associated with a poor clinical response to TNF\u03b1 inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab and methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Data from an ongoing longitudinal observational study in Norway were used to compare response to treatment with two different adalimumab regimens (monotherapy, n\u200a=\u200a84; combination with MTX, n\u200a=\u200a99). Patients were assessed with measures of disease activity, health status and utility scores. Within-group changes were analysed from baseline to follow-up at 3 and 6 months and the changes were compared between groups after adjustment for the propensity score. The groups were also compared for the proportions of patients achieving European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response, Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 remission and treatment terminations. Results: The improvement from baseline was significant for all measures in the adalimumab and MTX group, but only for DAS28, joint counts, two Short-form Health Survey with 36 questions (SF-36) dimensions and patient\u2019s and investigator\u2019s global assessment in the monotherapy group. All between-group differences were numerically in favour of combination therapy and significant for C reactive protein, joint counts, DAS28, Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, investigator\u2019s global assessment, four SF-36 dimensions and Short Form 6D at 6 months. More patients in the combination therapy group reached EULAR good response (p<0.001) and remission (p\u200a=\u200a0.07). At 6 months, 80.8% of the patients in the combination therapy group and 59.5% in the monotherapy group remained on treatment (p\u200a=\u200a0.002). More withdrawals in the monotherapy group were due to adverse events. Conclusions: Our results were consistent across several categories of end points and suggest that adalimumab combined with MTX is effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated in daily clinical practice and is superior to adalimumab monotherapy.",

The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients with a 20% response according to the ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis International Working Group criteria for improvement (ASAS20) at week 12. Secondary outcome measures included the ASAS20 at week 24 and multiple measures of disease activity, spinal mobility, and function, as well as ASAS partial remission.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 12, 58.2% of adalimumab-treated patients (121 of 208) achieved an ASAS20 response, compared with 20.6% of placebo-treated patients (22 of 107) (P < 0.001).

Therefore, anti-TNF antibody therapies may increase the risk of serious infections and malignancies.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the extent to which anti-TNF antibody therapies may increase the risk of serious infections and malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by performing a meta-analysis to derive estimates of sparse harmful events occurring in randomized trials of anti-TNF therapy.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nA systematic literature search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and electronic abstract databases of the annual scientific meetings of both the European League Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology was conducted through December 2005. This search was complemented with interviews of the manufacturers of the 2 licensed anti-TNF antibodies.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nWe included randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the 2 licensed anti-TNF antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab) used for 12 weeks or more in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nine trials met our inclusion criteria, including 3493 patients who received anti-TNF antibody treatment and 1512 patients who received placebo.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nData on study characteristics to assess study quality and intention-to-treat data for serious infections and malignancies were abstracted. Published information from the trials was supplemented by direct contact between principal investigators and industry sponsors.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nWe calculated a pooled odds ratio (Mantel-Haenszel methods with a continuity correction designed for sparse data) for malignancies and serious infections (infection that requires antimicrobial therapy and/or hospitalization) in anti-TNF-treated patients vs placebo patients. We estimated effects for high and low doses separately. The pooled odds ratio for malignancy was 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-9.1) and for serious infection was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.3-3.1). Malignancies were significantly more common in patients treated with higher doses compared with patients who received lower doses of anti-TNF antibodies. For patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies in the included trials, the number needed to harm was 154 (95% CI, 91-500) for 1 additional malignancy within a treatment period of 6 to 12 months. For serious infections, the number needed to harm was 59 (95% CI, 39-125) within a treatment period of 3 to 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is evidence of an increased risk of serious infections and a dose-dependent increased risk of malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF antibody therapy. The formal meta-analysis with pooled sparse adverse events data from randomized controlled trials serves as a tool to assess harmful drug effects.",

Concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs were permitted. Results: In all 1346 patients with rheumatoid arthritis received anakinra for up to three years. Patients had varying levels of disease severity, concomitant drug use, and comorbid conditions. Cumulative, exposure adjusted event (EAE) rates for all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and deaths were similar during each year of anakinra treatment; the overall rate (0 to 3 years) was similar to that observed for controls during the blinded phase. The most frequent AEs were injection site reactions (122.26 events/100 patient-years), rheumatoid arthritis progression (67.80 events/100 patient-years), and upper respiratory infections (26.09 events/100 patient-years). The EAE rate of serious infections was higher for patients treated with anakinra for 0 to 3 years (5.37 events/100 patient-years) than for controls during the blinded phase (1.65 events/100 patient-years). However, if the patient was not receiving corticosteroid treatment at baseline, the serious infection rate was substantially lower (2.87 event/100 patient-years). The overall incidence of malignancies was consistent with expected rates reported by SEER. Neutralising antibodies developed in 25 patients, but appeared to be transient in 12; neutralising antibody status did not appear related to occurrence of malignancies or serious infections.
