        "abstract": ": We have previously shown that 70% of patients experience nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough (defined as pH\u2003<\u20034 for more than 60\u2003min between 22.00 and 06.00\u2003hours) on twice a day (b.d.) proton pump inhibitor. Adding 150 or 300\u2003mg of ranitidine at bedtime is more effective than additional omeprazole at bedtime in control of night\u2010time acid breakthrough.",

        "abstract": "Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough is defined as night\u2010time periods when gastrin pH falls below 4.0 for greater than 1h during administration of a proton pump inhibitor. This phenomenon is a serious problem for patients who require strict control of their gastric acid secretions.",
