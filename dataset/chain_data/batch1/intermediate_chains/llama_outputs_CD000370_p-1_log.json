To assess the efficacy of therapy with the antiviral agent interferon alfa, we randomly assigned 166 patients with chronic hepatitis C to treatment with either 3 million or 1 million units of recombinant interferon alfa three times weekly for 24 weeks, or to no treatment. The probability of normalization or near normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase levels after six months of interferon therapy was 46 percent in patients treated with 3 million units of interferon (P less than 0.001) and 28 percent in those treated with 1 million units (P less than 0.02), but only 8 percent in untreated patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase level became completely normal in 22 of the 26 patients (85 percent) who responded to treatment with 3 million units of interferon and 9 of the 16 patients (56 percent) who responded to treatment with 1 million units. The patients who received 3 million units of interferon had histologic improvement because of the regression of lobular and periportal inflammation. Relapse within six months after the completion of treatment occurred in 51 percent of the patients treated with 3 million units of interferon and 44 percent of those treated with 1 million units. We conclude that a 24-week course of interferon therapy is effective in controlling disease activity in many patients with hepatitis C, although relapse after the cessation of treatment is common.",

Prior to therapy all patients were HCV RNA positive. During therapy, HCV RNA decreased to an undetectable level (< 1 chimpanzee infectious dose per ml) in nine patients at week 4. After week 4, no additional cases of HCV RNA disappearance (< 1 chimpanzee infectious dose per ml) were observed. During follow-up, HCV RNA could not be detected in four of the six patients with a sustained alanine aminotransferase response. These results suggest the probable predictive value of HCV RNA levels for detecting the failure of therapy in an early stage of HCV infection.",

Prior to therapy all patients were HCV RNA positive. During therapy, HCV RNA decreased to an undetectable level (< 1 chimpanzee infectious dose per ml) in nine patients at week 4. After week 4, no additional cases of HCV RNA disappearance (< 1 chimpanzee infectious dose per ml) were observed. During follow-up, HCV RNA could not be detected in four of the six patients with a sustained alanine aminotransferase response. These results suggest the probable predictive value of HCV RNA levels for detecting the failure of therapy in an early stage of HCV infection.",

We retrospectively evaluated the predictive value of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010RNA measurements in the first few months during consensus interferon (CIFN) treatment using a sensitive reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay to determine sustained responses. Data from two large treatment trials, one of IFN\u2010naive patients and one of retreated relapsers and nonresponders, were used, including serum samples at 2\u2010week intervals in the naive study and 8\u2010week intervals in the retreatment study. Patients received initial CIFN (9 \u03bcg) treatment for 6 months and were assessed 6 months after treatment. There were 28 sustained viral responders of 232 CIFN\u2010treated patients. Of the sustained responders, 48% had already cleared HCV RNA from serum (<100 copies/mL) by week 2, 78% by week 4, 81% by week 6, and 96% by week 12. Patients with early HCV\u2010RNA clearance were more likely to have sustained responses than those who responded later. Early clearance of HCV from serum was also associated with greater likelihood of a sustained response to 48 weeks of retreatment with 15 \u03bcg CIFN. Ninety\u2010five percent of the sustained responders were HCV\u2010RNA\u2013negative by week 8 of retreatment. Early assessment of HCV RNA may help in the prediction of sustained responses to IFN and allow the value of continued treatment to be determined early in the course of IFN therapy.",

Data from two large treatment trials, one of IFN\u2010naive patients and one of retreated relapsers and nonresponders, were used, including serum samples at 2\u2010week intervals in the naive study and 8\u2010week intervals in the retreatment study. Patients received initial CIFN (9 \u03bcg) treatment for 6 months and were assessed 6 months after treatment. There were 28 sustained viral responders of 232 CIFN\u2010treated patients. Of the sustained responders, 48% had already cleared HCV RNA from serum (<100 copies/mL) by week 2, 78% by week 4, 81% by week 6, and 96% by week 12. Patients with early HCV\u2010RNA clearance were more likely to have sustained responses than those who responded later. Early clearance of HCV from serum was also associated with greater likelihood of a sustained response to 48 weeks of retreatment with 15 \u03bcg CIFN. Ninety\u2010five percent of the sustained responders were HCV\u2010RNA\u2013negative by week 8 of retreatment. Early assessment of HCV RNA may help in the prediction of sustained responses to IFN and allow the value of continued treatment to be determined early in the course of IFN therapy.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is prevalent worldwide and has become a major cause of liver dysfunction and hepatocellular carcinoma. The high prevalence of HCV reflects the persistent nature of infection and the large frequency of cases that resist the current interferon (IFN)-based anti-HCV therapeutic regimens. HCV resistance to IFN has been attributed, in part, to the function of the viral nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein. NS5A from IFN-resistant strains of HCV can repress the PKR protein kinase, a mediator of the IFN-induced antiviral and apoptotic responses of the host cell and a tumor suppressor. Here we examined the relationship between HCV persistence and resistance to IFN therapy. When expressed in mammalian cells, NS5A from IFN-resistant HCV conferred IFN resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which normally is sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFN. NS5A blocked viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced PKR activation and phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1 in IFN-treated cells, resulting in high levels of VSV mRNA translation. Mutations within the PKR-binding domain of NS5A restored PKR function and the IFN-induced block to viral mRNA translation. The effects due to NS5A inhibition of PKR were not limited to the rescue of viral mRNA translation but also included a block in PKR-dependent host signaling pathways. Cells expressing NS5A exhibited defective PKR signaling and were refractory to apoptosis induced by exogenous dsRNA. Resistance to apoptosis was attributed to an NS5A-mediated block in eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Moreover, cells expressing NS5A exhibited a transformed phenotype and formed solid tumors in vivo. Disruption of apoptosis and tumorogenesis required the PKR-binding function of NS5A, demonstrating that these properties may be linked to the IFN-resistant phenotype of HCV.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is prevalent worldwide and has become a major cause of liver dysfunction and hepatocellular carcinoma. The high prevalence of HCV reflects the persistent nature of infection and the large frequency of cases that resist the current interferon (IFN)-based anti-HCV therapeutic regimens. HCV resistance to IFN has been attributed, in part, to the function of the viral nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein. NS5A from IFN-resistant strains of HCV can repress the PKR protein kinase, a mediator of the IFN-induced antiviral and apoptotic responses of the host cell and a tumor suppressor. Here we examined the relationship between HCV persistence and resistance to IFN therapy. When expressed in mammalian cells, NS5A from IFN-resistant HCV conferred IFN resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which normally is sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFN. NS5A blocked viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced PKR activation and phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1 in IFN-treated cells, resulting in high levels of VSV mRNA translation. Mutations within the PKR-binding domain of NS5A restored PKR function and the IFN-induced block to viral mRNA translation. The effects due to NS5A inhibition of PKR were not limited to the rescue of viral mRNA translation but also included a block in PKR-dependent host signaling pathways. Cells expressing NS5A exhibited defective PKR signaling and were refractory to apoptosis induced by exogenous dsRNA. Resistance to apoptosis was attributed to an NS5A-mediated block in eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Moreover, cells expressing NS5A exhibited a transformed phenotype and formed solid tumors in vivo. Disruption of apoptosis and tumorogenesis required the PKR-binding function of NS5A, demonstrating that these properties may be linked to the IFN-resistant phenotype of HCV.",

Although the genetic basis for this resistance is unknown, accumulated evidence suggests that changes in the heterogeneous viral population (quasispecies) may be an important determinant of viral persistence and response to therapy. Sequences within hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope 1 and envelope 2 genes, inclusive of the hypervariable region 1, were analyzed in parallel with the level of viral replication in serial serum samples obtained from 23 patients who exhibited different patterns of response to therapy and from untreated controls. Our study provides evidence that although the viral diversity before treatment does not predict the response to treatment, the early emergence and dominance of a single viral variant distinguishes patients who will have a sustained therapeutic response from those who subsequently will experience a breakthrough or relapse. A dramatic reduction in genetic diversity leading to an increasingly homogeneous viral population was a consistent feature associated with viral clearance in sustained responders and was independent of HCV genotype. The persistence of variants present before treatment in patients who fail to respond or who experience a breakthrough during therapy strongly suggests the preexistence of viral strains with inherent resistance to IFN. Thus, the study of the evolution of the HCV quasispecies provides prognostic information as early as the first 2 weeks after starting therapy and opens perspectives for elucidating the mechanisms of treatment failure in chronic hepatitis C.",

Anti-proliferative effects of single treatment with IFN-alpha subtypes or 5-fluorouracil (FU), and of combined treatment with each IFN-alpha subtype and 5-FU were examined on three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, HepG2, HLE and PLC/PRF/5. HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were susceptible to the combination treatment, but HLE cells were not. Proliferation of PLC/PRF/5 cells was also inhibited by the IFN-alpha subtypes singly. In addition, apoptosis was observed in HepG2 cells upon treatment with 5-FU alone and with the combination treatment, and in PLC/PRF/5 cells after single treatment with the IFN-alpha subtypes and after the combination treatment. IFN-alpha subtypes induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5. Analyses by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation revealed increased p53 phosphorylation in HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells but not in HLE cells after combined treatment. Single treatment with IFN-alpha subtypes promoted p53 activation only in PLC/PRF/5 cells.

            "abstract": "Infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) usually results into chronic hepatitis that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Type 1 interferons (IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2) constitute the primary cellular defense against viral infection including HCV. IFN binding to their receptors activates associated Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases, which ultimately leads to phosphorylation and assembly of a signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT)1\u2010STAT2\u2010interferon regulatory factor (IRF)9 trimetric complex called interferon\u2010stimulated gene factor 3 that translocates into the nucleus and binds to the interferon\u2010 stimulated response elements (ISRE), leading to transcriptional induction of several antiviral genes, including double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010activated protein kinase (PKR), 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA). Understanding the mechanisms of how the virus evades this cellular innate defense and establishes a chronic infection is the key for the development of better therapeutics against HCV infection. Here, we demonstrate that p53 could have a crucial role in the cellular innate defense against HCV. We observed significantly higher levels of HCV RNA replication and viral protein expression in the Huh7 cells when their p53 expressions were knocked down. Moreover, IFN treatment was less effective in inhibiting the HCV RNA replication in the p53\u2013knocked\u2010down (p53kd) Huh7 cells. In fact, the activation of the ISRE and the induction of ISGs were significantly attenuated in the p53kd Huh7 cells and p53 was found to directly interact with IRF9. Conclusion: These observations underscore the potential contributions of the tumor suppressor p53 in cellular antiviral immunity against HCV with possible therapeutic implications.

However, little is known about the expression of PKR in the context of p53 and about PKR involvement in p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here, we report that PKR is a p53 target gene and plays an important role in the tumor-suppressor function of p53. Activation of p53 by genotoxic stress induces a significant level of PKR expression by acting on the newly identified cis-acting element (ISRE), which is separated from the IFN-stimulated responsive element on the PKR promoter, resulting in translational inhibition and cell apoptosis. The genotoxin-mediated inhibition of translation is associated with the p53/PKR/elF2a (eukaryotic initiation factor-2\u03b1) pathway. To some extent, p53 activation induced by DNA damage facilitates cell apoptosis by activating PKR. PKR-knockdown human colon cancer cells grew rapidly in nude mice and proved resistant to anti-cancer drugs. These data indicate that p53-mediated tumor suppression can be attributed at least in part to the biological functions of PKR induced by p53 in genotoxic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Type I IFN-induced expression of dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) during viral infection is a well-established antiviral mechanism. However, little is known about the expression of PKR in the context of p53 and about PKR involvement in p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here, we report that PKR is a p53 target gene and plays an important role in the tumor-suppressor function of p53. Activation of p53 by genotoxic stress induces a significant level of PKR expression by acting on the newly identified cis-acting element (ISRE), which is separated from the IFN-stimulated responsive element on the PKR promoter, resulting in translational inhibition and cell apoptosis. The genotoxin-mediated inhibition of translation is associated with the p53/PKR/elF2a (eukaryotic initiation factor-2\u03b1) pathway. To some extent, p53 activation induced by DNA damage facilitates cell apoptosis by activating PKR. PKR-knockdown human colon cancer cells grew rapidly in nude mice and proved resistant to anti-cancer drugs. These data indicate that p53-mediated tumor suppression can be attributed at least in part to the biological functions of PKR induced by p53 in genotoxic conditions.",
