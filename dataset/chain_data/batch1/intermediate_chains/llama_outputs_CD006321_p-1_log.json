Food intake; weight gain; jejunal and ileal diameters, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt depths, and villus heights; mucosal sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter, and micrograms of DNA per centimeter; andd-xylose absorption were measured. There was a significant increase in diameter, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt-villus height, sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter and micrograms of DNA per centimeter in both the jejunum and ileum in response to resection and a significant additive response to the GLP-2 analog in the jejunum but not in the ileum. The ratio of milligrams of protein per centimeter to micrograms of DNA per centimeter of mucosa was not different among groups, consistent with hyperplasia.d-Xylose absorption was significantly reduced in response to resection; however, the GLP-2 analog enhanced the absorptive capacity in control animals and restored the absorptive capacity in resected animals. Thus the GLP-2 analog induces mucosal hyperplasia and enhances the rate and magnitude of the proximal intestinal adaptive response to massive resection.",

            "abstract": "To determine whether treatment with a potent protease-resistant analog of human glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) might augment the adaptive response to massive intestinal resection, rats were divided into resected, which had 75% of the midjejunoileum removed, sham-resected, and nonsurgical groups. Within each group, animals were assigned to 21 days of treatment with the drug (0.1 \u03bcg/g of the GLP-2 analog in phosphate-buffered saline) or vehicle alone subcutaneously twice daily. Food intake; weight gain; jejunal and ileal diameters, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt depths, and villus heights; mucosal sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter, and micrograms of DNA per centimeter; andd-xylose absorption were measured. There was a significant increase in diameter, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt-villus height, sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter and micrograms of DNA per centimeter in both the jejunum and ileum in response to resection and a significant additive response to the GLP-2 analog in the jejunum but not in the ileum. The ratio of milligrams of protein per centimeter to micrograms of DNA per centimeter of mucosa was not different among groups, consistent with hyperplasia.d-Xylose absorption was significantly reduced in response to resection; however, the GLP-2 analog enhanced the absorptive capacity in control animals and restored the absorptive capacity in resected animals. Thus the GLP-2 analog induces mucosal hyperplasia and enhances the rate and magnitude of the proximal intestinal adaptive response to massive resection.",

GLP-2 decreased fractional protein degradation rate, whereas ENT increased fractional protein synthesis rate compared with TPN pigs.

However, ENT, but not GLP-2, increased percentage of BrdU-positive crypt cells above that in TPN piglets.

Gene expression (mRNA) and activities of lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), maltase-glucoamylase (MGA), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), aminopeptidase N (ApN), and A (ApA) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured. Both GLP-2 and enteral nutrition increased mucosal weight (+30\u201340%, p < 0.05) relative to TPN. GLP-2 stimulated jejunal MGA and SI mRNA abundance and activity levels but did not change LPH in parenterally fed pigs (p < 0.05). Enteral nutrition decreased jejunal LPH and MGA mRNA abundance and activity and increased ileal ApN, ApA, and DPP IV activities relative to TPN (p < 0.05). We conclude that GLP-2 and enteral nutrition exert different effects on intestinal enzyme function despite similar effects on intestinal growth. In addition, the effects of GLP-2 on intestinal function in these parenterally fed, premature neonatal pigs differed from those previously reported for similarly fed term neonates.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the intestinotrophic peptide glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which reduces TPN-associated atrophy and maintains nutrient absorption in adult rats, for preventing nutrient malabsorption in neonates receiving TPN. Methods: Term pigs obtained by cesarean delivery received from birth TPN alone (TPN; n = 7) or TPN with GLP-2 (25 nmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121; GLP-2; n = 8) or were fed sow milk enterally (n = 7). The small intestine was removed on postnatal day 6 to measure morphological responses and absorption of glucose, leucine, lysine and proline by intact tissues and brush border membrane vesicles and to quantify the abundances of mRNA and protein for enterocyte glucose transporters (SGLT-1 and GLUT2). Results: Relative to TPN alone, administration of GLP-2 resulted in small intestines that were larger (P < 0.01), had greater abundances of mRNA and protein for SGLT-1, but not for GLUT2, and had higher capacities to absorb nutrients (P < 0.01). Moreover, the intestines of GLP-2 pigs were comparable in size and absorptive capacities with those of pigs fed sow milk enterally.

We investigated the relationship between IGF-I and GLP-2 responses and mucosal growth in rats fasted for 48 h and then refed for 2 or 4 days by continuous intravenous or intragastric infusion or ad libitum feeding. Fasting induced significant decreases in body weight, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and bioactive GLP-2, jejunal mucosal cellularity (mass, protein, DNA, and villus height), IGF-I mRNA, and ileal proglucagon mRNA. Plasma IGF-I concentration was restored to fed levels with 2 days of ad libitum refeeding but not with 4 days of intravenous or intragastric refeeding. Administration of an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-2 (rat GLP-2 3-33) during ad libitum refeeding partially attenuated mucosal growth and prevented the increase in plasma IGF-I to fed levels; however, plasma GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA were restored to fed levels. Intragastric refeeding restored intestinal cellularity and functional capacity (sucrase activity and sodium-glucose transporter-1 expression) to fed levels, whereas intravenous refeeding had no effect. Intestinal regeneration after 4 days of intragastric or 2 days of ad libitum refeeding was positively associated with increases in plasma concentrations of GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA. These data suggest that luminal nutrients stimulate intestinal growth, in part, by increased expression of both GLP-2 and IGF-I.",

Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of organic (selenium-enriched yeast) vs inorganic (sodium selenite) selenium source on fecal end-fermentation products and gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. Alpha and beta diversity of the gut bacterial community were affected by age but not by gender or selenium source. The relative abundance of taxa was differently affected by age, and the DNA concentration of all selected bacterial groups increased with age, although total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate, propionate, caproate and lactate concentrations decreased. Organic selenium was associated with a higher concentration of total VFA, propionate and butyrate, a higher number of DNA copies of Lactobacillus, and a trend to lower DNA copies of Escherichia coli. Effects on fecal microbiome during growth differed with selenium source. Females had higher fecal end-fermentation products related to protein degradation, whereas males had higher DNA concentration of Bifidobacterium. Organic selenium might be beneficial over inorganic for dog food supplementation due to the positive modulation of the gut microbiome observed in puppies.",

            "abstract": "Selenium (Se) deficiency is a widespread and seasonally chronic phenomenon observed in Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) traditionally grazed on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau (QTP). Effects of the dietary addition of Se-enriched yeast (SeY) on the bacterial community in sheep rumen and rumen fermentation were evaluated with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the rumen prokaryotic community. Twenty-four yearling Tibetan rams [initial average body weight (BW) of 31.0 \u00b1 0.64 kg] were randomly divided into four treatment groups, namely, control (CK), low Se (L), medium Se (M), and high Se (H). Each group comprised six rams and was fed a basic diet of fresh forage cut from the alpine meadow, to which SeY was added at prescribed dose rates. This feed trial was conducted for over 35 days. On the final day, rumen fluid was collected using a transesophageal sampler for analyzing rumen pH, NH3-N content, volatile fatty acid (VFA) level, and the rumen microbial community. Our analyses showed that NH3-N, total VFA, and propionate concentrations in the M group were significantly higher than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Both the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and the analysis of similarities revealed that the bacterial population structure of rumen differed among the four groups. The predominant rumen bacterial phyla were found to be Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the three dominant genera in all the samples across all treatments were Christensenellaceae R7 group, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Prevotella 1. The relative abundances of Prevotella 1, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcus 2, Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group, Carnobacterium, and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium were found to differ significantly among the four treatment groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, Tax4fun metagenome estimation revealed that gene functions and metabolic pathways associated with carbohydrate and other amino acids were overexpressed in the rumen microbiota of SeY-supplemented sheep. To conclude, SeY significantly affects the abundance of rumen bacteria and ultimately affects the rumen microbial fermentation.",

            "title": "Selenium Yeast Dietary Supplement Affects Rumen Bacterial Population Dynamics and Fermentation Parameters of Tibetan Sheep (Ovis aries) in Alpine Meadow",
            "abstract": "Selenium (Se) deficiency is a widespread and seasonally chronic phenomenon observed in Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) traditionally grazed on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau (QTP). Effects of the dietary addition of Se-enriched yeast (SeY) on the bacterial community in sheep rumen and rumen fermentation were evaluated with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the rumen prokaryotic community. Twenty-four yearling Tibetan rams [initial average body weight (BW) of 31.0 \u00b1 0.64 kg] were randomly divided into four treatment groups, namely, control (CK), low Se (L), medium Se (M), and high Se (H). Each group comprised six rams and was fed a basic diet of fresh forage cut from the alpine meadow, to which SeY was added at prescribed dose rates. This feed trial was conducted for over 35 days. On the final day, rumen fluid was collected using a transesophageal sampler for analyzing rumen pH, NH3-N content, volatile fatty acid (VFA) level, and the rumen microbial community. Our analyses showed that NH3-N, total VFA, and propionate concentrations in the M group were significantly higher than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Both the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and the analysis of similarities revealed that the bacterial population structure of rumen differed among the four groups. The predominant rumen bacterial phyla were found to be Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the three dominant genera in all the samples across all treatments were Christensenellaceae R7 group, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Prevotella 1. The relative abundances of Prevotella 1, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcus 2, Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group, Carnobacterium, and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium were found to differ significantly among the four treatment groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, Tax4fun metagenome estimation revealed that gene functions and metabolic pathways associated with carbohydrate and other amino acids were overexpressed in the rumen microbiota of SeY-supplemented sheep. To conclude, SeY significantly affects the abundance of rumen bacteria and ultimately affects the rumen microbial fermentation.",
