Therefore, a prospective randomized trial comparing primary stenting with balloon angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction was conducted.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to undergo either primary stenting (n=112) or balloon angioplasty (n=115). The clinical end points were death, recurrent infarction, subsequent bypass surgery, or repeat angioplasty of the infarct-related vessel. The overall mortality rate at 6 months was 2%. Recurrent infarction occurred in 8 patients (7%) after balloon angioplasty and in 1 (1%) after stenting (P=0.036). Subsequent target-vessel revascularization was necessary in 19 (17%) and 4 (4%) patients, respectively (P=0.0016). The cardiac event-free survival rate in the stent group was significantly higher than in the balloon angioplasty group (95% versus 80%; P=0.012).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn selected patients with acute myocardial infarction, primary stenting can be applied safely and effectively, resulting in a lower incidence of recurrent infarction and a significant reduction in the need for subsequent target-vessel revascularization compared with balloon angioplasty.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe recent recognition that coronary-artery stenting has improved the short- and long-term outcomes of patients treated with angioplasty has made it necessary to reevaluate the relative benefits of bypass surgery and percutaneous interventions in patients with multivessel disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 1205 patients were randomly assigned to undergo stent implantation or bypass surgery when a cardiac surgeon and an interventional cardiologist agreed that the same extent of revascularization could be achieved by either technique. The primary clinical end point was freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at one year. The costs of hospital resources used were also determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt one year, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the rates of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Among patients who survived without a stroke or a myocardial infarction, 16.8 percent of those in the stenting group underwent a second revascularization, as compared with 3.5 percent of those in the surgery group. The rate of event-free survival at one year was 73.8 percent among the patients who received stents and 87.8 percent among those who underwent bypass surgery (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The costs for the initial procedure were $4,212 less for patients assigned to stenting than for those assigned to bypass surgery, but this difference was reduced during follow-up because of the increased need for repeated revascularization; after one year, the net difference in favor of stenting was estimated to be $2,973 per patient.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs measured one year after the procedure, coronary stenting for multivessel disease is less expensive than bypass surgery and offers the same degree of protection against death, stroke, and myocardial infarction. However, stenting is associated with a greater need for repeated revascularization.",

The costs for the initial procedure were $4,212 less for patients assigned to stenting than for those assigned to bypass surgery, but this difference was reduced during follow-up because of the increased need for repeated revascularization; after one year, the net difference in favor of stenting was estimated to be $2,973 per patient.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs measured one year after the procedure, coronary stenting for multivessel disease is less expensive than bypass surgery and offers the same degree of protection against death, stroke, and myocardial infarction.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe need for repeated treatment of restenosis of a treated vessel remains the main limitation of percutaneous coronary revascularization. Because sirolimus (rapamycin) inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes and smooth-muscle cells, we compared a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard uncoated stent in patients with angina pectoris.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a randomized, double-blind trial to compare the two types of stents for revascularization of single, primary lesions in native coronary arteries. The trial included 238 patients at 19 medical centers. The primary end point was in-stent late luminal loss (the difference between the minimal luminal diameter immediately after the procedure and the diameter at six months). Secondary end points included the percentage of in-stent stenosis of the luminal diameter and the rate of restenosis (luminal narrowing of 50 percent or more). We also analyzed a composite clinical end point consisting of death, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous or surgical revascularization at 1, 6, and 12 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt six months, the degree of neointimal proliferation, manifested as the mean (+/-SD) late luminal loss, was significantly lower in the sirolimus-stent group (-0.01+/-0.33 mm) than in the standard-stent group (0.80+/-0.53 mm, P<0.001). None of the patients in the sirolimus-stent group, as compared with 26.6 percent of those in the standard-stent group, had restenosis of 50 percent or more of the luminal diameter (P<0.001). There were no episodes of stent thrombosis. During a follow-up period of up to one year, the overall rate of major cardiac events was 5.8 percent in the sirolimus-stent group and 28.8 percent in the standard-stent group (P<0.001). The difference was due entirely to a higher rate of revascularization of the target vessel in the standard-stent group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with a standard coronary stent, a sirolimus-eluting stent shows considerable promise for the prevention of neointimal proliferation, restenosis, and associated clinical events.",

Because sirolimus (rapamycin) inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes and smooth-muscle cells, we compared a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard uncoated stent in patients with angina pectoris.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a randomized, double-blind trial to compare the two types of stents for revascularization of single, primary lesions in native coronary arteries. The trial included 238 patients at 19 medical centers. The primary end point was in-stent late luminal loss (the difference between the minimal luminal diameter immediately after the procedure and the diameter at six months). Secondary end points included the percentage of in-stent stenosis of the luminal diameter and the rate of restenosis (luminal narrowing of 50 percent or more). We also analyzed a composite clinical end point consisting of death, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous or surgical revascularization at 1, 6, and 12 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt six months, the degree of neointimal proliferation, manifested as the mean (+/-SD) late luminal loss, was significantly lower in the sirolimus-stent group (-0.01+/-0.33 mm) than in the standard-stent group (0.80+/-0.53 mm, P<0.001). None of the patients in the sirolimus-stent group, as compared with 26.6 percent of those in the standard-stent group, had restenosis of 50 percent or more of the luminal diameter (P<0.001). There were no episodes of stent thrombosis. During a follow-up period of up to one year, the overall rate of major cardiac events was 5.8 percent in the sirolimus-stent group and 28.8 percent in the standard-stent group (P<0.001). The difference was due entirely to a higher rate of revascularization of the target vessel in the standard-stent group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with a standard coronary stent, a sirolimus-eluting stent shows considerable promise for the prevention of neointimal proliferation, restenosis, and associated clinical events.",

The time course of neointimal growth and risk factors of uncovered stent struts after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) was studied using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe 60 patients were enrolled and classified into G1 (follow-up period <9 months, n=27), G2 (9-24 months, n=18), and G3 (>25 months, n=15). The time elapsed since SES implantation was associated with a significant increase in mean neointimal area and neointimal thickness, and also with a significant decrease in the number of uncovered stent struts (G1: 14.8%, G2: 11.7%, and G3: 4.1%, P<0.001). However, only 17.6% of implanted SES was completely covered by neointima, even in the G3 period. Small-diameter SES, complex coronary lesions with lipid and calcium content adjacent to stent struts, and diabetes predicted delayed neointimal coverage of SES struts in G1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeointima inside SES progressively increases after the routine follow-up period, but only a few SES were completely covered at 3 years after implantation. OCT is a useful modality for assessing neointimal formation after SES implantation, and may give important information about the strategy of antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLate stent thrombosis related to delayed neointimal growth is a major concern after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. The time course of neointimal growth and risk factors of uncovered stent struts after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) was studied using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe 60 patients were enrolled and classified into G1 (follow-up period <9 months, n=27), G2 (9-24 months, n=18), and G3 (>25 months, n=15). The time elapsed since SES implantation was associated with a significant increase in mean neointimal area and neointimal thickness, and also with a significant decrease in the number of uncovered stent struts (G1: 14.8%, G2: 11.7%, and G3: 4.1%, P<0.001). However, only 17.6% of implanted SES was completely covered by neointima, even in the G3 period. Small-diameter SES, complex coronary lesions with lipid and calcium content adjacent to stent struts, and diabetes predicted delayed neointimal coverage of SES struts in G1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeointima inside SES progressively increases after the routine follow-up period, but only a few SES were completely covered at 3 years after implantation. OCT is a useful modality for assessing neointimal formation after SES implantation, and may give important information about the strategy of antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation.",

The purpose of this study was to compare morphological vessel characteristics, including post-stent IR in NIH, between patients with SES and bare metal stents (BMS) using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThirty-seven patients underwent OCT at their post-stent follow-up. OCT signal-intensity deviation (normalized standard-deviation; OCT-NSD) values in NIH were compared between the 2 groups. In addition, the serum concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured. Stent-malapposition rate (1.78% vs. 0.7%; P = 0.016), uncovered stent-strut rate (16% vs. 3.7%; P = 0.0002), peri-stent ulcer like appearance (PSUA; 50% vs. 0%; P = 0.006) were all significantly higher in the SES group than in the BMS group, respectively. The OCT-NSD value was also significantly higher in the SES group than in the BMS group (0.213 \u00b1 0.005 vs. 0.198 \u00b1 0.005; P < 0.001), as was the hs-CRP level (2.54 \u00b1 1.89 vs. 0.64 \u00b1 0.3 mg/L; P = 0.0006). In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between hs-CRP and OCT-NSD (r = 0.471; P = 0.0025).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPSUA-morphology was specific in the SES group, and higher levels of OCT-NSD and hs-CRP after SES implantation suggest sustained IR in NIH compared with following BMS implantation.

            "abstract": "Purpose The impacts of different time courses and the degree of neointimal growth on neointimal morphology have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the morphological features of neointimal tissue after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Materials and Methods The morphological features of neointimal tissue in stented segments with a maximal percentage of cross-sectional area (CSA) stenosis of neointima were evaluated in 507 DES-treated lesions with >100 \u00b5m mean neointimal thickness on follow-up OCT. Neointimal tissue was categorized as homogeneous, heterogeneous, layered, or neoatherosclerotic. Results In lesions with <50% of neointimal CSA stenosis, homogeneous neointima (68.2%) was predominant, followed by heterogeneous neointima (14.1%) and layered neointima (14.1%). In lesions with \u226550% of neointimal CSA stenosis, layered neointima was most frequently observed (68.3%), followed by neoatherosclerotic neointima (25.2%). In subgroup analysis of lesions with \u226550% of neointimal CSA stenosis, 89.5% of the lesions with a stent age <30 months were layered neointima, while 62.3% of the lesions with a stent age \u226530 months were neoatherosclerotic neointima. Conclusion This study suggests that the OCT-detected morphology of DES neointimal tissue was different according to the follow-up time course and degree of neointimal hyperplasia.",

            "abstract": "After coronary stent implantation, neointima formation resembles the wound healing process as it involves the sequential processes of inflammation, granulation, and remodeling. Because antiproliferative drugs and polymers of drug-eluting stents (DESs) delay vascular healing compared with bare metal stents, fibrin deposition can remain long after stent implantation, or inflammation can be excessive. Delayed vascular healing can be associated with adverse clinical outcomes including DES thrombosis or restenosis, and poor endothelization of DES neointima can accelerate neoatherosclerotic change inside the neointima, further contributing to luminal restenosis or neointimal instability. Despite the lack of correlation between pathologic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings, OCT assessments of neointima under various circumstances can reveal vascular responses to stent therapy. Homogeneous, heterogeneous, and layered neointima patterns can be recognized by OCT and can change with time. Homogeneous neointima might be associated with better clinical outcomes after DES implantation, whereas non-homogeneous neointima or neoatherosclerotic change can be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.

The current paper provides further insights into the formation and transformation of neointima, including the processes of inflammation, granulation, and remodeling, and discusses the clinical implications of different neointima patterns. The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, which described the OCT-detected morphology of DES neointimal tissue."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere are few data of clinical outcomes after drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty according to neointimal characteristics. This study investigated long-term clinical outcomes according to timing of in-stent restenosis (ISR) and neointimal characteristics in patients with drug-eluting stent (DES) ISR after DCB angioplasty. Methods\u2004and\u2004Results: In all, 122 patients (122 ISR lesions), treated with DCB under optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination before and after DCB, were categorized as early ISR (<12 months; E-ISR; n=21) and late ISR (\u226512 months; L-ISR; n=101). Associations between OCT-based neointima characteristics and period of ISR, as well as clinical outcomes after DCB were evaluated. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were a composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization (TLR). Quantitative parameters of the neointima were similar, but qualitative characteristics showed significant differences between the E-ISR and L-ISR groups. The incidence of MACE (33.3% vs. 20.8%; P=0.069) and TLR (33.3% vs. 18.5%; P=0.040) was higher in the E-ISR group. In addition, the incidence of MACE was significantly higher for heterogeneous than non-heterogeneous neointima (43.7% vs. 19.6%; P=0.018), but was not significantly associated with neoatherosclerosis (33.4% vs. 18.4%; P=0.168).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDCB angioplasty is less effective for heterogeneous neointima in DES ISR. OCT-based neointimal evaluation may be helpful in guiding treatment of DES ISR.",
