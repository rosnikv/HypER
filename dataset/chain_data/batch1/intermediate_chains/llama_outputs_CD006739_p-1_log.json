Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P <0.0001). Mean prandial glucose and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P <0.0001) and 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P=0.0001), 40 +/- 16 pmol/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (P=0.0312), respectively. HbA1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in LAF237-treated patients (n=42) but increased in participants given placebo (n=29). The between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c after 1 year was -1.1 +/- 0.2% (P <0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nData from this study demonstrate that LAF237 effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to metformin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes.",

Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P <0.0001).

            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIn response to a meal, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are released and modulate glycemic control. Normally these incretins are rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors are a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The degree of DPP-4 inhibition and the level of active incretin augmentation required for glucose lowering efficacy after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the study was to examine the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of sitagliptin.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, single-dose crossover study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted at six investigational sites.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nThe study population consisted of 58 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not on antihyperglycemic agents.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nInterventions included sitagliptin 25 mg, sitagliptin 200 mg, or placebo.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMeasurements included plasma DPP-4 activity; post-OGTT glucose excursion; active and total incretin GIP levels; insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentrations; and sitagliptin pharmacokinetics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSitagliptin dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity over 24 h, enhanced active GLP-1 and GIP levels, increased insulin/C-peptide, decreased glucagon, and reduced glycemic excursion after OGTTs administered at 2 and 24 h after single oral 25- or 200-mg doses of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with no hypoglycemic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study in patients with type 2 diabetes, near maximal glucose-lowering efficacy of sitagliptin after single oral doses was associated with inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity of 80% or greater, corresponding to a plasma sitagliptin concentration of 100 nm or greater, and an augmentation of active GLP-1 and GIP levels of 2-fold or higher after an OGTT.",

            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIn response to a meal, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are released and modulate glycemic control. Normally these incretins are rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors are a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The degree of DPP-4 inhibition and the level of active incretin augmentation required for glucose lowering efficacy after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the study was to examine the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of sitagliptin.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, single-dose crossover study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted at six investigational sites.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nThe study population consisted of 58 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not on antihyperglycemic agents.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nInterventions included sitagliptin 25 mg, sitagliptin 200 mg, or placebo.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMeasurements included plasma DPP-4 activity; post-OGTT glucose excursion; active and total incretin GIP levels; insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentrations; and sitagliptin pharmacokinetics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSitagliptin dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity over 24 h, enhanced active GLP-1 and GIP levels, increased insulin/C-peptide, decreased glucagon, and reduced glycemic excursion after OGTTs administered at 2 and 24 h after single oral 25- or 200-mg doses of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with no hypoglycemic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study in patients with type 2 diabetes, near maximal glucose-lowering efficacy of sitagliptin after single oral doses was associated with inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity of 80% or greater, corresponding to a plasma sitagliptin concentration of 100 nm or greater, and an augmentation of active GLP-1 and GIP levels of 2-fold or higher after an OGTT.",

All included patients were treated with vildagliptin (n=121) or SU (n=121) as add-on to metformin or as monotherapy for 16 weeks. The primary outcome of interest was to compare the proportion of patients with \u22651 hypoglycaemic event (HE) during fasting between vildagliptin and SU cohort. Changes in HbA1c and body weight and treatment adherence were also measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 244 patients enrolled, 120 patients in the vildagliptin cohort (99.2%) and 119 patients in the SU cohort (98.3%) completed the study. Patients experiencing at least one HE were fewer with vildagliptin when compared with SUs (5.8% vs. 14.2%; p<0.033). The reduction in HbA1c was 0.3% with vildagliptin from a baseline of 7.6% and 0.1% with SU from a baseline of 7.4% (between-treatment difference: -0.1% p<0.054). A reduction of 0.3 kg was seen with vildagliptin treatment vs. 0.2 kg weight gain in the SU group. Adverse events were experienced by 15.7% in the vildagliptin cohort and 17.4% in the SU group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe treatment with vildagliptin was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events compared with SUs and was well tolerated with good glycaemic and weight control in patients with T2DM fasting during Ramadan.",

            "abstract": "Hypoglycemia is the most common side effects for most glucose-lowering therapies. It constitutes a serious risk that faces diabetic patients who fast during Ramadan (the 9th month in the Islamic calendar). New glucose-lowering classes like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are efficacious in controlling blood glucose level with less tendency to induce hypoglycemia and thus may constitute a good choice for diabetic patients during Ramadan. This study reviews the safety and efficacy of newer glucose-lowering therapies during Ramadan. This study was accomplished through a careful literature search about studies that assess the benefit and side effects of these new glucose-lowering therapies during Ramadan during September 2015. Vildagliptin, sitagliptin, liraglutide, exenatide, and dapagliflozin were the only studied glucose-lowering therapies. All of the studied newer glucose-lowering therapies except dapagliflozin were associated with reduced risk to induce hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal upset was common with the usage of liraglutide while increased thirst sensation was common with dapagliflozin. In conclusion DPP-4 inhibitors such as vildagliptin and sitagliptin may form a suitable glucose-lowering therapy option for Ramadan fasting patients.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT There are no studies evaluating the glucose variability in different periods of Ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This study examined the effect of Ramadan fasting on interstitial glucose (IG) variability in early,- late-, and post-Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan days in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. Participants had a CGM system connected 2 or 3 days before Ramadan start, which was removed on the third or fourth day of Ramadan. CGM performance continued for a total of 6 days. A second CGM performance started on the 27th or 28th day of Ramadan and ended on the 4th or 5th post-Ramadan day. First, CGM recordings were divided into pre-Ramadan and early-Ramadan CGM, and second recordings into late-Ramadan and post-Ramadan. At each visit, blood pressure, body weight, and waist circumference were measured, and fasting blood samples were collected for HbA1c and plasma glucose. All patients received recommended Ramadan education before Ramadan. Thirty-three patients (mean age 55.0 \u00b1 9.8 years, 73% males) were prospectively included. IG variability, estimated as mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), increased significantly in early-Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan (P = 0.006) but not in late-Ramadan and post-Ramadan recording days. Only patients on >2 anti-diabetic drugs (n = 16, P = 0.019) and those on sulphonylureas (n = 14, P = 0.003) showed significant increase in MAGE in early-Ramadan. No significant changes were seen in coefficient of variation, time in range, time in hyperglycaemia, or time in hypoglycaemia. Except for an initial increase in glucose variability, fasting Ramadan for patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes did not cause any significant changes in glucose variability or time in hypoglycaemia during CGM recording days compared to non-fasting pre-Ramadan period.",

            "abstract": "Ramadan fasting is associated with changes in eating, physical activity, sleeping patterns, and medication. Unfortunately, only limited studies examine glucose variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes who fast in Ramadan. Our study aims to evaluate glucose variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes on oral antidiabetic agents using continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) during and after Ramadan fasting. This observational study was done in The Indonesian Medical Education and Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia, which recruited 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes who underwent Ramadan fasting in 2019. These subjects were free from cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, severe liver disease, chronic gastrointestinal disease and autoimmune disease. Insertion of CGMS for measuring interstitial glucose was performed after at least 2 weeks of Ramadan fasting and 4 weeks after the end of the Ramadan fasting, with a minimum of 3 days observation. The mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) during and after Ramadan were similar (p = 0.94). In line with this, the average interstitial glucose (p = 0.48), the maximum interstitial glucose (p = 0.35), the minimum interstitial glucose (p = 0.24), and the duration of hypoglycemia (p = 0.25) were also similar in both periods. Overall, nutritional intake and energy expenditure during both periods were comparable. Ramadan fasting is not associated with increased glucose variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Thus, Ramadan fasting is safe in subjects with type 2 diabetes with no complications.",
