            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with moderate-to-severe active RA who were receiving MTX for 6 consecutive months, with stable doses for > or = 3 months (those with disease duration of >6 months but <12 years) were randomized into 6 groups: placebo or 0.04, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of anakinra administered in a single, daily, subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (attained an ACR20 response) at week 12.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 419 patients were randomized in the study. Patient demographics and disease status were similar in the 6 treatment groups. The ACR20 responses at week 12 in the 5 active treatment plus MTX groups demonstrated a statistically significant (P = 0.001) dose-response relationship compared with the ACR20 response in the placebo plus MTX group. The ACR20 response rate in the anakinra 1.0-mg/kg (46%; P = 0.001) and 2.0-mg/kg (38%; P = 0.007) dose groups was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (19%). The ACR20 responses at 24 weeks were consistent with those at 12 weeks. Similar improvements in anakinra-treated subjects were noted in individual ACR components, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, onset of ACR20 response, sustainability of ACR20 response, and magnitude of ACR response. Anakinra was safe and well tolerated. Injection site reaction was the most frequently noted adverse event, and this led to premature study withdrawal in 7% (1.0-mg/kg group) to 10% (2.0-mg/kg group) of patients receiving higher doses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with persistently active RA, the combination of anakinra and MTX was safe and well tolerated and provided significantly greater clinical benefit than MTX alone.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with moderate-to-severe active RA who were receiving MTX for 6 consecutive months, with stable doses for > or = 3 months (those with disease duration of >6 months but <12 years) were randomized into 6 groups: placebo or 0.04, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of anakinra administered in a single, daily, subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (attained an ACR20 response) at week 12.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 419 patients were randomized in the study. Patient demographics and disease status were similar in the 6 treatment groups. The ACR20 responses at week 12 in the 5 active treatment plus MTX groups demonstrated a statistically significant (P = 0.001) dose-response relationship compared with the ACR20 response in the placebo plus MTX group. The ACR20 response rate in the anakinra 1.0-mg/kg (46%; P = 0.001) and 2.0-mg/kg (38%; P = 0.007) dose groups was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (19%). The ACR20 responses at 24 weeks were consistent with those at 12 weeks. Similar improvements in anakinra-treated subjects were noted in individual ACR components, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, onset of ACR20 response, sustainability of ACR20 response, and magnitude of ACR response. Anakinra was safe and well tolerated. Injection site reaction was the most frequently noted adverse event, and this led to premature study withdrawal in 7% (1.0-mg/kg group) to 10% (2.0-mg/kg group) of patients receiving higher doses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with persistently active RA, the combination of anakinra and MTX was safe and well tolerated and provided significantly greater clinical benefit than MTX alone.",

Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only.

Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abatacept at a fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg by weight range, or placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe abatacept and placebo groups exhibited similar frequencies of adverse events (90% and 87%, respectively), serious adverse events (13% and 12%, respectively), and discontinuations due to adverse events (5% and 4%, respectively). Five patients (0.5%) in the abatacept group and 4 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group died during the study. Serious infections were more frequent in the abatacept group than in the placebo group (2.9% versus 1.9%). Fewer than 4% of patients in either group experienced a severe or very severe infection. The incidence of neoplasms was 3.5% in both groups. When evaluated according to background therapy, serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the subgroup receiving abatacept plus a biologic agent (22.3%) than in the other subgroups (11.7-12.5%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAbatacept in combination with synthetic DMARDs was well tolerated and improved physical function and physician- and patient-reported disease outcomes. However, abatacept in combination with biologic background therapies was associated with an increase in the rate of serious adverse events. Therefore, abatacept is not recommended for use in combination with biologic therapy.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the safety of abatacept, a selective costimulation modulator, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had been receiving > or =1 traditional nonbiologic and/or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) approved for the treatment of RA for at least 3 months prior to entry into the study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a 1-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abatacept at a fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg by weight range, or placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe abatacept and placebo groups exhibited similar frequencies of adverse events (90% and 87%, respectively), serious adverse events (13% and 12%, respectively), and discontinuations due to adverse events (5% and 4%, respectively). Five patients (0.5%) in the abatacept group and 4 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group died during the study. Serious infections were more frequent in the abatacept group than in the placebo group (2.9% versus 1.9%). Fewer than 4% of patients in either group experienced a severe or very severe infection. The incidence of neoplasms was 3.5% in both groups. When evaluated according to background therapy, serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the subgroup receiving abatacept plus a biologic agent (22.3%) than in the other subgroups (11.7-12.5%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAbatacept in combination with synthetic DMARDs was well tolerated and improved physical function and physician- and patient-reported disease outcomes. However, abatacept in combination with biologic background therapies was associated with an increase in the rate of serious adverse events. Therefore, abatacept is not recommended for use in combination with biologic therapy.",

Recently, new biological agents have become available. Their safety is an important issue. Purpose: To assess if biological agents, ie rituximab, abatacept and anakinra increase the risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in published randomised controlled trials. Data source: A systematic review of the literature using PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane library and abstracts databases (American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings) was performed up to October 2007. This search was completed with data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and manufacturers.

Conclusions: These meta-analyses did not reveal a significant increase in the risk of serious infections during rituximab or abatacept treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, high doses of anakinra may increase this risk, especially when patients have comorbidity factors. Large studies must be performed to confirm this safety profile in daily practice.",

            "abstract": "Background: Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 blockers in rheumatoid arthritis are known to increase the risk of serious infections defined as life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics. Recently, new biological agents have become available. Their safety is an important issue. Purpose: To assess if biological agents, ie rituximab, abatacept and anakinra increase the risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in published randomised controlled trials. Data source: A systematic review of the literature using PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane library and abstracts databases (American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings) was performed up to October 2007. This search was completed with data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and manufacturers. Data extraction: Three fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed to compare serious infection rates between each biological agent and placebo. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method with a continuity correction. Data synthesis: Twelve randomised controlled trials with data concerning serious infections were analysed (three for rituximab, five for abatacept and four for anakinra). They included 745 patients, 1960 patients, 2062 patients and 2112 patients treated by rituximab, abatacept, anakinra and placebo respectively. The overall pooled ORs did not reveal a statistically significant increased risk of serious infection for abatacept and rituximab; this risk was increased for high doses of anakinra (\u2a7e100 mg daily) versus low dose and placebo (ORs\u200a=\u200a9.63 (95% CI, 1.31 to 70.91) and 3.40 (95% CI, 1.11 to 10.46) respectively). Conclusions: These meta-analyses did not reveal a significant increase in the risk of serious infections during rituximab or abatacept treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, high doses of anakinra may increase this risk, especially when patients have comorbidity factors.

Here, one such biologic therapy, the T-cell co-stimulation modulator abatacept, is discussed, exploring clinical evidence published to date on its use in patients with very early arthritis/early RA who are MTX na\u00efve, and in patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists. Data from relevant clinical trials are overviewed, discussing the clinical efficacy of abatacept in early disease, the clinical outcomes over long-term treatment in different patient populations and the effects of abatacept on structural damage. Findings from integrated safety analyses of abatacept clinical trial data, representing 10\u2009366 patient-years of exposure are described, and clinically important safety events, including serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events, are highlighted. It is concluded that abatacept represents an effective treatment option with an established safety profile across different patient populations, including patients with both early and erosive RA and those with established disease.

            "abstract": "We report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated with interstitial pneumonia that deteriorated after the administration of abatacept. A 55-year-old man developed RA and interstitial pneumonia. Although interstitial pneumonia was improved by high-dose glucocorticoids, various disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including infliximab were ineffective for his arthritis. Tacrolimus was effective but was discontinued due to refractory itching and diarrhea. After 2 months, he was registered on the Phase III trial of abatacept in Japan because of worsening of arthritis. From 2 days after the abatacept administration, frothy sputum frequently appeared, but sputum culture was negative. On 13 days after the administration, the interstitial shadow was deteriorated by chest CT as compared with that of 2 months before, and he was dropped out from the trial. On 27 days after the administration, the dose of prednisolone was increased from 2 to 10 mg/day for his arthritis. On 44 days after the administration, the interstitial pneumonia improved. Abatacpet might be the cause of the deterioration of the interstitial pneumonia, but other possibilities such as discontinuation of tacrolimus, flare-up of RA itself or viral infection should be considered. This is the first report of deteriorated interstitial pneumonia after the abatacept administration in the literature. Further cases are needed to identify the relation between abatacept and interstitial pneumonia, however this possibility should be always kept in mind when we use abatacept.",

This paper directly relates to the source paper, as it discusses a potential side effect of abatacept treatment, which is a key aspect of the source paper's findings. The case report builds upon the source paper's discussion of abatacept's safety profile and highlights the need for further research into potential risks associated with its use."

            "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accompanying the increased number of reports on the development or exacerbation of ILD in RA patients following therapy with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) has aroused renewed interest. Although such cases have been reported mainly in association with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the use of other biological DMARDs has also become a matter of concern. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between the use of biological DMARDs and either the development or exacerbation of ILD. Such pulmonary complications may occur in the natural course of RA regardless of the use of biological DMARDs. Since rheumatologists currently aim to achieve remission in RA patients, the administration of biological DMARDs is increasing, even for those with RA-ILD. However, there are no reliable, evidence-based guidelines for deciding whether biological DMARDs can be safely introduced and continued in RA-ILD patients. A standardized staging system for pulmonary conditions of RA-ILD patients is needed when making therapeutic decisions at baseline and monitoring during biological DMARD therapy. Based on the available information regarding the safety of biological DMARDs and the predictive factors for a worse prognosis, this review discusses candidate parameters for risk evaluation of ILD in RA patients who are scheduled to receive biological antirheumatic therapy.",

The aims of this study were to evaluate whether treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects the risk of developing severe extraarticular rheumatoid arthritis (ExRA) manifestations and to investigate potential predictors for developing ExRA. Methods. A dynamic community-based cohort of patients with RA was studied (n = 1977). Clinical records were reviewed and cases of severe ExRA were identified. Information on exposure to TNF inhibitors was obtained from a regional register. Exposure to TNF inhibitors was analyzed in a time-dependent fashion and the incidence of severe ExRA in exposed patients was compared with the incidence in unexposed patients.

            "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, having a considerably increased prevalence of mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). RA patients have an augmented risk for ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease. Increased cardiovascular (CV) risk is related to disease activity and chronic inflammation. Traditional risk factors and RA-related characteristics participate in vascular involvement, inducing subclinical changes in coronary microcirculation. RA is considered an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Endothelial dysfunction is a precocious marker of atherosclerosis (ATS). Pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6) play an important role in synovial inflammation and ATS progression. Therefore, targeting inflammation is essential to controlling RA and preventing CVD. Present guidelines emphasize the importance of disease control, but studies show that RA- treatment has a different influence on CV risk. Based on the excessive risk for CV events in RA, permanent evaluation of CVD in these patients is critical. CVD risk calculators, designed for the general population, do not use RA-related predictive determinants; also, new scores that take into account RA-derived factors have restricted validity, with none of them encompassing imaging modalities or specific biomarkers involved in RA activity.",

            "abstract": "Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune systemic chronic inflammatory disorder, which is characterized by joint stiffness, damage, and destruction of bone. In RA patients, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased by 2\u20133 folds as compared to the general population. The major burden of RA is the development of cardiovascular diseases, including congestive heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Objectives Assessment of the association of atherogenic indices with C-reactive protein to evaluate CVD risk was one of the purposes of this study. In addition, the association of atherogenic indices with elevated levels of cardiovascular risk factors (LDL-C and TG) was another aim of this study. Methods The preferred study design for this study was a hospital based comparative cross-sectional study method. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi Data version 4.6 software, and exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis of atherogenic indices, C-reactive protein, and risk factors. The comparison of atherogenic indices and other variables among the case and control groups was estimated by the independent t-test statistical analysis method. All variables with a p-value less than 0.2 during binary linear regression analysis were selected for multinomial logistic regression analysis. The association of atherogenic indices with C-reactive protein and risk factors was computed using multiple logistic regressions. The data were presented using tables and figures for clarification of the study. Results The levels of atherogenic indices were computed for both RA patients and the control group. The values of atherogenic indices were significantly associated with cardiovascular risk factor (CRP \u2265 2mg/L). Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and TC/HDL-C ratio had a statistically significant association with an elevated levels of triglycerides (P<0.01). The TC/HDL-Cratio value of the patient had 2.38 folds more likely to have an elevated low density lipoprotein level. In addition, AIP of RA patients had 57.51 and 23.65 folds more to have elevated low density lipoprotein and triglycerides respectively. Conclusions The result of this study showed that TC/HDL-C, LDL/HDL-C ratio values, and atherogenic index of plasma had a statistically significant association with elevated level of low density lipoprotein and triglycerides. In addition to this, they have a statistically significant association with the level of C-reactive protein. There was a highly significant statistical association between atherogenic indices, elevated low density lipoprotein, and triglycerides values. Therefore, the result of this finding confirmed that atherogenic indices have a potential role in the prediction and management of CVD risk in RA patients.",

            "abstract": "Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune systemic chronic inflammatory disorder, which is characterized by joint stiffness, damage, and destruction of bone. In RA patients, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased by 2\u20133 folds as compared to the general population. The major burden of RA is the development of cardiovascular diseases, including congestive heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Objectives Assessment of the association of atherogenic indices with C-reactive protein to evaluate CVD risk was one of the purposes of this study. In addition, the association of atherogenic indices with elevated levels of cardiovascular risk factors (LDL-C and TG) was another aim of this study. Methods The preferred study design for this study was a hospital based comparative cross-sectional study method. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi Data version 4.6 software, and exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis of atherogenic indices, C-reactive protein, and risk factors. The comparison of atherogenic indices and other variables among the case and control groups was estimated by the independent t-test statistical analysis method. All variables with a p-value less than 0.2 during binary linear regression analysis were selected for multinomial logistic regression analysis. The association of atherogenic indices with C-reactive protein and risk factors was computed using multiple logistic regressions. The data were presented using tables and figures for clarification of the study. Results The levels of atherogenic indices were computed for both RA patients and the control group. The values of atherogenic indices were significantly associated with cardiovascular risk factor (CRP \u2265 2mg/L). Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and TC/HDL-C ratio had a statistically significant association with an elevated levels of triglycerides (P<0.01). The TC/HDL-Cratio value of the patient had 2.38 folds more likely to have an elevated low density lipoprotein level. In addition, AIP of RA patients had 57.51 and 23.65 folds more to have elevated low density lipoprotein and triglycerides respectively. Conclusions The result of this study showed that TC/HDL-C, LDL/HDL-C ratio values, and atherogenic index of plasma had a statistically significant association with elevated level of low density lipoprotein and triglycerides. In addition to this, they have a statistically significant association with the level of C-reactive protein. There was a highly significant statistical association between atherogenic indices, elevated low density lipoprotein, and triglycerides values. Therefore, the result of this finding confirmed that atherogenic indices have a potential role in the prediction and management of CVD risk in RA patients.",
