Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces mobilization of bone marrow stem cells.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the value of stem cell mobilization by G-CSF therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients diagnosed with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction who had successful reperfusion by percutaneous coronary intervention within 12 hours after onset of symptoms in Germany between February 24, 2004, and February 2, 2005.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneously either a daily dose of 10 microg/kg of G-CSF or placebo for 5 days.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary end point was reduction of left ventricular infarct size according to technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy performed at baseline and at 4 to 6 months after randomization. Secondary end points included improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging and the incidence of angiographic restenosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 114 patients, 56 were assigned to receive treatment with G-CSF and 58 were assigned to receive placebo. Treatment with G-CSF produced a significant mobilization of stem cells. Between baseline and follow-up, left ventricular infarct size according to scintigraphy was reduced by a mean (SD) of 6.2% (9.1%) in the G-CSF group and 4.9% (8.9%) in the placebo group (P = .56) and left ventricular ejection fraction was improved by 0.5% (3.8%) in the G-CSF group and 2.0% (4.9%) in the placebo group (P = .14). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 19 (35.2%) of 54 patients in the G-CSF group and in 17 (30.9%) of 55 patients in the placebo group (P = .79). The most common adverse event among patients assigned to G-CSF was mild to moderate bone pain and muscle discomfort.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nStem cell mobilization by G-CSF therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and successful mechanical reperfusion has no influence on infarct size, left ventricular function, or coronary restenosis.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00126100.",

In contrast, intracoronary infusion of bone marrow cells appears to improve ejection fraction. We aimed to evaluate the G-CSF mobilization of subsets of stem cells. Methods and Results\u2014 We included 78 patients (62 men; 56\u00b18 years) with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous intervention <12 hours after symptom onset. Patients were randomized to double-blind G-CSF (10 &mgr;g/kg/d) or placebo. Over 7 days, the myocardium was exposed to 25\u00d7109 G-CSF mobilized CD34+ cells, compared with 3\u00d7109 cells in placebo patients (P<0.001); and to 4.9\u00d71011 mesenchymal stem cells, compared with 2.0\u00d71011 in the placebo group (P<0.001). The fraction of CD34+ cells/leukocyte increased during G-CSF treatment (from 0.3\u00b10.2 to 1.1\u00b10.9 \u00d710\u22123, P<0.001 when compared with placebo), whereas the fraction of putative mesenchymal stem cells/leukocyte decreased (from 22\u00b117 to 14\u00b111 \u00d710\u22123, P=0.01 when compared with placebo). An inverse association between number of circulating mesenchymal stem cells and change in ejection fraction was found (regression coefficient \u22126.8, P=0.004), however none of the mesenchymal cell subtypes analyzed, were independent predictors of systolic recovery. Conclusions\u2014 The dissociated pattern for circulating CD34+ and mesenchymal stem cells could be attributable to reduced mesenchymal stem cell mobilization from the bone marrow by G-CSF, or increased homing of mesenchymal stem cells to the infarcted myocardium. The inverse association between circulating mesenchymal stem cells and systolic recovery may be of clinical importance and should be explored further.",

The cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and stem cell factor may play a role in helping to stimulate cell regeneration under normal physiologic conditions and in patients with myocardial injury. After an ischemic insult, cytokines are released into the peripheral circulation and signal for the mobilization of stem cells. In experimental cardiac injury models, the addition of cytokines has been shown to improve myocardial function with and without the concurrent use of stem cell therapy. Preliminary studies in humans using cytokine therapy alone for treating myocardial infarction have been disappointing. Future studies in patients with myocardial injury need to examine the use of various combinations of cytokines, with and without the addition of intravascular stem cell infusions or direct stem cell injections.",

            "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of the myocardium and its blood vessels has now been well demonstrated. The cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and stem cell factor may play a role in helping to stimulate cell regeneration under normal physiologic conditions and in patients with myocardial injury. After an ischemic insult, cytokines are released into the peripheral circulation and signal for the mobilization of stem cells. In experimental cardiac injury models, the addition of cytokines has been shown to improve myocardial function with and without the concurrent use of stem cell therapy. Preliminary studies in humans using cytokine therapy alone for treating myocardial infarction have been disappointing. Future studies in patients with myocardial injury need to examine the use of various combinations of cytokines, with and without the addition of intravascular stem cell infusions or direct stem cell injections.",
