        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B is a serious liver disorder that frequently results in cirrhosis and death from liver failure. The long-term health risks associated with this condition have been most extensively studied in native born Chinese. It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma and/or cirrhosis is between 40% to 50% for men and the risk of death from liver disease is approximately 15% for women (1). Recent data from North America have confirmed the strong etiological link between chronic infection with HBV and hepatocellular carcinoma ( 2 1 . Thus large-scale vaccination against HBV and the development of effective medical therapies for patients with chronic hepatitis B are health issues of enormous importance worldwide. During the past decade, numerous clinical trials have studied a variety of antiviral approaches to treat chronic hepatitis B (3-10). In thew studies, a response has usually been defined as the sustained disappearance of circulating HBeAg and HBV DNA. Loss of these markers of viral replication has generally been associated with improved liver histology and a major decline in abnormal ALT levels. The most extensively evaluated agent and that with the greatest promise is a-interferon. A multicenter trial of recombinant cu-interferon has recently been completed in the United States (the Hepatitis Interventional Therapy or HIT Study) (1 1 I. Nearly 40% of patients exhibited HBeAg seroconversion, and approximately 50% of patients experienced a sustained loss of HBV DNA i n response to a 16-wk course of interferon a-2b given once daily ( p < 0.001 vs. untreated controls). Although the good news is that this study proves that interferon can be an effective therapy for some patients with chronic hepatitis B, the bad news is that a substantial number of individuals do not appear to benefit. It is a question of great importance, therefore. to know why some patients respond and others do not. One way of addressing this issue has been to study potential differences in the state of cellular activation induced by interferon. It is known that the antiviral effects of the various forms of interferon ( a , 0, y ) depend on their ability to interact with cell surface receptors and induce a cascade of intracellular and cell surface proteins (12). In a recent study conducted by Japanese investigators, responders to interferon therapy demonstrated",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C is often a progressive liver disease for which there is no satisfactory treatment. We studied the efficacy of recombinant \u03b1\u2010interferon or \u03b3\u2010interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Ten patients received 7.5 MU \u03b1\u2010interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo. Ten patients were treated with \u03b3\u2010interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment.",

        "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms that mediate signal transduction by growth inhibitory cytokines are poorly understood. Type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) interferons (IFNs) are potent growth inhibitory cytokines whose biological activities depend on induced changes in gene expression. IFN\u2010\u03b1 induced transient activation of phospholipase A2 in 3T3 fibroblasts and rapid hydrolysis of [3H]\u2010arachidonic acid (AA) from prelabeled phospholipid pools. The phospholipase inhibitor, bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), specifically blocked IFN\u2010induced binding of nuclear factors to a conserved, IFN\u2010regulated enhancer element, the interferonstimulated response element (ISRE). BPB also caused a dose\u2010dependent inhibition of IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010stimulated ISRE\u2010dependent transcription in transient transfection assays. Specific inhibition of AA oxidation by eicosatetraynoic acid prevented IFN\u2010\u03b1 induction of factors binding to ISRE. Treatment of intact cells with inhibitors of fatty acid cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzymes resulted in amplification of IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced ISRE binding and gene expression. Thus, IFN\u2010\u03b1 receptor\u2010coupled AA hydrolysis may function in activation of latent factors by IFN\u2010\u03b1 and provides a system for studying the role of AA metabolism in transduction of growth inhibitory signals.",
