            "abstract": "The effects of chronic ethanol consumption on thyroid hormone levels and the rates of whole animal and perfused liver oxygen consumption were determined to test the hypothesis that alcoholic liver damage is a result of thyroid mediated liver hypermetabolism (L. Videla, J. Bernstein, and Y. Israel: Biochem. J, 134: 507\u2013514, 1973). Whole animal minimal oxygen consumption, a sensitive indicator of the effects of thyroid hormone (W. D. Denckla: J. Clin. Invest, 53:572\u2013581, 1974) was unchanged in rats maintained 3 wk on a liquid diet containing 34% of the calories as ethanol (2.49 \u00b1 0.06 ml of O2/min/1O0 g of fat-free body weight) when compared to animals fed an equicaloric sucrose containing liquid diet (2.61 \u00b1 0.20 ml of 02/min/100 g of fat-free body weight) or Purina chow (2.50 \u00b1 0.12 ml of O2/min/100 g of fat-free body weight). Ethanol treatment lowered serum thyroxine (5.09 \u00b1 0.20 pg/100 ml) compared to sucrose-fed control rats (7.66 \u00b1 0.40 pg/100 ml), while serum triiodothyronine was unaffected (59.3 \u00b1 4.0 compared to 66.9 \u00b1 3.1 ng/100 ml for controls). Measurement of O2 consumption in the isolated perfused rat liver showed no significant difference after chronic treatment with the ethanol diet compared to either the sucrose or chow control diets. Infusion of 10-7 M norepinephrine into the perfusion medium resulted in an approximately 22% increase in O2 consumption in ethanol-fed animal and sucrose controls, while a 31 % increase was observed for sucrose-treated animals given 10 \u03bcg of T3/kg of body weight/day for 3 wk. These data indicate that T3 potentiates the ability of norepinephrine to increase O2 consumption. The data presented give no support to the concept that chronic ethanol ingestion results in hyperthyroidism or liver hypermetabolism and, consequently, the rationale for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with the antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil, is incorrect (H. Orrego, H. Ka-lant, Y. Israel, et al.: Gastroenterology, 76:105\u2013115, 1979).",

            "abstract": "Chronic alcohol administration to baboons results in perivenular lesions in the liver. To study possible mechanisms, the effect of ethanol on splanchnic oxygen consumption was measured. Acute ethanol administration increased splanchnic oxygen consumption in the control baboons, but the consequences of this effect on oxygenation of the perivenular zones were offset by a concomitant rise in blood flow, resulting in unchanged hepatic venous oxygen tensions. In alcohol-fed baboons, splanchnic oxygen consumption was not increased, either in the withdrawal state or after ethanol infusion. To study the magnitude of the shift in redox state induced by ethanol in the perivenular zones, we compared the effects of ethanol on the lactate/pyruvate ratio in hepatic venous blood (an approximation of that in perivenular hepatocytes) with the ratio in total liver. Prior to ethanol infusion, the lactate and pyruvate were the same in liver and in hepatic venous blood. By contrast, in all baboons, ethanol produced a much greater rise in the lactate/pyruvate ratio and decreased pyruvate more in hepatic venous blood than in total liver. Moreover, in isolated rat hepatocytes, the ethanol-induced redox shift was markedly exaggerated by oxygen tensions similar to those found in centrolobular zones. This suggests that the normally low oxygen tensions existing in perivenular zones exaggerate the ethanol-induced redox shift, a change which may contribute to the exacerbation of the damage in the perivenular area of the hepatic lobule.",

The degree of separation was indicated by significant differences between the pp and pv cells in their activity of the pp markers, alanine aminotransferase (pp/pv = 2.1), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (3.4) and lactate dehydrogenase (1.3), and of the pv markers, glutamate dehydrogenase (0.73) and pyruvate kinase (0.81). This pattern was not altered by a 3-day pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB). The hepatocytes isolated from the pv area contained higher activities of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, and of cytosolic glutathione transferase. Cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were slightly higher in pv cells. Treatment with PB induced NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, glutathione transferase, cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase but the degree of induction was found to be at least as strong in pp cells as in pv cells. The induction of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase was clearly more prominent in pp cells. On the other hand, PB reduced the activities of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in both cell types. These results demonstrate by direct enzyme assay of separated cells the dominance of the pv-region for metabolizing drugs in the normal liver.

No marked difference in alcohol dehydrogenase activity between the cell types was observed. The cells also oxidised AlOH at about equal rates. AlOH depleted cellular glutathione by about 95% within 10 minutes in both cell types, but was partially restored during subsequent incubation. The pp cells suffering from AlOH toxicity in vivo tended to resist AlOH in vitro better than pv hepatocytes, as judged from the measurement of cellular ATP and K+ ion content, and LDH leakage. It is suggested that the oxidation of AlOH may be restricted to the pp region in intact liver simply because of the high rate of uptake and oxidation of AlOH by the liver tissue.",

            "abstract": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes are known to display various functional differences. In this study we present a new method to separate periportal and perivenous cells: after selectively loading zone 1 or zone 3 with the fluorescent label acridine orange in an antegrade or retrograde perfusion, respectively, we separated the isolated hepatocytes on a fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorter. The common way to check on proper separation is to estimate activities of enzymes known to exhibit a heterogeneous acinar distribution. Using enzyme histochemistry, however, we found that already on short collagenase perfusion, some enzymes displayed a more shallow gradient than in vivo, making enzyme activities less suitable as zonal markers. We therefore used colloidal gold granules (17 nm) injected intravenously (2.5 mg) into the rat 2 to 3 hr before cell isolation. The gold is taken up predominantly by perivenous hepatocytes, probably because of the efficient removal of gold granules in zone 1 by competing Kupffer cells. We compared acridine orange fluorescence, presence of gold particles and activities of six marker enzymes, three biochemically and three histochemically determined. Acridine orange and gold both pointed to a high enrichment of the fractions, whereas most enzyme activities were more randomly distributed among the cells as a result of the isolation procedure. Our separation procedure yielded fractions highly enriched in either viable periportal or perivenous cells, both from one liver. The use of colloidal gold as a marker to monitor separation is a valuable alternative to the more risky estimation of enzyme activities. (HEPATOLOGY 1991;13:73\u201382).",

            "abstract": "Morphological and functional heterogeneity of hepatocytes according to their position in the liver lobule has been known for many years. The digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique is widely used to study hepatocyte heterogeneity and has yielded reliable data. However, with this procedure, periportal (PP) or perivenous (PV) hepatocytes are isolated from different livers, allowing only comparison between cell populations issued from two separate animals. To overcome this drawback, we have modified this technique by perfusing the two main rat liver lobes of a single animal in succession. The procedure involved alternate clamping of the median and the left lateral lobes, restricting digitonin infusion to one lobe via the portal vein, and to the other via the caudal vena cava. Lobe exclusion during digitonin perfusion, and zonal restriction of digitonin\u2010induced damage, were monitored using macroscopic and histological controls. We compared our results with previous data on PP and PV hepatocytes issued from two different livers using the conventional digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. First, we found that the cellular sensitivity to angiotensin II, a calcium\u2010mobilizing agonist, was 60% to 80% higher in PV than in PP hepatocytes, whereas, previously, no difference had been recorded. Second, we found that albumin messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were 35% more abundant in PP than in PV hepatocytes, whereas, previously, larger differences had been reported. Our results show that PP and PV hepatocytes may be isolated from a single liver using an improved digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. Furthermore, we suggest that zonal differences can be artificially masked or amplified when comparing PP and PV cell populations from two different livers, indicating that it is preferable to use a single liver for accurate zonal comparisons between hepatocytes.",

            "abstract": "Morphological and functional heterogeneity of hepatocytes according to their position in the liver lobule has been known for many years. The digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique is widely used to study hepatocyte heterogeneity and has yielded reliable data. However, with this procedure, periportal (PP) or perivenous (PV) hepatocytes are isolated from different livers, allowing only comparison between cell populations issued from two separate animals. To overcome this drawback, we have modified this technique by perfusing the two main rat liver lobes of a single animal in succession. The procedure involved alternate clamping of the median and the left lateral lobes, restricting digitonin infusion to one lobe via the portal vein, and to the other via the caudal vena cava. Lobe exclusion during digitonin perfusion, and zonal restriction of digitonin\u2010induced damage, were monitored using macroscopic and histological controls. We compared our results with previous data on PP and PV hepatocytes issued from two different livers using the conventional digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. First, we found that the cellular sensitivity to angiotensin II, a calcium\u2010mobilizing agonist, was 60% to 80% higher in PV than in PP hepatocytes, whereas, previously, no difference had been recorded. Second, we found that albumin messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were 35% more abundant in PP than in PV hepatocytes, whereas, previously, larger differences had been reported.

The stimulation of connected hepatocytes by glycogenolytic agonists induces reproducible sequences of intracellular calcium concentration increases, resulting in unidirectional intercellular calcium waves. Hepatocytes are characterized by a gradient of vasopressin binding sites from the periportal to perivenous areas of the cell plate in hepatic lobules. Also, coordination of calcium signals between neighboring cells requires the presence of the agonist at each cell surface as well as gap junction permeability. We present a model based on the junctional coupling of several hepatocytes differing in sensitivity to the agonist and thus in the intrinsic period of calcium oscillations. In this model, each hepatocyte displays repetitive calcium spikes with a slight phase shift with respect to neighboring cells, giving rise to a phase wave. The orientation of the apparent calcium wave is imposed by the direction of the gradient of hormonal sensitivity. Calcium spikes are coordinated by the diffusion across junctions of small amounts of inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphos phate (InsP3). Theoretical predictions from this model are confirmed experimentally. Thus, major physiological insights may be gained from this model for coordination and spatial orientation of intercellular signals.\u2014Dupont, G., Tordjmann, T., Clair, C., Swillens, S., Claret, M., Combettes, L.

            "abstract": "Intercellular signaling is highly coordinated in excitable tissues such as heart, but the organization of intercellular signaling in epithelia is less clear. We examined Ca2+ signaling in hepatoma cells expressing the hepatocyte gap junction protein connexin32 (cx32) or the cardiac gap junction protein cx43, plus a fluorescently tagged V1avasopressin receptor (V1aR). Release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in wild type cells increased Ca2+ in the injected cell but not in neighboring cells, while the Ca2+ signal spread to neighbors when gap junctions were expressed. Photorelease of caged Ca2+ rather than InsP3 resulted in a small increase in Ca2+that did not spread to neighbors with or without gap junctions. However, photorelease of Ca2+ in cells stimulated with low concentrations of vasopressin resulted in a much larger increase in Ca2+, which spread to neighbors via gap junctions. Cells expressing tagged V1aR similarly had increased sensitivity to vasopressin, and could signal to neighbors via gap junctions. Higher concentrations of vasopressin elicited Ca2+ signals in all cells. In cx32 or cx43 but not in wild type cells, this signaling was synchronized and began in cells expressing the tagged V1aR. Thus, intercellular Ca2+ signals in epithelia are organized by three factors: 1) InsP3 must be generated in each cell to support a Ca2+ signal in that cell; 2) gap junctions are necessary to synchronize Ca2+ signals among cells; and 3) cells with relatively increased expression of hormone receptor will initiate Ca2+ signals and thus serve as pacemakers for their neighbors. Together, these factors may allow epithelia to act in an integrated, organ-level fashion rather than as a collection of isolated cells.",

            "abstract": "Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is a plastic process during which the mechanisms that coordinate liver mass restoration compensate one another through a complex regulatory network of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. Vasopressin, an agonist that triggers highly organized Ca2+ signals in the liver, may be one of these factors, although little in vivo evidence is available in support of this hypothesis. We provide evidence that hypothalamic vasopressin secretion is stimulated early after partial hepatectomy. Although hepatocytes were fully responsive to vasopressin during the first hours of regeneration, they became desensitized and exhibited slow oscillating Ca2+ responses to vasopressin on the following days. On the first day, hepatocyte V1a receptor density decreased and its lobular gradient increased in hepatectomized rats. By antagonizing the V1a receptor in vivo, we demonstrated that vasopressin contributes to NF\u2010\u03baB and cyclin (D1 and A) activation, to hepatocyte progression in the cell cycle, and to liver mass restoration. Finally, vasopressin exerted a choleretic effect shortly after hepatectomy, both in the isolated perfused liver and in the intact rat. In conclusion, we provide compelling in vivo evidence that vasopressin contributes significantly to growth initiation and bile flow stimulation in the early stages of liver regeneration.",

            "abstract": "Water homeostasis is a critical challenge to survival for land mammals. Mice display increased locomotor activity when dehydrated, a behavior that improves the likelihood of locating new sources of water and simultaneously places additional demands on compromised hydration levels. The neurophysiology underlying this well known behavior has not been previously elucidated. We report that the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this response. AVP and oxytocin directly induced depolarization and an inward current in orexin/hypocretin neurons. AVP-induced activation of orexin neurons was inhibited by a V1a receptor (V1aR)-selective antagonist and was not observed in V1aR knock-out mice, suggesting an involvement of V1aR. Subsequently activation of phospholipase C\u03b2 triggers an increase in intracellular calcium by both calcium influx through nonselective cation channels and calcium release from calcium stores in orexin neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of AVP or water deprivation increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice, but not in transgenic mice lacking orexin neurons. V1aR knock-out mice were less active than wild-type mice. These results suggest that the activation of orexin neurons by AVP or oxytocin has an important role in the regulation of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. This system appears to play a key role in water deprivation-induced hyperlocomotor activity, a response to dehydration that increases the chance of locating water in nature.",

            "abstract": "Water homeostasis is a critical challenge to survival for land mammals. Mice display increased locomotor activity when dehydrated, a behavior that improves the likelihood of locating new sources of water and simultaneously places additional demands on compromised hydration levels. The neurophysiology underlying this well known behavior has not been previously elucidated. We report that the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this response. AVP and oxytocin directly induced depolarization and an inward current in orexin/hypocretin neurons. AVP-induced activation of orexin neurons was inhibited by a V1a receptor (V1aR)-selective antagonist and was not observed in V1aR knock-out mice, suggesting an involvement of V1aR. Subsequently activation of phospholipase C\u03b2 triggers an increase in intracellular calcium by both calcium influx through nonselective cation channels and calcium release from calcium stores in orexin neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of AVP or water deprivation increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice, but not in transgenic mice lacking orexin neurons. V1aR knock-out mice were less active than wild-type mice. These results suggest that the activation of orexin neurons by AVP or oxytocin has an important role in the regulation of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. This system appears to play a key role in water deprivation-induced hyperlocomotor activity, a response to dehydration that increases the chance of locating water in nature.",

Orexin deficiency results in narcolepsy in humans, dogs, and rodents, suggesting that the orexin system is particularly important for maintenance of wakefulness. In addition, orexin deficiency also cause abnormalities in energy homeostasis and reward systems. Orexin activates waking active monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem regions to maintain a long, consolidated waking period. Orexin neurons receive abundant input from the limbic system. Orexin neurons also have reciprocal links with the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which regulates feeding. Moreover, the responsiveness of orexin neurons to peripheral metabolic cues, such as leptin and glucose, suggest that these neurons have important role as a link between the energy homeostasis and vigilance states. Orexin neurons also have a link with the dopaminergic reward system in the ventral tegmental nucleus. These findings suggest that the orexin system interacts with systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis to maintain proper vigilance states.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have implicated the orexin system as a critical regulator of sleep/wake states as well as feeding behavior and reward processes. Orexin deficiency results in narcolepsy in humans, dogs, and rodents, suggesting that the orexin system is particularly important for maintenance of wakefulness. In addition, orexin deficiency also cause abnormalities in energy homeostasis and reward systems. Orexin activates waking active monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem regions to maintain a long, consolidated waking period. Orexin neurons receive abundant input from the limbic system. Orexin neurons also have reciprocal links with the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which regulates feeding. Moreover, the responsiveness of orexin neurons to peripheral metabolic cues, such as leptin and glucose, suggest that these neurons have important role as a link between the energy homeostasis and vigilance states. Orexin neurons also have a link with the dopaminergic reward system in the ventral tegmental nucleus. These findings suggest that the orexin system interacts with systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis to maintain proper vigilance states. Therefore, this system may be a potentially important therapeutic target for treatment of sleep disorder, obesity, emotional stress, and addiction.",

            "abstract": "Several pieces of evidence support that sleep duration plays a role in body weight control. Nevertheless, it has been assumed that, after the identification of orexins (hypocretins), the molecular basis of the interaction between sleep and energy homeostasis has been provided. However, no study has verified the relationship between neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin changes during hyperphagia induced by sleep deprivation. In the current study we aimed to establish the time course of changes in metabolite, endocrine, and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression of Wistar rats sleep deprived by the platform method for a distinct period (from 24 to 96 h) or sleep restricted for 21 days (SR-21d). Despite changes in the stress hormones, we found no changes in food intake and body weight in the SR-21d group. However, sleep-deprived rats had a 25-35% increase in their food intake from 72 h accompanied by slight weight loss. Such changes were associated with increased hypothalamus mRNA levels of prepro-orexin (PPO) at 24 h followed by NPY at 48 h of sleep deprivation. Conversely, sleep recovery reduced the expression of both PPO and NPY, which rapidly brought the animals to a hypophagic condition. Our data also support that sleep deprivation rapidly increases energy expenditure and therefore leads to a negative energy balance and a reduction in liver glycogen and serum triacylglycerol levels despite the hyperphagia. Interestingly, such changes were associated with increased serum levels of glucagon, corticosterone, and norepinephrine, but no effects on leptin, insulin, or ghrelin were observed. In conclusion, orexin activation accounts for the myriad changes induced by sleep deprivation, especially the hyperphagia induced under stress and a negative energy balance.",

            "abstract": "Rodent models for sleep restriction have good face validity when examining food intake and related regulatory metabolic hormones. However, in contrast to epidemiological studies in which sleep restriction is associated with body weight gain, sleep-restricted rats show a decrease in body weight. This difference with the human situation might be caused by the alternation between periods of sleep restriction and sleep allowance that often occur in real life. Therefore, we assessed the metabolic consequences of a chronic sleep restriction protocol that modeled working weeks with restricted sleep time alternated by weekends with sleep allowance. We hypothesized that this protocol could lead to body weight gain. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sleep restriction (SR), forced activity control (FA), and home cage control (HC). SR rats were subjected to chronic sleep restriction by keeping them awake for 20 h per day in slowly rotating drums. To model the human condition, rats were subjected to a 4-wk protocol, with each week consisting of a 5-day period of sleep restriction followed by a 2-day period of sleep allowance. During the first experimental week, SR caused a clear attenuation of growth. In subsequent weeks, two important processes occurred: 1) a remarkable increase in food intake during SR days, 2) an increase in weight gain during the weekends of sleep allowance, even though food intake during those days was comparable to controls. In conclusion, our data revealed that the alternation between periods of sleep restriction and sleep allowance leads to complex changes in food intake and body weight, that prevent the weight loss normally seen in continuous sleep-restricted rats. Therefore, this \"week-weekend\" protocol may be a better model to study the metabolic consequences of restricted sleep.",

One potential link between sleep health and CVD is through lifestyle factors such as diet. To clarify the association between diet and sleep, we assessed the associations of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with current Mediterranean-style diet (aMed) and with historical changes in aMed score. Actigraphy-measured sleep duration and self-reported insomnia symptoms categorized as insomnia with short sleep (<6 hr/night), insomnia without short sleep, no insomnia with short sleep, and no insomnia or short sleep were obtained from 2068 individuals who also had dietary intake data. A 10-point aMed score, derived from a self-report food frequency questionnaire, was collected concurrently with the sleep assessment and 10 years before. Compared with individuals who currently reported a low aMed score, those with a moderate-high aMed score were more likely to sleep 6-7 vs. <6 hr/night (p < 0.01) and less likely to report insomnia symptoms occurring with short sleep (vs. no insomnia or short sleep alone; p < 0.05). An increase in aMed score over the preceding 10 years was not associated with sleep duration or insomnia symptoms. However, compared with those with decreasing aMed score, individuals with an unchanging score reported fewer insomnia symptoms (p \u2264 0.01). These results suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with adequate sleep duration, less insomnia symptoms, and less likely to have insomnia accompanied by short sleep. Further research should identify possible mediators through which diet may promote adequate sleep duration and reduce the risk of insomnia.",

However, there are limited epidemiological data on the relationship between measures of sleep quality and habitual dietary patterns. This study examined these associations in a diverse sample of women. Methods and Results Baseline data from 495 participants in the AHA Go Red for Women prospective cohort study (age: 20\u201376 years; 61% racial/ethnic minority) were examined. Sleep quality and sleep\u2010onset latency were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and insomnia using the Insomnia Severity Index. The validated Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to assess diet quantity and quality. Linear regression models adjusted for confounding variables tested relationships between sleep and diet variables. Results showed that higher PSQI scores, indicative of poorer sleep quality, were associated with lower unsaturated fat intake (\u03b2=\u22120.14, P<0.05) and higher food weight (\u03b2=14.9, P=0.02) and added sugars consumed (\u03b2=0.44, P=0.04). Women with sleep\u2010onset latency >60 minutes had higher intakes of food by weight (\u03b2=235.2, P<0.01) and energy (\u03b2=426, P<0.01), and lower intakes of whole grains (\u03b2=\u22120.37, P=0.01) than women with sleep\u2010onset latency \u226415 minutes. Greater insomnia severity was associated with higher food weight (\u03b2=9.4, P=0.02) and energy (\u03b2=17, P=0.01) consumed and lower total (\u03b2=\u22120.15, P=0.01) and unsaturated fat intakes (\u03b2=\u22120.11, P<0.01). Conclusions Poor sleep quality was associated with greater food intake and lower\u2010quality diet, which can increase cardiovascular disease risk. Future studies should test whether promoting sleep quality could augment efforts to improve cardiometabolic health in women.",

            "abstract": "Background Poor sleep increases cardiovascular disease risk, and diet likely contributes to this relationship. However, there are limited epidemiological data on the relationship between measures of sleep quality and habitual dietary patterns. This study examined these associations in a diverse sample of women. Methods and Results Baseline data from 495 participants in the AHA Go Red for Women prospective cohort study (age: 20\u201376 years; 61% racial/ethnic minority) were examined. Sleep quality and sleep\u2010onset latency were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and insomnia using the Insomnia Severity Index. The validated Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to assess diet quantity and quality. Linear regression models adjusted for confounding variables tested relationships between sleep and diet variables. Results showed that higher PSQI scores, indicative of poorer sleep quality, were associated with lower unsaturated fat intake (\u03b2=\u22120.14, P<0.05) and higher food weight (\u03b2=14.9, P=0.02) and added sugars consumed (\u03b2=0.44, P=0.04). Women with sleep\u2010onset latency >60 minutes had higher intakes of food by weight (\u03b2=235.2, P<0.01) and energy (\u03b2=426, P<0.01), and lower intakes of whole grains (\u03b2=\u22120.37, P=0.01) than women with sleep\u2010onset latency \u226415 minutes. Greater insomnia severity was associated with higher food weight (\u03b2=9.4, P=0.02) and energy (\u03b2=17, P=0.01) consumed and lower total (\u03b2=\u22120.15, P=0.01) and unsaturated fat intakes (\u03b2=\u22120.11, P<0.01). Conclusions Poor sleep quality was associated with greater food intake and lower\u2010quality diet, which can increase cardiovascular disease risk. Future studies should test whether promoting sleep quality could augment efforts to improve cardiometabolic health in women.",

Methods and Results The analytic sample consisted of MESA (Multi\u2010Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Sleep Study participants who had complete data on sleep characteristics from overnight polysomnography, 7\u2010day wrist actigraphy, validated questionnaires, and the outcome. We computed the LS7 score and 4 iterations of a new CVH score: score 1 included sleep duration, score 2 included sleep characteristics linked to CVD in the literature (sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea), scores 3 and 4 included sleep characteristics associated with CVD in MESA (score 3: sleep duration and efficiency, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea; score 4: score 3+sleep regularity). Multivariable\u2010adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of the LS7 and CVH scores 1 to 4 with CVD prevalence and incidence. Among 1920 participants (mean age: 69\u00b19\u2009years; 54% female), there were 95 prevalent CVD events and 93 incident cases (mean follow\u2010up, 4.4\u2009years). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of the LS7 score and CVH scores 1 to 4 had up to 80% lower odds of prevalent CVD. The LS7 score was not significantly associated with CVD incidence (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.37\u20131.04]). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of CVH score 1, which included sleep duration, and CVH score 4, which included multidimensional sleep health, had 43% and 47% lower incident CVD risk (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33\u20130.97]; and hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32\u20130.89]), respectively. Conclusions CVH scores that include sleep health predicted CVD risk in older US adults. The incorporation of sleep as a CVH metric, akin to other health behaviors, may enhance CVD primordial and primary prevention efforts.

We computed the LS7 score and 4 iterations of a new CVH score: score 1 included sleep duration, score 2 included sleep characteristics linked to CVD in the literature (sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea), scores 3 and 4 included sleep characteristics associated with CVD in MESA (score 3: sleep duration and efficiency, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea; score 4: score 3+sleep regularity). Multivariable\u2010adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of the LS7 and CVH scores 1 to 4 with CVD prevalence and incidence. Among 1920 participants (mean age: 69\u00b19\u2009years; 54% female), there were 95 prevalent CVD events and 93 incident cases (mean follow\u2010up, 4.4\u2009years). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of the LS7 score and CVH scores 1 to 4 had up to 80% lower odds of prevalent CVD. The LS7 score was not significantly associated with CVD incidence (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.37\u20131.04]). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of CVH score 1, which included sleep duration, and CVH score 4, which included multidimensional sleep health, had 43% and 47% lower incident CVD risk (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33\u20130.97]; and hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32\u20130.89]), respectively. Conclusions CVH scores that include sleep health predicted CVD risk in older US adults. The incorporation of sleep as a CVH metric, akin to other health behaviors, may enhance CVD primordial and primary prevention efforts. Findings warrant confirmation in larger cohorts over longer follow\u2010up.",

            "abstract": "Background: The American Heart Association recently released a new cardiovascular health (CVH) metric, Life\u2019s Essential 8 (LE8), for health promotion. However, the association between levels of LE8 and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is not known from a large prospective cohort. We aim to analyze the relationship between CVH, indicated by LE8, and risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Moreover, we sought to test whether the genetic susceptibility to CHD or stroke could be modified by LE8. Methods: A total of 137\u2009794 participants free of CVD from the UK Biobank were included. CVH was scored using LE8 and categorized as low, moderate, and high. Results: During a median of 10 years, 8595 CVD cases (6968 CHDs and 1948 strokes) were documented. A higher LE8 score was associated with remarkably lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). Comparing the high CVH to the low CVH, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30\u20130.38) for CHD, 0.45 (0.37\u20130.54) for stroke, and 0.36 (0.33\u20130.40) for CVD. Moreover, the model with LE8 achieved higher accuracy and outperformed the model with Life\u2019s Simple 7 for CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). The protective associations of the LE8 score with CVD outcomes were more pronounced among women (P interaction, <0.001 for CHD and 0.0013 for CVD, respectively) and among younger adults (P interaction, <0.001, 0.007, and <0.001 for CHD, stroke, and CVD, respectively). In addition, a significant interaction was found between the genetic risk of CHD and the LE8 score (P interaction, <0.001). The inverse association was stronger among those with a lower genetic risk of CHD. Conclusions: High level of CVH, defined by LE8, was associated with significantly lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD.",
