RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this double-blind placebo-controlled study, 36 NIDDM patients were treated for 8 weeks with ginseng (100 or 200 mg) or placebo. Efficacy was evaluated with psychophysical tests and measurements of glucose balance, serum lipids, aminoterminalpropeptide (PIIINP) concentration, and body weight. RESULTS Ginseng therapy elevated mood, improved psychophysical performance, and reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and body weight. The 200-mg dose of ginseng improved glycated hemoglobin, serum PIIINP, and physical activity. Placebo reduced body weight and altered the serum lipid profile but did not alter FBG. CONCLUSIONS Ginseng may be a useful therapeutic adjunct in the management of NIDDM.",

            "abstract": "Panax ginseng is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a prophylactic, a stimulant, and a treatment for various diseases. In addition, ginseng has been found to enhance the immune system and possess an anti-tumor effect. Ginseng appears to stimulate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and the subsequent increase in titers of lymphocytes and circulating antibodies. Furthermore, ginseng's cancer-prevention properties seem to be mediated through the increased production of interferons and cytokines, which activate natural killer and cytotoxic T-cells that can served to lyse or inhibit growing tumors. Both clinical and epidemiological studies indicated that Panax ginseng can reduce the incidence of cancer in vivo. These results suggest that ginseng shows antitumor effects as an immunomodulator.",
