            "abstract": "Twenty-eight patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis completed a randomized 24-week double-blind crossover trial comparing oral methotrexate (2.5 to 5 mg every 12 hours for three doses weekly) with placebo. The methotrexate group had significant reductions (P less than 0.01 as compared with the placebo group) in the number of tender or painful joints, the duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity according to physician and patient assessments at the 12-week crossover visit; reductions in the number of swollen joints (P less than 0.05) and 15-m walking time (P less than 0.03) also occurred. These variables, as well as the grip strength and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, showed significant (P less than 0.01) improvement at 24 weeks in the population crossed over to methotrexate. A significantly increased frequency (P less than 0.03) of the HLA-DR2 haplotype occurred in the eight patients with the most substantial response to methotrexate. Adverse reactions during methotrexate therapy included transaminase elevation (21 per cent), nausea (18 per cent), and diarrhea (12 per cent); one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of diarrhea. One patient died while receiving the placebo. Methotrexate did not affect measures of humoral or cellular immunity. We conclude that this trial provides evidence of the short-term efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Longer trials will be required to determine the ultimate safety and effectiveness of this drug.",

            "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term oral weekly methotrexate (MTX) therapy were studied to determine the extent of their hepatic architectural changes. Liver biopsies (n = 101) were performed in all patients before the initiation of MTX therapy, after 2 years, and annually thereafter (mean duration of therapy 53 months). The hepatic histologic grade (5-point scale) in 25 patients increased (worsened) (mean +/- SEM change 0.84 +/- 1.02; P = 0.001). Fibrosis, confirmed by trichrome staining, developed in 14 of 27 patients (52%). A history of alcohol consumption prior to starting MTX correlated significantly with subsequent worsening of the liver biopsy grade (r = 0.55, P = 0.0054). Alcohol intake prior to study entry, elevated weight at MTX initiation, and dose and duration of MTX were significantly associated with the development of fibrosis. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at 29-53 months of therapy correlated with the increase in hepatic histologic grade at the 3-year biopsy (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) and 4-year biopsy (r = 0.58, P = 0.03). We conclude that long-term MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients results in a statistically significant worsening in hepatic histologic grade, with common development of mild fibrosis. We do not consider these changes to be clinically significant at present.",

            "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term oral weekly methotrexate (MTX) therapy were studied to determine the extent of their hepatic architectural changes. Liver biopsies (n = 101) were performed in all patients before the initiation of MTX therapy, after 2 years, and annually thereafter (mean duration of therapy 53 months). The hepatic histologic grade (5-point scale) in 25 patients increased (worsened) (mean +/- SEM change 0.84 +/- 1.02; P = 0.001). Fibrosis, confirmed by trichrome staining, developed in 14 of 27 patients (52%). A history of alcohol consumption prior to starting MTX correlated significantly with subsequent worsening of the liver biopsy grade (r = 0.55, P = 0.0054). Alcohol intake prior to study entry, elevated weight at MTX initiation, and dose and duration of MTX were significantly associated with the development of fibrosis. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at 29-53 months of therapy correlated with the increase in hepatic histologic grade at the 3-year biopsy (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) and 4-year biopsy (r = 0.58, P = 0.03). We conclude that long-term MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients results in a statistically significant worsening in hepatic histologic grade, with common development of mild fibrosis. We do not consider these changes to be clinically significant at present.",

            "abstract": "A potential approach toward rational decision making when using combinations of DMARDs has been presented. This approach combines knowledge of DMARD mechanisms of action, kinetics, and toxicities to look for \"nonoverlapping\" combinations. When using this approach to predict responses and comparing them to studies that have been done, some encouraging results were obtained. Nevertheless, as exemplified by the combination of D-penicillamine and hydroxychloroquine, this approach is not infallible. The use of refinements of such rational choices, however, should be continued in an effort to improve the chances of success and decrease the costs of testing drug combinations.",

The success of combination DMARD therapy in recent double blind controlled studies is encouraging.2223 As is frequently the case, however, the success of these approaches raises as many questions as it answers. Should all patients with rheumatoid arthritis receive combination DMARD therapy, or should it be reserved for only those with severe disease? Are there ways to predict who will respond best? When in the course of disease should combinations be used? Which combinations are best, or does this vary among patients? After an excellent response occurs, can some or all of these drugs be tapered or discontinued? Where do biological agents fit in, and should they be used in combinations? I do not have the answer to any of these questions. Until these answers are available, we will have to do as we have always done-make the best decisions we can based on the limited data available. As I stated earlier, our goal when treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be remission. As we try to achieve this goal, the data available now support the use of certain combinations of DMARD. Whether combinations should be used early in the disease process as suggested by Wilske and Healey'5 or added later is still open to question. As we better understand the mechanisms of actions of drugs and the disease process itself, we will be able to intervene more intelligently at the right time with the right drugs or combinations of drugs to improve the long term outcome for our patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
