Design : Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. Setting : General population of a suburb of Rotterdam. Subjects : 100 men and women between 55 and 75 years of age with untreated mild to moderate hypertension. Interventions : During 24 weeks the intervention group received a mineral salt (sodium: potassium: magnesium 8:6:1) and foods prepared with the mineral salt. Controls received common salt and foods. Main outcome measure : Change in blood pressure. Results - Complete follow up was achieved for 97 of the 100 randomised subjects. Systolic blood pressure (mean of measurements at weeks 8, 16, and 24) fell by 7.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 11.2) and diastolic blood pressure by 3.3 mm Hg (0.8 to 5.8) in the mineral salt group compared with the controls, with a 28% decrease in urinary sodium excretion and a 22% increase in urinary potassium excretion. Twenty five weeks after the study the difference in blood pressure between the groups was no longer detectable. Conclusion : Replacing common sodium salt by a low sodium, high potassium, high magnesium mineral salt could offer a valuable non -pharmacological approach to lowering blood pressure in older people with mild to moderate hypertension.",

Design: Standardised cross sectional study within and across populations. Setting: 52 population samples in 32 countries. Subjects: 10 074 men and women aged 20-59. Main outcome measures: Association of sodium and blood pressure from within population and cross population multiple linear regression analyses with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias. Relation of sample median daily urinary sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age. Results: In within population analyses (n=10 074), individual 24 hour urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol (for example, 170 v 70 mmol) was associated with systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher on average by 3/0 to 6/3 mm Hg (with and without body mass in analyses). Associations were larger at ages 40-59. In cross population analyses (n=52), sample median 24 hour sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol was associated with median systolic/diastolic pressure higher on average by 5-7/2-4 mm Hg, and estimated mean difference in systolic/diastolic pressure at age 55 compared with age 25 greater by 10-11/6 mm Hg. Conclusions: The strong, positive association of urinary sodium with systolic pressure of individuals concurs with Intersalt cross population findings and results of other studies. Higher urinary sodium is also associated with substantially greater differences in blood pressure in middle age compared with young adulthood. These results support recommendations for reduction of high salt intake in populations for prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels.

Adoption of a healthier lifestyle may have contributed to this favorable trend. Not all subgroups have benefited equally, however, particularly African Americans. According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)6 (1988 to 1991), 24% of the US population was classified as having hypertension. Blood pressure level and hypertension prevalence increase with age: high-normal and high blood pressure continue to be major contributors to cardiovascular disease.7 \n\nThe relationship between dietary electrolyte consumption and blood pressure is the focus of this brief review. Evidence for a positive association between sodium chloride (NaCl) intake and blood pressure is discussed. Increasing evidence also suggests that dietary patterns associated with low intakes of potassium, calcium, and possibly magnesium also contribute to higher levels of blood pressure. An understanding of these associations has important implications not only for the prevention and treatment of hypertension but also for developing population-based strategies to decrease cardiovascular disease risk by shifting the overall blood pressure distribution toward lower levels.\n\nA high NaCl intake convincingly contributes to elevated arterial pressure in a number of animal models of genetic and acquired hypertension.

The two prospective studies of dairy food consumption and stroke incidence both indicate that a higher intake of dairy foods reduces risk. It is difficult to associate any one mineral in dairy products to reduction in blood pressure or stroke incidence because an appropriate metabolic balance of all three is important and because of the strong correlations among Ca, Mg and K intakes when dairy products are consumed. In fact, the evidence reviewed indicates that although K apparently has the greatest effect, all three minerals potentially contribute to blood pressure and stroke reduction, i.e., a dietary balance of all three is recommended. Milk and food products such as yogurt made from milk, which retain substantial amounts of K, Ca and Mg, are important dietary sources of all three of these minerals. In addition, milk is a low Na food, which, as seen in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) II, provides further benefit in blood pressure reduction. New studies have associated dairy food consumption with other potential mechanisms affecting stroke, mainly reduction of platelet aggregation and insulin resistance. Further research is required to explore the relationship of dairy food consumption and stroke.",

We investigated the prognostic impact of Mg serum levels with respect to the occurrence of neurological events in patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Methods\u2014 We prospectively studied 323 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication (197 men; median age, 68 years). Serum Mg was determined, and patients were followed for a median of 20 months (interquartile range, 12 to 25 months) for the occurrence of neurological events, defined as ischemic stroke and/or carotid revascularization (carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to assess the association of serum Mg (in tertiles) and neurological events. Results\u2014 Neurological events occurred in 35 patients (11%) (15 patients with stroke, 13 with carotid revascularization, and 7 with stroke and subsequent revascularization). Compared with patients in the highest tertile of Mg serum levels (>0.84 mmol/L), patients with Mg serum values <0.76 mmol/L (lowest tertile) exhibited a 3.29-fold increased adjusted risk (95% CI, 1.34 to 7.90; P=0.009) for neurological events, but patients with Mg serum values of 0.76 mmol/L to 0.84 mmol/L (middle tertile) had no increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.35 to 3.33; P=0.88). Mg serum levels were not associated with all-cause mortality (P=0.87) or coronary events (P=0.67) during follow-up. Conclusions\u2014 Low Mg serum levels indicate an increased risk for neurological events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, favoring Mg substitution therapy in those patients with advanced atherosclerosis.",

Methods\u2014 We prospectively studied 323 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication (197 men; median age, 68 years). Serum Mg was determined, and patients were followed for a median of 20 months (interquartile range, 12 to 25 months) for the occurrence of neurological events, defined as ischemic stroke and/or carotid revascularization (carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to assess the association of serum Mg (in tertiles) and neurological events. Results\u2014 Neurological events occurred in 35 patients (11%) (15 patients with stroke, 13 with carotid revascularization, and 7 with stroke and subsequent revascularization). Compared with patients in the highest tertile of Mg serum levels (>0.84 mmol/L), patients with Mg serum values <0.76 mmol/L (lowest tertile) exhibited a 3.29-fold increased adjusted risk (95% CI, 1.34 to 7.90; P=0.009) for neurological events, but patients with Mg serum values of 0.76 mmol/L to 0.84 mmol/L (middle tertile) had no increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.35 to 3.33; P=0.88). Mg serum levels were not associated with all-cause mortality (P=0.87) or coronary events (P=0.67) during follow-up. Conclusions\u2014 Low Mg serum levels indicate an increased risk for neurological events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, favoring Mg substitution therapy in those patients with advanced atherosclerosis.",

            "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 There is considerable variability in the antiplatelet effects of the thienopyridine agent \u201cclopidogrel.\u201d We tested for an association of gene sequence variations in P2Y12 and occurrence of neurological adverse events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) during clopidogrel treatment. Methods\u2014 We studied 137 patients undergoing antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and 336 patients with aspirin for the occurrence of neurological events (ischemic stroke and/or carotid revascularization). Prevalence of 2 previously described exonic polymorphisms of the P2Y12 gene, 34C>T and 52G>T, was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Results\u2014 Genotype frequencies for mutated, heterozygous, and wild-type alleles for the 34C>T and the 52G>T polymorphisms were 9% (n=40), 44% (n=210), and 47% (n=223), and 4% (n=17), 27% (n=127), and 70% (n=329), respectively. During the median follow-up of 21 months, neurological events occurred in 8% of patients. In patients with aspirin therapy, neither polymorphism was associated with neurological events. However, in clopidogrel patients, carriers of at least one 34T allele had a 4.02-fold increased adjusted risk for neurological events compared with carriers of only 34C alleles (95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 14.9). Neither polymorphism was associated with all-cause mortality. Conclusions\u2014 In PAD patients, clopidogrel response variability exists, which may result in increased risk for cerebrovascular events. Sequence alterations of the target receptor gene represent one possible mechanism for clopidogrel failure. Whether identification of the 34C>T polymorphism as a contributor to this process could serve as risk stratification tool, an indicator for higher clopidogrel doses, or the use of alternate agents warrants further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Clopidogrel is a pro-drug that requires oxidation to its active metabolite, 2-oxoclopidogrel, by CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes. This active thiol metabolite inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation by blocking the platelet P2Y12 receptor (Figure), resulting in \u224850% reduction in ADP-mediated platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel is standard of care in many patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and those experiencing acute coronary syndromes. However, it has been suggested that response to clopidogrel varies widely with nonresponse rates ranging from 4% to 30% at 24 hours.1,2 Suggested mechanisms for this variability have included under-dosing, drug interactions with CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors,3 and intrinsic interindividual differences resulting from genetic polymorphisms in the pathways of clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. \n\n\n\nClopidogrel metabolism and mechanism of action. Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme family. The CYP3A gene family is located on chromosome 7q21-q22. Genes are shown as block arrows. Select CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms (named according to the Human CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee) are shown with vertical black lines in relation to their position in the genes. The proposed effect of the polymorphisms on protein expression or function is shown below. CYP3A4 IVS10+12G>A is indicated as CYP3A4*1G. The clopidogrel active metabolite antagonizes the GI protein\u2013coupled PY212 receptor resulting in irreversible blockade of ADP binding on platelets.\n\n\n\nSee page 1895 \n\nIn this issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology , Angiolillo and colleagues report on the influence of CYP3A4 genotype on interpatient variability in clopidogrel responsiveness.4 The authors find that an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CYP3A4 gene, IVS10+12G>A (also called CYP3A4*1G), influences platelet reactivity \u2026",

            "abstract": "Buchang naoxintong capsule (BNC) is a traditional Chinese medicine approved for the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about the specific protective function or mechanism by which BNC protects against myocardial injury. This research was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of BNC in vitro model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts. BNC intestinal absorption liquid was used in this study instead of drug-containing serum or extracting solution. Our study revealed that BNC preconditioning enhanced antioxidant function by increasing the activities of total-antioxygen capacity, total-superoxide dismutase, and catalase and by decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. BNC preconditioning also activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and inhibited apoptosis-related proteins such as poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. Additionally, preincubation with BNC reduced intracellular Ca2+ concentration, improved mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased the apoptosis rate of H9c2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrated that BNC protects H9c2 cardiomyoblasts from H2O2-induced oxidative injury by increasing antioxidant abilities, activating ERK1/2, and blocking Ca2+-dependent and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Based on our results, the potency of BNC for protecting H9c2 cells from oxidative damage is comparable to that of trimetazidine.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Buchang NaoXinTong (NXT) is a Chinese medicine that has been used for many years for treatment of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in China. Statins substantially reduce hypercholesterolemia and CHD mortality and morbidity. However, there is still a lot of CHD patients who do not respond well to statin therapy. Herein, we report the effects of NXT on atorvastatin-inhibited atherosclerosis and atorvastatin-induced hepatic side effects. After 10 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, apoE-deficient mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and received the following treatment for another 8 weeks: group 1, HFD; group 2, HFD containing NXT; group 3, HFD containing atorvastatin; and group 4, HFD containing both NXT and atorvastatin. After treatment, serum lipid profiles, atherosclerotic lesions, and hepatic lipid content and inflammation were determined. NXT moderately increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, although had little effect on atorvastatin-induced reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Both NXT and atorvastatin reduced en face lesions and sinus lesions of aortic root. In addition, NXT enhanced atorvastatin-induced lesion plaque stability by increasing smooth muscle cell/collagen content and reducing macrophage accumulation and calcification in lesion areas. The co-treatment of NXT and atorvastatin further reduced hepatic triglyceride levels by downregulating acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 while activating hormone-sensitive lipase, adipose triglyceride lipase, and comparative gene identification-58 expression. The AMPK&agr; pathway was also further activated by the co-treatment. More importantly, the liver injuries caused by atorvastatin, such as hepatic inflammation and elevated serum aminotransferase activities, were substantially attenuated by NXT. Therefore, our study demonstrates that NXT enhances atorvastatin-induced plaque stability and ameliorates atorvastatin-induced hepatic side effects.",

Herein, we report the effect of NXT on the development of cardiovascular diseases and clarify the correlation between NXT\u2019s cardioprotective effects and gut microbiota.

Our results showed that NXT\u2019s effects against cardiovascular diseases were through regulating blood lipid profiles, inhibiting vascular inflammation, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and alleviating myocardial injury, without damages on liver and kidney particularly.
