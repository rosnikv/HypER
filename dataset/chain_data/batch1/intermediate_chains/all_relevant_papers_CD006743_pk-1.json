        "abstract": "Bl!il'A ADBENIiliGIC llLOCKADE with a variety of betablocking drugs has now been shown to be of value in the management of cardiac arrhythmias, including those associated with acute myocardial infarction. The subject has been reviewed by Epstein and Braunwald (1966). Snow's report in 1965 of a reduction in mortality in acute myocardial infarction with the prophylactic administration of propranolol led to several other clinical trials, but Clausen et alii (1966), Balcon et alii (1966), Barber et alii (1966) and a multi-centre trial reported by Stephen et alii (1966) have not been able to confirm Snow's work.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the haemodynamic effects of atropine combined with propranolol in acute myocardial infarction, which is related to the source paper's topic of propranolol's effect on myocardial infarction. However, the paper does not directly build upon or depend on the findings of the source paper, as it explores a different aspect of propranolol's effects. The source paper's abstract is not available, but based on the title, it seems that the paper investigated the prophylactic effect of propranolol in myocardial infarction, whereas this paper focuses on the haemodynamic effects of combining atropine with propranolol."
