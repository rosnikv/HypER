            "abstract": "Lateral epicondylitis is the most common affliction of the elbow. It occurs in middle-aged individuals and is self-limiting in the majority of cases. The etiology of the condition is not completely understood. Based on clinical, histologic, and imaging data, the tendinous origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis is the most likely site of pathology. A variety of procedures have been described to treat epicondylitis. Most commonly, the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon origin is debrided with either open or arthroscopic methods. Both techniques require a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the extensor tendon origin at the humeral epicondyle. Improvement is reported in the majority of cases treated surgically, although residual symptoms persist in a substantial number of patients.

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe treatment of tendinosis of elbow can be challenging, yet rewarding. Nevertheless, for the patients who failed conservative management and develop persistent recalcitrant symptoms, surgical intervention should be considered. The hypothesis of this study is iliac bone marrow plasma injection after arthroscopic debridement of degenerative tissue will bring along biological cure. Thus, it will not only reduce pain but also improve function in patients with resistant elbow tendonitis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTwenty-four patients (26 elbows) with significant persistent pain for a mean of 15 months, despite of standard rehabilitation protocol and a variety of other nonsurgical modalities were treated arthroscopically. We applied autologous iliac bone marrow plasma injection following arthroscopic debridement. This material is produced by centrifugation of iliac bone marrow blood at 1,800 rpm for 20 to 30 minutes. Patients were allowed full range of motion (ROM) exercise after 2 to 3 days. Cytokine analyses for this injective material were done. Outcome was rated by postoperative sonography, visual analog pain scores (VAS) and Mayo elbow performance scores (MEPS) at 8 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Informed consent had been obtained from the subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Chosun University Hospital, Korea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll patients in this study noted improvement both in their VAS and MEPS. No complication occurred in any patient. Evidence of tendon healing was observed in postoperative sonographic examination. Predominant cytokines of this study were interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and RANTES.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBiologic treatments in orthopaedics are just beginning to evolve. In the present investigation, the injection of iliac bone marrow plasma after arthroscopic debridement in severe elbow tendinosis demonstrated early recovery of daily activities and clear improvement.",

            "abstract": "Acute soft-tissue lesions and chronic overuse injuries in the sports medicine field are very frequent and in most cases, difficult to treat. Tissue repair in musculoskeletal lesions is often too slow and sometimes incomplete for a given athlete. The fastest, most complete recovery is of primary importance, and keeping the delay until return-to- field as brief as possible, a priority. Many bioactive proteins and growth factors amongst others influence healing processes. Administration of Platelet Rich Plasma enables the production, from the patient\u2019s own blood, of natural, high concentrations of autologous growth factors. Basic research and animal studies are promising, but evidence- based studies examining the treatment of human musculoskeletal lesions by Platelet Rich Plasma are still lacking. Nevertheless, such treatment is increasingly used in sports medicine clinical practice and much is expected of growth factor injections. The aim of this non exhaustive review is to analyze the existing literature published in the fields of sports medicine. The results of this analysis do not permit us to recommend the systematic and generalized use of Platelet Rich Plasma injections in the management of sport injuries. Nevertheless, a few promising results have to be mentioned, but high-quality studies are needed to provide scientific evidence about these injections\u2019 effectiveness.",

Surgical osteosynthesis, with multiple lag screws and a neutralization plate, was performed for anatomical reconstruction. Despite a good gait condition, delayed bone consolidation and a bone gap were evident on follow up radiographic evaluations. Due to delayed healing, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was injected on the surface of the tibia. Increased bone consolidation was evident on radiographs one month after the PRP injection. Progressive filling of both the fracture lines and bone gap continued during the six-month follow up. Clinical outcome was excellent. Autologous PRP should be considered as a practical adjuvant therapy in bone healing process in donkeys.",

However, clinical advances are hampered by the fact that PRP products, doses and treatment protocols are far from being standardized. Freeze-drying PRP (FD-PRP) preserves platelet function, cytokine concentration and functionality, and has been proposed as a consistent method for product standardization and fabrication of an off-the-shelf product with improved stability and readiness for future uses. Here, we present the current state of experimental and clinical FD-PRP research in the different medical areas in which PRP has potential to meet prevailing medical needs. A systematic search, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, showed that research is mostly focused on wound healing, i.e., developing combination products for ulcer management. Injectable hydrogels are investigated for lumbar fusion and knee conditions. In dentistry, combination products permit slow kinetics of growth factor release and functionalized membranes for guided bone regeneration.",

            "abstract": "The complex biology of platelets and their involvement in tissue repair and inflammation have inspired the development of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapies for a broad array of medical needs. However, clinical advances are hampered by the fact that PRP products, doses and treatment protocols are far from being standardized. Freeze-drying PRP (FD-PRP) preserves platelet function, cytokine concentration and functionality, and has been proposed as a consistent method for product standardization and fabrication of an off-the-shelf product with improved stability and readiness for future uses. Here, we present the current state of experimental and clinical FD-PRP research in the different medical areas in which PRP has potential to meet prevailing medical needs. A systematic search, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, showed that research is mostly focused on wound healing, i.e., developing combination products for ulcer management. Injectable hydrogels are investigated for lumbar fusion and knee conditions. In dentistry, combination products permit slow kinetics of growth factor release and functionalized membranes for guided bone regeneration.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) induces more migration and proliferation of fibroblasts compared with standard PRF, but it being freshly prepared prior to it being applied is necessary. To preserve its biological function, lyophilization, a freeze-drying method, has been developed to improve the stability and storage potential of PRF. This study aimed to determine the effect of lyophilized A-PRF on growth factor release and cell biological activity compared to fresh A-PRF. The results of the present study demonstrated that both formulations of canine A-PRF matrices, the fresh and lyophilized forms, were able to release various growth factors, promoting better wound regeneration than in instances without the A-PRF matrices. Lyophilization in canine A-PRF can mostly preserve the similar release of growth factors, and consequently has similar biological activities to a fresh preparation. Interestingly, lyophilized canine A-PRF demonstrated the tendency of larger releases of certain growth factors, including the significantly larger accumulated release of a growth factor named vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA). Based on these findings, it became clear that the lyophilization process can preserve growth factor release as well as the biological activity of canine A-PRF matrices, in addition to encouraging the use of canine lyophilized A-PRF as a biological material for promoting wound healing. Abstract Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) induces more proliferation and migration of fibroblasts compared with standard PRF, but it being freshly prepared prior to it being applied is necessary. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of lyophilized A-PRF on growth factor release and cell biological activity. Blood samples were collected from six dogs and processed for fresh and lyophilized A-PRF. The growth factors released included transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and the fibroblast proliferation as well as wound closure enhancement of both products were compared. The results showed that TGF-\u03b21, PDGF-BB, and VEGFA were continually released from lyophilized A-PRF for over 72 h. Lyophilized A-PRF released significantly more accumulated VEGEA and a tendency to release more TGF-\u03b21 at 72 h as well as VEGFA at 24 h and 72 h than fresh A-PRF. Moreover, lyophilized A-PRF increased fibroblast proliferation and induced a significantly faster wound closure than the control, while no significant difference between fresh and lyophilized A-PRF was found. In conclusion, the lyophilization of canine A-PRF can preserve the release of growth factors and has similar biological activities to a fresh preparation. This encourages the substitution of lyophilized A-PRF instead of fresh A-PRF in regenerative treatments in which the stability of the product is concerned.",

The growth factors released included transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and the fibroblast proliferation as well as wound closure enhancement of both products were compared. The results showed that TGF-\u03b21, PDGF-BB, and VEGFA were continually released from lyophilized A-PRF for over 72 h. Lyophilized A-PRF released significantly more accumulated VEGEA and a tendency to release more TGF-\u03b21 at 72 h as well as VEGFA at 24 h and 72 h than fresh A-PRF. Moreover, lyophilized A-PRF increased fibroblast proliferation and induced a significantly faster wound closure than the control, while no significant difference between fresh and lyophilized A-PRF was found. In conclusion, the lyophilization of canine A-PRF can preserve the release of growth factors and has similar biological activities to a fresh preparation. This encourages the substitution of lyophilized A-PRF instead of fresh A-PRF in regenerative treatments in which the stability of the product is concerned.",
