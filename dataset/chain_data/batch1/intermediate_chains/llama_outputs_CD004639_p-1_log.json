Compared with placebo, Ca2+ significantly lowered supine systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg, standing systolic blood pressure by 5.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.02), and supine diastolic blood pressure by 2.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) in hypertensive persons. The response in normotensive persons differed significantly from that in hypertensives (p less than 0.03) as their blood pressure was unchanged. Twenty-one (44%) hypertensive and 6 (19%) normotensive persons achieved a reduction in standing systolic arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater. Reported adverse effects were similar between calcium and placebo phases and did not necessitate withdrawal of any patient from the trial. Treatment with 1000 mg/d of oral Ca2+ for 8 weeks represents a safe, well-tolerated, nonpharmacologic intervention that lowers blood pressure in selected patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",

            "abstract": "Data from a health screening survey with over 18,000 adult participants were used to determine the relations between serum calcium concentration and the cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and hyperlipidaemia. Blood pressure and serum glucose and cholesterol concentrations were all positively related to each other independent of age, sex, kidney function, and obesity. Similar relations between the risk factors were found in subjects with hypertension or hyperglycaemia independent of the degree of overweight. These results suggested that there might be a metabolic syndrome of cardiovascular risk factors. Serum calcium concentration was positively related to systolic and diastolic blood pressures and serum glucose and cholesterol concentrations. Thus a common feature in the syndrome is an increased serum calcium concentration. The relations between serum calcium concentrations and the cardiovascular risk factors were not limited to the upper parts of the distribution, being seen over a wide range. Changes in calcium metabolism seem to be related to a metabolic syndrome of hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperlipidaemia.",

The commonly used antihypertensive drugs, thiazides and betablockers, both induce impairments in both glucose and lipid metabolism and the thiazides are known to cause an elevation of serum urate. The effects of vitamin D treatment on these metabolic variables were recorded in these studies. Alphacalcidol did not induce any changes in fasting glucose HbA1c or insulin, serum triglycerides, cholesterol or serum urate in any of the treated groups. Neither was HDL cholesterol affected, except for a rise seen in the HPT subjects. It is therefore concluded that no major metabolic alterations in glucose or lipid metabolism or serum urate accompany the hypotensive effect of vitamin D.",

            "abstract": "A hypotensive effect of active vitamin D treatment (alphacalcidol 1 mg daily) has previously been reported in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies over 4-6 months in subjects with mild primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), intermittent hypercalcemia and essential hypertension. The commonly used antihypertensive drugs, thiazides and betablockers, both induce impairments in both glucose and lipid metabolism and the thiazides are known to cause an elevation of serum urate. The effects of vitamin D treatment on these metabolic variables were recorded in these studies. Alphacalcidol did not induce any changes in fasting glucose HbA1c or insulin, serum triglycerides, cholesterol or serum urate in any of the treated groups. Neither was HDL cholesterol affected, except for a rise seen in the HPT subjects. It is therefore concluded that no major metabolic alterations in glucose or lipid metabolism or serum urate accompany the hypotensive effect of vitamin D.",

However, it does not directly build upon or verify the source paper's hypothesis. Instead, it examines a different aspect of calcium metabolism and its effects on hypertension."
