        "abstract": "A patient is described who developed a poorly differentiated sarcoma after cyclophosphamide was used to treat his rheumatoid arthritis. This case emphasizes the importance ot considering neoplastic disease as a potential hazard associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs.",

        "title": "Treatment of eczema with cyclophosphamide and azathioprine *",
        "abstract": "Nine patients with eczema were treated with the immunosuppressive drugs cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. In all patients the eczema was severe and incapacitating and had not responded satisfactorily to systemic and topical corticosteroid therapy. The eczema improved in all patients and systemic corticosteroids, which had resulted in undesirable side\u2010effects, could be decreased or stopped. Leukopenia was not necessary for achieving clinical improvement. Several months of treatment were needed to obtain significant improvement in the eczema and long term remissions followed cessation of therapy.",

        "relevance": 1,
        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the use of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressive drug, in treating another autoimmune condition (eczema), building on the source paper's results regarding cyclophosphamide's efficacy in treating rheumatoid arthritis."
