        "explanation": "This paper discusses nutritional factors in the aetiology of diseases such as coronary heart disease and maturity-onset diabetes, and suggests principles for a prudent diet. The source paper also investigates the effect of dietary advice on diabetes treatment, but the connection between the two papers is not direct. The source paper does not serve as a sub-hypothesis for this paper, nor does this paper's hypothesis directly build upon the source paper's findings."
