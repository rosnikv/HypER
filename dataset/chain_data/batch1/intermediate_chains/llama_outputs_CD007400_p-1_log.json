            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\n. To compare the safety and efficacy of a topical diclofenac solution versus oral diclofenac in relieving the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy equivalence trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 622 men and women with radiological evidence of primary knee OA and mild to severe symptoms were randomly assigned to treatment with a topical diclofenac solution plus placebo oral capsules, or placebo topical solution plus oral diclofenac (50 mg) capsules. Patients applied 50 drops of study solution and took 1 study capsule 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy variables were pain and physical function, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) VA 3.1 OA Index, and patient global assessment (PGA). Equivalence in the per-protocol group was based on previously defined ranges of clinically significant difference. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe difference in mean (95% CI) change scores (final minus baseline) between treatments was 13.3 mm (-8.6 to 35.2) for pain (total scale 500 mm), 71.0 mm (-2.4 to 144.5) for physical function (total scale 1700 mm), and 4.3 mm (-1.2 to 9.8) for PGA (total scale 100 mm). The CI for each efficacy variable fell within the predefined equivalence ranges (pain, +/- 75 mm; physical function, +/- 255 mm; PGA, +/- 20 mm), indicating that no clinically relevant difference was found between the 2 treatment arms. Safety analyses of patients applying topical diclofenac solution revealed some minor skin irritation at the application site--mostly skin dryness in 83/311 (27%) patients--but a significantly reduced incidence, relative to oral diclofenac, of total and severe gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. The number of patients developing abnormal liver function tests (including clinically significant elevation), hemoglobin, and creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the oral diclofenac group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nApplication of this topical diclofenac solution to the knee of patients with OA produced relief of symptoms equivalent to oral diclofenac, with minor local skin irritation, but significantly reduced incidence of diclofenac-related GI complaints and abnormal laboratory values.",

Methods: Forty patients who had asymmetrical psoriatic arthritis in hand participated in this study. Their ages ranged from 30 to 50 years. Patients were classified randomly into two groups of equal numbers; group (1) (control group) received routine physical therapy (hot therapy, stretching and strengthening exercises), in addition to sham ibuprofen phonophoresis, while group (2) (studied group): received routine physical therapy, in addition to ibuprofen phonophoresis. Each patient was evaluated for grip strength, tender and swollen joint count before and after one month of treatment. The results revealed that there was a significant difference between both groups regarding to grip strength, tender and swollen joint count, with the percentage of improvement in group 1 were 56%, 54%, and 55% ,while in group 2 were 82%, 80% and 76% respectively.

Subjects: Sixty male patients with knee OA were assigned randomly into two equal groups .Their ages were ranged from 40-50 years old. Methods: The patients were evaluated for the following parameters: Pain and knee joints kinematics, kinetics and spatiotemporal parameters by 3-D motion analysis Lab before and after three months of treatment program. patients in the control group received selected physical therapy program in the form of stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound whereas patients in the study group received the same selected physical therapy program in addition to phonophoresis therapy. The data were collected and analyzed using a paired and un-paired t-test to compare the difference between the results within each group pre test and post test and between the two groups. Results: this study revealed that there were significant differences (p<0.05) of all of the measured variables (pain score, cadence, stride length, knee flexion ROM at stance and swing phase, knee flexion and extension moment) between pre test and post test in the control and experimental groups for right and left knees. There were significant differences between post test of control and experimental groups for right and left knees except knee extension moment there was no significant differences. Conclusion: Phonophoresis has got clear effect when added to treatment program in reducing the pain and improving mechanics of knee joint in patients with osteoarthritis.

            "abstract": "Background Intraarticular corticosteroid injection is an adjunct to core treatments for relief of moderate-to-severe pain in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. This randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of dexamethasone phonophoresis (DxPh) on knee OA. Patients and Methods Forty six female patients with knee OA were randomized into two equal groups. The study group received DxPh over the medial side of the knee, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and quadriceps strengthening exercises. Control group received ultrasound therapy and the same TENS and exercise program. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the pain subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pre- and posttreatment. Functional mobility was assessed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, total WOMAC, and the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC. The minimal clinically identifiable difference was used to calculate treatment effect sizes of both modalities, which was compared to intraarticular steroid injections. Results The VAS, TUG, and WOMAC scores improved with both modalities. Pain intensity improved by 50.6%\u201358.0% in the study group (VAS and pain subscale of WOMAC, respectively) compared to 17.8%\u201328.6% for the control group. Functional mobility showed a higher rate of improvement in the DxPh group compared to control (37.7 vs. 17.5% for TUG and 53.2 vs. 23.0 and 56.1 vs. 26.4% for the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC, respectively). Posttreatment results revealed statistically and clinically significant improvement in pain intensity and functional mobility in the DxPh group. Conclusion DxPh resulted in a greater improvement in pain and function in patients with knee OA than therapeutic ultrasound combined with exercise and TENS. The effect size of phonophoresis was clinically significant and higher than that reported for intraarticular steroid injection from pooled data in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Background Intraarticular corticosteroid injection is an adjunct to core treatments for relief of moderate-to-severe pain in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. This randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of dexamethasone phonophoresis (DxPh) on knee OA. Patients and Methods Forty six female patients with knee OA were randomized into two equal groups. The study group received DxPh over the medial side of the knee, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and quadriceps strengthening exercises. Control group received ultrasound therapy and the same TENS and exercise program. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the pain subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pre- and posttreatment. Functional mobility was assessed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, total WOMAC, and the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC. The minimal clinically identifiable difference was used to calculate treatment effect sizes of both modalities, which was compared to intraarticular steroid injections. Results The VAS, TUG, and WOMAC scores improved with both modalities. Pain intensity improved by 50.6%\u201358.0% in the study group (VAS and pain subscale of WOMAC, respectively) compared to 17.8%\u201328.6% for the control group.

The lack of a vascular system within synovial joints and the rapid removal of agents due to synovial exchange hinder continuous delivery of OA drugs. However, these obstacles are being addressed by promising nanoscale drugs. Methods: We synthesize and assemble a hydrogen peroxide [H2O2, belongs to the category of active oxygen species (ROS)]-sensitive nanomicelle, which is loaded with the anti-inflammation drug dexamethasone and chondrogenic differentiation factor cartilage-derivedmor-phogeneticprotein-1. The micelle can induce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair cartilage while inhibiting joint inflammation. Results: The prepared nanoparticles were of uniform size and displayed an obvious core-shell structure. Under H2O2 stimulation, the shell layer could be removed gradually. The drug-loaded micelle effectively inhibited proliferation of activated macrophages, induced macrophage apoptosis with an anti-inflammatory effect, and caused the BMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes. Conclusion: This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for further development of a drug-loaded micelle in the healing of osteoarthritis.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is an inflammatory and degenerative joint disease with severe effects on individuals, society, and the economy that affects millions of elderly people around the world. To date, there are no effective treatments for OA; however, there are some treatments that slow or prevent its progression. Polyfunctional nanosystems have many advantages, such as controlled release, targeted therapy and high loading rate, and have been widely used in OA treatment. Previous mechanistic studies have revealed that inflammation and ROS are interrelated, and a large number of studies have demonstrated that ROS play an important role in different types of OA development. In this review article, we summarize third-generation ROS-sensitive nanomaterials that scavenge excessive ROS from chondrocytes and osteoclasts in vivo. We only focus on polymer-based nanoparticles (NPs) and do not review the effects of drug-loaded or heavy metal NPs. Mounting evidence suggests that polyfunctional nanosystems will be a promising therapeutic strategy in OA therapy due to their unique characteristics of being sensitive to changes in the internal environment.",
