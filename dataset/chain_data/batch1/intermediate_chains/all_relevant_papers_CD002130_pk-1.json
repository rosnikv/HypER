        "title": "Reduction in periprocedural enzyme elevation by abciximab after rotational atherectomy of type B2 lesions: Results of the Rota ReoPro randomized trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAbciximab has been shown to reduce ischemic complications and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) elevation of both simple and complex coronary interventions. In addition to the procedural complications, one of the important mechanisms for CK-MB elevation after rotational atherectomy is an interaction between platelets and the atheromatous debris.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study was conducted to determine whether abciximab would limit the extent of periprocedural CK-MB release after rotational atherectomy of American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology type B(2) lesions in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled manner. A total of 100 lesions in 100 patients were randomized with the primary end point being a CK-MB elevation of >16 U/L.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProcedural success was achieved in 100% in the abciximab arm compared with 98% in the placebo group with any CK-MB elevation >16 U/L of 8% in the abciximab versus 22% in the placebo group (P =.04). The peak creatine phosphokinase level (units per liter) was 102 +/- 14 versus 153 +/- 22 (P =.05) and the peak CK-MB level was 12.8 +/- 1.8 versus 24.6 +/- 3.5 (P =.06) between the abciximab and placebo groups, respectively. Slow-flow or postprocedure chest pain occurred in 14% in the abciximab group versus 30% in the placebo group (P =.04). There was 1 Q-wave myocardial infarction in the placebo arm and 1 nonhemorrhagic stroke in the abciximab group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTherefore the Rota ReoPro randomized trial revealed the benefit of abciximab during rotational atherectomy in reducing procedural morbidity and CK-MB elevation, and its routine use can be justified even in moderately complex lesions undergoing rotational atherectomy.",

        "abstract": "One of the most notable advances in cardiology of the past decade has been the development and clinical application of a novel class of potent antiplatelet agents \u2014 the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa integrin inhibitors. In the mid-1990s, large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents documented highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in the morbidity and mortality of percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequently, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were found to prevent ischaemic events in patients admitted with the acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina or non-Q wave myocardial infarction. The first GP IIb/IIIa agent brought to market in the U.S.A. (1994) was abciximab (ReoPro, Centocor, Malvern, PA, U.S.A., and Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, U.S.A.). Abciximab is the Fab fragment of a chimeric murine\u2013human monoclonal antibody to the GP IIb/ IIIa integrin. Abciximab binds to GP IIb/IIIa with high affinity and has a slow receptor off-rate, resulting in a long biological half-life ( 12 h). In clinical trials, treatment with abciximab during percutaneous coronary intervention consistently provided impressive reductions in the incidence of ischaemic events across a series of trials including EPIC, EPILOG, CAPTURE, and EPISTENT. In 1998, eptifibatide (Integrilin, COR Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA, U.S.A., and Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, U.S.A.) and tirofiban (Aggrastat, Merck, West Point, PA, U.S.A.) were approved for use by the U.S.A. Food and Drug Administration. These agents are distinguished from abciximab by a much shorter half-life ( 2\u20133 h), a rapid off-rate, and greater selectivity for the GP IIb/IIIa receptor complex. Results of pivotal clinical trials of these two agents in the percutaneous coronary intervention indication, however, were disappointing. In the IMPACT II trial of eptifibatide and the RESTORE trial of tirofiban, lower degrees of absolute and relative benefit were seen in comparison to the abciximab series of trials. Potential explanations for this disparity included both pharmacodynamic issues (particularly the extended duration of action of abciximab) and the potential role of receptor cross-reactivity of abciximab with other receptors beside GP IIb/IIIa.

        "abstract": "Slow or no\u2010reflow phenomenon (SNR) complicates 10%\u201315% of cases of percutaneous intervention (PCI) in aortocoronary saphenous vein grafts (SVG). At present, there are no uniform, effective strategies to predict or prevent this common and potentially serious complication. The purpose of our study was to characterize variables correlated with the risk of SNR in SVG PCI in the era of stenting and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors. We identified 2,898 consecutive patients who had PCI, of whom 163 underwent PCI of at least one SVG. The clinical and angiographic characteristics of patients who developed SNR (SNR group) were compared with those who did not (no\u2010SNR group). A total of 23 patients experienced SNR and 140 did not. Using a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, four independent predictors for SNR were detected: probable thrombus (OR 6.9; 95% CI, 2.1\u201323.9; P = 0.001), acute coronary syndromes (OR 6.4; 95% CI, 2.0\u201325.3; P = 0.003), degenerated vein graft (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.7\u201316.6; P = 0.003), and ulcer (OR 3.4; 95% CI, 0.99\u201311.6; P = 0.04). The risk of developing SNR could be estimated according to the number of predictors found: low\u2010grade risk (1%\u201310%) if \u2264 one variable was present, moderate risk (20%\u201340%) if two variables were present, and high risk (60%\u201390%) if three or more variables were present. We identified and quantified current risk factors for SNR and concluded that the risk of developing SNR during PCI in SVG can be predicted by simple clinical and angiographic variables obtained before PCI. This information may be useful when the risk of PCI has to be balanced against alternative strategies such as medical therapy or redo\u2010bypass surgery or in the selection of those patients that will most benefit from the use of protection devices during PCI.

        "abstract": "Thrombocytopenia is a frequent comorbid condition in many in hospital patients. In some patients, drugs are the cause of low platelet counts. While cytotoxic effects of anti-tumor therapy are the most frequent cause, immune mechanisms should also be considered. This review addresses thrombocytopenias in four groups. Heparin-dependent thrombocytopenia (HIT), by far the most frequent drug-induced immune-mediated type of thrombocytopenia, has a unique pathogenesis and clinical consequences. HIT is a clinicopathological syndrome in which antibodies mostly directed against a multimolecular complex of platelet factor 4 and heparin cause paradoxical thromboembolic complications. The mechanisms through which heparin can enhance thrombin generation are discussed and treatment alternatives for affected patients are presented in detail. It is of primary importance to recognize these patients as early as possible and to substitute heparin with a compatible anticoagulatory drug, such as hirudin, danaparoid or argatroban. Patients seem to benefit from therapeutic doses of alternative treatment rather than from low-dose prophylactic doses. With the increasing use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndromes, thrombocytopenias are increasingly recognized as an adverse effect of these drugs. Up to 4% of treated patients are affected. Most important, pseudothrombocytopenia, a laboratory artefact, is as frequent as real drug-induced thrombocytopenia and must be excluded before changes in treatment are considered. The pathogenesis of these thrombocytopenias is still debated; an immune mechanism involving preformed antibodies is likely. However, since these antibodies are also detectable in a high percentage of normal controls and of patients not developing thrombocytopenia, their impact is still unclear. Patients with real thrombocytopenia are at an increased risk of bleeding; treatment consists of cessation of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor and platelet transfusions in cases of severe hemorrhage. Classic immune thrombocytopenia can be induced by some drugs, e.g. gold, which trigger anti-platelet antibodies indistinguishable from platelet autoantibodies found in autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Drug-induced and drug-dependent immune thrombocytopenia is induced by antibodies recognizing an epitope on platelet GP formed after binding of a drug to a platelet glycoprotein. Still unresolved is whether antibody binding is the consequence of a conformational change of the antigen, the antibody, or both. These antibodies typically react with monomorphic epitopes on platelet GP, but only in the presence of the drug or a metabolite. Although several platelet GP have been identified as antibody target (GPIb/IX, GPV, GP IIb/IIIa), antibodies in an individual patient are highly specific for a single GP. Clinically, these patients present with very low platelet counts and acute, sometimes severe, hemorrhage. Treatment is restricted to withdrawal of the drug and symptomatic treatment of bleeding.",

        "title": "Emergency Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in the Era of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor Antagonist Use",
        "abstract": "Abstract\u2002 The use of intravenous glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa platelet receptor antagonists in the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome or those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become increasingly common in recent years. There are three GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists currently available for clinical use. Patients on GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists who require emergency surgical revascularization may be at increased risk for excessive peri\u2010and postoperative bleeding. The duration of action of eptifibatide and tirofiban are short because they bind reversibly to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor and have a short half\u2010life. Therefore, within a relatively short time after discontinuation of these agents, surgery can be performed with little or no increased risk of bleeding and without the need for additional hemostatic measures. Abciximab has a short plasma half\u2010life but a long duration of action due to its high\u2010affinity binding of GP IIb/IIIa receptors. Early retrospective studies demonstrated a higher incidence of major bleeding and requirement for blood transfusion, especially in those undergoing surgery within 12 hours of the discontinuation of abciximab. However, platelet transfusion has been shown to successfully reduce the incidence of these complications. The current evidence therefore indicates that, with appropriate measures, urgent surgical revascularization can be safely performed in patients who have received a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist with little added risk. The benefits of these agents in the treatment of patients with an acute coronary syndrome or undergoing PCI are not obviated by the need for emergency bypass surgery.",

This registry was conducted to characterize the effects of repeated administration of abciximab during intervention. Methods and Results\u2014We recruited 500 consecutive patients at 22 centers in the United States who were receiving abciximab for at least a second time during percutaneous coronary intervention. Safety was measured as the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, major bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. Efficacy was assessed as event-free clinical success. Human antichimeric antibody (HACA) responses were also characterized. There were no cases of hypersensitivity (95% upper confidence bound, 0.3%), major bleeding, or death. Clinical success was 94.4%. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 23 patients (4.6%; 95% CI, 2.8% to 6.4%), including 12 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.1% to 3.7%) who developed profound thrombocytopenia (<20\u00d7109 cells/L). In 2 patients (0.4%), profound thrombocytopenia did not develop until after hospital discharge; in 4 (0.8%), profound thrombocytopenia recurred despite platelet transfusion. Before a first readministration, a positive HACA titer was present in 22 of 454 patients (4.8%); after a first readministration, an additional 82 of 432 (19.0%) became HACA-positive. HACA did not neutralize the in vitro inhibition of platelet aggregation by abciximab or correlate with clinical events. Conclusions\u2014The results, including overall rates of thrombocytopenia, were consistent with randomized clinical trials of first abciximab treatment. However, there was a shift from mild to profound thrombocytopenia, and cases of delayed presentation and of recurrent thrombocytopenia were seen. These findings suggest that indications and guidelines for first-time use apply to retreatment, particularly the systematic monitoring for thrombocytopenia.",

These patients were categorized into 2 groups depending on whether they had been given abciximab during PCI. We compared blood product transfusion requirements, bleeding complications, and frequency of in-hospital adverse events of the 2 groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 5636 patients who had PCI, 77 (1.4%) had urgent or emergency CABG within 48 hours, including 11 who were given abciximab (abciximab group) during PCI and 66 who were not given abciximab (no abciximab group). The 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics. The mean +/- SD time to surgery was 8.4 +/-8.0 hours (median, 6 hours) for the abciximab group vs 12.1 +/- 12.5 hours (median, 4 hours) for the no abciximab group. Major bleeding (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction criteria) occurred in 9 (90%) of 10 patients in the abciximab group vs 48 (77%) of 62 patients in the no abciximab group. The total volumes of intraoperative autotransfusion and transfusion of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma tended to be higher for the abciximab group. Also, this group received a mean of 13.9 U of platelets vs 3.2 U for the no abciximab group (P<.001). However, no in-hospital deaths occurred among patients in the abciximab group, and adverse events were infrequent and comparable between the 2 groups. No difference was noted between the 2 groups in the frequency of surgical reexploration for bleeding.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTransfusion requirements are higher for patients who undergo emergency or urgent CABG after having received abciximab during PCI. However, in-hospital adverse events are infrequent and comparable to those for patients who do not receive abciximab.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nAbciximab, a potent inhibitor of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, reduces thrombotic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because of its potent inhibition of platelet aggregation, the effect of abciximab on risk of stroke is a concern.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether abciximab use among patients undergoing PCI is associated with an increased risk of stroke.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCombined analysis of data from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials (EPIC, CAPTURE, EPILOG, and EPISTENT) conducted between November 1991 and October 1997 at a total of 257 academic and community hospitals in the United States and Europe.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA total of 8555 patients undergoing PCI with or without stent deployment for a variety of indications were randomly assigned to receive a bolus and infusion of abciximab (n = 5476) or matching placebo (n = 3079). One treatment group in EPIC received a bolus of abciximab only.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nRisk of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke within 30 days of treatment among abciximab and placebo groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant difference in stroke rate was observed between patients assigned abciximab (n = 22 [0.40%]) and those assigned placebo (n = 9 [0.29%]; P =.46). Excluding the EPIC abciximab bolus-only group, there were 9 strokes (0.30%) among 3023 patients who received placebo and 15 (0.32%) in 4680 patients treated with abciximab bolus plus infusion, a difference of 0.02% (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.23% to 0.28%). The rate of nonhemorrhagic stroke was 0.17% in patients treated with abciximab and 0.20% in patients treated with placebo (difference, -0.03%; 95% CI, -0.23% to 0.17%), and the rates of hemorrhagic stroke were 0.15% and 0.10%, respectively (difference, 0.05%; 95% CI, -0.11% to 0.21%). Among patients treated with abciximab, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke in patients receiving standard-dose heparin in EPIC, CAPTURE, and EPILOG was higher than in those receiving low-dose heparin in the EPILOG and EPISTENT trials (0.27% vs 0.04%; P =.057).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbciximab in addition to aspirin and heparin does not increase the risk of stroke in patients undergoing PCI. Patients undergoing PCI and treated with abciximab should receive low-dose, weight-adjusted heparin.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn the setting of percutaneous coronary revascularization, agents in the class known as platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have significantly reduced the incidence of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days. We assessed whether there are differences in safety or efficacy between two such inhibitors, tirofiban and abciximab.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a double-blind, double-dummy design at 149 hospitals in 18 countries, we randomly assigned patients to receive either tirofiban or abciximab before undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization with the intent to perform stenting. The primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent target-vessel revascularization at 30 days. The trial was designed and statistically powered to demonstrate the noninferiority of tirofiban as compared with abciximab.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point occurred more frequently among the 2398 patients in the tirofiban group than among the 2411 patients in the abciximab group (7.6 percent vs. 6.0 percent; hazard ratio, 1.26; one-sided 95 percent confidence interval of 1.51, demonstrating lack of equivalence, and two-sided 95 percent confidence interval of 1.01 to 1.57, demonstrating the superiority of abciximab over tirofiban; P=0.038). The magnitude and the direction of the effect were similar for each component of the composite end point (hazard ratio for death, 1.21; hazard ratio for myocardial infarction, 1.27; and hazard ratio for urgent target-vessel revascularization, 1.26), and the difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction between the tirofiban group and the abciximab group was significant (6.9 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively; P=0.04). The relative benefit of abciximab was consistent regardless of age, sex, the presence or absence of diabetes, or the presence or absence of pretreatment with clopidogrel. There were no significant differences in the rates of major bleeding complications or transfusions, but tirofiban was associated with a lower rate of minor bleeding episodes and thrombocytopenia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough the trial was intended to assess the noninferiority of tirofiban as compared with abciximab, the findings demonstrated that tirofiban offered less protection from major ischemic events than did abciximab.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhen administered in conjunction with primary coronary stenting for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may provide additional clinical benefit, but data on this combination therapy are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 300 patients with acute myocardial infarction in a double-blind fashion either to abciximab plus stenting (149 patients) or placebo plus stenting (151 patients) before they underwent coronary angiography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 30 days and 6 months after the procedure. The angiographic patency of the infarct-related vessel and the left ventricular ejection fraction were evaluated at 24 hours and 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 30 days, the primary end point--a composite of death, reinfarction, or urgent revascularization of the target vessel--had occurred in 6.0 percent of the patients in the abciximab group, as compared with 14.6 percent of those in the placebo group (P=0.01); at 6 months, the corresponding figures were 7.4 percent and 15.9 percent (P=0.02). The better clinical outcomes in the abciximab group were related to the greater frequency of grade 3 coronary flow (according to the classification of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) in this group than in the placebo group before the procedure (16.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent, P=0.01), immediately afterward (95.1 percent vs. 86.7 percent, P=0.04), and six months afterward (94.3 percent vs. 82.8 percent, P=0.04). One major bleeding event occurred in the abciximab group (0.7 percent); none occurred in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with placebo, early administration of abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction improves coronary patency before stenting, the success rate of the stenting procedure, the rate of coronary patency at six months, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes.",
