        "abstract": "A patient with severe type II cryoglobulinemia after ten years of asymptomatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is reported. Laboratory data showed hypergammaglobulinemia with polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM, blood hyperviscosity, high level of cryocrit (60%), HCV viremia, and normal levels of serum transaminases. Due to cold exposure, acrocyanosis and cardiac ischemic attack occurred; he recovered after being artificially warmed. Administration of prednisolone and natural interferon-alpha for three months resulted in significant decreases in the levels of serum IgM and cryocrit.",

        "title": "Immunochemical and biomolecular studies of circulating immune complexes isolated from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis C virus infection",
        "abstract": "Circulating immune complexes (ICs) were isolated by affinity chromatography and sucrose density gradient fractionation during acute and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Immunochemical and biomolecular studies showed that they basically consist of the virus component, IgG with specific anti\u2010HCV activity and IgM bearing 17.109 epitope (IgM 17.109), an antigenic determinant common to rheumatoid factors (RFs) with WA cross\u2010idiotype (XId). An antigen\u2010specific IC assay was used to demonstrate IgG anti\u2010HCV/IgM 17.109 ICs (IgG\u2010IgM ICs) in five out of the five patients with acute and in 8 out of the 10 patients with chronic hepatitis C who mounted an IgG anti\u2010HCV immune response. They were not detected in patients with no IgG anti\u2010HCV response. IgG\u2013IgM ICs appeared in step with IgG anti\u2010HCV seroconversion and remained detectable for a long period irrespective of clinical outcome, in that they were demonstrated over a 4\u2010year follow\u2010up of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Their presence was unrelated to the severity and progression of liver histology. Despite similar serum levels of IgM 17.109 XId, antigen\u2010specific IgG\u2010IgM ICs were not found in acute and chronic hepatitis B or in acute hepatitis A. Thus, these ICs appear to be uniquely associated with HCV infection, supporting the view that IgM 17.109 XId derive from an antigen\u2010driven response strictly related to the involved antigen. Even although they have no apparent effects on the progression of HCV\u2010related liver disease, their presence may help to explain the immunological abnormalities and extrahepatic disorders observed in HCV infection.",

        "title": "Detection and distribution of hepatitis C virus-related proteins in lymph nodes of patients with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia and neoplastic or non-neoplastic lymphoproliferation.",
        "abstract": "The role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the pathogenesis of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) has been strongly emphasized in the last few years. Although MC is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder, the risk of overt B-cell malignancy greatly increases during its course. The occurrence of HCV infection in 10% to 30% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) suggests that this virus may have a role in the development of MC-associated B-cell malignancies. We identified 2 patients with hyperplastic reactive lymphadenopathy (HRL) and 12 with NHL in two series of MC patients chronically infected with HCV collected over a 5-year period. Structural and nonstructural HCV-related proteins were investigated in lymph node sections by immunohistochemistry and their location and distribution were correlated with clinical and histologic findings, viremic state, and HCV genotypes. In HRL, HCV proteins were found in the cytoplasm of lymphoid cells, mainly in interfollicular areas. However, occasional positive cells were found in the mantle zone and in the germinal centers of follicles. In addition, strong reactivity was found in the circulating mononuclear cells of capsular blood vessels. HCV immunodeposits were found in 3 of 12 (25%) NHL cases. Positive cells were frequently restricted to the cortex; if not, they were randomly diffused in the neoplastic tissue. Positivity was related to the low-grade type of NHL; in the 2 composite cases, HCV immunodetection was found in the small cells, whereas large anaplastic cells were regularly negative. Other viruses previously involved in lymphoproliferation, ie, human herpes virus-6 and Epstein-Barr virus, were absent in all tissues. These data emphasize that lymphoid organs may be a site of HCV infection. The demonstration of HCV-related proteins in a nonmalignant condition, namely HRL, indicates that HCV infection precedes the neoplastic transformation and possibly plays a major role in lymphomagenesis in MC.",
