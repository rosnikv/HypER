The primary outcome measure was joint space narrowing (JSN) in the medial tibiofemoral compartment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this placebo-controlled trial, obese women (n = 431) ages 45-64 years with unilateral radiographic knee OA were randomly assigned to receive 30 months of treatment with 100 mg doxycycline or placebo twice a day. Tibiofemoral JSN was measured manually in fluoroscopically standardized radiographic examinations performed at baseline, 16 months, and 30 months. Severity of joint pain was recorded at 6-month intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-one percent of all randomized subjects completed the trial. Radiographs were obtained from 85% of all randomized subjects at 30 months. Adherence to the dosing regimen was 91.8% among subjects who completed the study per protocol. After 16 months of treatment, the mean +/- SD loss of joint space width in the index knee in the doxycycline group was 40% less than that in the placebo group (0.15 +/- 0.42 mm versus 0.24 +/- 0.54 mm); after 30 months, it was 33% less (0.30 +/- 0.60 mm versus 0.45 +/- 0.70 mm). Doxycycline did not reduce the mean severity of joint pain, although pain scores in both treatment groups were low at baseline and remained low throughout the trial, suggesting the presence of a floor effect. However, the frequency of followup visits at which the subject reported a > or = 20% increase in pain in the index knee, relative to the previous visit, was reduced among those receiving doxycycline. In contrast, doxycycline did not have an effect on either JSN or pain in the contralateral knee. In both treatment groups, subjects who reported a > or = 20% increase in knee pain at the majority of their followup visits had more rapid JSN than those whose pain did not increase.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDoxycycline slowed the rate of JSN in knees with established OA. Its lack of effect on JSN in the contralateral knee suggests that pathogenetic mechanisms in that joint were different from those in the index knee.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nBisphosphonates have slowed the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in animal models and have decreased pain in states of high bone turnover. The Knee OA Structural Arthritis (KOSTAR) study, which is the largest study to date investigating a potential structure-modifying OA drug, tested the efficacy of risedronate in providing symptom relief and slowing disease progression in patients with knee OA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study group comprised 2,483 patients with medial compartment knee OA and 2-4 mm of joint space width (JSW), as determined using fluoroscopically positioned, semiflexed-view radiography. Patients were enrolled in 2 parallel 2-year studies in North America and the European Union. These studies evaluated the efficacy of risedronate at dosages of 5 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 35 mg/week (in Europe), and 50 mg/week (in North America) compared with placebo in reducing signs and symptoms, as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and patient global assessment (PGA) scores, and in slowing radiographic progression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA reduction of approximately 20% in signs and symptoms, as measured by WOMAC subscales and PGA scores, was observed in all groups, with no treatment effect of risedronate demonstrated. Risedronate did not significantly reduce radiographic progression as measured by decreased JSW or using a dichotomous definition of progression (joint space loss of >or=0.6 mm). Thirteen percent of patients receiving placebo demonstrated significant disease progression over 2 years.

The Knee OA Structural Arthritis (KOSTAR) study, which is the largest study to date investigating a potential structure-modifying OA drug, tested the efficacy of risedronate in providing symptom relief and slowing disease progression in patients with knee OA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study group comprised 2,483 patients with medial compartment knee OA and 2-4 mm of joint space width (JSW), as determined using fluoroscopically positioned, semiflexed-view radiography. Patients were enrolled in 2 parallel 2-year studies in North America and the European Union. These studies evaluated the efficacy of risedronate at dosages of 5 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 35 mg/week (in Europe), and 50 mg/week (in North America) compared with placebo in reducing signs and symptoms, as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and patient global assessment (PGA) scores, and in slowing radiographic progression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA reduction of approximately 20% in signs and symptoms, as measured by WOMAC subscales and PGA scores, was observed in all groups, with no treatment effect of risedronate demonstrated. Risedronate did not significantly reduce radiographic progression as measured by decreased JSW or using a dichotomous definition of progression (joint space loss of >or=0.6 mm). Thirteen percent of patients receiving placebo demonstrated significant disease progression over 2 years. A dose-dependent reduction in the level of C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type II collagen, a cartilage degradation marker associated with progressive OA, was seen in patients who received risedronate. No increase in the number of adverse events was demonstrated for risedronate compared with placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough risedronate (compared with placebo) did not improve signs or symptoms of OA, nor did it alter progression of OA, a reduction in the level of a marker of cartilage degradation was observed.

Using data from a large fracture prevention trial, we evaluated the effect of alendronate on the progression of radiographic spinal osteophytes (OST) and disc-space narrowing (DSN). Methods: The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) evaluated the effectiveness of alendronate at 5 mg/day (first 2 years) followed by 10 mg/day (third year) vs placebo over 3\u20134 years in preventing osteoporotic fractures. In 200 randomly selected subjects from FIT, we read baseline and follow-up lateral x rays for anterior OST and DSN (both scored 0\u20133 at each vertebral level) in the thoracic and lumbar spine. We calculated the mean difference in change in the sum of OST and DSN scores at T4 to L5 from baseline to follow-up, respectively, in each treatment arm using linear regression. Results: The participants\u2019 baseline characteristics were similar in the alendronate and placebo arms. The adjusted mean change in summary OST score was less in the alendronate group compared to placebo (3.2 vs 4.7, p\u200a=\u200a0.04), indicating that OST progression was less in the alendronate group. The adjusted mean change in summary DSN score was less in the alendronate group vs placebo for the whole spine (0.4 vs 0.7, p\u200a=\u200a0.2), particularly when limited to the lumbar spine (0.3 vs 0.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.04).

In this Phase 2 randomized, partially blind clinical trial, we tested the efficacy of IA clodronate vs HA in patients with primary KOA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and fifty men or women aged 50-75 years suffering from KOA were randomized to one of five IA therapies: (i) clodronate 0.5 mg one IA injection/week for 4 weeks; (ii) clodronate 1 mg one IA injection/week for 4 weeks; (iii) clodronate 2 mg one IA injection/week for 4 weeks; (iv) clodronate 1 mg two IA injections/week for 2 weeks (clodronate 1 + 1 mg); and (v) HA 20 mg one IA injection/week for 4 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVisual analogue scores (VASs) for different types of pain and the Lequesne index significantly improved in all treatment groups after the first injection and continued to improve even 2-4 weeks after the last injection without significant difference among the groups. A significant (P = 0.03) linear trend for a dose-response (0.5-2 mg clodronate) relationship was found for active movement VAS pain. Both joint extension and mobility scores improved significantly at all time points in all treatment groups without statistical differences among them.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study indicates that IA clodronate provides symptomatic and functional improvements at least as good as those obtained with HA.

Group A consisted of 24 patients treated for 24\u00a0months with clodronate 300\u00a0mg i.v. for 7\u00a0days, followed by clodronate i.m. 100\u00a0mg for 14\u00a0days every 3\u00a0months. Group B comprised 14 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine 400\u00a0mg daily for 30\u00a0days, followed by 200\u00a0mg daily for the next 11\u00a0months. In group A, 21/24 patients completed the trial and obtained significant pain reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Dreiser\u2019s score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), and number of tender joints (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).

In group B, 8/14 patients completed 12\u00a0months of the study, which showed the inefficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its lack of acceptance by patients (worsening pain and patient\u2019s global assessment). Therefore, enrolment was stopped. Differences between groups showed a pain decreasing trend for group A and a slightly increasing one for group B (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Physician and patient global assessments showed a strong increase in group A compared with group B (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

            "abstract": "Background: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder of articular cartilage and is the most common type of arthritis in the elderly. There are only a few reports regarding the use of Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Methods: To investigate the effects of Hydroxychloroquine on the symptoms of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence grade II and III), we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 44 patients. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received Hydroxychloroquine pills (200 mg twice daily) and the other group received placebo pills. Symptoms were assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at baseline and at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Results: Approximately, 98% of the patients were women at an average age of 47 years. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. In the placebo group, maximum improvement occurred at the 4th week; and during the remaining time, there was no significant improvement. In the Hydroxychloroquine group, maximum improvement occurred at the 8th week and persisted over the entire remaining follow-up period. There were significant differences between the two groups regarding the degree of reduction in the WOMAC total score and the WOMAC subscales scores of pain, stiffness, and function at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine conferred significant improvement in the symptoms of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis in our patients and may, accordingly, be recommended for knee osteoarthritis treatment.",
