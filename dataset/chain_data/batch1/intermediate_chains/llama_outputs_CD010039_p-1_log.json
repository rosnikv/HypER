            "abstract": "Objectives Previous laboratory studies have identified two dairy fractions, glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract (G600), with anti-inflammatory effects in models of acute gout. The aim of this proof-of-concept clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that daily intake of skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with GMP and G600 can prevent gout flares. Methods This was a 3-month randomised double-blind controlled trial of milk products for prevention of gout flares. One hundred and twenty patients with recurrent gout flares were randomised to one of three arms: lactose powder control, SMP control and SMP enriched with GMP and G600 (SMP/GMP/G600). The primary end point was change in the frequency of gout flares using a daily flare diary measured monthly for 3 months. Results The frequency of gout flares reduced in all three groups over the 3-month study period compared with baseline. Over the 3-month study period there was a significantly greater reduction in gout flares in the SMP/GMP/G600 group (analysis of covariance pgroup=0.031, Tukey post hoc test compared with lactose control, p=0.044). Following treatment with SMP/GMP/G600 over the 3-month period, greater improvements were also observed in pain and fractional excretion of uric acid, with trends to greater improvement in tender joint count. Similar adverse event rates and discontinuation rates were observed between the three groups. Conclusions This is the first reported controlled trial of dietary intervention in patients with gout, and suggests that SMP enriched with GMP and G600 may reduce the frequency of gout flares.",

            "abstract": "Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

            "abstract": "Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all\u2010cause mortality with febuxostat.

We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first\u2010line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol.

These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first\u2010line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision\u2010making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

            "abstract": "This review aims to critically present the available clinical evidence supporting the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. For this reason, the studies published on uric acid (UA)-lowering drugs in the English language from 2000 to August 2019 have been carefully reviewed. The terms \u201cserum uric acid,\u201d \u201cxanthine oxidase,\u201d \u201callopurinol,\u201d \u201cfebuxostat,\u201d and \u201ctopiroxostat\u201d were incorporated into an electronic search strategy, alone and in combinations, in both MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Even if new urate-lowering drugs seem of particular efficacy for acute treatment of refractory hyperuricemia, their use is supported by relatively small clinical evidence. On the contrary, large long-term clinical trials have demonstrated that xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs, namely, allopurinol and febuxostat) are effective, safe, and relatively well-tolerated in most of the patients. They have mainly been tested in the elderly, in patients affected by chronic diseases such as heart failure and cancer, and in patients taking a large number of drugs, confirming their safety profile. Recent data also show that they could exert some positive effects on vascular health, renal function, and glucose metabolism. Their cost is also low. In conclusion, XOIs remain the first choice of UA-lowering drug for chronic treatment.",

For this purpose, in-vitro and different computational methods were applied to determine the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory potential of eight structurally diverse phenolic compounds. The results revealed that phenolic compounds (C1\u2013C8) possess strong to weak XO inhibitory activity. These results were further confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 1H NMR analysis. Furthermore, computational study results revealed that phenolic compounds (C1\u2013C8) bind with the surrounding amino acids of XO at the molybdenum (MO) site. These in-vitro and in-silico results divulge that phenolic compounds have a strong potential to lower uric acid levels via interacting with the XO enzyme and can be used to combat hyperuricemia.",

            "abstract": "This project was designed to explore the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory mechanism of eight structurally diverse phenolic compounds [quercetin: C1, quercetin-3-rhamnoside: C2, 4, 5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid: C3, 3, 5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid: C4, 3, 4-O-di-caffeoylquinic acid: C5, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (C6), 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid: C7, and caffeic acid: C8]. For this purpose, in-vitro and different computational methods were applied to determine the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory potential of eight structurally diverse phenolic compounds. The results revealed that phenolic compounds (C1\u2013C8) possess strong to weak XO inhibitory activity. These results were further confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 1H NMR analysis. Furthermore, computational study results revealed that phenolic compounds (C1\u2013C8) bind with the surrounding amino acids of XO at the molybdenum (MO) site. These in-vitro and in-silico results divulge that phenolic compounds have a strong potential to lower uric acid levels via interacting with the XO enzyme and can be used to combat hyperuricemia.",

            "abstract": "Bee pollen, known as a \u2018life-giving dust\u2019, is a product of honeybees using flower pollen grains and combining them with their saliva secretions. Thus, flower pollen could be an indicator of the bee pollen botanical source. Identification of bee pollen sources is a highly crucial process for the evaluation of its health benefits, as chemical composition is directly related to its pharmacological activity. In this study, the chemical profiles, contents of phenolic marker compounds and pharmacological activities of Hedera helix L. (ivy) bee pollen samples from T\u00fcrkiye and Slovenia, as well as ivy flower pollen grains, were compared. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) analyses revealed that pollen samples, regardless of where they were collected, have similar chemical profiles due to the fact that they have the same botanical origins. Marker compounds afzelin, platanoside and quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03b2-galactopyranoside, common to both bee pollen and flower pollen, were isolated from bee pollen, and their structures were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). These three compounds, as well as chlorogenic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (found in flower pollen), were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. In vitro tests and effect-directed analyses were used to evaluate the xanthine oxidase inhibition and antioxidant activity of the marker compounds and extracts from flower pollen and bee pollen. This is the first report comparing chemical profiles and related bioactivities of the flower pollen and bee pollen of the same botanical origin, as well as the first report of the chemical profile and related bioactivities of ivy flower pollen.",
