        "title": "Pain and the placebo in rehabilitation using TENS and laser.",
        "abstract": "The placebo effect of many health-related treatment is generally acknowledged. This paper discusses the role of the placebo in relation to pain perception and pain control. The theoretical basis of the placebo response is examined, followed by a discussion of the factors influencing the placebo response. Finally, the magnitude of the placebo response is explored specifically in relation to outcome measures and the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and laser for pain relief.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the placebo effect in relation to pain perception and control, specifically discussing the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief. Although it does not directly build upon or depend on the findings of the source paper, it is inspired by the hypothesis of the source paper, which investigated the therapeutic effect of TENS in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."
