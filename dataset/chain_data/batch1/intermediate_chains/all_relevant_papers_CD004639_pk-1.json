        "title": "Decreased calcium pump adenosine triphosphatase in red blood cells of hypertensive subjects.",
        "abstract": "Several operationally defined adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities were determined in vitro in red blood cell lysates of normotensive or hypertensive humans: Mg2+-ATPase, Na+,K+-ATPase, and Ca2+ pump ATPase, the latter in the calmodulin-activated and basal states. Basal Ca2+ pump ATPase was defined as the Ca2+-activated ATPase resistant to 10(-4) M trifluoperazine. Subjects were part of a double-blind study in which treatment was divided into several phases: baseline (4 weeks), placebo or calcium (1 g elemental calcium/day, 8 weeks), placebo washout (4 weeks), placebo or calcium (1 g elemental calcium/day, 8 weeks). Irrespective of the phase of treatment, the basal Ca2+ pump ATPase activity in red blood cell lysates of 36 hypertensive subjects was significantly less than that in lysates from 18 normotensive subjects. Other ATPase activities did not differ significantly, although all ATPases tended to be decreased in hypertension. The data are consistent with previous reports of altered membrane Ca2+ binding and transport in hypertension, but the precise changes are not elucidated.",

        "title": "Controlled trial of long-term oral calcium supplementation in essential hypertension.",
        "abstract": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of oral calcium supplementation was carried out in 18 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. After 15 weeks of oral calcium supplementation, 1 g/day, of the patients' habitual diet, the only blood pressure change (compared with the results of placebo treatment) was in the average standing systolic blood pressure, which was significantly reduced (-8.6 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). The 24-hour urinary calcium excretion and the total serum calcium concentration increased significantly during calcium supplementation (p less than 0.05), indicating good compliance with the treatment. The individual blood pressure changes with high calcium intake were found to be inversely related to basal 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (r = -0.69, p less than 0.001 for standing systolic pressure; r = -0.55, p less than 0.002 for standing diastolic pressure). This correlation was independent of age, basal blood pressure, serum calcium concentration, basal 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, and body weight changes during the trial. In particular, a subgroup of six patients, who had a basal 24-hour urinary calcium excretion higher than the mean + 2 SD of a reference healthy population previously described, showed a substantial average blood pressure fall at variance with the other patients in the study. These results do not support the usefulness of an oral calcium supplement in the majority of subjects with mild essential hypertension; however, they suggest that a group of patients with a previously reported abnormality of calcium metabolism may be responsive to this therapeutic measure.",

        "title": "Neurohumoral and Hemodynamic Responses to Dietary Calcium Supplementation in Deoxycorticosterone\u2010Salt Hypertensive Dogs",
        "abstract": "We determined whether dietary calcium supplementation can influence the development and maintenance of hypertension in deoxycorticosterone (DOC)-salt-treated dogs. Dogs on normal dietary calcium (0.4%) had significant increases in mean arterial pressure (from 92 \u00b1 2 to 131 \u00b1 3 mm Hg, p < 0.01); those given high dietary calcium (1.7%) had attenuated but significant increases in mean arterial pressure (from 90 \u00b1 2 to 107 \u00b1 1, p < 0.01). The elevation of blood pressure in dogs on normal dietary calcium was primarily due to increased calculated total peripheral resistance, which was prevented by the high calcium diet. The increases in blood pressure could not be attributed to any changes in cardiac output, blood volume, or plasma norepinephrine. These results suggest that mineralocorticoid hypertension in the dog is associated with abnormalities not only in sodium, but also in calcium metabolism. Further, they suggest a direct link between sodium and calcium metabolism and may thus have implications for the pathogenesis and management of saltdependent hypertension.",

        "title": "Preliminary report: natriuretic effect of calcium supplementation in hypertensive women over forty.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-four hypertensive women over 40 years of age were given calcium carbonate 1 g/d for 12 weeks after a 4-week period of observation. Blood pressures were measured every 2 weeks. Plasma ionized calcium (Ca++), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) were measured twice in the control period and twice in the Ca-supplementation period. Urine measurements included Ca, Magnesium (Mg), Na, K, prostaglandin E2, and osmolality. Blood pressures were averaged to get group means, and these were compared using the paired t-test. For the group, seated systolic blood pressure fell from 141.5 +/- 13.2 to 136.3 +/- 11.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.025) at the end of 12 weeks of supplementation, and diastolic blood pressure fell from 84.5 +/- 7.5 to 81.1 +/- 7.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.025). There was no correlation between serum Ca++ and blood pressure. The urinary Na excretion was markedly elevated during the Ca supplementation period: 25.8 +/- 14.2 vs. 18.4 +/- 7.9 mmol/4 hr (p less than 0.005). These results suggest an indirect (natriuretic) effect as the means by which Ca supplementation lowers blood pressure.",

        "title": "Oral calcium treatment lowers blood pressure in renovascular hypertensive rats by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.",
        "abstract": "The effects of calcium supplementation on blood pressure and its mechanisms were investigated in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats. Two series of experiments were performed: one was begun just after renal artery constriction, the other after the onset of hypertension. Calcium supplementation significantly attenuated the development of hypertension (systolic blood pressure: 183 +/- 8 vs 130 +/- 2 mm Hg) and was found to abate existing renovascular hypertension (systolic blood pressure: from 183 +/- 8 to 151 +/- 4 mm Hg). Calcium treatment did not cause significant alterations in fluid intake, urine volume, or urinary sodium excretion in either study. However, increased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were suppressed to the basal levels at the end of 3 weeks of calcium treatment (14 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 2 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr; 530 +/- 50 vs 380 +/- 40 pg/ml). Blood pressure of calcium-treated renovascular hypertensive rats responded poorly to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril injection and angiotensin II analogue (saralasin) infusion. Further, in rats with chronic established renovascular hypertension, calcium treatment attenuated the enhanced pressor response to norepinephrine, but not to angiotensin II. These results suggest that the blood pressure-lowering actions of calcium supplementation are related primarily to suppression of renin secretion and secondarily to alteration of pressor response to norepinephrine in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats.",
