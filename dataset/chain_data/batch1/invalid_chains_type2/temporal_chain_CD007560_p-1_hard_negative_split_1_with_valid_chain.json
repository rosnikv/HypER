        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUncontrolled studies have suggested that methotrexate may be effective in patients with active ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral methotrexate in chronic steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with active ulcerative colitis who have received steroids and/or immunosuppressives for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months with a current Mayo Clinic score of > or = 7 were included in the study. Methotrexate (12.5 mg) or placebo was added to their treatment once weekly for 9 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-seven patients were included (methotrexate, 30 patients, placebo, 37 patients). The proportion of patients entering first remission (methotrexate, 46.7%; placebo, 48.6%), the time to reach first remission (methotrexate, 4.1 +/- 1.9 months; placebo, 3.4 +/- 1.7 months), as well as the proportions of patients having a relapse after first remission (methotrexate, 64.3%; placebo, 44.4%) were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean Mayo Clinic score, the mean monthly steroid dose, and the proportion of abnormal laboratory results during the study were also similar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg was not found to be better than placebo in the induction or maintenance of remission in patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis.",

However, it appears to involve an enhanced systemic immune response and intensified local intestinal mucosal inflammatory activity, mediated through various inflammatory cells and an array of proinflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment of Crohn's disease. The controlled trials of the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study and the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study established that corticosteroids were effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease for the duration of the studies (6\u201317 wk). However, corticosteroids have not been shown to have an impact on the maintenance of long term remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, they are associated with a high potential for dependence and serious toxic side effects. Alternative classes of medical therapy for Crohn's disease, including modified corticosteroids and a group of new biological therapies, have proven to be efficacious in the management of active and/or quiescent Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Objective. The aim of this study was to elucidate the predictive value of intra-operative enteroscopy (IOE) and the effect of enteral nutrition (EN) with regard to the postoperative recurrence of Crohn disease (CD). Material and methods. Forty patients requiring surgery for severe intestinal complications of CD were examined by IOE, and the severity of the remnant small intestine was determined. Patients were subclassified into either an EN group (>1,200\u2009kcal/day) or a non-EN group (<1,200\u2009kcal/day) according to the amount of daily EN intake after surgery. Contributions of IOE findings and EN to postoperative recurrence were analysed retrospectively. Results. IOE identified intestinal lesions in 39 patients and active intestinal lesions in 24 patients. The cumulative rate of postoperative recurrence was significantly higher in patients with cobblestone appearance confirmed by IOE (p=0.006). However, other active intestinal lesions were not related to postoperative recurrence. EN reduced the cumulative rate of postoperative recurrence (p=0.017), especially in patients with penetrating type (p=0.005), in patients who did not have colitis (p=0.051) and in patients who did not have active intestinal lesions confirmed by IOE (p=0.02). Conclusions. EN is a prophylactic that prevents the postoperative recurrence of small intestinal CD. Patients with the penetrating type of CD, and those who do not have active lesions in the small intestine according to IOE, are candidates for EN after surgery.",

        "title": "Enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPrevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of quiescent Crohn's disease (CD). Current therapies (e.g. methotrexate, biologics, 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) may be effective for maintaining remission in CD, but these drugs may cause significant adverse events. Interventions that are effective and safe for maintenance of remission in CD are desirable.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in CD and to assess the impact of formula composition on effectiveness.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 27 July 2018. We also searched references of retrieved studies and reviews.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) including participants of any age with quiescent CD were considered for inclusion. Studies that compared enteral nutrition with no intervention, placebo or any other intervention were selected for review.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures (i.e. height and weight), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference and 95% CI. A random-effects model was used for the statistical analysis. We used the GRADE criteria to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nFour RCTs (262 adult participants) met the inclusion criteria. One study (N = 33) compared an elemental diet to a non-elemental (polymeric) diet. One study (N = 51) compared a half elemental diet to a regular free diet. Another study (N = 95) compared an elemental diet to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or a no treatment control group. One study (N= 83) compared a polymeric diet to mesalamine. Two studies were rated as high risk of bias due to lack of blinding or incomplete outcome data. The other two studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias. The studies were not pooled due to differences in control interventions and the way outcomes were assessed.The effect of an elemental diet compared to a polymeric diet on remission rates or withdrawal due to adverse events is uncertain. Fifty-eight per cent (11/19) of participants in the elemental diet group relapsed at 12 months compared to 57% (8/14) of participants in the polymeric diet group (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.84; very low certainty evidence). Thirty-two per cent (6/19) of participants in the elemental diet group were intolerant to the enteral nutritional formula because of taste or smell and were withdrawn from the study in the first 2 weeks compared to zero participants (0/14) in the polymeric diet group (RR 9.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 159.93; low certainty evidence). Anthropometric measures, QoL, adverse events and serious adverse events were not reported as outcomes.The effect of an elemental diet (half of total daily calorie requirements) compared to a normal free diet on relapse rates is uncertain. Thirty-five per cent (9/26) of participants in the elemental diet group relapsed at 12 months compared to 64% (16/25) of participants in the free diet group (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; very low certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported. This study reported no differences in weight change between the two diet groups. Height and QoL were not reported as outcomes.The effect of an elemental diet compared to 6-MP on relapse rates or adverse events is uncertain. Thirty-eight per cent (12/32) of participants in the elemental diet group relapsed at 12 months compared to 23% (7/30) of participants in the 6-MP group (RR 1.61; 95% CI 0.73 to 3.53; very low certainty evidence). Three per cent (1/32) of participants in the elemental diet group had an adverse event compared to 13% (4/30) of participants in the 6-MP group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.98; low certainty evidence). Adverse events in the elemental diet group included surgery due to worsening CD. Adverse events in the 6-MP group included liver injury (n = 2), hair loss (n = 1) and surgery due to an abscess (n = 1). No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events were reported. Weight, height and QoL were not reported as outcomesThe effect of a polymeric diet compared to mesalamine on relapse rates and weight is uncertain. Forty-two per cent (18/43) of participants in the polymeric diet group relapsed at 6 months compared to 55% (22/40) of participants in the mesalamine group (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). The mean difference in weight gain over the study period was 1.9 kg higher in the polymeric diet group compared to mesalamine (95% CI -4.62 to 8.42; low certainty evidence). Two participants in the polymeric diet group experienced nausea and four had diarrhoea. It is unclear if any participants in the mesalamine group had an adverse event. Height, QoL, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events were not reported as outcomes.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of enteral nutrition in quiescent CD can be drawn. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of using enteral nutrition as maintenance therapy in CD. Currently, there are four ongoing studies (estimated enrolment of 280 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.",

        "abstract": "Medical and surgical treatments for Crohn\u2019s disease are associated with toxic effects. Medical therapy aims for mucosal healing and is achievable with biologics, immunosuppressive therapy, and specialised enteral nutrition, but not with corticosteroids. Sustained remission remains a therapeutic challenge. Enteral nutrition, containing macro- and micro-nutrients, is nutritionally complete, and is provided in powder or liquid form. Enteral nutrition is a low-risk and minimally invasive therapy. It is well-established and recommended as first line induction therapy in paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease with remission rates of up to 80%. Other than in Japan, enteral nutrition is not routinely used in the adult population among Western countries, mainly due to unpalatable formulations which lead to poor compliance. This study aims to offer a comprehensive review of available enteral nutrition formulations and the literature supporting the use and mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition in adult Crohn\u2019s disease patients, in order to support clinicians in real world decision-making when offering/accepting treatment. The mechanisms of actions of enteral feed, including their impact on the gut microbiome, were explored. Barriers to the use of enteral nutrition, such as compliance and the route of administration, were considered. All available enteral preparations have been comprehensively described as a practical guide for clinical use. Likewise, guidelines are reported and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Enteral nutrition seems to play a significant role in the treatment of both adults and children with active Crohn\u2019s disease, and to a lesser degree in the treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis. The inclusion of some special factors in the enteral nutrition formulas might increase the rate of the efficacy. Actually, enteral nutrition enriched in Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2 reduced the activity index and maintained remission in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. In addition, a number of experimental animal studies have shown that colostrum exerts a significantly positive result. Probiotics of a special type and a certain dosage could also reduce the inflammatory process in patients with active ulcerative colitis. Therefore, the addition of these factors in an enteral nutrition formula might increase its effectiveness. Although the use of these formulas is not supported by large clinical trials, it could be argued that their administration in selected cases as an exclusive diet or in combination with the drugs used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could benefit the patient. In this review, the authors provide an update on the role of enteral nutrition, supplemented with Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2, colostrum, and probiotics in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the first line of treatment for pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We studied EEN nutritional composition and TGF-\u03b2 effect in a mouse model of colitis, as well as the role of intestinal microbiota. Methods Mice were treated with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) during 5 days to induce colitis, until the inflammatory peak (day 7) or gut restitution (day 14). After DSS treatment, some of them received EEN formula such as Modulen IBD\u00ae (DM mice) or Infatrini Peptisorb\u00ae (DINF mice), with TGF-\u03b2 supplementation or neutralization, and clinical inflammation was evaluated. After sacrifice, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation were analyzed, as well as intestinal permeability (IP). The composition of mucosal colonic microbiota was analyzed and fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to evaluate its capacity to mediate anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative effect. Colonic crypts from DSS and EEN mice were cultured as 3D organoids and cellular properties were analyzed. Results DSS mice developed colitis, as evidenced by the weight loss and clinical inflammation. It was accompanied by macroscopic inflammation such as colon thickness and edemas, and an elevated IP. In contrast, EEN mice with TGF-\u03b2 formula present faster weight recovery and decreased inflammatory parameters, with a normalized IP, suggesting gut restitution and functionality. These functional improvements were not obtained for EEN mice without TGF-\u03b2 formula. Moreover, EEN with Modulen IBD\u00ae (DM mice) modified the microbiota in comparison to DSS condition and attenuated inflammation. In addition, the organoids from DM mice colonic crypts treated had an enhanced survival, and re-epithelialization capacity. Conclusions Both EEN formula have anti-inflammatory properties, certainly by the nutritional composition. However, TGF-\u03b2 plays a significant role in intestinal restitution and restoring barrier function. These beneficial effects are partly mediated by the microbiota to maintain gut homeostasis.",
