        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with moderate-to-severe active RA who were receiving MTX for 6 consecutive months, with stable doses for > or = 3 months (those with disease duration of >6 months but <12 years) were randomized into 6 groups: placebo or 0.04, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of anakinra administered in a single, daily, subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (attained an ACR20 response) at week 12.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 419 patients were randomized in the study. Patient demographics and disease status were similar in the 6 treatment groups. The ACR20 responses at week 12 in the 5 active treatment plus MTX groups demonstrated a statistically significant (P = 0.001) dose-response relationship compared with the ACR20 response in the placebo plus MTX group. The ACR20 response rate in the anakinra 1.0-mg/kg (46%; P = 0.001) and 2.0-mg/kg (38%; P = 0.007) dose groups was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (19%). The ACR20 responses at 24 weeks were consistent with those at 12 weeks. Similar improvements in anakinra-treated subjects were noted in individual ACR components, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, onset of ACR20 response, sustainability of ACR20 response, and magnitude of ACR response. Anakinra was safe and well tolerated. Injection site reaction was the most frequently noted adverse event, and this led to premature study withdrawal in 7% (1.0-mg/kg group) to 10% (2.0-mg/kg group) of patients receiving higher doses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with persistently active RA, the combination of anakinra and MTX was safe and well tolerated and provided significantly greater clinical benefit than MTX alone.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the potential for additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy with the selective anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent etanercept and the anti-interleukin-1 agent anakinra.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred forty-four patients in whom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was active despite methotrexate therapy were treated with subcutaneous etanercept only (25 mg twice weekly), full-dosage etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day), or half-dosage etanercept (25 mg once weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day) for 6 months in a double-blind study at 41 centers in the US. Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abatacept at a fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg by weight range, or placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe abatacept and placebo groups exhibited similar frequencies of adverse events (90% and 87%, respectively), serious adverse events (13% and 12%, respectively), and discontinuations due to adverse events (5% and 4%, respectively). Five patients (0.5%) in the abatacept group and 4 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group died during the study. Serious infections were more frequent in the abatacept group than in the placebo group (2.9% versus 1.9%). Fewer than 4% of patients in either group experienced a severe or very severe infection. The incidence of neoplasms was 3.5% in both groups. When evaluated according to background therapy, serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the subgroup receiving abatacept plus a biologic agent (22.3%) than in the other subgroups (11.7-12.5%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAbatacept in combination with synthetic DMARDs was well tolerated and improved physical function and physician- and patient-reported disease outcomes. However, abatacept in combination with biologic background therapies was associated with an increase in the rate of serious adverse events. Therefore, abatacept is not recommended for use in combination with biologic therapy.",

        "title": "Comparative Effectiveness of Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease of uncertain cause associated with symmetric polyarthritis and, in some patients, with extra-articular manifestations. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis experience a chronic, fluctuating course that may result in joint damage, disability, deformities, and even a shortened life span. The goals of treatment are to control pain and inflammation and to avoid, to the extent possible, progressive joint destruction. In recent years, studies comparing immediate with delayed treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have shown that early treatment with these drugs is associated with improved outcomes for signs and symptoms and slower progression of damage to joints (1). Currently available DMARDs fall into 2 broad categories: synthetic DMARDs, including sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and leflunomide, and biological DMARDs, including tumor necrosis factorblocking agents, anakinra, abatacept, and rituximab. Pharmacologic treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis typically consists of synthetic DMARDs, alone or in combination, or a biological DMARD, either alone or in combination with 1 or more synthetic DMARDs. Biological DMARDs are not generally used in combination with other biological DMARDs because several of these combinations have shown increased toxicity (2, 3). Given the multiplicity of effective DMARDs, clinicians need an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the evidence to help them choose 1 DMARD over another for an individual patient and, when a single agent fails to control disease activity, decide which combinations of DMARDs to consider. The report by Donahue and colleagues in this issue (4) addresses this need by reporting the results of a systematic review of the literature comparing the benefits and harms associated with different DMARDs, used alone or in combination. The authors include head-to-head randomized trials, prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses for 11 drug therapies in their review. Their review provides evidence for the following important conclusions: there is no evidence that any synthetic DMARD is more effective than another; combinations of synthetic DMARDs can be effective in patients who continue to have active disease despite monotherapy with a synthetic DMARD; the clinical response to monotherapy with tumor necrosis factor blockers compared with that of methotrexate is similar, but radiographic outcomes are better with tumor necrosis factor blockers, and clinical outcomes are better when methotrexate is combined with a biological DMARD than when methotrexate is administered alone. These general conclusions are well supported by the evidence and are clinically useful. However, the authors offer a few caveats. First, they note that several of the studies used a lower methotrexate dose than is typically used in the United States (7.5 to 15 mg/wk vs. 7.5 to 25 mg/wk) (5, 6), which limits the lessons we can draw from studies that compare methotrexate and other synthetic DMARDs. Second, most studies were short-term efficacy studies conducted in selected populations. Many of the randomized trials in rheumatoid arthritis were conducted to demonstrate efficacy of products for registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and they typically use placebo as a comparator. Consequently, head-to-head comparisons of some important drugs have never been done. For example, no published randomized head-to-head trial compares the available biological DMARDs with each other. These shortcomings of the evidence notwithstanding, Donahue and colleagues have provided an evidence base for comparing outcomes of many currently available therapies. How do the conclusions of this review compare with current recommendations? The American College of Rheumatology offered guidelines for managing rheumatoid arthritis in 2002 (7). These guidelines emphasize the importance of establishing the diagnosis early, documenting the baseline level of disease activity and existing joint damage, and estimating the prognosis. Most patients should start taking a DMARD within 3 months of diagnosis. In addition to DMARDs, physicians should consider treating with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; using local or low-dose corticosteroids; and initiating nonpharmacologic interventions, including physical therapy and occupational therapy. Physicians should assess patients regularly (approximately every 3 months) for a response to treatment. For patients with active disease despite treatment with a DMARD, the guidelines recommend 1 of the following strategies: a trial with methotrexate, if the patient has not yet received it; adding another synthetic DMARD (combination therapy); switching to monotherapy with another synthetic DMARD; and biological DMARD therapy, alone or in combination with synthetic DMARDs. Thus, the American College of Rheumatology guidelines seem generally consistent with the findings of Donahue and colleagues. Many patients continue to live with active rheumatoid arthritis despite DMARD treatment and the availability of many effective regimens. What can be done to improve the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Two approaches may help guide future research. One is to compare different treatment strategies, rather than comparing individual study drugs, as exemplified by the FinRACo (Finnish Rheumatoid Arthritis Combination Therapy), BeST, and TICORA (Tight Control for Rheumatoid Arthritis) studies (810). In these 3 randomized trials of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, treating physicians monitored disease activity at regular intervals (every 3 months) and adjusted therapy as needed to attain a target low level of disease activity. All 3 studies used strategies associated with high rates of remission at 18 to 24 months, based on the disease activity score (a standardized measure of disease activity). Patients in these studies had good clinical outcomes, which suggests that treating to the target of low disease activity by using a standardized sequence of graded treatment regimens (the empirical approach) is a sound treatment strategy. In the future, it may be possible to define biomarkers that identify patients who are most likely to respond to a particular treatment and those who are most prone to developing toxicity (11). Hopefully, with a mix of different strategies, we can find a way to target the best treatment to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In summary, many disease-modifying agents are effective, both as monotherapy and in combination, for treating rheumatoid arthritis. By following the American College of Rheumatology guidelines for monitoring disease activity and selecting pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment (1214), clinicians can optimize the care of their patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "title": "Predictors of the Use of Physical Therapy Services Among Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Background Although physical therapy is a proven and recommended intervention for managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), few studies have explored correlates of physical therapy service use among people with RA. Objective The purposes of this study were: (1) to describe physical therapy use among people with RA and (2) to identify biopsychosocial factors associated with physical therapy use. It was expected that use of physical therapy services would be lower than previously reported, considering recent medical advancements, and that including contextual factors may lead to identification of new factors associated with physical therapy use. Design This was a cohort study. Methods Of 1,032 patients prospectively recruited from a large hospital registry, 772 completed baseline and laboratory assessments, received a physical examination, and completed a 1-year follow-up survey regarding physical therapy service use. Measures included: demographics (ie, age, sex, marital status, race, employment, disability status, insurance, income, comorbidities, and education), disease duration, RA medications, self-efficacy (assessed with the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale), social support (assessed with the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index), function (assessed with the Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire), and disease activity (assessed with the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index). Self-reported use of physical therapy (yes/no) was assessed at the 1-year follow-up. A staged regression approach, based on a theoretical model, was used to select and enter variables into the regression to develop a parsimonious set of predictors. Results The patients were well educated and had modestly high incomes, and most had health insurance. Approximately 15.3% of the patients used physical therapy services during the designated follow-up period. Using multivariable modeling, the most significant predictors of physical therapy service use were moderate to high disease activity (odds ratio [OR]=1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1\u20131.8), less than a college education (OR=0.5, 95% CI=0.2\u20130.8), greater social networks (OR=2.1, 95% CI=1.3\u20133.5), and being on disability (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.3\u20134.6). Limitations The limitations of this study were use of a convenience sample and the potential for misclassification of physical therapy service use. Conclusions Patients with less than college education were less likely to receive physical therapy services, and those with more active disease, those who were on disability, and those who had greater social networks were more likely to receive physical therapy services.",
