        "abstract": "Statin therapy is well established for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins may also reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity via a pleiotropic (non\u2013lipid-lowering) effect. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to determine the influence of statin treatment on adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac, vascular, or noncardiovascular surgery. Two independent authors abstracted data from 12 retrospective and 3 prospective trials (n = 223,010 patients). A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the overall effect of preoperative statin therapy on postoperative outcomes. Preoperative statin therapy was associated with 38% and 59% reduction in the risk of mortality after cardiac (1.9% vs. 3.1%; P = 0.0001) and vascular (1.7% vs. 6.1%; P = 0.0001) surgery, respectively. When including noncardiac surgery, a 44% reduction in mortality (2.2% vs. 3.2%; P = 0.0001) was observed. Preoperative statin therapy may reduce postoperative mortality in patients undergoing surgical procedures. However, the statin associated effects on postoperative cardiovascular morbidity are too variable to draw any conclusion.",

        "title": "Anaesthesia for vascular procedures: How do South African patients differ?",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT South African vascular anaesthetic practice is strongly influenced by European and American literature. This is inappropriate, as the prevalence and aetiology of cardiovascular disease, the aetiology of the vascular pathology, and the vascular surgical outcomes in South African patients differ from those reported internationally. South African vascular surgical patients are at higher cardiac risk and have a higher mortality than that reported in the international literature. Although cardiac clinical risk predictors are probably consistent globally, the epidemiological transition of cardiovascular disease and the socioeconomic consequences of apartheid have had a profound influence on the \u2018weighting\u2019 of these risk factors in South Africans. Of the South African race groups, South African Indians have the highest cardiac mortality, secondary to a high prevalence of renal dysfunction, diabetes and cerebrovascular accidents. South African black patients now have a similar cardiovascular burden to that reported internationally. The perioperative cardiac mortality of black South Africans is lower than international comparisons, probably secondary to a cardioprotective lipid profile of these patients. Black South Africans have an unacceptably high non-cardiac mortality associated with vascular surgery. Access to medical therapy for South African vascular surgical patients is wholly inadequate, as only a quarter of vascular patients are on statin therapy. Nearly 6% of South African vascular patients present with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vasculopathy of predominantly two distinct clinical presentations: aneurysmal and occlusive vascular disease. Aneurysmal disease is associated with a worse long-term prognosis. The poor access to highly-active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for these patients is unacceptable. It is imperative that practice guidelines based on South African epidemiological data be established, that clinical cardiac and HIV risk indices be developed specifically for South African vascular patients, that socioeconomic issues affecting outcome between race groups be addressed, and that access to statin therapy and HAART be improved.",

        "title": "Risk factors associated with intermediate and long-term mortality following vascular surgery in South African patients",
        "abstract": "Summary There are few data on predictors of mortality following vascular surgery in South African patients. While in the developed world, peri-operative risk factors are also associated with intermediate-term survival, it is likely that the weighting and even the clinical risk factors may be different in South African patients due to the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in developing countries. The aim of this study was therefore to determine risk factors associated with intermediate and long-term mortality in South African vascular surgical patients. Design A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Intermediate and long-term survival was determined by subsequent hospital visits or admissions. For patients who did not return to the hospital, the patient or patient\u2019s next of kin was contacted telephonically. The outcome of the patient, and the time to the outcome following the surgical procedure were recorded. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was conducted using Cox regression analysis to determine predictors of intermediate-term mortality. Results Only hypertension and diabetes were associated with intermediate and long-term mortality at the bivariate level of analysis with p < 0.10. There was no co-linearity between hypertension and diabetes. Hypertension was the only predictor of intermediate and long-term survival retained in the multivariate model (hazard ratio 3.86, 95% confidence interval 0.83\u201315.4, p = 0.086). Conclusion In contrast to developed-world observations, peri-operative clinical risk indices were not associated with intermediate and long-term survival in South African vascular surgical patients. Instead, two risk factors that were identified in the South African National Burden of Disease study were associated with mortality. It appears that a \u2018western lifestyle\u2019 (and the presence of associated risk factors) may be more important predictors of intermediate and long-term mortality than peri-operative risk predictors of cardiac events in South African vascular surgical patients. This study highlights an important public health issue for the South African population where the most important determinants of mortality are continued exposure to risk factors (such as hypertension and diabetes) in the community, with little modification of these risk factors through primary health surveillance and management, even after surgical admission for pathology known to be associated with these risk factors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRecent evidence suggests that application of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for peri-operative cardiovascular risk stratification in vascular surgery patients may be inappropriate, necessitating the development of risk indices specific to vascular surgery patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo identify risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in South African patients undergoing major vascular surgery, and to develop an appropriate cardiovascular risk stratification index, the South African Vascular Surgical Cardiac Risk Index (SAVS-CRI), which could be used to predict the risk of peri-operative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in South African vascular surgery patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe prospectively collected data related to peri-operative MACE occurrence and established risk factors for peri-operative MACEs from adult patients who underwent elective vascular surgery at a tertiary hospital in Durban, South Africa, between February 2008 and March 2011. We determined independent predictors of peri-operative MACEs in our cohort by binary logistic regression and used the identified predictors to create a risk index that stratified patients into low-, intermediate- or high-risk groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix independent predictors of peri-operative MACEs were identified in the vascular surgery cohort: age >65 years, a history of ischaemic heart disease, a history of diabetes, chronic \u03b2-blockade, prior coronary revascularisation, and the vascular surgical procedure. The risk model derived from these risk factors appeared to discriminate between the three risk groups more accurately than the RCRI.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe RCRI is not appropriate for peri-operative cardiovascular risk stratification in vascular surgery patients. The SAVS-CRI may be preferable for risk stratification in South African vascular surgery patients, although independent validation is required.",

Case and control groups were compared using \u03c72, Fisher's exact, McNemar's or Student's t-tests, where applicable.
