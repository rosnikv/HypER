        "abstract": "The blood pressure response of 48 hypertensive persons and 32 normotensive persons to elemental calcium (as the carbonate or citrate salt), 1000 mg/d for 8 weeks, was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Compared with placebo, Ca2+ significantly lowered supine systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg, standing systolic blood pressure by 5.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.02), and supine diastolic blood pressure by 2.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) in hypertensive persons. The response in normotensive persons differed significantly from that in hypertensives (p less than 0.03) as their blood pressure was unchanged. Twenty-one (44%) hypertensive and 6 (19%) normotensive persons achieved a reduction in standing systolic arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater. Reported adverse effects were similar between calcium and placebo phases and did not necessitate withdrawal of any patient from the trial. Treatment with 1000 mg/d of oral Ca2+ for 8 weeks represents a safe, well-tolerated, nonpharmacologic intervention that lowers blood pressure in selected patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",

        "abstract": "This report reviews a variety of nonpharmacological approaches used to control arterial blood pressure. Of all the modalities considered, only three had sufficient scientific support to warrant recommendation for inclusion in hypertension treatment programs. Each of these three modalities--weight control, alcohol restriction, and sodium restriction--was found to be capable not only of independently controlling blood pressure (particularly in patients with mild hypertension) but also of reducing the number and dosage of prescribed pharmacological agents, should their prescription be indicated. Weight reduction was found to reduce the risk from elevated arterial pressure as well as overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, because the rate of recidivism was exceedingly high in these studies, close and continuous patient follow-up is considered necessary. Excessive alcohol intake is associated in many studies with proportionally higher arterial pressures and an increased prevalence of hypertension. Therefore, the recommendation of moderation in alcohol consumption to less than 2 oz of ethanol daily for patients with hypertension is supported. Restriction of dietary sodium to less than 2 g/day was the only other nonpharmacological approach with sufficient support to be recommended as a treatment for hypertension. Although long-term studies are sorely lacking, sodium restriction has been shown to be manageable and safe and probably will benefit those hypertensive patients who are sodium-sensitive.",

        "title": "The Library-Community Convergence Framework for Community Action: Libraries as Catalysts of Social Change",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a library-community convergence framework (LCCF) to extend the role of all libraries to participate more fully in community action and enhance their function as proactive catalysts of social change, as compared to a sometimes perceived role of bystanders. Although the paper highlights deliberations about the involvement of public libraries in their local communities, and shares experiences of community interactions between library and information professionals and minority and underserved groups in American academic library settings, yet the proposed framework of convergence between the library-community and the methods/approaches of community action are applicable across a variety of library contexts. The paper discusses select application of the LCCF for community action in two qualitative research studies, with local immigrant communities and sexual minorities, that use methods pioneered in ethnographic outreach and participatory action research (PAR) respectively. The results of these studies show that the LCCF is applicable in the development of various forms of services in different library environments. Ethnographic methods in the first study provide understanding of cross-cultural issues and uncover how local immigrant classifications can be induced from an ethnographic perspective to generate library classifications and information services that are locally relevant and participant-empowering. PAR ideologies in the second study underlie implementation of library and information interventions and community action while partnering with local sexual minorities and their allies, to address specific and contextualized community facets in ways that may promote community-wide social changes. Points of intersection from the two studies help identify key elements in the LCCF framework that can extend the role of all kinds of libraries as leaders and cultural planners of progressive community-based action.",

        "abstract": "The need for progressive change in people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors is essential for a communitywide acceptance of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders, and questioning (LGBTQ) individuals. This article examines our role as library and information science (LIS) professionals working in an academic environment to promote equality of sexual minorities by taking community action and creating social awareness and acceptance on their behalf. Findings based on qualitative studies and action research conducted in the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK) help identify typical barriers and challenges faced by local LGBTQ individuals toward self-fulfillment and social and political empowerment. Research participants share their marginalizing experiences that paint a picture of slow acceptance reflected in the lukewarm campus and community climate of support toward LGBTQ individuals.

        "abstract": "In recent years the geographic state of Tennessee in the United States has acquired a national notoriety and shameful reputation as a toxic place on issues of sex and gender (Mehra 2011; Mehra and Braquet, in press; Mehra and Braquet, 2011; Mehra and Braquet, 2007a, 2007b; Mehra and Braquet, 2006), especially owing to the infamous \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill that thankfully died a second death when lawmakers failed to pass the measure banning elementary and middle-school teachers from discussing sexual activity that is not \u201crelated to natural human reproduction\u201d (Ford, 2013; McDonough, 2013; Staff Reports, 2013).

This paper highlights findings from an exploratory website study to identify key trends, best practices, and case representations across different types of library environments of LGBTQ information resources, collections, programs, and services.

This call to action explores and organizes the transdisciplinary literature about ADHD experiences into a guide that informs the social justice efforts of public libraries/librarians, who can serve as intermediaries between information stakeholders and the vast array of information resources about ADHD. These intermediaries can develop collections and services to support shared decision making among various ADHD stakeholders.
