        "title": "Pioglitazone and Risk for Bone Fracture: Safety Data From a Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "Context\nPioglitazone reduces cardiovascular risk in nondiabetic patients after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) but is associated with increased risk for bone fracture.\n\n\nObjective\nTo characterize fractures associated with pioglitazone by location, mechanism, severity, timing, and sex.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Patients\nPatients were 3876 nondiabetic participants in the Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke trial randomized to pioglitazone or placebo and followed for a median of 4.8 years. Fractures were identified through quarterly interviews.\n\n\nResults\nAt 5 years, the increment in fracture risk between pioglitazone and placebo groups was 4.9% [13.6% vs 8.8%; hazard ratio (HR), 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 1.89). In each group, \u223c80% of fractures were low energy (i.e., resulted from fall) and 45% were serious (i.e., required surgery or hospitalization). For serious fractures most likely to be related to pioglitazone (low energy, nonpathological), the risk increment was 1.6% (4.7% vs 3.1%; HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.09). Increased risk for any fracture was observed in men (9.4% vs 5.2%; HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.48) and women (14.9% vs 11.6%; HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.78; interaction P = 0.13).\n\n\nConclusions\nFractures affected 8.8% of placebo-treated patients within 5 years after an ischemic stroke or TIA. Pioglitazone increased the absolute fracture risk by 1.6% to 4.9% and the relative risk by 47% to 60%, depending on fracture classification. Our analysis suggests that treatments to improve bone health and prevent falls may help optimize the risk/benefit ratio for pioglitazone.",

        "title": "Practical strategies for improving outcomes in T2DM: The potential role of pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors",
        "abstract": "T2DM is a complex disease underlined by multiple pathogenic defects responsible for the development and progression of hyperglycaemia. Each of these factors can now be tackled in a more targeted manner thanks to glucose\u2010lowering drugs that have been made available in the past 2 to 3 decades. Recognition of the multiplicity of the mechanisms underlying hyperglycaemia calls for treatments that address more than 1 of these mechanisms, with more emphasis placed on the earlier use of combination therapies. Although chronic hyperglycaemia contributes to and amplifies cardiovascular risk, several trials have failed to show a marked effect from intensive glycaemic control. During the past 10 years, the effect of specific glucose\u2010lowering agents on cardiovascular risk has been explored with dedicated trials. Overall, the cardiovascular safety of the new glucose\u2010lowering agents has been proven with some of the trials summarized in this review, showing significant reduction of cardiovascular risk. Against this background, pioglitazone, in addition to exerting a sustained glucose\u2010lowering effect, also has ancillary metabolic actions of potential interest in addressing the cardiovascular risk of T2DM, such as preservation of beta\u2010cell mass and function. As such, it seems a logical agent to combine with other oral anti\u2010hyperglycaemic agents, including dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 inhibitors (DPP4i). DPP4i, which may also have a potential to preserve beta\u2010cell function, is available as a fixed\u2010dose combination with pioglitazone, and could, potentially, attenuate some of the side effects of pioglitazone, particularly if a lower dose of the thiazolidinedione is used. This review critically discusses the potential for early combination of pioglitazone and DPP4i.",

        "title": "Effects of Pioglitazone on Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide\u2013Mediated Insulin Secretion and Adipocyte Receptor Expression in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Incretin hormone dysregulation contributes to reduced insulin secretion and hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Resistance to glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) action may occur through desensitization or downregulation of \u03b2-cell GIP receptors (GIP-R). Studies in rodents and cell lines show GIP-R expression can be regulated through peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) response elements (PPREs). Whether this occurs in humans is unknown. To test this, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone therapy on GIP-mediated insulin secretion and adipocyte GIP-R expression in subjects with well-controlled T2DM. Insulin sensitivity improved, but the insulinotropic effect of infused GIP was unchanged following 12 weeks of pioglitazone treatment. In parallel, we observed increased GIP-R mRNA expression in subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes from subjects treated with pioglitazone. Treatment of cultured human adipocytes with troglitazone increased PPAR\u03b3 binding to GIP-R PPREs. These results show PPAR\u03b3 agonists regulate GIP-R expression through PPREs in human adipocytes, but suggest this mechanism is not important for regulation of the insulinotropic effect of GIP in subjects with T2DM. Because GIP has antilipolytic and lipogenic effects in adipocytes, the increased GIP-R expression may mediate accretion of fat in patients with T2DM treated with PPAR\u03b3 agonists.",

        "title": "Coordinated regulation of gene expression and microRNA changes in adipose tissue and circulating extracellular vesicles in response to pioglitazone treatment in humans with type 2 diabetes",
        "abstract": "Pioglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, is used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D). PPAR\u03b3 is highly expressed in adipose tissue (AT), however the effects of pioglitazone to improve insulin sensitivity are also evident in other tissues and PPAR\u03b3 agonism has been shown to alter cancer derived extracellular vesicle (EV)-miRNAs. We hypothesized that pioglitazone modifies the cargo of circulating AT-derived EVs to alter interorgan crosstalk in people with diabetes. We tested our hypothesis in a 3-month trial in which 24 subjects with T2D were randomized to treatment with either pioglitazone 45 mg/day or placebo (NCT00656864). Levels of 42 adipocyte-derived EV-miRNAs were measured in plasma EVs using low density TaqMan arrays. Levels of differentially expressed EV-miRNAs and their most relevant target genes were also measure in adipose tissue from the same participants, using individual TaqMan assays. Levels of 5 miRNAs (i.e., miR-7-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-195-5p, and miR-374b-5p) were significantly downregulated in EVs in response to pioglitazone treatment relative to placebo. The opposite occurred for miR-195-5p in subcutaneous AT. Changes in miRNA expression in EVs and AT correlated with changes in suppression of lipolysis and improved insulin sensitivity, among others. DICER was downregulated and exosomal miRNA sorting-related genes YBX1 and hnRNPA2B1 displayed a downregulation trend in AT. Furthermore, analysis of EV-miRNA targeted genes identified a network of transcripts that changed in a coordinated manner in AT. Collectively, our results suggest that some beneficial pharmacologic effects of pioglitazone are mediated by adipose-specific miRNA regulation and exosomal/EV trafficking.

        "abstract": "Adipose tissue plays an important role in systemic energy metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to severe metabolic disorders. Various cells in adipose tissue communicate with each other to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are recognized as novel medium for remote intercellular communication by transferring various bioactive molecules from parental cells to distant target cells. Increasing evidence suggests that the endocrine functions of adipose tissue and even the metabolic homeostasis are largely affected by different cell-derived EVs, such as insulin signaling, lipolysis, and metabolically triggered inflammation regulations. Here, we provide an overview focused on the role of EVs released by different cell types of adipose tissue in metabolic diseases and their possible molecular mechanisms and highlight the potential applications of EVs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Moreover, the current EVs-based therapeutic strategies have also been discussed. This trial is registered with NCT05475418.",

        "title": "Comparison of Adiposomal Lipids between Obese and Non-Obese Individuals",
        "abstract": "Our recent findings revealed that human adipose tissues (AT)-derived extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) vary in cargo among obese and lean individuals. The main objective of this study was to investigate the adiposomal lipid profiles and their correlation with cardiometabolic risk factors. AT samples were collected from obese subjects and lean controls and analyzed for their characteristics and lipid content. In addition, we measured the correlation between adiposomal lipid profiles and body composition, glucose and lipid metabolic profiles, brachial artery vasoreactivity, AT arteriolar flow-induced dilation, and circulating markers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, and nitric oxide (NO). Compared to lean controls, adiposomes isolated from obese subjects were higher in number after normalization to AT volume. The two major lipid classes differentially expressed were lysophosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylcholine (LPC/PC) and ceramides (Cer). All lipids in the LPC/PC class were several-fold lower in adiposomes from obese subjects compared to lean controls, on top of which were PC 18:2, PC 18:1, and PC 36:3. Most ceramides were markedly upregulated in the obese group, especially Cer d37:0, Cer d18:0, and Cer d39:0. Regression analyses revealed associations between adiposomal lipid profiles and several cardiometabolic risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, insulin resistance, arteriolar and brachial artery vasoreactivity, NO bioavailability, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C). We conclude that the ability of adiposomes from obese subjects to disrupt cardiometabolic function could be partly attributed to the dysregulated lipid cargo.",
