        "abstract": "Six primary care practices which utilize both physician and non-physician practitioner types were studied to measure differences between practitioner types in the care of patients. By chart review 1,369 patient-practitioner encounters were examined. Physicians identified less symptoms and signs in their patients and prescribed less non-drug therapies than did non-physicians. Likewise, at follow-up visits, physicians tended to document less follow-up of these types of problems and therapies than non-physicians. When examining the interaction between practitioners, the highest rates of follow-up of all types of problems and therapies were found when the same practitioner saw the patient at two successive visits to the same clinic. When a physician saw a patient following a previous visit to a nurse practitioner, there was a significant drop-off in the follow-up rate of problems and therapies. However, when a nurse practitioner saw the patient following a previous visit to a physician, the drop-off in follow-up rates was not as striking. These findings indicate that the skills of physician and nonphysician practitioners are potentially complementary. However, this potential is not fully exploited, particularly by physicians.",

When random sampling is not possible, providers should be selected using variables known to correlate with quality of care; (5) random assignment of patients to providers is strongly recommended, taking care to use clients new to both providers; (6) use of multiple data sources is recommended to decrease the current heavy reliance on audits; (7) conclusions should point out differential findings identifying those which favor physicians, those which favor nurse practi tioners, and those identifying no differences between providers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOne third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and in the developed countries immigration is a major force that sustains the incidence of tuberculosis. We studied the effects of immigration on the epidemiology of tuberculosis and its recent resurgence in the United States.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from the national tuberculosis reporting system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1986 reports of tuberculosis have included the patient's country of origin. Population estimates for foreign-born persons were derived from special samples from the 1980 and 1990 censuses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of persons reported to have tuberculosis who were foreign-born increased from 21.6 percent (4925 cases) in 1986 to 29.6 percent (7346 cases) in 1993. For the entire eight-year period, most foreign-born patients with tuberculosis were from Latin America (43.9 percent; 21,115 cases) and Southeast Asia (34.6 percent; 16,643 cases). Among foreign-born persons the incidence rate was almost quadruple the rate for native residents of the United States (30.6 vs. 8.1 per 100,000 person-years), and 55 percent of immigrants with tuberculosis had the condition diagnosed in their first five years in the United States.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImmigration has had an increasingly important effect on the epidemiology of tuberculosis in the United States. It will be difficult to eliminate tuberculosis without better efforts to prevent and control it among immigrants and greater efforts to control it in the countries from which they come.",

Among long-term residents, those who arrived in the United States after their fifth birthday had incidence rates of TB 2 to 6 times higher than those of similar age who arrived before their fifth birthday.

We sought to determine whether isoniazid prophylaxis administered during liver transplant candidacy was safe and effective for the prevention of posttransplantation tuberculosis. Methods. During a 9-year period, 18 liver transplant candidates with tuberculin skin test greater than 5 mm or recent conversion to positive tuberculin skin test were identified and received isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for 12 months. For each case, a control matched with the patient for underlying liver disease and age (within 5 years of the case) was included. Liver function tests were assessed monthly. The median follow-up was 55 months and ranged up to 107 months for the cases. Results. At baseline, the cases had a total bilirubin of 2.2 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase of 106 IU/L, prothrombin time of 14.2 sec, and serum albumin of 2.9 gm/dL (mean values). Hepatic function tests did not differ significantly for the cases at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months when compared with those at baseline or between the cases and controls at each of the above time points. Discontinuation of prophylaxis was not required in any of the patients.

        "abstract": "Objectives:To determine burden and risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) in an antiretroviral treatment (ART) programme and its impact on ART outcomes. Design:Prospective cohort study. Methods:Prevalent TB was assessed at baseline and incident TB was ascertained prospectively over 3 years among 944 patients accessing a community-based ART programme in South Africa. Results:At enrollment, median CD4 cell count was 96 cells/\u03bcl and 52% of patients had a previous history of TB. Prevalent TB (current antituberculosis treatment or active TB) was present in 25% and was strongly associated with advanced immunodeficiency. During 782 person-years of ART, 81 cases of TB were diagnosed. The incidence was 22.1/100 person-years during the first 3 months of ART and decreased to an average of 4.5/100 person-years during the second and third years. In multivariate analysis, risk of incident TB during follow-up was only associated with the current absolute CD4 cell count at that time point; an increase of 100 cells/\u03bcl was associated with a 25% lower risk (P = 0.007). Although prevalent and incident TB were associated with greater than two-fold increased mortality risk, they did not compromise immunological and virological outcomes among survivors at 48 weeks. Conclusions:Late initiation of ART was associated with a major burden of TB in this ART programme. TB reduced survival but did not impair immunovirological outcomes. Reductions in TB incidence during ART were dependent on CD4 cell count; however, after 3 years of treatment, rates were still 5- to 10-fold higher than among non-HIV-infected people.

Methods:Patients receiving treatment for TB at the time ART was initiated (n = 160) were studied. Cases of TB-associated IRD during the first 4 months of ART were ascertained. Results:The median baseline CD4 cell count was 68 cells/\u03bcl [interquartile range (IQR), 29\u2013133 cells/\u03bcl) and ART was initiated after a median of 105 days (IQR, 61\u2013164 days) from TB diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic disease in HIV-infected patients during the initial months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and presents a great challenge to ART programs in resource-limited settings. The mechanisms underlying development of TB in this period are complex. Some cases may represent progression of undiagnosed subclinical disease present before starting ART, emphasizing the importance of careful screening strategies for TB. It has been suggested that progression in such cases is due to immune reconstitution disease-a phenomenon in which dysregulated restoration of pathogen-specific immune responses triggers the presentation of subclinical disease. However, whereas some cases have exaggerated or overtly inflammatory manifestations consistent with existing case definitions for IRD, many others do not. Moreover, since ART-induced immune recovery is a time-dependent process, active TB may develop as a consequence of persisting immunodeficiency. All these mechanisms are likely to be important, representing a spectrum of complex interactions between mycobacterial burden and changing host immune response. We propose that the potential range of effects of ART includes (1) shortening of the time for subclinical TB to become symptomatic (a phenomenon often referred to as \"unmasking\"), (2) increased rapidity of initial onset of TB symptoms, and (3) heightened intensity of clinical manifestations. We suggest that the term \"ART-associated TB\" be used to refer collectively to all cases of TB presenting during ART and that \"immune reconstitution disease\" be used to refer to the subset of ART-associated TB cases in which the effect on disease severity results in exaggerated and overtly inflammatory disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) is indicated during tuberculosis treatment in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but the timing for the initiation of ART when tuberculosis is diagnosed in patients with various levels of immune compromise is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an open-label, randomized study comparing earlier ART (within 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment for tuberculosis) with later ART (between 8 and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment for tuberculosis) in HIV-1 infected patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 250 per cubic millimeter and suspected tuberculosis. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who survived and did not have a new (previously undiagnosed) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness at 48 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 809 patients with a median baseline CD4+ T-cell count of 77 per cubic millimeter and an HIV-1 RNA level of 5.43 log(10) copies per milliliter were enrolled. In the earlier-ART group, 12.9% of patients had a new AIDS-defining illness or died by 48 weeks, as compared with 16.1% in the later-ART group (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.8 to 8.1; P=0.45). Among patients with screening CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter, 15.5% of patients in the earlier-ART group versus 26.6% in the later-ART group had a new AIDS-defining illness or died (95% CI, 1.5 to 20.5; P=0.02). Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was more common with earlier ART than with later ART (11% vs. 5%, P=0.002). The rate of viral suppression at 48 weeks was 74% and did not differ between the groups (P=0.38).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall, earlier ART did not reduce the rate of new AIDS-defining illness and death, as compared with later ART. In persons with CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter, earlier ART was associated with a lower rate of new AIDS-defining illnesses and death.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nNew trial data and drug regimens that have become available in the last 2 years warrant an update to guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults in resource-rich settings.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo provide current recommendations for the treatment of adult HIV infection with ART and use of laboratory-monitoring tools. Guidelines include when to start therapy and with what drugs, monitoring for response and toxic effects, special considerations in therapy, and managing antiretroviral failure.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA EXTRACTION\nData that had been published or presented in abstract form at scientific conferences in the past 2 years were systematically searched and reviewed by an International Antiviral Society-USA panel. The panel reviewed available evidence and formed recommendations by full panel consensus.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nTreatment is recommended for all adults with HIV infection; the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence increase with decreasing CD4 cell count and the presence of certain concurrent conditions. Recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz), a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (raltegravir). Alternatives in each class are recommended for patients with or at risk of certain concurrent conditions. CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA level should be monitored, as should engagement in care, ART adherence, HIV drug resistance, and quality-of-care indicators. Reasons for regimen switching include virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure and drug toxicity or intolerance. Confirmed treatment failure should be addressed promptly and multiple factors considered.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNew recommendations for HIV patient care include offering ART to all patients regardless of CD4 cell count, changes in therapeutic options, and modifications in the timing and choice of ART in the setting of opportunistic illnesses such as cryptococcal disease and tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDolutegravir (S/GSK1349572), a once-daily, unboosted integrase inhibitor, was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Dolutegravir, in combination with abacavir-lamivudine, may provide a simplified regimen.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study involving adult participants who had not received previous therapy for HIV-1 infection and who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 1000 copies per milliliter or more. Participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir at a dose of 50 mg plus abacavir-lamivudine once daily (DTG-ABC-3TC group) or combination therapy with efavirenz-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)-emtricitabine once daily (EFV-TDF-FTC group). The primary end point was the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48. Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression, the change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count, safety, and viral resistance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug. At week 48, the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter was significantly higher in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group (88% vs. 81%, P=0.003), thus meeting the criterion for superiority. The DTG-ABC-3TC group had a shorter median time to viral suppression than did the EFV-TDF-FTC group (28 vs. 84 days, P<0.001), as well as greater increases in CD4+ T-cell count (267 vs. 208 per cubic millimeter, P<0.001). The proportion of participants who discontinued therapy owing to adverse events was lower in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group (2% vs. 10%); rash and neuropsychiatric events (including abnormal dreams, anxiety, dizziness, and somnolence) were significantly more common in the EFV-TDF-FTC group, whereas insomnia was reported more frequently in the DTG-ABC-3TC group. No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine.

Though considered to be a well tolerated drug, we aimed to determine the actual rate, timing and detailed motivation of stopping DGV in a real-life clinical setting. Design:A cohort study including all patients who started DGV in two HIV treatment centers in The Netherlands. Methods:All cART-na\u00efve and cART-experienced patients who had started DGV were identified from the institutional HIV databases. Clinical data, including motivation and timing of discontinuation of DGV, were extracted from the patient files. Factors that potentially influenced discontinuation of DGV were compared between patients who stopped or continued DGV by multivariate and Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses. Results:In total, 556 patients were included, of whom 102 (18.4%) were cART-na\u00efve at initiation of DGV. Median follow-up time was 225 days. Overall, in 85 patients (15.3%), DGV was stopped. In 76 patients (13.7%), this was due to intolerability. Insomnia and sleep disturbance (5.6%), gastrointestinal complaints (4.3%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, psychosis and depression (4.3%) were the predominant reasons for switching DGV. In regimens that included abacavir, DGV was switched more frequently (adjusted relative risk 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.09\u20133.38, P log-rank 0.01). No virologic failures were observed. Conclusion:A relatively high rate of preliminary discontinuation of DGV due to intolerability was detected in our patient population. In particular, DGV was stopped more frequently if the regimen included abacavir. Multiple factors may explain these unexpected postmarketing observations, which warrant further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Aging HIV-infected antiretroviral-treatment (ART)-controlled patients often present cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. Thus, it is mandatory that life-long used ART has no cardiometabolic toxicity. Protease inhibitors have been associated with cardiometabolic risk, integrase-strand-transfer-inhibitors (INSTI) with weight gain and the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc with improved vascular function. We have previously reported that the INSTI dolutegravir and maraviroc improved, and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir(atazanavir/r) worsened, inflammation and senescence in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC)s from adult controls. Here, we analyzed the pathways involved in the drugs\u2019 effects on inflammation, senescence and also insulin resistance. Methods We analyzed the involvement of the anti-inflammatory SIRT-1 pathway in HCAECs. Then, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the effect of dolutegravir, maraviroc and atazanavir/r and used siRNA-silencing to address ubiquitin-specific-peptidase-18 (USP18) involvement into ART effects. Results Dolutegravir reduced inflammation by decreasing NF\u03baB activation and IL-6/IL-8/sICAM-1/sVCAM-1 secretion, as did maraviroc with a milder effect. However, when SIRT-1 was inhibited by splitomicin, the drugs anti-inflammatory effects were maintained, indicating that they were SIRT-1-independant. From the transcriptomic analysis we selected USP18, previously shown to decrease inflammation and insulin-resistance. USP18-silencing enhanced basal inflammation and senescence. Maraviroc still inhibited NF\u03baB activation, cytokine/adhesion molecules secretion and senescence but the effects of dolutegravir and atazanavir/r were lost, suggesting that they involved USP18. Otherwise, in HCAECs, dolutegravir improved and atazanavir/r worsened insulin resistance while maraviroc had no effect. In USP18-silenced cells, basal insulin resistance was increased, but dolutegravir and atazanavir/r kept their effect on insulin sensitivity, indicating that USP18 was dispensable. Conclusion USP18 reduced basal inflammation, senescence and insulin resistance in coronary endothelial cells. Dolutegravir and atazanavir/r, but not maraviroc, exerted opposite effects on inflammation and senescence that involved USP18. Otherwise, dolutegravir improved and atazanavir/r worsened insulin resistance independently of USP18. Thus, in endothelial cells, dolutegravir and atazanavir/r oppositely affected pathways leading to inflammation, senescence and insulin resistance.",

Methods: We performed lipoaspiration of paired SCAT samples, histology on fresh/fixed samples and examined the transcriptomic profile analyzed using Illumina microarrays after RNA extraction. Statistical analyses used the Wilcoxon-paired test. Results: The patients (n\u200a=\u200a8) were mainly male (7/8), aged (mean\u200a\u00b1\u200astandard error of the mean) 54.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.2\u200ayears, BMI 26.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.2\u200akg/m2, CD4+ 699\u200a\u00b1\u200a56\u200acells/mm3, all viral load (VL) <50\u200acopies/ml. After a follow-up of 6\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.5\u200amonths, all PLWH remained with VL <50\u200acopies/ml. BMI, trunk and limb fat amounts were unchanged yet systemic insulin resistance increased. Adipose tissue histology was unchanged except for borderline increased adipocyte diameter (P\u200a=\u200a0.1). Among the 16\u200a094 RNA transcripts, 458 genes were up-regulated and 244 were down-regulated. Analyses of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology databases, evaluating modifications in the main functional pathways, revealed that genes related to immune recognition/function were less expressed as were genes encoding T-cell receptor and receptor signaling pathways. The gene expression profiles indicated decreased inflammation but genes involved in adipogenesis and insulin resistance were overexpressed. Conclusion: After 6\u200amonths of raltegravir/maraviroc, adipogenesis-related gene profile was enhanced in SCAT, in agreement with a tendency for increased adipocyte size. Enhanced SCAT insulin resistance-related profile was concordant with higher systemic insulin resistance. However, the immune activation/inflammation profile was globally lowered. We propose that raltegravir/maraviroc might favor SCAT gain but reduce inflammation/immune activation.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on HIV-infected patients undergoing bariatric surgery, focusing on adipose tissue and liver histology. Although it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it does investigate the effects of a different ART regimen (integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based) on adipose tissue, which is partially dependent on the understanding of ART's effects on adipose tissue established in the source paper."
