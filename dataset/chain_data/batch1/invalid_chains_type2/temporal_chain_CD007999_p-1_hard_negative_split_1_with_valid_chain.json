        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIt has been suggested that profound acid inhibition along with endoscopic therapy might prevent rebleeding and reduce mortality in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. The aim of the study was to test the possible equivalence of a high dose and the regular dose of omeprazole in peptic ulcer bleeding.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a prospective randomized double-blind study involving 142 patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding (Forrest classification I-II: spurting or oozing bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, clot and black base). One-hundred-and-two (71.8%) patients received endoscopic treatment (adrenaline injection and/or heater probe) in pre-entry. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the regular dose of omeprazole intravenously (20 mg once a day for 3 days, i.e. 60 mg/72 h) or a high dose of omeprazole (80 mg bolus + 8 mg/h for 3 days, i.e. 652 mg/72 h). Rebleeding, surgery and death were the outcome measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix (8.2%) of the 73 patients receiving the regular dose of omeprazole and 8 (11.6%) of the 69 patients receiving the high dose of omeprazole rebled (P = 0.002 for equivalence, equivalence limit 0.15). Three (4.1%) of the former patients and 5 (7.2%) of the latter group underwent surgery. Four (5.5%) patients in the regular-dose and 2 (2.9%) in the high-dose group died within 30 days.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUnder the defined tolerance limits, the regular dose of omeprazole is as successful as a high dose in preventing peptic ulcer rebleeding.",

        "title": "Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: guidelines",
        "abstract": "Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is the commonest emergency managed by gastroenterologists. It has an incidence ranging from approximately 50 to 150 per 100 000 of the population each year, the incidence being highest in areas of the lowest socioeconomic status. An audit of patients admitted to hospital in the UK published in 1995 reported 11% mortality in patients admitted to hospital because of bleeding and 33% mortality in those who developed gastrointestinal bleeding while hospitalised for other reasons.1 Most deaths occur in elderly patients who have significant comorbidity and the majority are inevitable, despite improvements in medical and surgical expertise. Mortality is reported to be lower in specialist units2,3 and this is probably not related to technical developments but because of adherence to protocols and guidelines. Thus guidelines do have the potential to improve prognosis and in addition may be of value in making the best use of resources by fast tracking low risk patients, thereby optimising duration of hospital stay.\n\n\u201cMedline\u201d and \u201cEMBASE\u201d were searched to identify the evidence used in formulating these guidelines. The term \u201cgastrointestinal hemorrhage\u201d was used to identify general reviews, leading articles, meta-analyses, and randomised clinical trials. Not all of the recommendations have been subjected to clinical trial but represent what, in the view of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) endoscopy committee, defines best clinical practice. Guidelines cannot replace clinical judgment in the management of any specific patient. Best management depends on close cooperation between medical and surgical gastroenterologists and \u201ccombined care\u201d is essential in managing the critically ill bleeding patient.\n\nThe specific management of acute variceal haemorrhage is a special subject and is not considered in detail.\n\n### 1.1 Grading of recommendations\n\n#### Grade A\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Grade B\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Grade C",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:From the Canadian Registry of patients with Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding and Endoscopy (RUGBE), we determined clinical outcomes and explored the roles of endoscopic and pharmacologic therapies in a contemporary real-life setting.METHODS:Analysis of randomly selected patients endoscoped for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding at 18 community and tertiary care institutions between 1999 and 2002. Covariates and outcomes were defined a priori and 30-day follow-up obtained. Logistic regression models identified predictors of outcomes.RESULTS:One thousand eight-hundred and sixty-nine patients were included (66 \u00b1 17 yr, 38% female, 2.5 \u00b1 1.6 comorbid conditions, hemoglobin, 96 \u00b1 27 g/L, 54% received a mean of 2.9 \u00b1 1.7 units of blood). Endoscopy was performed within 24 h in 76%, with ulcers (55%) most commonly noted. High-risk endoscopic stigmata and endoscopic therapy were reported in 37%. Rebleeding, surgery, and mortality rates were 14.1%, 6.5%, and 5.4%, respectively. Decreased rebleeding was significantly and independently associated with PPI use (85% of patients, mean daily dose 56 \u00b1 53 mg) in all patients regardless of endoscopic stigmata, (odds ratio (OR):0.53, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI:0.37\u20130.77) and endoscopic hemostasis in patients with high-risk stigmata (OR:0.39, 95% CI:0.25\u20130.61). PPI use (OR:0.18, 95% CI:0.04\u20130.80) and endoscopic therapy (OR:0.31, 95% CI:0.11\u20130.91) were also each independently associated with decreased mortality in patients with high-risk stigmata.CONCLUSIONS:These results appear to confirm the protective role of endoscopic therapy in patients with high-risk stigmata, and suggest that acute use of PPIs may be associated with a reduction of rebleeding in all patients, and lower mortality in patients with high-risk stigmata. Independent prospective validation of these observational findings is now required.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To compare the inhibitory effect of a novel proton pump inhibitor (PPI), tenatoprazole 40 mg once daily, with esomeprazole 40 mg once daily on intragastric acidity.METHODS:A randomized, investigator-blind, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 30 healthy Helicobacter pylori negative male volunteers. Tenatoprazole 40 mg or esomeprazole 40 mg was administered once daily for 7 consecutive days with a 4-wk washout period between treatments. Ambulatory 24-h intragastric pH was recorded at baseline, after 7 days' treatment, and 3 and 5 days after treatment was stopped.RESULTS:At presumed steady-state (day 7), median 24-h pH values were 5.02 and 4.79 for tenatoprazole and esomeprazole, respectively. There was a significant difference between tenatoprazole and esomeprazole during the nocturnal period when mean pH was 4.64 \u00b1 0.67 versus 3.61 \u00b1 0.90, respectively (p < 0.0001), as well as a significantly higher mean percentage of time with pH >4 on tenatoprazole (72.5 \u00b1 14.9 vs 62.2 \u00b1 13.6, p < 0.0001). The effect of tenatoprazole was still present 5 days after treatment withdrawal especially during the night-time. The mean area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve and elimination half-time was significantly higher in the tenatoprazole group as compared with the esomeprazole group.CONCLUSION:Tenatoprazole 40 mg daily provides a prolonged duration of acid suppression and a shorter nocturnal acid breakthrough in healthy volunteers, even after stopping the drug. Thus, tenatoprazole may provide greater clinical efficacy for patients in whom a once daily PPI is ineffective. Further studies are indicated.",

        "abstract": "We studied spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux (GER)-induced esophageal distension using ultrasound imaging and its role in the genesis of esophageal symptoms before and during esomeprazole therapy. Ten controls and 10 GER disease (GERD) patients were studied by combined impedance, esophageal pH, manometry, and ultrasonography before and during esomeprazole therapy. Physiological data and symptoms were recorded for 2 h following a standardized meal. From ultrasound images, the esophageal cross-sectional area (CSA) at the peak of GER-induced distension was determined and compared between controls vs. patients, symptomatic vs. asymptomatic GER episodes, and before vs. during esomeprazole in GERD patients. The mean lumen CSA is greater in the patients than controls (271 +/- 71 mm(2) vs. 163 +/- 56 mm(2), P = 0.001) but not different among asymptomatic reflux episodes, and those associated with regurgitation (290 +/- 110 mm(2)) or heartburn (271 +/- 67 mm(2)). Eight chest pain episodes associated with reflux revealed a tendency toward larger mean esophageal distension (459 +/- 40 mm(2)) compared with asymptomatic reflux (268 +/- 70 mm(2), P = 0.058). Following esomeprazole treatment, most GER episodes were nonacidic and asymptomatic except in two patients in whom cyclical reflux was associated with large esophageal distensions. Esomeprazole did not alter the lumen CSA during GER. Esophageal distension is greater in the GERD subjects compared with controls; however, it is unlikely that the GER-induced distension of the esophagus plays a significant role in the genesis of heartburn sensation. Esomeprazole therapy does not alter the GER-induced distension of the esophagus.",

        "abstract": "The rate and extent of drug dissolution and absorption from solid oral dosage forms is highly dependent upon the volumes and distribution of gastric and small intestinal water. However, little is known about the time courses and distribution of water volumes in vivo in an undisturbed gut. Previous imaging studies offered a snapshot of water distribution in fasted humans and showed that water in the small intestine is distributed in small pockets. This study aimed to quantify the volume and number of water pockets in the upper gut of fasted healthy humans following ingestion of a glass of water (240 mL, as recommended for bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies), using recently validated noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Twelve healthy volunteers underwent upper and lower abdominal MRI scans before drinking 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. After ingesting the water, they were scanned at intervals for 2 h. The drink volume, inclusion criteria, and fasting conditions matched the international standards for BA/BE testing in healthy volunteers. The images were processed for gastric and intestinal total water volumes and for the number and volume of separate intestinal water pockets larger than 0.5 mL. The fasted stomach contained 35 \u00b1 7 mL (mean \u00b1 SEM) of resting water. Upon drinking, the gastric fluid rose to 242 \u00b1 9 mL. The gastric water volume declined rapidly after that with a half emptying time (T50%) of 13 \u00b1 1 min. The mean gastric volume returned back to baseline 45 min after the drink. The fasted small bowel contained a total volume of 43 \u00b1 14 mL of resting water. Twelve minutes after ingestion of water, small bowel water content rose to a maximum value of 94 \u00b1 24 mL contained within 15 \u00b1 2 pockets of 6 \u00b1 2 mL each. At 45 min, when the glass of water had emptied completely from the stomach, total intestinal water volume was 77 \u00b1 15 mL distributed into 16 \u00b1 3 pockets of 5 \u00b1 1 mL each. MRI provided unprecedented insights into the time course, number, volume, and location of water pockets in the stomach and small intestine under conditions that represent standard BA/BE studies using validated techniques. These data add to our current understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and will help improve physiological relevance of in vitro testing methods and in silico transport analyses for prediction of bioperformance of oral solid dosage forms, particularly for low solubility Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 2 and Class 4 compounds.",

        "title": "pH-Dependent Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of Highly Supersaturated Solutions of Weakly Basic Drugs.",
        "abstract": "Supersaturated solutions of poorly aqueous soluble drugs can be formed both in vivo and in vitro. For example, increases in pH during gastrointestinal transit can decrease the aqueous solubility of weakly basic drugs resulting in supersaturation, in particular when exiting the acidic stomach environment. Recently, it has been observed that highly supersaturated solutions of drugs with low aqueous solubility can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) prior to crystallization, forming a turbid solution such that the concentration of the drug in the continuous solution phase corresponds to the amorphous solubility while the colloidal phase is composed of a disordered drug-rich phase. Although it is well established that the equilibrium solubility of crystalline weakly basic drugs follows the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship, the impact of pH on the LLPS phenomenon or the amorphous solubility has not been explored. In this work, the LLPS concentration of three weakly basic compounds-clotrimazole, nicardipine, and atazanavir-was determined as a function of pH using three different methods and was compared to the predicted amorphous solubility, which was calculated from the pH-dependent crystalline solubility and by estimating the free energy difference between the amorphous and crystalline forms. It was observed that, similar to crystalline solubility, the experimental amorphous solubility at any pH follows the Henderson-Hasselbalch relation and can be predicted if the amorphous solubility of the free base is known. Excellent agreement between the LLPS concentration and the predicted amorphous solubility was observed. Dissolution studies of amorphous drugs showed that the solution concentration can reach the corresponding LLPS concentration at that pH. Solid-state analysis of the precipitated material confirmed the amorphous nature. This work provides insight into the pH-dependent precipitation behavior of poorly water-soluble compounds and provides a fundamental basis with which to understand the performance of supersaturating dosage forms.",

        "title": "Exploiting the Phenomenon of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation for Enhanced and Sustained Membrane Transport of a Poorly Water-Soluble Drug.",
        "abstract": "Recent studies on aqueous supersaturated lipophilic drug solutions prepared by methods including antisolvent addition, pH swing, or dissolution of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) have demonstrated that when crystallization is slow, these systems undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) when the concentration of the drug in the medium exceeds its amorphous solubility. Following LLPS, a metastable equilibrium is formed where the concentration of drug in the continuous phase corresponds to the amorphous solubility while the dispersed phase is composed of a nanosized drug-rich phase. It has been reasoned that the drug-rich phase may act as a reservoir, enabling the rate of passive transport of the drug across a membrane to be maintained at the maximum value for an extended period of time. Herein, using clotrimazole as a model drug, and a flow-through diffusion cell, the reservoir effect is demonstrated. Supersaturated clotrimazole solutions at concentrations below the amorphous solubility show a linear relationship between the maximum flux and the initial concentration. Once the concentration exceeds the amorphous solubility, the maximum flux achieved reaches a plateau. However, the duration for which the high flux persists was found to be highly dependent on the number of drug-rich nanodroplets present in the donor compartment. Macroscopic amorphous particles of clotrimazole did not lead to the same reservoir effect observed with the nanodroplets formed through the process of LLPS. A first-principles mathematical model was developed which was able to fit the experimental receiver concentration-time profiles for concentration regimes both below and above amorphous solubility, providing support for the contention that the nanodroplet phase does not directly diffuse across the membrane but, instead, rapidly replenishes the drug in the aqueous phase that has been removed by transport across the membrane. This study provides important insight into the properties of supersaturated solutions and how these might in turn impact oral absorption through effects on passive membrane transport rates.",

        "title": "Impact of Drug-Rich Colloids of Itraconazole and HPMCAS on Membrane Flux in Vitro and Oral Bioavailability in Rats.",
        "abstract": "Improving the oral absorption of compounds with low aqueous solubility is a common challenge that often requires an enabling technology. Frequently, oral absorption can be improved by formulating the compound as an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). Upon dissolution, an ASD can reach a higher concentration of unbound drug than the crystalline form, and often generates a large number of sub-micrometer, rapidly dissolving drug-rich colloids. These drug-rich colloids have the potential to decrease the diffusional resistance across the unstirred water layer of the intestinal tract (UWL) by acting as rapidly diffusing shuttles for unbound drug. In a prior study utilizing a membrane flux assay, we demonstrated that, for itraconazole, increasing the concentration of drug-rich colloids increased membrane flux in vitro. In this study, we evaluate spray-dried amorphous solid dispersions (SDDs) of itraconazole with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) to study the impact of varying concentrations of drug-rich colloids on the oral absorption of itraconazole in rats, and to quantify their impact on in vitro flux as a function of bile salt concentration. When Sporanox and itraconazole/AFFINISOL High Productivity HPMCAS SDDs were dosed in rats, the maximum absorption rate for each formulation rank-ordered with membrane flux in vitro. The relative maximum absorption rate in vivo correlated well with the in vitro flux measured in 2% SIF (26.8 mM bile acid concentration), a representative bile acid concentration for rats. In vitro it was found that as the bile salt concentration increases, the importance of colloids for improving UWL permeability is diminished. We demonstrate that drug-containing micelles and colloids both contribute to aqueous boundary layer diffusion in proportion to their diffusion coefficient and drug loading. These data suggest that, for compounds with very low aqueous solubility and high epithelial permeability, designing amorphous formulations that produce colloids on dissolution may be a viable approach to improve oral bioavailability.",

        "abstract": "Because spray-dried dispersion (SDD) performance depends on polymer selection and drug load, time- and resource-sparing methods to screen drug/polymer combinations before spray drying are desirable. The primary objective was to assess the utility of films to anticipate the effects of drug load and polymer grade on dissolution performance of tablets containing SDDs of itraconazole (ITZ). A secondary objective was to characterize the solid-state attributes of films and SDDs to explain drug load and polymer effects on dissolution performance. SDDs employed three different grades of hypromellose acetate succinate (i.e., either HPMCAS-L, HPMCAS-M, or HPMCAS-H). Solid-state characterization employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Results indicate that films correctly anticipated the effects of drug load and polymer on dissolution performance. The best dissolution profiles were observed under the following conditions: 20% drug loading performed better than 30% for both films and SDDs, and the polymer grade rank order was HPMCAS-L > HPMCAS-M > HPMCAS-H for both films and SDDs. No dissolution was detected from films or SDDs containing HPMCAS-H. Solid-state characterization revealed percent crystallinity and phase miscibility as contributing factors to dissolution, but were not the sole factors. Amorphous content in films varied with drug load (10%\u2009>\u200920%\u2009>\u200930%) and polymer grades (HPMCAS-L > HPMCAS-M > HPMCAS-H), in agreement with dissolution. In conclusion, films anticipated the rank-order effects of drug load and polymer grade on dissolution performance from SDDs of ITZ, in part through percent crystallinity and phase miscibility influences.",

        "abstract": "An amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) is a commonly used approach to enhancing the dissolution of poorly aqueous soluble drugs. Selecting the desired polymer and drug loading can be time-consuming. Surface properties, such as surface composition and wetting behavior, are essential factors controlling the dissolution of ASD tablets. Thus, our study aims to use surface characterization to understand the factors that affect the dissolution rate of ASD tablets. In this work, we prepared ASDs with itraconazole and hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) using spray drying. ASDs were prepared using three grades of HPMCAS and different drug loading levels (10%, 30%, and 50%). We prepared ASD tablets with two porosities. For each tablet, contact angles were measured using the Drop Shape Analyzer; surface free energies, disperse, and polar fractions were calculated based on the contact angles. We conducted near-infrared (NIR) and dissolution measurements of ASD tablets. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to investigate the NIR spectra further. The relative PCA scores were reported with other sample properties. A partial least square (PLS) model using NIR scores, tablets\u2019 wetting properties, and dissolution rates revealed that water and buffer contact angles, surface free energy, and polar fraction are the most significant factors attributing to the dissolution rate of ASD tablets. This work understood the interplay between the surface properties and the dissolution rate of ASD tablets. Moreover, surface characterization can be the tool to screen the formulation and compaction process of ASD tablets in early development.",

PAA showed maximum interaction and wetting property hence, was selected for further studies. Solid state characterization studies confirmed the formation of ASD with PAA. Saturation solubility, dissolution profile, and in vivo pharmacokinetic data of the ASD formulation were generated in rats against its marketed tablet Rilutor. The RLZ:PAA ASD showed exponential enhancement in the dissolution of RLZ. Predicted and observed pharmacokinetic data in rats showed enhanced area under curve (AUC) and Cmax in plasma and brain with respect to Rilutor. Furthermore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of rats for Rilutor and RLZ ASD was developed and then extrapolated to humans where physiological parameters were changed along with a biochemical parameter. The partition coefficient was kept similar in both species. The model was used to predict different exposure scenarios, and the simulated data was compared with observed data points. The PBPK model simulated Cmax and AUC was within two times the experimental data for plasma and brain. The Cmax and AUC in the brain increased with ASD compared to Rilutor for humans showing its potential in improving its biopharmaceutical performance and hence enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The model can predict the RLZ concentration in multiple compartments including plasma and liver.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper, as it also investigates the properties of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) for enhancing the dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs. The source paper's focus on surface characterization as a tool for identifying factors affecting the dissolution rate of ASD tablets is built upon in this paper, which explores the use of a PBPK model to simulate the pharmacokinetic profile of an ASD formulation."
