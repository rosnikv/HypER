        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nCollagenous colitis (CC) is a well-described entity causing chronic diarrhea and characteristic histologic findings. Several treatment options have been suggested, but no controlled data are available. We conducted a placebo-controlled trial to show the clinical and histologic effects of budesonide in CC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 14) or budesonide 9 mg daily (n = 14) for 8 weeks. Patients were evaluated clinically, and blinded biopsy specimens were analyzed from fixed locations at weeks 0 and 8. Clinical response was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in the disease activity score (number of bowel movements in the last 7 days). At week 8, nonresponders received open-label budesonide for the next 8-week period; responders discontinued treatment and were followed up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree patients discontinued the study prematurely. Intention-to-treat analysis showed clinical response in 8 of 14 patients in the budesonide group compared with 3 of 14 responders for placebo (P = 0.05) after 8 weeks of blinded therapy, together with improved stool consistency. Histologically, there was no change in the mean thickness of the collagen band but a significant decrease of the lamina propria infiltrate in the budesonide group (P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is efficacious in inducing short-term clinical response in CC with significant reduction of the histologic infiltrate in the lamina propria.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMicroscopic colitis is a disease of unknown aetiology characterized by chronic watery diarrhoea and diarrhoea can be eliminated by budesonide but frequently recurs when budesonide is stopped. We studied whether prednisolone could induce remission in patients with disabling, chronic diarrhoea due to microscopic colitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA double-blind, randomized (3:1) trial of oral prednisolone 50 mg daily or placebo for 2 weeks. Remission was defined as stool weight < or = 200 g/day or frequency < or = 2/day; effect was defined as > 50% reduction of either stool frequency or weight. Six centres screened 31 consecutive patients and included 11 with collagenous colitis and 1 with lymphocytic colitis. Median duration of diarrhoea was 9 months. Patients had a normal colonoscopy, and no evidence of coeliac disease, bile acid or lactose malabsorption. Patients with gastrointestinal infection, previous gastrointestinal surgery, abnormal biochemical screening or recent treatment with immunosuppressive agents were excluded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStool weight (grams) declined in 7 of 9 patients given prednisolone and in 1 of 3 receiving placebo; changes in median weight were from 430 to 278 and from 825 to 489, respectively. Stool frequency (per day) declined from 6 to 3 and from 8 to 5.

        "abstract": "Background Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA\u20105 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB\u201012 (AB\u2010Cap\u201010) in patients with CC. Materials and Methods Patients with CC and diarrhea were in a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled study randomized (2:1) to AB\u2010Cap\u201010 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550%. Secondary end points were changes in bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal bloating and pain. Results Twenty\u2010nine patients were randomized: 21 to probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550% occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18\u201384) to 23 (range 11\u201356; P < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days (range 0\u20137 days) to 1 day (range 0\u20137 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group. Conclusions AB\u2010Cap\u201010 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease course of CC.",

        "abstract": "Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "To explore the proteins regulated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in gastric cancer, the expression plasmid of COX-2siRNA was constructed and transfected into gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. Then, two-dimensional electrophoresis and the PDQuest software analysis were applied to discover the differentially expressed proteins. The differential protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Fourteen differentially expressed proteins between the two cell lines were identified. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] (15-PGDH), a key enzyme in prostaglandin degradation, was identified as an upregulated protein in SGC7901 cells transfected with the COX-2siRNA plasmid. To further explore whether the 15-PGDH is regulated by COX-2, western blotting and immunocytochemical assay were performed to detect the expression of 15-PGDH in different cell lines with different expression level of COX-2. The results showed that the expression of 15-PGDH was upregulated (128.57%) as COX-2 was suppressed by small interfering RNA and downregulated (51.72%) as COX-2 was enhanced by COX-2 cDNA transfection in gastric cancer cells. In tissue specimens with gastric cancer, there was a decreased expression of 15-PGDH and an increased expression of COX-2 simultaneously. A significantly negative correlation of 15-PGDH expression was found to COX-2 level, tumor differentiation, tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) staging and lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer. All the results suggest that 15-PGDH is downregulated by COX-2 in human gastric cancer and may contribute to the carcinogenesis and development of human gastric cancer in combination with COX-2.",

We determined the correlations between pattern of expression of 15\u2010hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15\u2010PGDH), a catabolic enzyme for biological inactivation of PGE2, in gastric adenocarcinoma and various clinicopathological factors and patient outcome in an attempt to elucidate its biological significance. In 35 of 71 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma, expression of 15\u2010PGDH protein was reduced in tumor tissues. Multivariate analysis revealed reduction of 15\u2010PGDH expression to be an independent predictor of poor survival. The proportion of Ki67\u2010positive cells in 15\u2010PGDH\u2010negative adenocarcinoma was higher than that in 15\u2010PGDH\u2010positive adenocarcinoma.

        "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 plays an important role in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity. The level of biologically active prostaglandin E2 in the tissue is regulated by the balanced expression of its synthetic enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase, and its catabolic enzyme, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. We examined the effect of rebamipide, a mucoprotective drug, on prostaglandin E2 production and metabolism in the gastric tissue and its effect on indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury in mice. Rebamipide suppressed indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury. Suppressive effect of rebamipide on indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury was also observed in cyclooxygenase-2-knockout mice. The mice that were treated with rebamipide showed a 2-fold increase in cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression in the gastric tissue, whereas 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase mRNA expression markedly decreased as compared to vehicle-treated control mice. Rebamipide did not affect the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 in the gastric tissue. Rebamipide did not increase prostaglandin E2 production in the gastric tissue; however, it induced a 1.4-fold increase in the concentration of prostaglandin E2 in the gastric tissue as compared to vehicle-treated control mice. These results suggest that the suppressive effect of rebamipide on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-induced gastric mucosal injury can be attributed to reduced 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase expression, which increases the prostaglandin E2 concentration in the gastric tissue.",

The outcome measurement was complete ulcer healing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of six studies involving 724 patients were included. The pooled data suggested a significantly higher rate of ulcer healing after endoscopic therapy among patients treated with PPIs plus rebamipide than among those treated with PPIs alone [odds ratio (OR)=2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.68-3.44]. The subgroup analysis showed PPI plus rebamipide therapy to be more effective in healing ESD-induced ulcers than treatment with PPIs alone after both four (OR=2.22, 95%CI: 1.53-3.24) and eight weeks of treatment (OR=3.19, 95%CI: 1.22-8.31). In addition, the combination therapy was found to be significantly more effective than the use of PPIs alone for all ESD ulcers greater than 20 mm in size (OR=4.77, 95%CI: 2.22-10.26). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups with regard to ulcer location (low, middle or upper stomach) or the presence of absence of H. pylori infection. No serious adverse events were observed in either group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this meta-analysis suggest that treatment with PPIs plus rebamipide is superior to PPI monotherapy for healing ESD-induced ulcers over four weeks, particularly large ulcers.

We conducted a direct and indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the best choice in preventing post-ESD bleeding among proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and the most widely used potassium-competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan. Methods: The Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for randomized trials. We pooled odds ratios (OR) for preventing post-ESD bleeding using meta-analysis. Results: Sixteen randomized trials met the inclusion criteria including 2,062 patients. Direct comparisons showed slightly significant efficacy in PPIs rather than H2RAs in preventing post-ESD bleeding [OR: 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 3.05] and vonoprazan was better than PPIs (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.86).

The use of dedicated ESD knives with size adequate to the location/thickness of the gastrointestinal wall is recommended. It is suggested that isotonic saline or viscous solutions can be used for submucosal injection. ESGE recommends traction methods in esophageal and colorectal ESD and in selected gastric lesions. After gastric ESD, coagulation of visible vessels is recommended, and post-procedural high dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (or vonoprazan). ESGE recommends against routine closure of the ESD defect, except in duodenal ESD. ESGE recommends corticosteroids after resection of \u200a>\u200a50\u200a% of the esophageal circumference. The use of carbon dioxide when performing ESD is recommended. ESGE recommends against the performance of second-look endoscopy after ESD. ESGE recommends endoscopy/colonoscopy in the case of significant bleeding (hemodynamic instability, drop in hemoglobin >\u200a2\u200ag/dL, severe ongoing bleeding) to perform endoscopic hemostasis with thermal methods or clipping; hemostatic powders represent rescue therapies.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nEndoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a widely used technique to remove early neoplastic lesions. It was primarily used in the initial days to treat gastric lesions, but recently, the horizon of this endoscopic procedure has expanded, that has allowed us to manage other technically more complex locations, such as the colorectum.\n\n\nAREAS COVERED\nThere has been an exponential growth regarding the wide range of devices available in the market for performing colorectal ESD. As a result, the aim of the review is to highlight the indication of this endoscopic technique, which device is best suited for which indication, as well as future trajectories in this field.\n\n\nEXPERT OPINION\nAlthough some devices have proven to be more advantageous than others in this area, very often the choice is still subjective, which is commonly attributed to individual preferences and experience. However, an accurate knowledge of the available tools and their functioning, with their pros and cons, is fundamental for any endoscopist venturing into the field of third space endoscopy. In this way, one can choose which device best suits a particular situation, along with simultaneously having the wealth of knowledge related to therapeutic armamentarium at our disposal in the endoscopy suite.",
