        "abstract": "This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter trial compared efficacy and safety of tramadol HCL 37.5 mg/paracetamol 325 mg combination tablet with tramadol HCL 50 mg capsule in the treatment of postoperative pain following ambulatory hand surgery with iv regional anesthesia. Patients received trial medication at admission, immediately after surgery, and every 6 hours after discharge until midnight of the first postoperative day. Analgesic efficacy was assessed by patients (n = 128 in each group, full analysis set) and recorded in a diary on the evening of surgery day and of the first postoperative day. They also documented the occurrence of adverse events. By the end of the first postoperative day, the proportion of treatment responders based on treatment satisfaction (primary efficacy variable) was comparable between the groups (78.1% combination, 71.9% tramadol; P = 0.24) and mean pain intensity (rated on a numerical scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) had been reduced to 1.7 \u00b1 2.0 for both groups. Under both treatments, twice as many patients experienced no pain (score = 0) on the first postoperative day compared to the day of surgery (35.9% vs 16.4% for tramadol/paracetamol and 36.7% vs 18% for tramadol treatment). Rescue medication leading to withdrawal (diclofenac 50 mg) was required by 17.2% patients with tramadol/paracetamol and 13.3% with tramadol. Adverse events (mainly nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, and increased sweating) occurred less frequently in patients under combination treatment (P = 0.004). Tramadol/paracetamol combination tablets provided comparable analgesic efficacy with a better safety profile to tramadol capsules in patients experiencing postoperative pain following ambulatory hand surgery.",

        "title": "Efficacy and safety profile of combination of tramadol-diclofenac versus tramadol-paracetamol in patients with acute musculoskeletal conditions, postoperative pain, and acute flare of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: a Phase III, 5-day open-label study",
        "abstract": "Objective We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of tramadol and diclofenac versus a standard approved FDC of tramadol and paracetamol, in patients with acute moderate to severe pain. Methods A total of 204 patients with moderate to severe pain due to acute musculoskeletal conditions (n=52), acute flare of osteoarthritis (n=52), acute flare of rheumatoid arthritis (n=50), or postoperative pain (n=50) were enrolled in the study at baseline. Each disease category was then randomized to receive either of two treatments for 5 days: group A received an FDC of immediate-release tramadol hydrochloride (50 mg) and sustained-release diclofenac sodium (75 mg) (one tablet, twice daily), and group B received an FDC of tramadol hydrochloride (37.5 mg) and paracetamol (325 mg) (two tablets every 4\u20136 hours, up to a maximum of eight tablets daily). The primary efficacy end points were reductions in pain intensity from baseline at day 3 and day 5 as assessed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score. Results Group A showed a significant reduction in the VAS score for overall pain from baseline on day 3 (P=0.001) and day 5 (P<0.0001) as compared with group B. The combination of tramadol-diclofenac resulted in few mild to moderate adverse events (nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and gastritis), which required minimal management, without any treatment discontinuation. The number of adverse events in group A was nine (8.82%) compared with 22 (21.78%) in group B, after 5 days of treatment. Conclusion An FDC of tramadol-diclofenac showed a significantly greater reduction in pain intensity and was well tolerated compared with tramadol-paracetamol, resulting in better analgesia in patients suffering from moderate to severe pain due to acute musculoskeletal conditions, postoperative pain following orthopedic surgery, or acute flare of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "title": "Practice of Pain Management by Indian Healthcare Practitioners: Results of a Paper Based Questionnaire Survey",
        "abstract": "Objective. Understanding factors while selecting an analgesic and its usage pattern by Indian healthcare practitioners (HCPs). Methods. Questionnaire-based survey was conducted among six healthcare specialties. Results. Total 448 HCPs participated. Patient's age (72.8%, 74.4%, 87.5%, and 78.9%) and duration of therapy (70.8%, 66.2%, 69.6%, and 73.6%) were main attributes for selecting an opioid according to general practitioners (GPs), dentists, consulting physicians (CPs), and surgeons, respectively. Patient's age was important factor while selecting NSAID according to 77.60%, 66.91%, and 84.20% of GPs, dentists, surgeons, respectively. For mild pain, paracetamol was the choice according to 77%, 78.57% and 74% of GPs, CPs, and surgeons, respectively. For moderate pain, 77%, 87.50%, 68%, and 80.30% of GPs, CPs, surgeons and orthopedicians, respectively, preferred the use of paracetamol + tramadol combination. For moderate pain, NSAID + paracetamol and paracetamol+diclofenac were used by 68.94% and 47.73% of orthopedicians, respectively. Lack of pain clinic (38.8%) in city was commonly cited reason for not referring patients to pain clinics. Conclusion. Patient's age, duration of therapy, comorbid conditions, frequency of dosing, and severity of pain are important parameters while selecting analgesics. Paracetamol and its combinations are commonly used for mild and moderate pain, respectively. Pain clinics currently have limited presence in India.",

        "title": "Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India",
        "abstract": "Despite enormous progress in the field of pain management over the recent years, pain continues to be a highly prevalent medical condition worldwide. In the developing countries, pain is often an undertreated and neglected aspect of treatment. Awareness issues and several misconceptions associated with the use of analgesics, fear of adverse events \u2013 particularly with opioids and surgical methods of analgesia \u2013 are major factors contributing to suboptimal treatment of pain. Untreated pain, as a consequence, is associated with disability, loss of income, unemployment and considerable mortality; besides contributing majorly to the economic burden on the society and the health care system in general. Available guidelines suggest that a strategic treatment approach may be helpful for physicians in managing pain in real-world settings. The aim of this manuscript is to propose treatment recommendations for the management of different types of pain, based on the available evidence. Evidence search was performed by using MEDLINE (by PubMed) and Cochrane databases. The types of articles included in this review were based on randomized control studies, case\u2013control or cohort studies, prospective and retrospective studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based consensus recommendations. Articles were reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel and recommendations were developed. A stepwise treatment algorithm-based approach based on a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the underlying disease, associated comorbidities and type/duration of pain is proposed to assist general practitioners, physicians and pain specialists in clinical decision making.",

        "title": "A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey of Medical Practitioners in India to Assess their Knowledge, Attitude, Prescription Practices, and Barriers toward Opioid Analgesic Prescriptions",
        "abstract": "Context: Inadequate training of medical practitioners is a key factor responsible for inappropriate use of opioid analgesics. Aims: We assessed the current knowledge, attitude, prescribing practices, and barriers perceived by the Indian medical practitioners in three tertiary care hospitals toward the use of opioid analgesics. Subjects and Methods: Web-based survey of registered medical practitioner employed at three chosen tertiary health care institutions in New Delhi. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive analysis of survey responses was carried out. Comparative analysis was done using Chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: The response rate was 10.4% (n = 308). Two-thirds of the participants (61.7%) had never received formal pain management training, and 86.7% participants would like further training. Most participants (71.1%) agreed that opioids should be prescribed in cancer pain, while 26.3% agreed that opioids should be prescribed in noncancer pain. Half of the participants agreed that SOS (if necessary) dosing schedule (48.4%), low dosage (61.7%), and short duration of use (51.4%) could decrease the harmful effect of opioids. Lack of information about opioid-related policies and addiction potential were identified as the most common barriers to prescribing opioids. Those seeing more patients with chronic noncancer pain come across opioid misuse and diversion more often (P = 0.02). Those who understood addiction were more likely to agree that patients of chronic cancer pain with substance use disorders should be prescribed opioid analgesics (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Indian medical practitioners felt the need for formal pain management training. There is a lack of consensus on how to manage the pain using opioid analgesics. Tough regulations on medical and scientific use of opioids are the most commonly reported barrier to prescribing them.",

        "abstract": "The\u201cNon-pharmacological treatment of pain\u201d section of the Frontiers in Pain Research was initiated to reflect the growing appreciation for the role that complementary interventions play in the therapeutic armamentarium for pain management. There are two factors driving this new emphasis. First, there is an increasing number of well-designed clinical trials showing that non-pharmacological modalities have a significant and often enduring efficacy in the management of the pain state with minimal adverse events, whether employed alone or in combination with pharmacological interventions. The real or potential benefits arising from interventions involving mind-body therapeutic modalities take on particular importance in light of the world-wide opiate crisis, which has highlighted the need to develop and understand the mechanisms of novel analgesic treatments. Second, we are beginning to understand the biological mechanisms of nonpharmacological pain treatments, with the development of sophisticated behavioral methodologies, non-invasive imaging techniques, multiple physiological endpoints, and the rigorous adherence to scientific method in both human and pre-clinical studies. Nevertheless, there are many challenges to our obtaining a complete understanding of the efficacy and mechanisms of the myriad nonpharmacological pain treatment modalities.",

This study investigated nurses\u2019 perceptions regarding their own and patients\u2019 pain experiences by examining relationships between pain cautiousness and stoicism, cultural sensitivity, and personal pain attitudes. Methodology: A correlational methodology examined nursing staff in a Midwestern private hospital. The sample included 102 primarily female (95.1%), Caucasian (97%), and married (66%) nursing staff. Measures included the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale, Pain Attitudes Questionnaire to Assess Stoicism and Cautiousness, and the Pain Management: Nurses\u2019 Knowledge and Attitude Survey. Results: Cultural sensitivity was a significant predictor of pain knowledge and attitudes total score (R2 = .081, \u03b2 = .244, p = .040), while pain stoicism and pain cautiousness were not predictive. Discussion: Findings highlight the importance of nurses being aware of personal attitudes, beliefs, and cultural sensitivity in pain management. Results also demonstrate a gap between the knowledge and utilization of nonpharmacologic pain management interventions among nursing staff.",

        "abstract": ": Aim: Cultural diversity in communities has increased upon the increase in globalization. It is possible for health professionals to provide effective care to individuals from different cultures by developing intercultural sensitivity. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between nurses' cultural sensitivity levels and care behaviors. Methods: Two hundred and ten nurses working in a public hospital in the Central Anatolia Region in Turkey were included in the study. The data were collected via the Personal Information Form, the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale and the Caring Behaviors Inventory-24. Results: According to the results of the study, it was determined that the intercultural sensitivity mean score was 87\u00b17.55 and the mean score of caring behaviors was 5.24\u00b10.53. There was a positive correlation between the intercultural sensitivity and caring behaviors of the nurses. It was observed that the intercultural sensitivity level of the nurses increased, thus leading to a positive effect on their caring behaviors. Conclusion: It is seen that the increase in the intercultural sensitivity levels of the nurses is positively related to the patient care behaviors. It is important for nurses to have intercultural sensitivity in the professional development of the profession. In order for nurses to provide quality care, it can be recommended to create trainings based on cultural models and skills",
