        "title": "Natural interferon-alpha versus its combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone in the therapy of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia: a long-term, randomized, controlled study.",
        "abstract": "Type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is an often progressive vasculitis characterized by circulating cold-precipitable proteins that usually consists of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM kappa with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity. Its etiology is unknown, although recent evidence strongly suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a major role. Plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, and cytotoxic drugs have been used in the therapy of MC patients. Recently, favorable results with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN alpha) have been reported. To further assess its effectiveness, we studied the effects of natural human interferon-alpha (nIFN alpha), alone and in combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone (PDN), in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with symptomatic MC. Sixty-five patients were enrolled onto the trial, 52 (80%) of whom presented serum anti-HCV antibodies and specific genomic RNA sequences. Fifteen patients received nIFN alpha (3 MU) intramuscularly (IM) three times weekly, whereas 17 patients also received 16 mg/d of PDN orally on non-IFN days. Moreover, 18 patients received 16 mg/d of PDN only, and 15 were untreated. Treatment was discontinued after 1 year and patients were monitored for 8 to 17 months (mean, 13). A complete response was achieved in eight of 15 patients (53.3%) treated with nIFN alpha and nine of 17 (52.9%) treated with nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with three of 18 patients (16.7%) who received PDN only (P < .05) and one of 15 (6.7%) untreated controls (P < .01). Partial response occurred in two of 15 (13.3%) patients treated with nIFN alpha, three of 17 (17.6%) who received nIFN alpha plus PDN, one of 18 (5.5%) who received PDN only, and one of 15 (6.7%) controls. A complete response in six patients (66.7%) was achieved within 3 months in the group that received nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with two patients (25%) of those who received nIFN alpha alone (P < .02). In anti-HCV-positive patients, the clinical response occurred in step with reduced or undetectable levels of HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. Quantification of circulating HCV RNA represented a good predictive response marker. The probability of relapse within 3 months after treatment was 100% (three of three patients) and 75% (six of eight patients), respectively, in patients who received PDN alone or nIFN alpha alone as compared with none of those who received nIFN alpha plus PDN (P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Immunochemical and biomolecular studies of circulating immune complexes isolated from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis C virus infection",
        "abstract": "Circulating immune complexes (ICs) were isolated by affinity chromatography and sucrose density gradient fractionation during acute and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Immunochemical and biomolecular studies showed that they basically consist of the virus component, IgG with specific anti\u2010HCV activity and IgM bearing 17.109 epitope (IgM 17.109), an antigenic determinant common to rheumatoid factors (RFs) with WA cross\u2010idiotype (XId). An antigen\u2010specific IC assay was used to demonstrate IgG anti\u2010HCV/IgM 17.109 ICs (IgG\u2010IgM ICs) in five out of the five patients with acute and in 8 out of the 10 patients with chronic hepatitis C who mounted an IgG anti\u2010HCV immune response. They were not detected in patients with no IgG anti\u2010HCV response. IgG\u2013IgM ICs appeared in step with IgG anti\u2010HCV seroconversion and remained detectable for a long period irrespective of clinical outcome, in that they were demonstrated over a 4\u2010year follow\u2010up of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Their presence was unrelated to the severity and progression of liver histology. Despite similar serum levels of IgM 17.109 XId, antigen\u2010specific IgG\u2010IgM ICs were not found in acute and chronic hepatitis B or in acute hepatitis A. Thus, these ICs appear to be uniquely associated with HCV infection, supporting the view that IgM 17.109 XId derive from an antigen\u2010driven response strictly related to the involved antigen. Even although they have no apparent effects on the progression of HCV\u2010related liver disease, their presence may help to explain the immunological abnormalities and extrahepatic disorders observed in HCV infection.",

        "title": "Hepatitis C virus infection, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: an emerging picture.",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA agent which expresses its genetic informations in the form of a single, large polyprotein encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) that extends through most of its genomic RNA. Proteolytic cleavage of the ORF product is essential for the virogenesis and the production of viral progeny. HCV is responsible for chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral persistence is considered the greatest problem in the management of HCV infection. It may result from several mechanisms, two of which are established. In the first, the high rate of genetic variations during viral replication results in the production of mutants capable of escaping the immune attack. In the second, the virus infects cells of the immune system itself, which represent a privileged site that cannot be reached by virus-specific T cell response. Involvement of lymphoid cells in the early stages of HCV infection may provide insight into the pathobiologic patterns of extrahepatic dissemination (lymph nodes, major salivary glands, kidneys, blood vessels). Dissemination of HCV-infected lymphoid cells throughout the organism is likely to maintain a mobile and extensive reservoir of the virus. In this respect, extrahepatic sites may act as a source of continuous reinfection of hepatocytes. Studies of intrahepatic B lymphocytes indicate that they are infected with HCV, clonally expanded and activated to secrete IgM molecules with rheumatoid factor activity. This strongly suggests that HCV directly stimulates B cell expansion, which may result in an indolent stage of lymphoproliferation (i.e., mixed cryoglobulinemia) or in frank B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The frequency of NHL, however, is much lower than that of HCV infection, suggesting that HCV alone is not able to induce tumors and that cellular events, in addition to the presence of virus and virus-encoded products, are necessary in order to obtain a malignant B cell phenotype. The demonstration of HCV productive infection in bone marrow-recruited and circulating pluripotent hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells indicates that HCV replication occurs in the early differentiation stages of hematopoietic progenitors. These are stable cell populations and are likely to represent the initial site of infection and a continuous source of virus production.",

        "title": "Sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin antigen receptor of hepatitis C virus-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas suggests that the malignant cells are derived from the rheumatoid factor-producing cells that occur mainly in type II cryoglobulinemia.",
        "abstract": "Analysis of the immunoglobulin receptor (IGR) variable heavy- and light-chain sequences on 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) (9 patients also had type II mixed cryoglobulinemia [MC] syndrome and 8 had NHL unrelated to MC) and analysis of intraclonal diversity on 8 of them suggest that such malignant lymphoproliferations derive from an antigen-driven pathologic process, with a selective pressure for the maintenance of a functional IgR and a negative pressure for additional amino acid mutations in the framework regions (FRs). For almost all NHLs, both heavy- and light-chain complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) showed the highest similarity to antibodies with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity that have been found in the MC syndrome, thus suggesting that a common antigenic stimulus is involved in MC syndrome and in HCV-associated lymphomagenesis. Moreover, because HCV is the recognized pathologic agent of MC and the CDR3 amino acid sequences of some HCV-associated NHLs also present a high homology for antibody specific for the E2 protein of HCV, it may be reasonable to speculate that HCV E2 protein is one of the chronic antigenic stimuli involved in the lymphomagenetic process. Finally, the use of specific segments, in particular the D segment, in assembling the IgH chain of IgR seems to confer B-cell disorders with the property to produce antibody with RF activity, which may contribute to the manifestation of an overt MC syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic data have shown a close association between chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In many countries of the developed world, HCV infection accounts for more than half of the cases of HCC. HCC usually arises after 2-4 decades of infection, typically in the context of an underlying cirrhosis. Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-alfa can lead to sustained clearance of HCV, and small prospective studies as well as larger retrospective analyses suggest that interferon therapy leads to a decrease in the incidence of HCC. Without a reliable tissue culture system or a small animal model of HCV infection, analysis of the mechanisms by which HCV leads to cancer has been difficult. Nevertheless, both in vitro expression systems and in vivo transgenic mice studies suggest that HCV has an inherent carcinogenic potential. Understanding the pathogenesis of HCV-associated HCC is important in developing effective means of prevention and treatment of this highly malignant form of cancer.",

There was no inflammation in transgenic and nontransgenic livers. Compared with mice in 3 other groups, transgenic mice fed the excess-iron diet showed marked hepatic steatosis including the centrilobular microvesicular type, ultrastructural alterations of the mitochondria and decreased degradation activity of fatty acid at 6 months, and greater hepatic content of lipid peroxidation products and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine at 12 months after initiation of feeding.

This review highlights recent achievements that have clarified defective molecular pathways and shed new lights on the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors in determining disease phenotype. This advancement paves the way for development of new strategies to diagnose and cure metabolic liver diseases. Recent findings Hepcidin, the iron hormone that is defective in hemochromatosis, is controlled not only by iron signals but also by a number of circulatory and membrane-associated regulators. Serum and urinary hepcidin can be now measured. New studies have provided important information on variable clinical expressivity of the genetic defect in hemochromatosis. The molecular and cellular events that accompany Wilson's disease and \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficiency are being elucidated. In both, an unexpected pathogenic link with early metabolic abnormality in lipid or glycogen metabolism has emerged. Interference with apoptotic pathways may offer new therapeutic tools to prevent liver disease progression and acute liver failure associated with inherited metabolic diseases of the liver.

The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of FHC with risk of BTC in the Biliary Tract Cancers Pooling Project (BiTCaPP). Methods: We used Cox proportional hazards regressions models to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals for associations between FHC (any, first-degree, in female relative, in male relative, relative with gastrointestinal cancer, and relative with hormonally related cancer) and BTC risk by anatomic site within the biliary tract, adjusting for sex and race/ethnicity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted that restricted to studies reporting cholecystectomy data and to people without a history of cholecystectomy. Results: Data on FHC were available from 12 prospective studies within BiTCaPP, which collectively contributed 2,246 cases (729 gallbladder, 345 intrahepatic and 615 extrahepatic bile duct, and 385 ampulla of Vater cancers) with 21,706,107 person-years of follow-up. A marginal, inverse association between FHC and gallbladder cancer was driven to the null when analysis was restricted to studies reporting cholecystectomy data and to people without a history of cholecystectomy. FHC was not associated with risk of BTC at the other anatomic sites. Conclusions: These findings do not support an association between FHC and BTCs.

        "abstract": "Biliary tract cancers are rare but highly fatal with poorly understood etiology. Identifying potentially modifiable risk factors for these cancers is essential for prevention. Here we estimated the relationship between adiposity and cancer across the biliary tract, including cancers of the gallbladder (GBC), intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDC), extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBDC), and the ampulla of Vater (AVC). We pooled data from 27 prospective cohorts with over 2.7 million adults. Adiposity was measured using baseline body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sex, education, race, smoking, and alcohol consumption with age as the time metric and the baseline hazard stratified by study. During 37,883,648 person-years of follow-up, 1,343 GBC cases, 1,194 EHBDC cases, 784 IHBDC cases, and 623 AVC cases occurred. For each 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index there were risk increases for GBC (HR: 1.27 [95% CI: 1.19, 1.36]), IHBDC (HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.21, 1.45]), and EHBDC (HR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.23]), but not AVC (HR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.88, 1.11]). Increasing waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio were associated with GBC and IHBDC but not EHBDC or AVC. These results indicate that adult adiposity is associated with an increased risk of biliary tract cancer, particularly GBC and IHBDC.

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Despite implementing numerous changes in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for gallbladder cancer (GBC), the ability to accurately prognosticate survival in these patients has not been vigorously evaluated. The purpose of our study was to compare the prognostic ability of AJCC 7th and 8th edition, investigate the effect of AJCC 8th edition nodal status on the survival, and identify risk factors associated with the survival after N reclassification in GBC patients. We used the largest cancer database in the United States and determined that the updated AJCC 8th edition GBC staging system was comparable to the 7th edition, with no major improvements in survival discrimination. The recently implemented changes in N classification do not appear to improve the prognostic performance of the AJCC cancer staging system with regard to survival in GBC patients. Abstract The scope of our study was to compare the predictive ability of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th and 8th edition in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) patients, investigate the effect of AJCC 8th nodal status on the survival, and identify risk factors associated with the survival after N reclassification using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) in the period 2005\u20132015. The cohort consisted of 7743 patients diagnosed with GBC; 202 patients met the criteria for reclassification and were denoted as stage \u2265III by AJCC 7th and 8th edition criteria. Overall survival concordance indices were similar for patients when classified by AJCC 8th (OS c-index: 0.665) versus AJCC 7th edition (OS c-index: 0.663). Relative mortality was higher within strata of T1, T2, and T3 patients with N2 compared with N1 stage (T1 HR: 2.258, p < 0.001; T2 HR: 1.607, p < 0.001; \u03a43 HR: 1.306, p < 0.001). The risk of death was higher in T1\u2013T3 patients with Nx compared with N1 stage (T1 HR: 1.281, p = 0.043, T2 HR: 2.221, p < 0.001, T3 HR: 2.194, p < 0.001). In patients with AJCC 8th edition stage \u2265IIIB GBC and an available grade, univariate analysis showed that higher stage, Charlson\u2013Deyo score \u2265 2, higher tumor grade, and unknown nodal status were associated with an increased risk of death, while year of diagnosis after 2013, academic center, chemotherapy. and radiation therapy were associated with decreased risk of death. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy were associated with decreased risk of death in patients with T3\u2013T4 and T2\u2013T4 GBC, respectively. In conclusion, the updated AJCC 8th GBC staging system was comparable to the 7th edition, with the recently implemented changes in N classification assessment failing to improve the prognostic performance of the staging system. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the T2 stage subclassification as well as to clarify the association, if any is actually present, between advanced N staging and increased risk of death in patients of the same T stage.",

        "title": "A Novel Clinically Prognostic Stratification Based on Prognostic Nutritional Index Status and Histological Grade in Patients With Gallbladder Cancer After Radical Surgery",
        "abstract": "Purpose Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, with a 5-year survival rate of 5%. The prognostic models to predict the prognosis of patients with GBC remain controversial. Therefore, to construct a prognosis prediction of GBC, a retrospective cohort study was carried out to investigate the prognostic nutritional index and histological grade in the long-term outcome of patients with GBC after radical surgery (RS). Methods A retrospective study of a total of 198 patients with GBC who underwent surgical treatment were enrolled. The hematological indicators, imageological data, and perioperative clinical data were acquired for statistical analysis and poor prognosis model construction. Results Prognostic nutrition index (PNI) < 45.88, maximum tumor diameter (MTD) > 2.24 cm, and jaundice (JD) were all associated with a poor prognosis in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The prognosis prediction model was based on the three risk factors, which indicated a superior predictive ability in the primary cohort [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.951] and validation cohort (AUC = 0.888). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, poorly differentiation (PD) was associated with poor 3-year survival. In addition, Kaplan\u2013Meier (KM) survival analysis suggested that GBC patients with high-risk scores and PD had a better prognosis after RS (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in prognosis for patients with non-poorly differentiation (NPD) or low-risk scores after RS (p > 0.05). Conclusion Our prediction model for GBC patients with prognosis evaluation is accurate and effective. For patients with PD and high-risk scores, RS is highly recommended; a simple cholecystectomy can also be considered for acceptance for patients with NPD or low-risk score. The significant findings provide a new therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of GBC.",

        "title": "Can neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, prognostic nutrition index, and albumin be used to predict cholecystectomy morbidity in super-elderly patients?",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and serum albumin level in predicting cholecystectomy morbidity in elderly patients (85 years and older) who underwent cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. METHODS: This retrospective study included super-elderly patients who underwent cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis at a tertiary health centre between January 2010 and January 2021. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of postoperative complications (morbidity). The differences between the two groups were evaluated. In addition, the role of NLR, PLR, PNI, and serum albumin level in predicting cholecystectomy morbidity for acute cholecystitis in super-elderly patients was assessed via ROC analysis. RESULTS: Of 30 patients who met the study criteria, 22 (73.3%) were female, and the mean age of all patients was 87.43\u00b12.66 years (range 85\u201394 years). 7 (23.3%) patients had at least one comorbid disease during the preoperative period. The mean value of NLR, PLR, albumin, and PNI were 8.31, 153.76, 3.45, and 48.37, respectively. The morbidity rate of the study was 23.3%. The area under the curve (AUC) for NLR was 0.466 ([95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.259\u20130.672]; P=0.787), and the AUC for PLR was 0.429 ([95% CI: 0.201\u20130.656]; P=0.573). These two factors were not suitable for predicting morbidity. The AUC for PNI was 0.780 ([95% CI: 0.568\u20130.991]; P=0.027), and the AUC for albumin was 0.894 ([95% CI: 0.770\u20131.000]; P=0.002). At the cut-off value of 3.05 g/dL, the sensitivity and specificity of albumin were 91.3% and 71.4%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of PNI at the 41.70 cut-off value were 82.6% and 71.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study found that PNI and albumin can be used as predictive factors with high sensitivity and specificity for predicting cholecystectomy morbidity for acute cholecystitis in super-elderly patients. However, NLR and PLR had no significance in predicting cholecystectomy morbidity.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is quite a safe procedure, as only about 2% of cases result in clinically significant postoperative complications. The occurrence of conversion and postoperative complications is associated with prolonged hospitalization and higher perioperative mortality. Some parameters assessed in preoperative laboratory tests are used to predict the risk of conversion and clinically significant postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelets-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values in predicting the risk of conversion and complications in laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed due to symptomatic cholelithiasis. Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis of patients operated on for symptomatic cholelithiasis was performed. The Results of preoperative laboratory tests were assessed \u2013 NLR, MLR and PLR. Their impact on early outcomes of surgical treatment was analyzed in the study population. Results The analysis concerned 227 patients operated on for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The study group included 61 (26.9%) men and 166 (73.1%) women. As the NLR, MLR and PLR values increase, the length of hospitalization increases (rS 0.226, 0.247 and 0.181, respectively), as well as the risk of converting the procedure to an open method (p<0.05). Moreover, with increasing NLR and MLR values, the grade of postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo scale increases (p 0.0001 and 0.008, respectively). The grade of postoperative complications does not depend on the PLR value. Conclusion The risk of conversion can be assessed based on preoperative NLR, MLR and PLR values in patients undergoing surgery for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Elevated preoperative NLR and MLR values are associated with a higher grade of postoperative complications in the Clavien-Dindo scale.",
