        "title": "Topical NSAIDs for musculoskeletal conditions. A review of the literature.",
        "abstract": "In recent years a growing number of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have become available. This has been prompted in large part by the high incidence of serious gastrointestinal adverse events associated with the use of systemic NSAIDs, and the premise that minimisation of plasma concentrations of active drug may result in fewer systemic adverse effects. Evidence in humans and animals with topical NSAIDs demonstrates lower plasma concentrations than with systemically administered drugs, while those in soft tissues are still of a magnitude considered consistent with exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. In joints, however, the evidence is less strong, and there is still dispute whether in this case the drug reaches the joint predominantly via the transcutaneous or systemic route. There has been a sufficient number of studies of soft tissue conditions to demonstrate the superiority of topical NSAIDs over placebo and to suggest equivalent efficacy in comparison with some oral NSAIDs. For arthropathies, however, the literature is more sparse. Although several studies claim a benefit for topical NSAIDs against placebo, the results are less conclusive and further study is required. Trials of topical agents against intra-articular corticosteroids and rubefacients are either lacking or inconclusive. The adverse event profile of topical agents is reasonable: minor cutaneous effects occur in up to 2% of patients but tend to be self-limiting. Gastrointestinal events appear from the existing literature to be infrequent and minor, although long term studies are required. Bronchospasm and renal impairment have been reported and may be more frequent in patients who have experienced these effects with oral agents. The initial costs of topical agents tend to be higher than those of oral agents but a cost-effectiveness analysis suggests an overall benefit: this issue requires further clarification.",

        "title": "Oral versus topical NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases: a comparison.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and are responsible for approximately one-quarter of all adverse drug reaction reports. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for patients with rheumatic disease--a population at increased risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Topical administration of NSAIDs offers the advantage of local, enhanced drug delivery to affected tissues with a reduced incidence of systemic adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease and GI haemorrhage. NSAIDs administered topically penetrate slowly and in small quantities into the systemic circulation; bioavailability and maximal plasma NSAID concentration after topical application are generally less than 5 and 15%, respectively, compared with equivalent oral administration. Product formulation may have a dramatic impact, not only on absorption rates but also on penetration depth. Compared with oral administration, topical application leads to relatively high NSAID concentrations in the dermis. Concentrations achieved in the muscle tissue below the site of application are variable, but are at least equivalent to that obtained with oral administration. NSAIDs applied topically do reach the synovial fluid, but the extent and mechanism (topical penetration versus distribution via the systemic circulation) remain to be determined. In addition, marked interindividual variability was noted in all studies; percutaneous absorption may be strongly influenced by individual skin properties. In general, interpretation of clinical studies measuring efficacy of topical NSAIDs in rheumatic disease states is difficult because of a remarkably high placebo response rate, use of rescue paracetamol (acetaminophen), and significant variability in percutaneous absorption and response rates between patients. Overall efficacy rates attributable to topical NSAIDs in patients with rheumatic disorders ranged from 18 to 92% of treated patients. Topically applied NSAIDs have a superior safety profile to oral formulations. Adverse effects secondary to topical NSAID application occur in approximately 10 to 15% of patients and are primarily cutaneous in nature (rash and pruritus at site of application). GI adverse drug reactions are rare with topically applied NSAIDs, compared with a 15% incidence reported for oral NSAIDs. Available clinical studies suggest, but do not document, equivalent efficacy of topical over oral NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases.",

        "title": "Synthesis and properties of a naproxen polymeric prodrug",
        "abstract": "A water\u2010soluble polymeric prodrug containing a naproxen moiety was synthesized. The carboxylic groups of naproxen were condensed with the hydroxyl groups of 2\u2010hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to produce a drug\u2010linked monomer, denoted HN. The polymeric prodrug was prepared by copolymerization of HN with methacrylic acid. The molar percentage of HN in the polymeric prodrug was 26 mol%, as determined by 1H NMR. To investigate the pertinence of this polymeric prodrug, the hydrolysis was studied in\u2010vitro with or without esterase or lipase. The kinetics of enzymatic catalysis was calculated from a Lineweaver\u2010Burk plot. The anti\u2010inflammatory activity was evaluated using the carrageenan\u2010induced oedema test. The polymeric prodrug released a major fraction of the free naproxen and a significant fraction of the hydroxyethyl ester derived\u2010naproxen. The maximum hydrolysis rate Vmax, and the Michaelis constant Km were calculated to be 2.16 times 10\u22125 equiv. mol L\u22121 min\u22121 and 5.11 times 10\u22122 equiv. mol L\u22121. The maximum anti\u2010inflammatory inhibition of free naproxen appeared at 2 h and quickly decreased thereafter. In contrast, the polymeric prodrug showed a maximum at around 2\u223c3 h and then slowly decreased. This indicates that the polymeric prodrug displays greater potency than free naproxen in the inhibition of acute inflammatory processes over long periods.",

        "abstract": "A new type of multifunctional polymeric micelle drug carrier for active intracellular drug delivery was prepared and characterized in this study. The micelle is a nano-supramolecular assembly with a spherical core-shell structure, and its surface and core were modified with piloting molecules for cancer cells and pH-sensitive drug binding linkers for controlled drug release, respectively. In order to prepare such micelles, self-assembling amphiphilic block copolymers, folate-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(aspartate hydrazone adriamycin) [Fol-PEG-P(Asp-Hyd-ADR)], were specially designed and synthesized by installing a molecular promoter to enhance intracellular transport, folate (Fol), at the end of the shell-forming PEG chain and conjugating the anticancer drug, adriamycin (ADR), to the side chain of the core-forming PAsp segment through an acid-sensitive hydrazone bond. Because folate-binding proteins (FBP) are selectively overexpressed on the cancer cell membranes, the folate-bound micelles (FMA) can be guided to the cancer cells in the body, and after the micelles enter the cells, hydrazone bonds are cleaved by the intracellular acidic environment (pH 5-6) so that the drug release profile of the micelles is controlled pH-dependently. In this regard, FBP-binding selectivity of the prepared FMA was evaluated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. The tetrazolium dye method (MTT assay) using human pharyngeal cancer cells (KB cell) revealed that FMA significantly improved cell growth inhibitory activity in spite of a short exposure time due to the selective and strong interaction between folate molecules and their receptors. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis showed that cellular uptake of FMA significantly increased. Consequently, these findings would provide one of the most effective approaches for cancer treatment using intracellular environment-targeting supramolecular drug carriers.",

        "abstract": "New divinyl-functionalized acetal-based crosslinkers were synthesized as building elements to form acid-labile microgel particles for controlled-release applications. The synthesized crosslinkers underwent hydrolysis at slightly acidic pHs in less than 1 h while they were stable at neutral pHs for longer times. HEMA was copolymerized with the crosslinkers via an inverse emulsion polymerization technique using a redox initiator system at room temperature to form crosslinked, colloidal p(HEMA) microgels. Microgels in diameters ranging from 150 to 475 nm with narrow distribution could be produced. The crosslinking density and the diameter of the microgels were found to be controlled by monomer/crosslinker feed ratio. The microgels demonstrated a pH-dependent cleavage behavior that mimicked the pH-dependent hydrolysis profile of the acid-labile crosslinkers. Model biomacromolecules, i.e., Rhodamine B-labeled dextran and BSA were efficiently loaded into the microgels. The release of the biomolecules from p(HEMA) microgels was also found to be controllable by the pH of the environment similar to the particle degradation. The protein released from the microgels was observed to retain its structural stability.",

Aminolysis with hexylamine allowed the removal of the PLA core without any detrimental effect on the glycopolymer units to produce hollow nanocages. Characterization of these hollow \"sugar balls\" with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the cross-linked micelles with a central void due to the removal of the hydrophobic block.

Considering the unique role of a gas stimulus in smart materials and the promising gradient-type properties induced by combined stimuli, this study aims at the synthesis, thermoresponsive and self-assembly behaviors of an O2-, redox-, thermo-, and pH-responsive 3-miktoarm star quarterpolymer. A robust method involving controlled polymerization, amine\u2013thiol\u2013ene conjugation and hydrolysis was developed to achieve a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-4-(2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethylcarbamoyl)ethylthio)-2-(acrylamido)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)butanamide)-arm-poly(e-caprolactone)-arm-poly(acrylic acid) star. Owing to the changes in amphiphilicity, chemical composition and mutual interactions, a single stimulus or various stimuli combinations could lead to switchable LCSTs and morphological transformations. Upon increasing pH, O2 treatment and oxidation, the copolymer solution was liable to exhibit enhanced LCST due to the improved hydrophilicity. The star quarterpolymer could self-assemble into multicompartment vesicles (pH 3.0), vesicles (pH 5.9) and small micelle/vesicle mixtures (pH 10) at ambient temperature. Upon thermo, redox and O2 stimuli, the assemblies formed at different pHs could be further converted into some other morphologies such as compound micelles and nanocapsules with hollow caves.
