        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInsulin glargine (21A-Gly-30Ba-L-Arg-30Bb-L-Arg-human insulin) is a biosynthetic insulin analog with a prolonged duration of action compared with NPH human insulin. This study compared insulin glargine with NPH human insulin in subjects with type 1 diabetes who had been previously treated with multiple daily injections of NPH insulin and regular insulin.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis study was a multicenter randomized parallel-group study in which subjects were randomized to receive premeal regular insulin and either insulin glargine (at bedtime) or NPH insulin (at bedtime for patients on once-daily therapy and at bedtime and in the morning for patients on twice-daily therapy) for up to 28 weeks. Dose titration of both basal insulins was based on capillary fasting whole blood glucose (FBG) levels; the goal was a premeal blood glucose concentration of 4.4-6.7 mmol/l.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 534 well-controlled type 1 diabetic subjects (mean GHb 7.7%, mean fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 11.8 mmo/l) were treated. A small decrease in GHb levels was noted with both insulin glargine (-0.16%) and NPH insulin (-0.21%; P > 0.05). Significant reductions in median FPG levels from baseline (-1.67 vs. -0.33 mmol/l with NPH insulin, P = 0.0145) and a trend for a reduction in capillary FBG levels were achieved with insulin glargine. After the 1-month titration phase, significantly fewer subjects receiving insulin glargine experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia (39.9 vs. 49.2%, P = 0.0219) or nocturnal hypoglycemia (18.2 vs. 27.1%, P = 0.0116) with a blood glucose level <2.0 mmol/l compared with subjects receiving NPH insulin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLower FPG levels with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia were achieved with insulin glargine compared with once- or twice-daily NPH insulin as part of a basal-bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes.",

        "title": "Insulin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Background and aims. Given that the pathogenesis of type 1 and 2 diabetes are markedly different, it is possible that patients with type 2 diabetes should not be treated with insulin following the principles used for treatment of type 1 diabetes. The present studies were undertaken to define 1) the optimal insulin treatment regimen for type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure to oral anti-diabetic drugs (OAD), 2) causes of inter-individual variation in insulin requirements in type 2 diabetic patients and 3) how improvement of glycemic control by insulin therapy influences markers of endothelial activation as measured by serum concentrations of the soluble adhesion molecules sE-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1). Subjects, study designs and methods. 153 poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients who were treated with maximal doses of sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin were randomized to treatment for 3 months with either continued OAD and NPH insulin in the evening or continued OAD and NPH insulin in the morning, a 2 insulin injection regimen without OAD or a multiple insulin injection regimen without OAD. The goal was to achieve similar glycemic control with all insulin regimens and to compare effects of various regimens on insulin requirements, body weight, serum lipids and lipoproteins and episodes of hypoglycemia (study I). Study II was designed to determine what bedtime NPH insulin should be combined with, a sulfonylurea, metformin, both drugs or another injection of NPH insulin. Ninety-six type 2 diabetic patients who were treated with a maximal dose of sulfonylurea, were randomized to treatment for one year with bedtime NPH insulin and glibenclamide, or bedtime NPH insulin and metformin, or bedtime NPH insulin and glibenclamide and metformin, or bedtime NPH insulin and morning NPH insulin. The patients were taught to self adjust their insulin doses. In study III, 20 type 2 diabetic patients with stable glucose control and insulin dose, who were treated with combination therapy with bedtime NPH insulin and metformin for at least 1 year were studied. In each subject, the following measurements were performed: 1) measurement of action of intravenous insulin on endogenous glucose production (EGO) and utilization, (euglycemic insulin clamp combined with [3-H]glucose) 2) measurement of absorption (increase in free insulin and total insulin over 8 h after subcutaneous dose of regular insulin) and action of subcutaneous insulin (glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia and suppress FFA) and 3) measurement of liver (proton spectroscopy) and intra-abdominal (magnetic resonance imaging) fat content and in addition, body weight, body composition, and the thickness of subcutaneous abdominal (ultrasound) fat were determined. In study IV, 81 type 2 diabetic patients, who participated in study II and 41 normal subjects were studied. In these groups, concentrations of serum sE-selectin and sVCAM-1 concentrations were determined. In the type 2 diabetic patients, the measurements were repeated at 3 and 12 months. Results. Study I: The mean insulin doses of NPH insulin in the two groups receiving an OAD and NPH insulin were similar and 60 % lower than in the 2-injection or multiple injection group. The total doses of insulin were comparable in the 2and multiple insulin injection groups. HbA1c concentrations decreased from approximately 8 to 10 % in all the insulintreatment groups. All groups receiving insulin therapy gained weight. The smallest increment in body weight occurred in the OAD and evening NPH insulin group and the largest in the multiple-injection group (p < 0.05). The frequency of hypoglycemia was similar in all insulin treated groups. The concentration of serum VLDL triglycerides decreased by 13 to 28 % in the insulin treatment groups with no differences between the groups who used insulin. The concentrations of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. Study II: Patients receiving bedtime insulin and metformin showed a progressive decrease in HbA1c concentrations over time. At 12 months, HbA1c values in this group averaged 7.2 % \u00b1 0,2 %; which differed significantly from that in the other groups. Patients receiving bedtime insulin and metformin did not gain weight unlike the other groups. The frequency of hypoglycemic episodes in patients receiving bedtime insulin and metformin was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that in patients receiving bedtime and morning insulin. Hypoglycemia limited adequate titration of the insulin dose in the group using NPH insulin and glibenclamide. Serum triglyceride concentrations decreased similarly in all groups. Study III: The amount of insulin absorbed was significantly correlated with glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia ( r = 0.74, p < 0.001) and suppression of FFA ( r = -0.63, p < 0.005). On the other hand, the actions of intravenous and subcutaneous insulin were so closely correlated that the contribution of variation in insulin absorption to interindividual variation in insulin action was maximally 30 %. Of the relationships of measures of overall adiposity and fat distribution, the % liver fat was the best correlate of the % suppression of EGO by intravenous insulin. In multiple linear regression, 61.3% of variation in the daily insulin dose (units per day) could be explained by variation in the ability of subcutaneous insulin to suppress FFA (p < 0.001) and by insulin antibodies (p = 0.05). Of all measures of adiposity, the % liver fat was the parameter best correlated with the insulin dose. Study IV. Serum sE-selectin concentrations were 71 % higher in the type 2 diabetic patients than in the normal subjects before insulin therapy. During insulin therapy, sE-selectin concentrations decreased significantly compared to 0 month but the concentration at 12 months was still 55 % higher than in the normal subjects. Serum sVCAM-1 decreased transiently during the first 3 months and then increased back to baseline by 12 months. The change in HbA1c, both in diabetic men and women, was significantly correlated with the change in sE-selectin concentrations. Conclusions. In poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients receiving OAD therapy, the addition of NPH insulin in the evening improves glycemic control in a similar manner as a two-insulin-injection therapy regimen and multiple-insulin-therapy regimen, but induces less weight gain and hyperinsulinemia. Combination therapy with bedtime insulin and metformin prevents weight gain and seems superior to other bedtime insulin regimens with respect to improvement in glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemia. Self-adjustment of the insulin dose is critically important to achieve glycemic targets. The major reason for interindividual variation in insulin requirements in type 2 diabetes is variation in insulin action. Variation in hepatic fat content may influence insulin requirements via an effect on the sensitivity of EGO to insulin. Improvement in glycemic control by insulin alone or insulin combined with either glibenclamide, metformin, or both agents induces a sustained decrease in sE-selectin, the magnitude of which seems to be dependent on the degree of improvement in glycemic control. Serum sE-selectin might provide a marker of effects of treatment of chronic hyperglycemia on endothelial activation.",

        "title": "Inhaled Insulin Improves Glycemic Control When Substituted for or Added to Oral Combination Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Context Because inhaled insulin acts very rapidly and lasts as long as regular insulin, mealtime dosing could control postmeal hyperglycemia. Content The authors randomly assigned 309 patients whose type 2 diabetes was poorly controlled with oral therapy to receive inhaled insulin at mealtime, either alone or with oral therapy, or to continue oral therapy. Compared with oral agent therapy alone, inhaled insulin combination therapy and monotherapy reduced hemoglobin A1c level by 1.67 percentage points and 1.18 percentage points, respectively. Patients receiving inhaled insulin gained more weight and had more episodes of hypoglycemia. Conclusions Inhaled insulin is effective in patients whose oral agent therapy has failed. Using it alone is surprisingly effective despite its short duration of action. The Editors The long-term benefits of good glycemic control are well-established for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (1-9). In type 2 diabetes, the traditional treatment pathway generally involves the initiation of oral hypoglycemic agent therapy if lifestyle intervention is not effective (10). However, many patients will not achieve good glycemic control with oral agent therapy once insulin secretory capacity becomes insufficient (11). These patients must then receive insulin therapy to reduce the risk for diabetic complications. This usually involves the addition of basal insulin therapy to oral agents, although some studies suggest that insulin monotherapy is also effective (12-14). The optimal strategy for insulin add-on therapy is yet to be determined. Both patients and physicians are often reluctant to initiate subcutaneous insulin therapy (15-19). Consequently, the pulmonary route is being investigated as an alternative, less invasive method of insulin administration. Human inhaled insulin (Exubera; Pfizer Inc. [New York, New York], sanofi-aventis Group [Paris, France], and Nektar Therapeutics [San Carlos, California]) is a dry powder formulation and inhaler system currently in development (Figure 1). Figure 1. The inhaled insulin delivery system. Compared with injected regular insulin, inhaled insulin is more rapidly absorbed and eliminated and has a more rapid glucose-lowering effect (20). The pharmacodynamic profile of inhaled insulin has also been compared with the rapid-acting insulin analogue insulin lispro and regular human insulin at equivalent doses in healthy volunteers. Inhaled insulin had a faster onset of action than both insulin lispro and regular insulin, with a duration of action longer than insulin lispro and similar to regular insulin (21). These characteristics predict that inhaled insulin is suitable for administration before meals to control postprandial glycemia. In studies in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, inhaled insulin has shown similar glycemic control to conventional subcutaneous regimens (22, 23). In addition, data from a small pilot study suggested that when oral agent therapy failed in patients with type 2 diabetes, adding premeal inhaled insulin to existing therapy significantly improved glycemic control (24). Our aim was to investigate whether monotherapy with inhaled insulin or therapy with inhaled insulin added to dual oral agent therapy can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, compared with those continuing a stable regimen of dual oral agent therapy. We also assessed the tolerability and safety of inhaled insulin therapy over a 3-month period. Methods Participants We screened male and female outpatients 35 to 80 years of age who had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (25), at least 1 year earlier at 48 centers in the United States and Canada. Patients were already attending the investigator's clinic or were recruited by physician referral. For 2 months before the baseline lead-in period, patients were required to have been treated with a stable oral agent regimen involving 2 antidiabetic medications: 1 insulin secretagogue (a sulfonylurea or repaglinide) and 1 insulin sensitizer (a thiazolidinedione or metformin). In addition, patients were required to have a hemoglobin A1c level of 8% or greater at screening (week 4) and prerandomization (week 1) for eligibility. Exclusion criteria included hemoglobin A1c level greater than 11%; body mass index greater than 35 kg/m2; poorly controlled asthma; clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other clinically significant respiratory disease; smoking during the previous 6 months; abnormal pulmonary function at screening (carbon monoxide diffusing capacity < 75%, total lung capacity < 80% or > 120%, and FEV1 < 70% of predicted); clinically significant major organ system disease; abnormal electrocardiogram; abnormalities on laboratory screening; systemic glucocorticoid therapy; known drug or alcohol dependence; previous inhaled insulin use; or pregnancy, lactation, or planned pregnancy. We also excluded patients with a predisposition to severe hypoglycemia (2 severe episodes within the past 6 months) or any hospitalization or emergency department visit due to poor diabetic control within the past 6 months. Study Design This was an open-label, 12-week, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized study. The independent local institutional review boards of all participating centers approved the protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Using a computer-generated randomization scheme, we randomly assigned eligible patients to receive premeal inhaled insulin (Exubera) plus their existing stable regimen of 2 oral agents (n= 102) (inhaled insulin plus 2 oral agents group), to receive a premeal inhaled insulin regimen (n= 105) (inhaled insulin monotherapy group), or to be in the comparator group and continue receiving their existing stable regimen of dual oral agent therapy (n= 102) (2 oral agents group). Randomization was not within center. A system of interactive voice-response technology assigned the randomization codes. The investigator dialed a central database, where the master randomization list was held, and answered a series of prompts (for example, protocol number and center identification), which determined the specific treatment group assignment. At screening, 90%, 87%, and 90% of patients in the inhaled insulin plus 2 oral agents, inhaled insulin monotherapy, and 2 oral agents groups, respectively, were using metformin (mean dosage, approximately 2100 mg/d). Furthermore, 58%, 65%, and 63% of patients, respectively, were using glyburide (mean dosage, approximately 19 mg/d), and 27%, 23%, and 26% of patients, respectively, were using glipizide (mean dosage, approximately 20 mg/d). Five patients in the inhaled insulin plus 2 oral agents group, 3 patients in the inhaled insulin monotherapy group, and 4 patients in the 2 oral agents group were using troglitazone (400 mg to 600 mg). Since troglitazone was withdrawn from the market while the study was in progress, we required patients who were receiving troglitazone (n= 4) to switch to another thiazolidinedione. We recommended that patients who were receiving 400 mg or 600 mg of troglitazone switch to 4 mg of rosiglitazone or 30 mg of pioglitazone or to 8 mg of rosiglitazone or 45 mg of pioglitazone, respectively. Patients who switched from troglitazone therapy could continue participation in the study with no delay in study procedure schedules. Patients received dietary instruction in accordance with ADA recommendations (26). We also instructed patients to perform 30 minutes of moderate exercise at least 3 days per week, per ADA guidelines (27). Inhaled insulin was administered within 10 minutes before meals. Before beginning the study, we trained patients in the appropriate procedure for inhalation of insulin. The insulin was available in 1-mg and 3-mg blister packs (1 mg is equivalent to approximately 2.5 U to 3.0 U of subcutaneously injected insulin). Typically, patients administered 1 or 2 inhalations for any given dose. We based initial recommended doses for inhaled insulin on factors such as the patient's weight and degree of glycemic control (Appendix 1). The doses of the oral agents were kept stable for the duration of the study. We instructed patients to self-monitor blood glucose levels by using the Accu-Chek Complete glucometer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and to assess their blood glucose levels at least 4 times daily (before breakfast, lunch, and supper and at bedtime) with results recorded on a worksheet. Glycemic targets were 4.4 to 7.8 mmol/L (80 to 140 mg/dL) before breakfast, lunch, and supper and 5.6 to 8.9 mmol/L (100 to 160 mg/dL) at bedtime. Patients measured their blood glucose levels before administering insulin. We based recommended doses for prebreakfast, prelunch, and presupper inhaled insulin on review of the mean results for the prelunch, presupper, and bedtime self-monitored blood glucose levels, respectively, between clinic visits (Appendix 1). Doses of inhaled insulin could be altered according to guidelines in case the glucose concentrations were outside these ranges, in anticipation of a smaller or larger meal, or on an as-needed basis. Assessments The primary efficacy end point was the change in hemoglobin A1c level from baseline to week 12. We measured hemoglobin A1c at screening and at weeks 1, 0, 6, and 12. We defined baseline hemoglobin A1c as the average of the week 1 and week 0 values (if either value was missing, baseline was the nonmissing value). Secondary efficacy end points included changes in fasting plasma glucose level and 2-hour postprandial glucose concentration and percentage of patients achieving acceptable (hemoglobin A1c level < 8.0%) or good (hemoglobin A1c level < 7.0%) glycemic control at the end of the study. We measured fasting plasma glucose levels at weeks 4, 1, 0, and 12 i",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014Patients were randomly assigned to receive prandial EXU or subcutaneous insulin (regular or short-acting) plus basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin. The primary end points were the annual rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). RESULTS\u2014Small differences in FEV1 favoring subcutaneous insulin developed during the first 3 months but did not progress. Adjusted treatment group differences in FEV1 annual rate of change were \u22120.007 l/year (90% CI \u22120.021 to 0.006) between months 0 and 24 and 0.000 l/year (\u22120.016 to 0.016) during months 3\u201324. Treatment group differences in DLCO annual rate of change were not significant. Both groups sustained similar reductions in A1C by month 24 (last observation carried forward) (EXU 7.7\u20137.3% vs. subcutaneous insulin 7.8\u20137.3%). Reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were greater with EXU than with subcutaneous insulin (adjusted mean treatment difference \u221212.4 mg/dl [90% CI \u221219.7 to \u22125.0]). Incidence of hypoglycemia was comparable in both groups. Weight increased less with EXU than with subcutaneous insulin (\u22121.3 kg [\u22121.9 to \u22120.7]). Adverse events were comparable, except for a higher incidence of mild cough and dyspnea with EXU. CONCLUSIONS\u2014Two-year prandial EXU therapy showed a small nonprogressive difference in FEV1 and comparable sustained A1C improvement but lower FPG levels and less weight gain than seen in association with subcutaneous insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes.",
