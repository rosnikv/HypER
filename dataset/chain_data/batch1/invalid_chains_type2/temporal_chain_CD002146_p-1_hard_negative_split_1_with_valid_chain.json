        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension.\n\n\nDESIGN\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.\n\n\nSETTING\nCommunity-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\n--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.",

        "title": "Low diastolic blood pressure and atherosclerosis in elderly subjects. The Rotterdam study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA low diastolic blood pressure has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The following proposed mechanisms underlie this phenomenon: a low diastolic pressure that compromises coronary blood flow, a low diastolic pressure that is due to deteriorating health, and a low diastolic pressure that is a consequence of stiffening of the large arteries. Atherosclerosis may be the link between stiffening of the arteries, a low diastolic pressure, and an increased cardiovascular risk.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo study whether a low diastolic blood pressure in older subjects is a reflection of atherosclerosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Rotterdam (the Netherlands) Study is a population-based follow-up study of 7983 subjects (age, > or = 55 years) who are living in the suburb of Ommoord of Rotterdam. Baseline measurements included ultrasonographic evaluation of the carotid arteries, measurement of blood pressure, and determination of other cardiovascular risk factors. The main cross-sectional analyses were performed among 930 subjects who currently were not using blood pressure-lowering drugs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA J-shaped association of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery with diastolic blood pressure was found with a nadir from 60 to 69 mm Hg. The intima-media thickness was increased in subjects with a diastolic pressure that was less than 60 mm Hg compared with that in subjects with a diastolic pressure that was between 60 and 69 mm Hg (a difference of 0.033 mm [95% confidence limits; 0.001, 0.065]). Beyond a diastolic pressure of 70 mm Hg, a gradual increase in the intima-media thickness was observed. The association was most pronounced among subjects with relatively high pulse pressures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults of the present study indicate the existence of a J-shaped association between carotid atherosclerosis and diastolic pressure. These findings support the hypothesis that in elderly subjects, a low diastolic pressure may be a reflection of widespread atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "In research on the effectiveness of treatments, the randomised controlled trial is considered the best study design because it enables several sources of bias to be removed from the observation. The most important advantage of such a trial is that the baseline prognoses of patient groups are comparable so that unbiased estimates of the effects of a particular intervention can be obtained. In non-experimental (observational) studies allocation to drug treatment is, by definition, not random. This usually means that the prognoses of the patient groups are not comparable and any inferences drawn about the relative effects of treatment are therefore invalid.1 2 In studies of patients who are not randomly allocated to a treatment arm but receive treatment when their doctor decides to prescribe it, the onus is on the investigator to achieve comparability. We discuss the pitfalls of non-randomised comparisons of treatment effects. The results of a recently published study which suggested that hypertension should not be lowered too far by treatment and the subsequent debate provide an example of problems that may arise in validating the conclusions of such studies.\n\nA sensible doctor prescribes drugs only to patients who need them\u2014those who have indications that this treatment is required. Moreover, he or she will give priority to treating the most needy patients. When two patients seem to have indications but only one is being treated, the treated patient probably has more compelling indications than the second. The prognosis in any given group of treated patients will be different from that in untreated subjects because the latter will not generally have any indications for treatment. Furthermore, although many drugs can affect the course of a disease positively, the outcome in people with that disease compared with those who do not have it or have a less severe form \u2026",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nIt is important to assess the extent of bias when comparing the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral regimens in observational databases because, with the current lack of planned large trials, such analyses may represent the only means of assessing the risk of serious clinical events associated with new regimens. We aimed to compare the results from observational databases with those from randomized trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree treatment comparisons from randomized trials [Delta, AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175, Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) 007 and ACTC 320] were mimicked in cohorts: (i) zidovudine monotherapy versus combination regimens of two nucleoside analogues; (ii) zidovudine combined with either didanosine or zalcitabine; and (iii) a dual combination versus a triple regimen including a protease inhibitor. Data for over 10 000 patients from the French Hospital Database on HIV, the EuroSIDA study and the Swiss HIV cohort study were analysed for each of the comparisons. Progression to AIDS disease or death was analysed in Cox models, adjusting for baseline differences, and results compared with randomized trials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor comparison (i) the adjusted relative risk estimates from cohorts were between 0.61 and 0.84, favouring combinations over monotherapy, compared with 0.57 to 0.63 for trials. For comparison (ii) relative risk estimates from cohorts ranged from 0.81 to 1.01 compared with 0.77 to 0.92 for trials. For comparison (iii), two of the cohorts showed similar results to the ACTG 320 trial but one indicated a higher risk of progression on triple therapy [relative risk 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.441, in direct contrast to the trial result (relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.76).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSerious biases can be present when comparing outcomes from the use of antiretroviral regimens in observational studies. However, such bias is not inevitable and careful interpretation of the results from several observational studies considered together is likely to be informative, guiding the design of new trials.",

We used proportional-hazards regression models to estimate the effect on mortality of combination therapy including protease inhibitors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven percent of the subjects were receiving combination therapy including protease inhibitors in 1996; by 1999, 73 percent were receiving such therapy. In univariate analyses, a higher base-line percentage of lymphocytes that were CD4-positive, a higher weight for age, a higher height for age, black race, Hispanic ethnic background, younger age, and perinatally acquired infection were associated with a longer median time to the initiation of this type of therapy (P<0.001). After adjustment for covariates, the differences among racial and ethnic groups in the time to initiation were not statistically significant. Mortality declined from 5.3 percent in 1996 to 2.1 percent in 1997, 0.9 percent in 1998, and 0.7 percent in 1999 (P for trend <0.001). There were reductions in mortality in all subgroups defined according to age, sex, percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes, educational level of the parent or guardian, and race or ethnic background.

Twenty-six perinatally HIV-infected children being treated with three or more antiretroviral medications and their caregivers were enrolled and prospectively followed-up for 6 months. Adherence was assessed using MEMS monitoring of one antiretroviral, pharmacy refill records of all antiretrovirals, a caregiver self-report interview, a physician/nurse questionnaire, and appointment-keeping behavior. Viral loads measured at the end of the 6-month period were compared with the various adherence assessment methods. Adherence rates for the MEMS-monitored medication ranged from 12.7% to 97.9% (median = 81.4%), and 11 of the participants (42%) had less than 80% adherence using this method. A MEMS adherence rate greater than 80% was associated with viral load below the threshold of detection 6 months after enrollment (p <.001). Although not as robust, pharmacy refill rates for all antiretroviral medications were also associated with virologic response. The highest specificity was attained when both MEMS and pharmacy refill were used in combination. Physician assessment of adherence rate as well as appointment-keeping behavior was associated with virologic response, whereas caregiver self-report was not.",

        "title": "PENTA guidelines for the use of antiretroviral therapy, 2004",
        "abstract": "There have been few major advances in paediatric HIV management over the last 2 years. Decisions about starting antiretroviral therapy can now be based on a recent large meta\u2010analysis of the predictive value of CD4 and HIV RNA viral load (VL) in nearly 4000 untreated children, which is discussed in these updated guidelines. Risk estimates for progression to AIDS and death using surrogate markers can now be broken down by age, allowing more accurate discussion with families. In addition, there is increasing recognition of the problems of long\u2010term adherence, drug resistance and cumulative toxicity in adults and children. The controversy over whether to treat asymptomatic infants continues. For older children more data on the efficacy of ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimens suggests that these may be the PI option of first choice. There is still no adult or paediatric trial evidence on which to base decisions about whether to start with PI\u2010 or non\u2010nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhbitor (NNRTI)\u2010 based regimens, but the PENPACT 1 trial, which is addressing this question, is ongoing. There are increasing moves to provide simpler antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, including once daily dosing, but these lag behind adult regimens because of the paucity of pharmacokinetic data. Resistance assays should now be performed in all HIV\u2010infected infants exposed to ART in pregnancy. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be very important in children because of high between\u2010 and within\u2010child variability in drug absorption and metabolism. A trial to evaluate this should start shortly in Europe (PENTA 14 trial). The value of resistance tests for choice of second\u2010line and subsequent choices of ART regimens remain unproven (the PERA trial will report late in 2004), but resistance assays are increasingly being used. The issue of when to switch therapy also remains unanswered and is being addressed within the PENPACT 1 trial. Regular formal assessment of adherence is now the standard of care, and routine monitoring in the clinic for lipodystrophy syndrome (LDS) and other ART toxicities is increasingly important. These guidelines will be updated again in 2006.",

They received HAART consisting of either nevirapine or efavirenz, together with lamivudine and stavudine. Generic drugs and/or adult formulations were used. CD4 lymphocyte count, plasma HIV RNA level, and weight-for-age and height-for-age z scores were measured before, 2 months after, and every 6 months after initiation of HAART.

We identified predictors of viral failure and documented genotypic mutations in a subset of patients with viral failure after 12 months on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods:From April 2004 to June 2005, consecutive treatment-naive patients beginning ART at a university clinic in Uganda were enrolled. Clinical information, CD4 cell count, and HIV RNA level were collected at baseline and every 3 to 6 months. Independent predictors of viral failure were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Genotypic drug resistance for 8 patients with viral failure at 12 months was measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Results:Five hundred twenty-six adults and 250 children (0 to 18 years of age) were started on first-line ART regimens and followed for 12 months. Outcomes could not be assessed in 13% of patients (79 died and 21 were withdrawn). Children were almost twice as likely to have viral failure compared with adults (26% vs. 14%; P = 0.0001). In adults, the sole independent predictor of viral failure was treatment with stavudine (d4T)/lamivudine (3TC)/nevirapine (NVP) versus zidovudine (ZDV)/3TC/efavirenz (EFV) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20 to 5.59). In children, independent predictors of viral failure included male gender (OR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.20 to 4.93), baseline CD4% <5 (OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.28 to 5.63), and treatment with d4T/3TC/NVP versus ZDV/3TC/EFV (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.23 to 4.90). All 8 patients with viral breakthrough and genotypic drug resistance results had nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- and 3TC-associated mutations. Conclusions:These data demonstrate the effectiveness of ART in a low-resource setting. Children and patients of all ages taking the d4T/3TC/NVP regimen were more likely to have viral failure. Our data suggest that viral failure occurring 6 months or more after the start of ART regimens commonly used in Uganda is likely to be associated with NNRTI- and 3TC-resistant virus.",

We evaluated drug resistance patterns among patients failing first-line ART on the basis of clinical or immunological criteria in Lilongwe and Blantyre, Malawi. Methods:Patients meeting the definition of ART failure (new or progressive stage 4 condition, CD4 cell count decline more than 30%, CD4 cell count less than that before treatment) from January 2006 to July 2007 were evaluated. Among those with HIV RNA of more than 1000 copies/ml, genotyping was performed. For complex genotype patterns, phenotyping was performed. Results:Ninety-six confirmed ART failure patients were identified. Median (interquartile range) CD4 cell count, log10 HIV-1 RNA, and duration on ART were 68 cells/\u03bcl (23\u2013174), 4.72 copies/ml (4.26\u20135.16), and 36.5 months (26.6\u201349.8), respectively. Ninety-three percent of samples had nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, and 81% had the M184V mutation. The most frequent pattern included M184V and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations along with at least one thymidine analog mutation (56%). Twenty-three percent of patients acquired the K70E or K65R mutations associated with tenofovir resistance; 17% of the patients had pan-nucleoside resistance that corresponded to K65R or K70E and additional resistance mutations, most commonly the 151 complex. Emergence of the K65R and K70E mutations was associated with CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells/\u03bcl (odds ratio 6.1) and inversely with the use of zidovudine (odds ratio 0.18). Phenotypic susceptibility data indicated that the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone with the highest activity for subsequent therapy was zidovudine/lamivudine/tenofovir, followed by lamivudine/tenofovir, and then abacavir/didanosine. Conclusion:When clinical and CD4 cell count criteria are used to monitor first-line ART failure, extensive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance emerges, with most patients having resistance profiles that markedly compromise the activity of second-line ART.",

        "abstract": "Background:The South African national antiretroviral therapy roll-out program is entering its sixth year, with over 570,000 adults accessing treatment. HIV-1 drug resistance is a potential consequence of therapy. This study determined the pattern of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations after failure of first-line treatment regimens in South Africa. Methods:Two hundred and twenty-six patients virologically failing first-line regimens were studied to determine resistance patterns. Results:The most common reverse transcriptase mutation was M184V/I (72%; n = 163); 11% of patients (n = 25) had only nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations and 17% (n = 38) had no known resistance mutations. The K65R mutation was detected in 4%. The frequency of thymidine analog mutations was significantly higher with azidothymidine-containing (31 of 57) than stavudine-containing regimens (39 of 169; P < 0.001). The Y181C mutation was more frequent with failure of nevirapine (NVP)-containing (26%) than efavirenz (EFV)-containing therapy (3%; P < 0.001). The V106M mutation was more frequent with EFV (30%) than NVP (4%; P = 0.012). Conclusions:HIV-1 drug resistance patterns varied broadly after failure of first-line therapy, ranging from no known resistance mutations (17%) to multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and NNRTI resistance (23%). NNRTI mutation profiles differed for patients on EFV- compared with NVP-containing regimens. Overall, these findings suggest that HIV-1 drug resistance testing would be useful in identifying most appropriate second-line regimens.",

This cohort study examined patterns of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) in individuals with virological failure on first-line ART at 13 clinical sites in 6 African countries and predicted their impact on second-line drug susceptibility.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 2588 antiretroviral-naive individuals initiated ART consisting of different nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbones (zidovudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or abacavir, plus lamivudine or emtricitabine) with either efavirenz or nevirapine. Population sequencing after 12 months of ART was retrospectively performed if HIV RNA was >1000 copies/mL. The 2010 International Antiviral Society-USA list was used to score major DRMs. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHIV-1 sequences were generated for 142 participants who virologically failed ART, of whom 70% carried \u22651 DRM and 49% had dual-class resistance, with an average of 2.4 DRMs per sequence (range, 1-8). The most common DRMs were M184V (53.5%), K103N (28.9%), Y181C (15.5%), and G190A (14.1%). Thymidine analogue mutations were present in 8.5%. K65R was frequently selected by stavudine (15.0%) or tenofovir (27.7%).

After stavudine failure in African populations, zidovudine rather than tenofovir may be preferred in second-line ART. Strategies to prevent HIV-1 resistance are a global priority.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe World Health Organization Antiretroviral Treatment Guidelines recommend phasing-out stavudine because of its risk of long-term toxicity. There are two mutational pathways of stavudine resistance with different implications for zidovudine and tenofovir cross-resistance, the primary candidates for replacing stavudine. However, because resistance testing is rarely available in resource-limited settings, it is critical to identify the cross-resistance patterns associated with first-line stavudine failure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed HIV-1 resistance mutations following first-line stavudine failure from 35 publications comprising 1,825 individuals. We also assessed the influence of concomitant nevirapine vs. efavirenz, therapy duration, and HIV-1 subtype on the proportions of mutations associated with zidovudine vs. tenofovir cross-resistance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMutations with preferential zidovudine activity, K65R or K70E, occurred in 5.3% of individuals. Mutations with preferential tenofovir activity, \u2265 two thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) or Q151M, occurred in 22% of individuals. Nevirapine increased the risk of TAMs, K65R, and Q151M. Longer therapy increased the risk of TAMs and Q151M but not K65R. Subtype C and CRF01_AE increased the risk of K65R, but only CRF01_AE increased the risk of K65R without Q151M.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRegardless of concomitant nevirapine vs. efavirenz, therapy duration, or subtype, tenofovir was more likely than zidovudine to retain antiviral activity following first-line d4T therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background Tenofovir (TDF) has replaced stavudine (d4T) as the preferred nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) in first-line regimens in South Africa, but limited information is available on the resistance patterns that develop after the introduction of TDF. This study investigated the antiretroviral drug resistance patterns in South African HIV-1 subtype C-infected patients failing stavudine- (d4T) and tenofovir- (TDF) based first-line regimens and assess the suitability of TDF as the preferred first-line nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Methods Resistance patterns of HIV-1 from 160 adult patients virologically failing TDF- (n = 80) and d4T- (n = 80) based first-line regimens were retrospectively analyzed. The pol gene was sequenced using an in-house protocol and mutations were analysed using the IAS-USA 2014 Drug Resistance Mutation list. Results Compared to d4T-exposed patients (n = 7), patients failing on a TDF-containing regimen (n = 43) were almost 5 times more likely to present with a K65R mutation (aRR 4.86 95% CI 2.29 \u2013 10.34). Y115F was absent in the d4T group, and detected in 13.8% (n = 11) of TDF-exposed patients, p = 0.0007. Virus from 9 of the 11 patients (82.0%) who developed the Y115F mutation also developed K65R. Intermediate or high-level resistance to most NRTIs was common in the TDF-treatment group, but these patients twice more likely to remain susceptible to AZT as compared to those exposed to d4T (aRR 2.09 95% CI 1.13 \u2013 3.90). Conclusion The frequency of the TDF induced K65R mutation was higher in our setting compared to non-subtype C dominated countries. However, despite the higher frequency of cross-resistance to NRTIs, most patients remained susceptible to AZT, which is reflected in the South African treatment guidelines that recommend AZT as an essential component of second-line regimens.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine drug resistance mutation (DRM) patterns in a large cohort of patients failing nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens in programs without routine viral load (VL) monitoring and to examine intersubtype differences in DRMs. Design: Sequences from 787 adults/adolescents who failed an NNRTI-based first-line regimen in 13 clinics in Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Malawi were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between specific DRMs and Stanford intermediate-/high-level resistance and factors including REGA subtype, first-line antiretroviral therapy drugs, CD4, and VL at failure. Results: The median first-line treatment duration was 4 years (interquartile range 30\u201343 months); 42% of participants had VL \u2265100,000 copies/mL and 63% participants had CD4 <100 cells/mm3. Viral subtype distribution was A1 (40%; Uganda and Kenya), C (31%; Zimbabwe and Malawi), and D (25%; Uganda and Kenya), and recombinant/unclassified (5%). In general, DRMs were more common in subtype-C than in subtype-A and/or subtype-D (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations K65R and Q151M; NNRTI mutations E138A, V106M, Y181C, K101E, and H221Y). The presence of tenofovir resistance was similar between subtypes [P (adjusted) = 0.32], but resistance to zidovudine, abacavir, etravirine, or rilpivirine was more common in subtype-C than in subtype-D/subtype-A [P (adjusted) < 0.02]. Conclusions: Non-B subtypes differ in DRMs at first-line failure, which impacts on residual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and NNRTI susceptibility. In particular, higher rates of etravirine and rilpivirine resistance in subtype-C may limit their potential utility in salvage regimens.",

        "abstract": "Background The HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia has been shown to be dominated by two phylogenetically distinct subtype C clades, the Ethiopian (C\u2019-ET) and East African (C-EA) clades, however, little is known about the temporal dynamics of the HIV epidemic with respect to subtypes and distinct clades. Moreover, there is only limited information concerning transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance (TDR) in the country. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among young antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na\u00efve individuals recently diagnosed with HIV infection, in Gondar, Ethiopia, 2011\u20132013 using the WHO recommended threshold survey. A total of 84 study participants with a median age of 22 years were enrolled. HIV-1 genotyping was performed and investigated for drug resistance in 67 individuals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on all available HIV sequences obtained from Gondar (n = 301) which were used to define subtype C clades, temporal trends and local transmission clusters. Dating of transmission clusters was performed using BEAST. Result Four of 67 individuals (6.0%) carried a HIV drug resistance mutation strain, all associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Strains of the C-EA clade were most prevalent as we found no evidence of temporal changes during this time period. However, strains of the C-SA clade, prevalent in Southern Africa, have been introduced in Ethiopia, and became more abundant during the study period. The oldest Gondar transmission clusters dated back to 1980 (C-EA), 1983 (C-SA) and 1990 (C\u2019-ET) indicating the presence of strains of different subtype C clades at about the same time point in Gondar. Moreover, some of the larger clusters dated back to the 1980s but transmissions within clusters have been ongoing up till end of the study period. Besides being associated with more sequences and larger clusters, the C-EA clade sequences were also associated with clustering of HIVDR sequences. One cluster was associated with the G190A mutation and showed onward transmissions at high rate. Conclusion TDR was detected in 6.0% of the sequenced samples and confirmed pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C\u2019-ET, are common in Ethiopia. Moreover, the findings indicated an increased diversity in the epidemic as well as differences in transmission clusters sizes of the different clades and association with resistance mutations. These findings provide epidemiological insights not directly available using standard surveillance and may inform the adjustment of public health strategies in HIV prevention in Ethiopia.",

There is an increasing number of proven and specific HIV prevention tools, but little consensus on how best to deploy them. Recent findings Traditionally, phylogenetics has been used in HIV research to reconstruct the history of the epidemic and date zoonotic infections, whereas more recent publications focus on HIV diversity and drug resistance. However, it is also the most powerful method of source attribution available for the study of HIV transmission. The PANGEA (Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized Epidemics in Africa) consortium has generated over 18\u200a000 NGS HIV sequences from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using phylogenetic methods, we will identify characteristics of individuals or groups, which are most likely to be at risk of infection or at risk of infecting others. Summary Combining phylogenetics, phylodynamics and epidemiology will allow PANGEA to highlight where prevention efforts should be focussed to reduce the HIV epidemic most effectively. To maximise the public health benefit of the data, PANGEA offers accreditation to external researchers, allowing them to access the data and join the consortium.

        "abstract": "Across sub-Saharan Africa, key populations with elevated HIV-1 incidence and/or prevalence have been identified, but their contribution to disease spread remains unclear. We performed viral deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses to quantify transmission dynamics between the general population (GP), fisherfolk communities (FF), and women at high risk of infection and their clients (WHR) in central and southwestern Uganda. Between August 2014 and August 2017, 6185 HIV-1 positive individuals were enrolled in 3 GP and 10 FF communities, 3 WHR enrollment sites. A total of 2531 antiretroviral therapy (ART) na\u00efve participants with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL were deep-sequenced. One hundred and twenty-three transmission networks were reconstructed, including 105 phylogenetically highly supported source\u2013recipient pairs. Only one pair involved a WHR and male participant, suggesting that improved population sampling is needed to assess empirically the role of WHR to the transmission dynamics. More transmissions were observed from the GP communities to FF communities than vice versa, with an estimated flow ratio of 1.56 (95% CrI 0.68\u20133.72), indicating that fishing communities on Lake Victoria are not a net source of transmission flow to neighboring communities further inland.

Network generative models were fitted to the observed degree distributions and network parameters, and corrected Akaike Information Criteria and Bayesian Information Criteria values were estimated. 347 (17.2%) HIV sequences were linked on ML trees (maximum genetic distance \u22644.5%, \u226595% bootstrap support) and, of these, 303 (86.7%) that consisted of pure A1 (n = 168) and D (n = 135) subtypes were analyzed in BEAST v1.8.4.

The findings support the targeting of interventions for FFCs in a timely manner for effective epidemic control.

        "abstract": "HIV incidence in eastern and southern Africa has historically been concentrated among girls and women aged 15-24 years, but as new cases decline with HIV interventions, population-level infection dynamics may shift by age and gender. Here, we integrated population-based surveillance and longitudinal deepsequence viral phylogenetics to assess how HIV incidence and the population groups driving transmission have evolved over a 15 year period from 2003 to 2018 in Uganda. HIV viral suppression increased more rapidly in women than men, resulting in 1.5-2 fold higher suppression rates in women with HIV by 2018 across age groups. Incidence declined more slowly in women than men, increasing pre-existing gender imbalance in HIV burden. Age-specific transmission flows shifted; the share of transmission to girls and women aged 15-24 years from older men declined by approximately one third, whereas the contribution of transmission to women aged 25-34 years from men aged 0-6 years older doubled from 2003 to 2018. We estimated closing the gender gap in viral suppression could have reduced HIV incidence in women by half in 2018 and ended gender disparities in incidence. This study suggests that male-targeted HIV programs to increase HIV suppression are critical to reduce incidence in women, close gender gaps in infection burden and improve men's health in Africa.",

Sequence data were used to predict resistance. Population prevalence of class-specific resistance and resistance-conferring substitutions were estimated using robust log-Poisson regression. Findings Data from 93,622 participant-visits, including 4,702 deep-sequencing measurements, showed that the prevalence of NNRTI resistance among pre-treatment viremic PLHIV doubled between 2012 and 2017 (PR:1.98, 95%CI:1.34\u20132.91), rising to 9.61% (7.27\u201312.7%). The overall population prevalence of pre-treatment viremic NNRTI and NRTI resistance among all participants decreased during the same period, reaching 0.25% (0.18% - 0.33%) and 0.05% (0.02% - 0.10%), respectively (p-values for trend = 0.00015, 0.002), coincident with increasing treatment coverage and viral suppression. By the final survey, population prevalence of resistance contributed by treatment-experienced PLHIV exceeded that from pre-treatment PLHIV, with NNRTI resistance at 0.54% (0.44%\u22120.66%) and NRTI resistance at 0.42% (0.33%\u22120.53%). Overall, NNRTI and NRTI resistance was predominantly attributable to rtK103N and rtM184V. While 10.52% (7.97%\u221213.87%) and 9.95% (6.41%\u221215.43%) of viremic pre-treatment and treatment-experienced PLHIV harbored the inT97A mutation, no major dolutegravir resistance mutations were observed. Interpretation Despite rising NNRTI resistance among pre-treatment PLHIV, overall population prevalence of pre-treatment resistance decreased due to treatment uptake. Most NNRTI and NRTI resistance is now contributed by treatment-experienced PLHIV. The high prevalence of mutations conferring resistance to components of current first-line ART regimens among PLHIV with viremia is potentially concerning.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the population dynamics of HIV drug resistance in Uganda, which is related to the source paper's focus on HIV infection dynamics in Uganda. However, the key hypothesis in this paper is not directly inspired by the source paper's findings, but rather builds upon the broader context of HIV treatment and resistance in Uganda."
