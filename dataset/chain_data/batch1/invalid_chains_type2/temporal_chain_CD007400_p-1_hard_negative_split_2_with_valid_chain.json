        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\n. To compare the safety and efficacy of a topical diclofenac solution versus oral diclofenac in relieving the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy equivalence trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 622 men and women with radiological evidence of primary knee OA and mild to severe symptoms were randomly assigned to treatment with a topical diclofenac solution plus placebo oral capsules, or placebo topical solution plus oral diclofenac (50 mg) capsules. Patients applied 50 drops of study solution and took 1 study capsule 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy variables were pain and physical function, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) VA 3.1 OA Index, and patient global assessment (PGA). Equivalence in the per-protocol group was based on previously defined ranges of clinically significant difference. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe difference in mean (95% CI) change scores (final minus baseline) between treatments was 13.3 mm (-8.6 to 35.2) for pain (total scale 500 mm), 71.0 mm (-2.4 to 144.5) for physical function (total scale 1700 mm), and 4.3 mm (-1.2 to 9.8) for PGA (total scale 100 mm). The CI for each efficacy variable fell within the predefined equivalence ranges (pain, +/- 75 mm; physical function, +/- 255 mm; PGA, +/- 20 mm), indicating that no clinically relevant difference was found between the 2 treatment arms. Safety analyses of patients applying topical diclofenac solution revealed some minor skin irritation at the application site--mostly skin dryness in 83/311 (27%) patients--but a significantly reduced incidence, relative to oral diclofenac, of total and severe gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. The number of patients developing abnormal liver function tests (including clinically significant elevation), hemoglobin, and creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the oral diclofenac group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nApplication of this topical diclofenac solution to the knee of patients with OA produced relief of symptoms equivalent to oral diclofenac, with minor local skin irritation, but significantly reduced incidence of diclofenac-related GI complaints and abnormal laboratory values.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac diethylamine gel, 1.16%, 4 g applied qid for 3 weeks to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with OA of the knee washed out their OA medications for at least 5 drug half-lives. Patients with adequately high baseline pain scores were randomized to apply either double-blind active or placebo gel for 3 weeks. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g/day) was supplied as rescue medication. In a diary, patients recorded compliance to dosing and use of rescue medication and assessed daily pain on movement, spontaneous pain, and pain relief. At weekly site visits, patients completed the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index Questionnaire, which includes assessment of pain, stiffness, and physical function, and assessed pain intensity \"right now.\" At the final visit, a global assessment of treatment efficacy was completed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 238 randomized patients, 237 were included in the intent to treat efficacy analysis. Treatments differed significantly for daily pain on movement at Day 5, and continued on most days through end of study. Peak differences were achieved in the second week. On the primary outcome, average pain on movement over Days 1-14, diclofenac gel was significantly superior to placebo gel. Scores for all 3 WOMAC indices for diclofenac gel treatment were significantly superior to placebo at Weeks 2 and 3. A significant difference was achieved on pain intensity \"right now\" at all 3 weeks. At the end of the study, patients rated diclofenac gel as significantly more effective in treating the pain of OA of the knee (p = 0.03) compared to placebo. There were no safety issues concerning adverse events or laboratory values.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDiclofenac gel was effective and safe for relief of symptoms of OA of the knee over 3 weeks of dosing.",

        "title": "Which anticholinergic drug for overactive bladder symptoms in adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAround 16% to 45% of adults have overactive bladder symptoms (urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence - 'overactive bladder syndrome'). Anticholinergic drugs are common treatments.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo compare the effects of different anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder symptoms.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 8 March 2011) and reference lists of relevant articles.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials in adults with overactive bladder symptoms or detrusor overactivity that compared one anticholinergic drug with another, or two doses of the same drug.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nEighty six trials, 70 parallel and 16 cross-over designs were included (31,249 adults). Most trials were described as double-blind, but were variable in other aspects of quality. Crossover studies did not present data in a way that could be included in the meta-analyses. Twenty nine collected quality of life data (the primary outcome measure) using validated measures, but only fifteen reported useable data.Tolterodine versus oxybutynin: There were no statistically significant differences for quality of life, patient reported cure or improvement, leakage episodes or voids in 24 hours, but fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with tolterodine (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.66, data from eight trials), and less risk of dry mouth (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.71, data from ten trials).Solifenacin versus tolterodine: There were statistically significant differences for quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.12, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.01, data from three trials), patient reported cure/improvement (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39, data from two trials), leakage episodes in 24 hours (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.08, data from four studies) and urgency episodes in 24 hours (WMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.13, data from four trials), all favouring solifenacin. There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events and dry mouth, but after sensitivity analysis the dry mouth (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94) was statistically significantly lower with solifenacin when compared to Immediate Release (IR) tolterodine.Fesoterodine versus extended release tolterodine: Three trials contributed to the meta analyses. There were statistically significant differences for quality of life (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.14), patient reported cure/improvement (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16), leakage episodes (WMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.09), frequency (WMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.06) and urgency episodes (WMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.16) in 24 hours, all favouring fesoterodine, but those taking fesoterodine had higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.98) and higher risk of dry mouth (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.05) at 12 weeks.Different doses of tolterodine: The standard recommended starting dose (2 mg twice daily) was compared with two lower (0.5 mg and 1 mg twice daily), and one higher dose (4 mg twice daily). The effects of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg doses were similar for leakage episodes and micturitions in 24 hours, with greater risk of dry mouth with 2 and 4 mg doses at two to 12 weeks.Different doses of solifenacin: The standard recommended starting dose of 5 mg once daily was compared to 10 mg: while frequency and urgency were less (better) with 10 mg compared to 5 mg, there was a higher risk of dry mouth with 10 mg solifenacin at four to 12 weeks.Different doses of fesoterodine:The recommended starting dose of 4mg once daily was compared to 8 and 12 mg. The clinical efficacy (patient reported cure, leakage episodes, micturition per 24 hours) of 8 mg was better than 4 mg fesoterodine but with a higher risk of dry mouth with 8 mg.There was no statistically significant difference between 4 and 12 mg in the efficacy but the dry mouth was significantly higher with 12 mg at eight to 12 weeks.Extended versus immediate release preparations of oxybutynin and/or tolterodine: There were no statistically significant differences for cure/improvement, leakage episodes or micturitions in 24 hours, or withdrawals due to adverse events, but there were few data. Overall, extended release preparations had less risk of dry mouth at two to 12 weeks.One extended release preparation versus another: There was less risk of dry mouth with oral extended release tolterodine than oxybutynin (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95), but no difference between transdermal oxybutynin and oral extended release tolterodine although some people withdrew due to skin reaction at the transdermal patch site at 12 weeks.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nWhere the prescribing choice is between oral immediate release oxybutynin or tolterodine, tolterodine might be preferred for reduced risk of dry mouth. With tolterodine, 2 mg twice daily is the usual starting dose, but a 1 mg twice daily dose might be equally effective, with less risk of dry mouth. If extended release preparations of oxybutynin or tolterodine are available, these might be preferred to immediate release preparations because there is less risk of dry mouth.Between solifenacin and immediate release tolterodine, solifenacin might be preferred for better efficacy and less risk of dry mouth. Solifenacin 5 mg once daily is the usual starting dose, this could be increased to 10 mg once daily for better efficacy but with increased risk of dry mouth.Between fesoterodine and extended release tolterodine, fesoterodine might be preferred for superior efficacy but has higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events and higher risk of dry mouth.There is little or no evidence available about quality of life, costs, or long-term outcome in these studies. There were insufficient data from trials of other anticholinergic drugs to draw any conclusions.",

        "title": "Between-subject similarity of functional connectivity-based organization of the human periaqueductal gray related to autonomic processing",
        "abstract": "The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a brain stem area designated to play an essential role in lower urinary tract (LUT) control. Post-mortem human and animal studies have indicated that the PAG is symmetrically organized in functionally and anatomically distinct columns which are involved in sympathetic or parasympathetic autonomic control of the LUT. The current study aims to find consistency across subjects and identify homologous clusters between subjects. Here, we evaluated data from 10 female participants. During a bladder filling protocol, we ran a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while participants experienced a strong desire to void. A voxel-by-voxel correlation matrix of the PAG was created and parcellated using the Louvain module detection algorithm. Resulting in a map of the PAG in which each voxel is assigned to a cluster as determined by the Louvain module detection algorithm. The spatial similarity of resulting clusters between participants was assessed by computing the Dice similarity coefficient for all cluster comparisons. Next, we designed a permutation test to create randomized parcellation maps which enabled us to statistically test the similarity values observed across participants. We observed several significantly similar clusters between subjects compared to permutations (p \u2264 0.05). These results show that the PAG can be parcellated into distinct clusters which show a similar spatial distribution at the group level. This analysis is a crucial step to determine the agreement between in vivo PAG parcellations and the functional and anatomical columnar organization of the PAG which is known from previous research. These advancements may enable us to identify the relationship between LUT symptoms, such as urgency, and activity patterns in the PAG in normal and pathological states.",

Furthermore, the antagonism of OX2 receptors restored the abnormal levels of overactive bladder markers (i.e., ATP, CGRP, OCT3, TRPV1, ROCK1, and VAChT), diminished neuronal overactivity in central micturition areas (i.e., pontine micturition center, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and medial preoptic area) as well as restored the altered hippocampal levels of CRF, cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1), and growth factors (BDNF and NGF) that reflected biochemical disturbances detected in depressed people.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt seems that our findings open new perspectives regarding the implication of the orexin system in the functioning of the urinary bladder and in the pathophysiology of depression.",
