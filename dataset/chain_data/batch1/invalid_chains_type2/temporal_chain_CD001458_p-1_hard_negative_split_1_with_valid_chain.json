        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCollaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine associations between cerebral microbleed (CMB) burden with recurrent ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk after IS or TIA. Methods: We identified prospective studies of patients with IS or TIA that investigated CMBs and stroke (ICH and IS) risk during \u22653 months follow-up. Authors provided aggregate summary-level data on stroke outcomes, with CMBs categorized according to burden (single, 2\u20134, and \u22655 CMBs) and distribution. We calculated absolute event rates and pooled risk ratios (RR) using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 5,068 patients from 15 studies. There were 115/1,284 (9.6%) recurrent IS events in patients with CMBs vs 212/3,781 (5.6%) in patients without CMBs (pooled RR 1.8 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4\u20132.5). There were 49/1,142 (4.3%) ICH events in those with CMBs vs 17/2,912 (0.58%) in those without CMBs (pooled RR 6.3 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% CI 3.5\u201311.4). Increasing CMB burden increased the risk of IS (pooled RR [95% CI] 1.8 [1.0\u20133.1], 2.4 [1.3\u20134.4], and 2.7 [1.5\u20134.9] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively) and ICH (pooled RR [95% CI] 4.6 [1.9\u201310.7], 5.6 [2.4\u201313.3], and 14.1 [6.9\u201329.0] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively). Conclusions: CMBs are associated with increased stroke risk after IS or TIA. With increasing CMB burden (compared to no CMBs), the risk of ICH increases more steeply than that of IS. However, IS absolute event rates remain higher than ICH absolute event rates in all CMB burden categories.",

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Background and Purpose\u2014 Warfarin is associated with a better net clinical benefit compared with no treatment in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). There are limited data on nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in these patients, especially in the Asian population. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of NOACs to warfarin in a large-scale nationwide Asian population with AF and a history of ICH. Methods\u2014 Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database from January 2010 to April 2018, we identified patients with oral anticoagulant na\u00efve nonvalvular AF with a prior spontaneous ICH. For the comparisons, warfarin and NOAC groups were balanced using propensity score weighting. Ischemic stroke, ICH, composite outcome (ischemic stroke+ICH), fatal ischemic stroke, fatal ICH, death from composite outcome, and all-cause death were evaluated as clinical outcomes. Results\u2014 Among 5712 patients with AF with prior ICH, 2434 were treated with warfarin and 3278 were treated with NOAC. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced after propensity score weighting (mean age 72.5 years and CHA2DS2-VASc score 4.0). Compared with warfarin, NOAC was associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61\u20130.97]), ICH (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47\u20130.92]), and composite outcome (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.60\u20130.88]). NOAC was associated with lower risks of fatal stroke (HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.32\u20130.89]), death from composite outcome (HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.34\u20130.81]), and all-cause death (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69\u20130.99]) than warfarin. NOAC showed nonsignificant trends toward to reduce fatal ICH compared with warfarin (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20\u20131.03]). Conclusions\u2014 NOAC was associated with a significant lower risk of ICH and ischemic stroke compared with warfarin. NOAC might be a more effective and safer treatment option for Asian patients with nonvalvular AF and a prior history of ICH.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study evaluated the long-term outcomes for up to 20 years after On-X mechanical valve implantation in the left side of the heart.Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:Between 1999 and 2015, 861 patients (mean age=51.6\u00b110.9 years) who underwent prosthetic valve replacement using the On-X valve in the aortic or mitral position were enrolled (aortic=344, mitral=325, double=192). The mean clinical follow-up duration was 10.5\u00b15.3 (median 10.9) years. Operative mortality occurred in 26 patients (3.0%), and linearized late cardiac mortality was 0.9%/patient-year without an intergroup difference. Linearized thromboembolism, bleeding, prosthetic valve endocarditis, non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD), and reoperation rates were 0.8%/patient-year, 0.6%/patient-year, 0.2%/patient-year, 0.5%/patient-year, and 0.5%/patient-year, respectively. Prosthetic valve endocarditis was more frequent after double valve replacement than after aortic or mitral valve replacement (P=0.008 and 0.005, respectively). NSVD and reoperation rates were significantly lower aortic valve replacement than after mitral or double valve replacement (P=0.001 and 0.002, P=0.001 and <0.001, respectively). Valve replacement in the mitral position was the only risk factor for NSVD (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]=5.247 [1.608-17.116], P=0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOn-X valve implantation in the left side heart had favorable clinical outcomes with acceptable early and late mortality and a low incidence of prosthetic valve-related complications. Particularly in the aortic position, the On-X valve had better long-term non-structural durability.",

        "title": "From the INVICTUS Trial to Current Considerations: It\u2019s Not Time to Retire Vitamin K Inhibitors Yet!",
        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in clinical practice, and oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone of stroke prevention in AF. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) significantly reduce the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage with preserved efficacy for preventing stroke compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA). However, the pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DOAC excluded patients with valvular heart disease, especially mitral stenosis, which remains an exclusion criterion for DOAC use. The INVICTUS study was a large multicenter global RCT aimed at evaluating the role of DOAC compared to VKA in stroke prevention among patients with rheumatic valvular AF. In this study, rivaroxaban failed to prove superiority over VKA in preventing the composite primary efficacy endpoints of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and death. Unfortunately, the bleeding rates were not lower with rivaroxaban either. The death and drug discontinuation rates were higher in the DOAC arm. Close to the heels of the dismal results of INVICTUS, an apixaban trial in prosthetic heart valves, PROACT-Xa, was also prematurely terminated due to futility. Hence, for AF complicating moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or prosthetic valve VKA remains the standard of care. However, DOAC can be used in patients with surgical bioprosthetic valve implantation, TAVR, and other native valve diseases with AF, except for moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis. Factor XI inhibitors represent a breakthrough in anticoagulation as they aim to dissociate thrombosis from hemostasis, thereby indicating a potential to cut down bleeding further. Multiple agents (monoclonal antibodies\u2014e.g., osocimab, anti-sense oligonucleotides\u2014e.g., fesomersen, and small molecule inhibitors\u2014e.g., milvexian) have garnered positive data from phase II studies, and many have entered the phase III studies in AF/Venous thromboembolism. Future studies on conventional DOAC and new-generation DOAC will shed further light on whether DOAC can dethrone VKA in valvular heart disease.",
