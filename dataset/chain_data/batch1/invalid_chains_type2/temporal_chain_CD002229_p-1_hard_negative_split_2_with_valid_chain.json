        "title": "Randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) Research Group.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nObservational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nEither 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.",

        "title": "Effect of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular events in recently postmenopausal women: randomised trial",
        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the long term effect of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in recently postmenopausal women. Design Open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Denmark, 1990-93. Participants 1006 healthy women aged 45-58 who were recently postmenopausal or had perimenopausal symptoms in combination with recorded postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone values. 502 women were randomly allocated to receive hormone replacement therapy and 504 to receive no treatment (control). Women who had undergone hysterectomy were included if they were aged 45-52 and had recorded values for postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone. Interventions In the treatment group, women with an intact uterus were treated with triphasic estradiol and norethisterone acetate and women who had undergone hysterectomy received 2 mg estradiol a day. Intervention was stopped after about 11 years owing to adverse reports from other trials, but participants were followed for death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer for up to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on women who took more than 80% of the prescribed treatment for five years. Main outcome measure The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to hospital for heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Results At inclusion the women on average were aged 50 and had been postmenopausal for seven months. After 10 years of intervention, 16 women in the treatment group experienced the primary composite endpoint compared with 33 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.87; P=0.015) and 15 died compared with 26 (0.57, 0.30 to 1.08; P=0.084). The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer. Conclusions After 10 years of randomised treatment, women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke.

        "title": "Effects of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine (Zhi Mu 14) on hot flushes and quality of life in postmenopausal women: results of a four-arm randomized controlled pilot trial",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical trial investigating the effects of acupuncture (AP) and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) on hot flushes and quality of life in postmenopausal women. MethodsForty postmenopausal women reporting at least 20 hot flushes per week were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. They were randomly allocated to receive traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) AP, sham AP, verum CHM, or placebo CHM for 12 weeks. Follow-up assessment was conducted 12 weeks after intervention. Primary outcome measures included hot flush frequency and severity. As a secondary outcome measure, the severity of menopausal symptoms was assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) II. ResultsTCM AP induced a significant decline in all outcome measures from pretreatment to posttreatment compared with sham AP (hot flush frequency, P = 0.016; hot flush severity, P = 0.013; MRS, P < 0.001). In the TCM AP group, a larger decrease in MRS scores persisted from pretreatment to follow-up (P = 0.048). No significant differences were noted between the verum CHM group and the placebo CHM group. Compared with the verum CHM group, there was a significant decrease in MRS scores (P = 0.002) and a trend toward a stronger decrease in hot flush severity (P = 0.06) in the TCM AP group from pretreatment to posttreatment. ConclusionsTCM AP is superior to sham AP and verum CHM in reducing menopausal symptoms, whereas verum CHM shows no significant improvements when compared with placebo CHM.",

        "title": "Effects of acupuncture on menopause-related symptoms and quality of life in women in natural menopause: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveThis meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on hot flash frequency and severity, menopause-related symptoms, and quality of life in women in natural menopause. MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed/Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL using keywords such as acupuncture, hot flash, menopause-related symptoms, and quality of life. Heterogeneity, moderator analysis, publication bias, and risk of bias associated with the included studies were examined. ResultsOf 104 relevant studies, 12 studies with 869 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. We found that acupuncture significantly reduced the frequency (g = \u22120.35; 95% CI, \u22120.5 to \u22120.21) and severity (g = \u22120.44; 95% CI, \u22120.65 to \u22120.23) of hot flashes. Acupuncture significantly decreased the psychological, somatic, and urogenital subscale scores on the Menopause Rating Scale (g = \u22121.56, g = \u22121.39, and g = \u22120.82, respectively; P < 0.05). Acupuncture improved the vasomotor subscale score on the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (g= \u22120.46; 95% CI, \u22120.9 to \u22120.02). Long-term effects (up to 3 mo) on hot flash frequency and severity (g = \u22120.53 and g = \u22120.55, respectively) were found. ConclusionsThis meta-analysis confirms that acupuncture improves hot flash frequency and severity, menopause-related symptoms, and quality of life (in the vasomotor domain) in women experiencing natural menopause.",

        "title": "Acupuncture to Reduce Sleep Disturbances in Perimenopausal and Postmenopausal Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of acupuncture with sleep disturbances and serum sex hormone levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and whether there are associated changes in sex hormone levels. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Wanfang Data Chinese Database, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database) and the reference lists of the identified studies. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of acupuncture on sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement was followed. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We identified 31 randomized controlled trials with 34 effect sizes involving a total of 2,433 participants. Acupuncture is associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of sleep disturbances (odds ratio [OR] 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14\u20130.31), a significant increase in the secretion of serum estradiol (pooled difference in means 7.56 pg/mL, 95% CI 4.03\u201311.08), and reduction in the secretion of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (\u22126.75 milli-international units/mL, 95% CI \u221212.16 to \u22121.34) and luteinizing hormone (\u22122.71 milli-international units/mL, 95% CI \u22124.22 to \u22121.20). Studies with a large effect size of acupuncture-associated changes in serum estradiol had a significantly lower odds of sleep disturbances than did those with a small-to-moderate effect sizes (ORs 0.07 and 0.36, P=.02). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is associated with a significant reduction in sleep disturbances in women experiencing menopause-related sleep disturbances. Our findings suggest that acupuncture should be adopted as part of a multimodal approach for improving sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.",

        "title": "Combination of acupuncture improves the effect of estazolam on senile insomnia",
        "abstract": "Objective: The current study was designed to compare the effects of acupuncture, estazolam and a combination of the two on the treatment of senile insomnia. Methods: From January 2015 to December 2019, a total of 270 elderly outpatients with insomnia were recruited from the Department of Encephalopathy of Shaanxi Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and randomly grouped into three groups (Group A: acupuncture group, Group B: estazolam group, Group C: acupuncture plus estazolam group, n=90). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography indexes (PSG) were used to evaluate the treatment efficacy of these three methods. Results: The effective rates in Group A, Group B and Group C were 72.2%, 71.3% and 89.2%, respectively. The PSQI scores after treatment were statistically lower than those before treatment in all three groups. No significant difference existed between Group A and Group B in the total PSQI score before and after treatment. The difference in score after treatment in Group C was more significant than that in the other two groups. The sub-score analysis of the PSQI showed that a combination of acupuncture and estazolam was more effective in improving subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency and daytime function than acupuncture or estazolam alone. The PSG results showed that the combination group had better outcomes in terms of increasing the total sleep time and sleep efficiency, prolonging NREM sleep, decreasing the frequency of awakening, reducing the light sleep time of the S1 phase and increasing the deep sleep time of the S3 phase over Group A and Group B. Conclusion: Acupuncture has a similar effect to estazolam on senile insomnia. The combination of acupuncture and estazolam has a greater effect in improving both the quality and quantity of sleep in elderly patients suffering from insomnia over acupuncture or estazolam alone.",
