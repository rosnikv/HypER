        "abstract": "Background:The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a successful treatment, but its mode of action remains unknown. This study assessed serial changes in the fecal microbiota milieu during EEN. Methods:Five fecal samples were collected from CD children: 4 during EEN (start, 15, 30, end EEN approximately 60 days) and the fifth on habitual diet. Two samples were collected from healthy control subjects. Fecal pH, bacterial metabolites, global microbial diversity abundance, composition stability, and quantitative changes of total and 7 major bacterial groups previously implicated in CD were measured. Results:Overall, 68 samples were from 15 CD children and 40 from 21 control subjects. Fecal pH and total sulfide increased and butyric acid decreased during EEN (all P < 0.05). Global bacterial diversity abundance decreased (P < 0.05); a higher degree of microbiota composition stability was seen in control subjects than in CD children during EEN (at P \u2a7d 0.008). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp concentration significantly decreased after 30 days on EEN (P < 0.05). In patients who responded to EEN, the magnitude of the observed changes was greater and the concentration of Bacteroides/Prevotella group decreased (P < 0.05). All these changes reverted to pretreatment levels on free diet, and EEN microbiota diversity increased when the children returned to their free diet. Conclusions:EEN impacts on gut microbiota composition and changes fecal metabolic activity. It is difficult to infer a causative association between such changes and disease improvement, but the results do challenge the current perception of a protective role for F. prausnitzii in CD.",

        "abstract": "Background:Faecalibacterium prausnitzii comprises 2 phylogroups, whose abundance in healthy and diseased gut and in conjunction with Escherichia coli has not yet been studied. This work aims to determine the contribution of F. prausnitzii phylogroups I and II in intestinal disease and to assess their potential diagnostic usefulness as biomarkers for gut diseases. Methods:Total F. prausnitzii, its phylogroups, and E. coli loads were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene on biopsies from 31 healthy controls (H), 45 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 25 patients with ulcerative colitis, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 20 patients with colorectal cancer. Data were normalized to total bacterial counts and analyzed according to patients' disease location and clinical characteristics. Results:Lower levels of both total F. prausnitzii and phylogroup I were found in subjects with CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) compared with H subjects. Phylogroup I load was a better biomarker than total F. prausnitzii to discriminate subjects with gut disorders from H. Phylogroup II depletion was observed only in patients with CD (P < 0.001) and can be potentially applied to differentiate ulcerative pancolitis from colonic CD. No statistically significant correlation between E. coli and any of the 2 F. prausnitzii phylogroups was found in any group of patients or by inflammatory bowel disease location. Phylogroup I was lower in active patients with CD, whereas those CD with intestinal resection showed a reduction in phylogroup II. Treatments with mesalazine and immunosuppressants did not result in the recovery of F. prausnitzii phylogroups abundance. Conclusions:F. prausnitzii phylogroup I was depleted in CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer, whereas phylogroup II was specifically reduced in CD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii phylogroups and E. coli may help to identify gut disorders and to classify inflammatory bowel disease location.",

        "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, cohabitants in the intestinal mucosa, are considered members of a healthy microbiota and reduction of both species occurs in several intestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease. Little is known however about a possible link between the reduction in quantity of these species, and in which circumstances this may occur. This study aims to determine the abundances and co-occurrence of the two species in order to elucidate conditions that may compromise their presence in the gut. Loads of A. muciniphila, total F. prausnitzii and its two phylogroup (16S rRNA gene copies) were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in colonic biopsies from 17 healthy controls (H), 23 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 31 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 3 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 3 with colorectal cancer (CRC). Data were normalized to total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies in the same sample. Prevalence, relative abundances and correlation analyses were performed according to type of disease and considering relevant clinical characteristics of patients such as IBD location, age of disease onset, CD behavior, current medication and activity status. Co-occurrence of both species was found in 29% of H, 65% of UC and 29% of CD. Lower levels of total F. prausnitzii and phylogroups were found in subjects with CD, compared with H subjects (P \u2264 0.044). In contrast, no differences were found with the regard to A. muciniphila abundance across different disease states, but CD patients with disease onset below 16 years of age featured a marked depletion of this species. In CD patients, correlation between A. muciniphila and total F. prausnitzii (\u03c1 = 0.362, P = 0.045) was observed, and particularly in those with non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease behavior and under moderate immunosuppressants therapy. Altogether, this study revealed that co-occurrence of both species differs between disease status. In addition, IBD patients featured a reduction of F. prausnitzii but similar loads of A. muciniphila when compared to H subjects, with the exception of those with early onset CD. Depletion of A. muciniphila in this subgroup of subjects suggests that it could be a potential biomarker to assist in pediatric CD diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Obesity and its metabolic syndrome, including liver disorders and type 2 diabetes, are a worldwide epidemic and are intimately linked to diet. The gut microbiota interaction has been pointed to as a hot topic of research in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic diseases by influencing energy metabolism and the immune system. In terms of the novel beneficial microbes identified, Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) colonizes the mucosa layer of the gut and modulates basal metabolism. A. muciniphila is consistently correlated with obesity. The causal beneficial impact of A. muciniphila treatment on obesity is coming to light, having been proved by a variety of animal models and human studies. A. muciniphila has been characterized as a beneficial player in body metabolism and has great prospects for treatments of the metabolic disorders associated with obesity, as well as being considered for next-generation therapeutic agents. This paper aimed to investigate the basic mechanism underlying the relation of A. muciniphila to obesity and its host interactions, as identified in recent discoveries, facilitating the establishment of the causal relationship in A. muciniphila-associated therapeutic supplement in humans.",

This study monitored non-pharmacological interventions (diet therapy and probiotics) in managing sarcopenia for patients with recent SARS-CoV-2 history (14 days). A prospective study was performed on 200 patients (between December 2020\u2013December 2021), with SPPB score < 9, randomly divided into: Group K\u2014DP (93 patients) with dietary therapy (protein 1.2\u20131.5 g/kg) and probiotics for two months; and Group K\u2014non-DP (107 patients) without diet therapy and probiotics. All patients were included in a specific physical training program (40 min), three sessions per week. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), serum albumin, and hemoglobin were determined. The SMI was initially low for both groups without significant statistical differences (6.5 \u00b1 0.52 kg/m2 for Group K\u2014non-DP vs. 6.7 \u00b1 0.57 Kg/m2 for Group K\u2014DP, p = 0.135).

The present trial aimed to reveal the efficacy of synbiotic supplementation on clinical and paraclinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients. The current randomized placebo\u2010controlled trial enrolled 78 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID\u201019 infection. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups that received synbiotic or placebo capsules twice daily for 2 weeks, respectively. The synbiotic capsule contains multi\u2010strain probiotics such as Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus, L. helveticus, L. casei, Bifidobacterium (B.) lactis, L. acidophilus, B. breve, L. bulgaricus, B. longum, L. plantarum, B. bifidum, L. gasseri, and Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus (109\u2009CFU), as well as fructooligosaccharides prebiotic agent. Besides COVID\u201019 clinical features, levels of proinflammatory interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), liver and renal function markers, as well as hematological parameters, were assessed during follow\u2010up.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, triggering an acute proinflammatory response and chronic lung inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has shown promise in reducing the nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, diminishing symptom frequency and duration, and mitigating inflammation; thus, it is a potential strategy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the oral administration of the Lactobacillus plantarum GUANKE strain, a gram-positive bacterium originally isolated from a healthy individual, on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. We found that GUANKE significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary interstitial exudation in mice. The transcription of CCL2, TNFA, IL1B, IL6, and IL17C in the lungs was reduced. The protein levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-17 in the lungs were significantly lower in GUANKE-treated mice than in control mice. The viral load in GUANKE-treated mice was lower than that in saline-treated mice, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. L. plantarum GUANKE can decrease SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation in mice, suggesting its potential for use as an agent for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Most otherwise healthy individuals develop only mild or moderate symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by current strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and virus replication is mainly confined to the upper respiratory tract; however, the virus can infect the lower respiratory tract and promote inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to reduce nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, reduce the overall number and duration of symptoms, and attenuate inflammation in clinical trials. We showed that a novel L. plantarum GUANKE strain alleviated SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia in mice. The transcription and production of inflammatory cytokines were suppressed, and GUANKE moderately reduced the viral load. L. plantarum GUANKE has the potential to become a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 or other viral respiratory infections.",
