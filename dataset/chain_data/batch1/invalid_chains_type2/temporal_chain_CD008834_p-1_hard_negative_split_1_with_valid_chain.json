        "abstract": "Abstract The effects of sulfinpyrazone and a placebo on the incidence of thrombosis of arteriovenous shunts was investigated in a double-blind study in 52 patients on chronic hemodialysis over a six-month period. Thrombi occurred in 86 per cent of patients on placebo and 50 per cent of those on sulfinpyrazone (p<0.01). The incidence of thrombosis was reduced from 0.76 thrombi per patient month in the placebo group to 0.18 thrombi per patient month in the sulfinpyrazone group (p<0.001). Venous-shunt revisions were required in 48 per cent of patients given placebo and in only 16 per cent of those receiving sulfinpyrazone (p<0.05). Side effects were minimal and necessitated withdrawal from the study in only one patient. This study supports the results of animal experiments showing that sulfinpyrazone decreases thrombus formation the high-flow systems. (N Engl J Med 290:304\u2013306, 1974)",

        "abstract": "Abstract We assessed aspirin prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in a prospective, controlled, double-blind study of patients over 40 years of age, who had undergone total hip replacement. Radiographic phlebography was the diagnostic end point. Thromboembolism developed in 11 of 44 patients receiving aspirin, as compared to 23 of 51 receiving the placebo (P<0.03). Unexpectedly, this protection was limited to men. In four of 23 men on aspirin thrombi developed, as compared to 14 of 25 receiving placebo (P<0.01). Corresponding figures for women were seven of 21 versus nine of 26. Review of a similar group of patients receiving aspirin revealed significantly greater protection (P<0.03) in men (three of 15) than in women (15 of 27). These data establish statistically significant prophylaxis in men over the age of 40 by 600 mg of aspirin given twice daily. The absence of a protective effect in women remains unexplained.

        "abstract": "Aspirin inhibits platelet function by acetylating platelet cyclooxygenase. Recent clinical trials indicate that aspirin is a promising antithrombotic agent against both venous and arterial thrombosis, but somewhat surprisingly this protective effect appears to be limited to males. To examine the potential sex-related differences in response to aspirin, we developed an animal model for quantitating fibrin accretion into an injury-induced thrombus and used it to study the effects of aspirin on thrombus size in male and female rabbits. Platelet prostaglandin synthesis was estimated by assay of platelet malondialdehyde and was significantly decreased in both male and female rabbits following treatment with 10 mg/kg aspirin (p less than 0.001). This inhibitory effect was not different for platelets from male and female rabbits. Thrombus size was significantly decreased in aspirin-treated male rabbits when compared to controls (p less than 0.05), but this aspirin effect was not apparent in female rabbits or rabbits of either sex treated with 10 mg/kg sodium salicylate. These findings support the results of clinical trials that were obtained by retrospective subgroup analysis. The reason for the sex difference is not known, but the findings raise an important issue in relationship to this mechanism of the antithrombotic effect of aspirin.",

        "abstract": "The effects of ketoprofen on frusemide-induced diuresis, natriuresis and renin release were studied in 12 healthy male volunteers. Each received frusemide 40 mg once daily with either ketoprofen 100 mg twice daily or placebo for two periods of 5 days separated by a treatment-free period according to a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study design. Ketoprofen significantly reduced frusemide-induced diuresis on Day 1 but not on Day 5 of treatment. The natriuresis induced by frusemide on Day 1 or Day 5 of treatment did not differ significantly whether ketoprofen or placebo was administered, although the mean urinary sodium excretion values were consistently lower following ketoprofen. Ketoprofen did not affect the kaliuretic response to frusemide on Day 1 or Day 5 of treatment. The increase in plasma renin activity after frusemide was inhibited by ketoprofen on both Day 1 and Day 5. These results suggest that ketoprofen reduces the diuresis and renin release induced by frusemide, but that the reduction in diuretic response may become less important after their repeated coadministration.",

        "title": "Factors affecting the absorption and disposition of frusemide and bumetanide in man",
        "abstract": "Drug absorption, elimination and effect may be influenced by many factors including type of formulation, particle size, dissolution and by the presence ofother drugs or food and fluid ingestion. The influence of some of these factors on the absorption and effect offrusemide and bumetanide have been investigated in the present studies. The effect of food on the absorption of oral frusemide (40 mg) was determined in 8 healthy volunteers. Food significantly reduced peak plasma concentrations (2.35 \u00b1 0.49 versus 0.51 \u00b1 0.19 mg/1) and delayed the time to peak. The bioavailability of frusemide was also significantly reduced from 76 % fasting to 43 % after food. The study was then repeated in 9 healthy volunteers using oral bumetanide (2 mg) given with and without food. The peak concentration was reduced after food (96.9 \u00b1 15.1 versus 36.1 \u00b1 11,5 pig/1) and the time to peak concentration delayed. However the mean bioavailability of bumetanide was not significantly reduced by food. A survey carried out in two medical wards within the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary then provided information on the general use of frusemide and bumetanide and showed that most of the patients were taking a single oral dose ofdiuretic with or in close proximity to breakfast, a situation which could potentially alter diuretic absorption and effect. Consequently, the effect ofhospital breakfast on the absorption and efficacy offrusemide was studied in 10 medical inpatients. However when frusemide was administered 2 hours after breakfast, no significant improvement in area under the plasma concentration-time curve, urinary recovery of frusemide or total natriuretic and diuretic response was found. The pharmacokinetics of frusemide were compared in 8 healthy volunteers following oral administration of single doses of 10, 40 and 80 mg. Peak plasma concentrations, areas under the plasma concentration time curves and amounts excreted, normalised to 40 mg, were not significantly different. Over this dose range there was no significant dose-dependent effect on frusemide absorption. The effects ofpenicillin on frusemide renal secretion and diuretic effect were studied in 8 healthy volunteers. Penicillin significantly reduced the renal clearance of frusemide (103.0 \u00b1 15.9 to 83.6 \u00b1 17.4 ml/min), but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, total urinary recovery of frusemide or on the time course and magnitude ofnatriuresis and diuresis. Finally, the time course of frusemide delivery to the active site has been suggested to be an independent determinant of overall response. The kinetic and the dynamic effects of the same total dose of frusemide (40 mg) administered as a single dose and as repeated doses over 8 h were compared in 8 healthy volunteers. The average area under the plasma concentration-time curve (2.89 \u00b1 0.66 versus 2.25 \u00b1 0.32 mg.h/1) and total urinary recovery of frusemide (1 8.3 \u00b13.3 versus 16.4 \u00b1 3.0 mg) were significantly lower following the repeated doses. However despite less drug being delivered to the active site, no significant differences were found in total sodium and water excretion compared to the single dose.",
