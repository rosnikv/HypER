The effects of dexamethasone and budesonide on biliary bicarbonate excretion and H+/HCO3- transport processes were investigated in bile fistula rats, isolated intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDUs), and purified cholangiocytes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGcRs were expressed by rat cholangiocytes. Although acute administration of corticosteroids showed no effect, treatment for 2 days with dexamethasone or budesonide increased (P < 0.05) biliary bicarbonate concentration and secretion, which were blocked by the specific GcR antagonist, RU-486. IBDUs isolated from rats treated with dexamethasone or budesonide showed an increased (P < 0.05) activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE2 member), which was blocked by RU-486. Protein expression of NHE1 and AE2 and messenger RNA for NH1 but not AE2 were increased (P < 0.05) in isolated cholangiocytes by dexamethasone treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe intrahepatic biliary epithelium expresses GcR and responds to corticosteroids by increasing bicarbonate excretion in bile. This is caused by corticosteroid-induced enhanced activities and protein expression of transport processes driving bicarbonate excretion in the biliary epithelium.",

The study was performed in 3\u2010week\u2010old bile duct\u2013ligated (BDL) rats, BDL rats treated with the antiestrogens, tamoxifen or Ici 182,780, and normal control rats. Proliferation was also evaluated in normal purified cholangiocytes treated with 17\u03b2 estradiol in the presence or absence of tamoxifen, Ici 182,780, ERK, or Src inhibitors. After bile duct ligation, cholangiocyte proliferation was associated with a marked immunohistochemical nuclear positivity for phosphorylated (p)\u2010ERK1/2, which was inhibited by in vivo treatment with tamoxifen or Ici 182,780. Protein expression of total and p\u2010ERK1/2, and Shc in cholangiocytes isolated from BDL rats was markedly increased compared with controls and was inhibited by in vivo treatment with antiestrogens. In vitro, 17\u03b2 estradiol\u2013induced proliferation of isolated normal cholangiocyte was associated with increased (P < .01) protein expression of p\u2010ERK1/2, Src, and Shc. Specific inhibitors of ER (Ici 182,780), ERK (U0125), and Src (PP2) inhibited in vitro 17\u03b2 estradiol\u2013induced cholangiocyte proliferation. In conclusion, this study showed that estrogens induced cholangiocyte proliferation by activating the Src/Shc/ERK pathway. This might suggest that pharmacologic modulation of ER, ERK, and/or Src could be proposed for the treatment of human pathology characterized by dysregulation of cholangiocyte proliferation.",

In vitro, the effect of NGF on cholangiocyte proliferation and signal transduction was investigated by immunoblotting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), phosphorylated c-jun-N-terminal kinase, and phosphorylated p38. In vivo, rats that had undergone bile duct ligation (BDL) were treated with an anti-NGF antibody to immunoneutralize NGF and bile duct mass, proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation were investigated by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNGF and its TrkA receptor were expressed by normal rat cholangiocytes and up-regulated following BDL. Cholangiocytes secrete NGF, and secretion is increased in proliferating BDL cholangiocytes. In vitro, NGF stimulated cholangiocyte proliferation, which was associated with enhanced p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 expression. NGF proliferation in vitro was partially blocked by the MEK inhibitor (UO126) and completely ablated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin). In vitro, NGF and estrogens have an additive effect on cholangiocyte proliferation by acting on phosphorylated TrkA and p-ERK1/2. In vivo, immunoneutralization of NGF decreased bile duct mass in BDL rats, which was associated with depressed proliferation and enhanced apoptosis and with increased portal inflammation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCholangiocytes secrete NGF and express NGF receptors.

        "abstract": "The scientific framework concerning estrogen effects on different tissues has expanded enormously during the last decades, when estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes were identified. Estrogens are not only essential for the female reproductive system, but they also control fundamental functions in other tissues including the cardiovascular system, bone, brain and liver. Recently, estrogens have been shown to target the biliary tree, where they modulate the proliferative and secretory activities of cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells lining bile ducts. By acting on both estrogen receptors (ER-alpha) and (ER-beta) subtypes, and by activating either genomic or non-genomic pathways, estrogens play a key role in the complex loop of growth factors and cytokines, which modulates the proliferative response of cholangiocytes to damage. Specifically, estrogens activate intracellular signalling cascades [ERK(1/2) (extracellular regulated kinases (1/2), PI3- kinase/AKT (phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase/AKT)] typical of growth factors such as insulin like growth factor (IGF1), nerve growth factor (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus potentiating their action. In addition, estrogens stimulate the secretion of different growth factors in proliferating cholangiocytes. This review specifically deals with the recent advances related to the role and mechanisms by which estrogens modulate cholangiocyte functions in normal and pathological conditions.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease where lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines that accelerate its initiation and progression. Estrogen has been proven to be vasoprotective against atherosclerosis; however, the anti-inflammatory function of estrogen in the vascular system remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effect of estrogen on LPS-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; listed as CCL2 in the MGI database) production in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). LPS significantly enhances MCP-1 production and this is dependent on nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling, since the use of NFkappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or the silencing of NFkappaB subunit p65 expression with specific siRNA largely impairs LPS-enhanced MCP-1 production. On the contrary, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) inhibits LPS-induced MCP-1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which is related to the suppression of p65 translocation to nucleus. Furthermore, p38 MAPK is rapidly activated in response to LPS, while E(2) markedly inhibits p38 MAPK activation. Transfection with p38 MAPK siRNA or the use of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 markedly attenuates LPS-stimulated p65 translocation to nucleus and MCP-1 production, suggesting that E(2) suppresses NFkappaB signaling by the inactivation of p38 MAPK signaling. LPS promotes VSMCs migration and this is abrogated by MCP-1 antibody, implying that MCP-1 may play a major role as an autocrine factor in atherosclerosis. In addition, E(2) inhibits LPS-promoted cell migration by downregulation of MCP-1 production. Overall, our results demonstrate that E(2) exerts anti-inflammatory property antagonistic to LPS in VSMCs by reducing MCP-1 production, and this effect is related to the inhibition of p38 MAPK/NFkappaB cascade.",

        "abstract": "Clinical observations and basic studies show that progesterone and progestins have a variable influence on endothelial function. Dydrogesterone (DG) is a widely used progestin, but its endothelial actions have not been thoroughly assessed. In this study, we investigated the effects of DG and its metabolite 20-\u03b1-dihydro-dydrogesterone (DHD), natural progesterone as well as medroxyprogesterone acetate, on the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells using an in vitro experimental endothelial inflammation system. Our findings show that all progestins significantly suppress endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) induced by bacterial lypopolysaccharide (LPS). These inhibitory effects of DG and DHD require activation of progesterone receptor. DG and DHD decrease adhesion molecule expression associated with LPS administration by preventing nuclear translocation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB. In addition, DG and DHD do not alter the anti-inflammatory effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol. In conclusion, DG and DHD decrease endothelial inflammatory responses induced by LPS, via reduced expression of the pro-atherogenic adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. These actions may be relevant for the vascular effects of DG.",

Although estrogens inhibit atherosclerosis development, effects of coadministered progestogen remain controversial.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe examined the effects of progestogen on cytokine-stimulated human umbilical venous endothelial cell (HUVEC) expression of adhesion molecules.\n\n\nDESIGN\nIn HUVECs, adhesion molecule mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. Protein expression was quantified by immunocytochemistry and ELISAs. To mimic the monocyte adherence to endothelial cells, we used a flow chamber system to assess progestogen effects on U937 monocytoid cell adherence to HUVEC monolayers. We also examined the suppression effects of adhesion molecules with small interference RNAs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nmRNA levels of adhesion molecules in HUVECs treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or 17\u03b2-estradiol + MPA were 1.7- to 2.5-fold higher than those in the control. MPA increased the protein expression of E-selectin, P-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 compared with that for the control (83.0 \u00b1 0.7, 34.8 \u00b1 1.2, and 5.4 \u00b1 0.0 ng/mL, respectively), whereas other progestogens or 17\u03b2-estradiol additive to progestogens did not significantly change expression. MPA significantly increased U937 monocytoid cell adherence compared with the control (56.0 \u00b1 1.5 vs 46.5 \u00b1 3.5 adherent cells per 10 fields) but did not increase adherence to HUVECs with knocked down intercellular adhesion molecule-1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMPA increases cell adhesion molecule expression on HUVECs, causing increased numbers of monocytoid cells to adhere to HUVECs. These MPA effects may be a risk factor for atherogenesis on endothelial cells in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy.",

Specifically, emodin significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT, and enhanced the phosphorylation of MAPK pathways. Furthermore, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was up-regulated in KLE cells upon treatment with emodin, while the anti-oxidant agent N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can inhibit emodin-induced apoptosis and promote the activation of AKT and Bcl-2.

Sulforaphane reduced viability of endometrial cancer cell lines in association with the G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell division cycle protein 2 (Cdc2) phosphorylation, and intrinsic apoptosis. Inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and migration of the cell lines was associated with sulforaphane-induced alterations in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin and vimentin expression. Proteomic analysis identified alterations in AKT, mTOR, and ERK kinases in the networks of sulforaphane effects in the Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line. Western blots confirmed sulforaphane inhibition of AKT, mTOR, and induction of ERK with alterations in downstream signaling. AKT and mTOR inhibitors reduced endometrial cancer cell line viability and prevented further reduction by sulforaphane.

        "title": "The Impact of Oxidative Stress and AKT Pathway on Cancer Cell Functions and Its Application to Natural Products",
        "abstract": "Oxidative stress and AKT serine-threonine kinase (AKT) are responsible for regulating several cell functions of cancer cells. Several natural products modulate both oxidative stress and AKT for anticancer effects. However, the impact of natural product-modulating oxidative stress and AKT on cell functions lacks systemic understanding. Notably, the contribution of regulating cell functions by AKT downstream effectors is not yet well integrated. This review explores the role of oxidative stress and AKT pathway (AKT/AKT effectors) on ten cell functions, including apoptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial morphogenesis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, DNA damage response, senescence, migration, and cell-cycle progression. The impact of oxidative stress and AKT are connected to these cell functions through cell function mediators. Moreover, the AKT effectors related to cell functions are integrated. Based on this rationale, natural products with the modulating abilities for oxidative stress and AKT pathway exhibit the potential to regulate these cell functions, but some were rarely reported, particularly for AKT effectors. This review sheds light on understanding the roles of oxidative stress and AKT pathway in regulating cell functions, providing future directions for natural products in cancer treatment.",

        "title": "The Essential Oil from Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist (Asteraceae) Exerts an In Vitro Antimelanoma Effect by Inducing Apoptosis and Modulating the MAPKs, NF-\u03baB, and PKB/AKT Signaling Pathways",
        "abstract": "The characterization and cytotoxicity of the essential oil from Conyza bonariensis (L.) aerial parts (CBEO) were previously conducted. The major compound was (Z)-2-lachnophyllum ester (EZ), and CBEO exhibited significant ROS-dependent cytotoxicity in the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28. Herein, we employed the Molegro Virtual Docker v.6.0.1 software to investigate the interactions between the EZ and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and the Protein Kinase B (PKB/AKT). Additionally, in vitro assays were performed in SK-MEL-28 cells to assess the effect of CBEO on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and these signaling pathways by flow cytometry and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using MAPKs inhibitors. CBEO induced a significant increase in the sub-G1 peak, as well as biochemical and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. The in-silico results indicated that EZ interacts with Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1 (ERK1), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase 1 (JNK1), p38\u03b1 MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and PKB/AKT. Moreover, CBEO modulated the ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and PKB/AKT activities in SK-MEL-28 cells. Furthermore, CBEO\u2019s cytotoxicity against SK-MEL-28 cells was significantly altered in the presence of MAPKs inhibitors. These findings support the in vitro antimelanoma effect of CBEO through apoptosis induction, and the modulation of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and PKB/AKT activities.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer remains a significant cause of mortality worldwide. A spiro-acridine derivative, (E)-1\u2032-((4-bromobenzylidene)amino)-5\u2032-oxo-1\u2032,5\u2032-dihydro-10H-spiro[acridine-9,2\u2032-pyrrole]-4\u2032-carbonitrile (AMTAC-19), showed significant cytotoxicity in HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 = 10.35 \u00b1 1.66 \u00b5M) and antioxidant effects after 48 h of treatment. In this study, Molegro Virtual Docker v.6.0.1 software was used to investigate the interactions between AMTAC-19 and the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1 (ERK1), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase 1 (JNK1), and p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase \u03b1 (p38\u03b1 MAPK). In vitro assays were conducted in HCT-116 cells to evaluate the effect of AMTAC-19 on the modulation of these proteins\u2019 activities using flow cytometry. Furthermore, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in the presence or absence of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK inhibitors was used to evaluate the involvement of these enzymes in AMTAC-19 cytotoxicity. ROS production was assessed using the 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay at various incubation times (30 min, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h), and the MTT assay using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was performed. In silico results indicated that AMTAC-19 interacts with ERK1, JNK1, and p38\u03b1 MAPK. Additionally, AMTAC-19 activated ERK1/2 and JNK1 in HCT-116 cells, and its cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in the presence of ERK1/2 and JNK inhibitors. AMTAC-19 also induced a significant increase in ROS production (30 min and 1 h), while NAC pretreatment reduced its cytotoxicity. These findings support AMTAC-19\u2032s in vitro antitumor effect through ROS-dependent activation of ERK and JNK pathways.",
