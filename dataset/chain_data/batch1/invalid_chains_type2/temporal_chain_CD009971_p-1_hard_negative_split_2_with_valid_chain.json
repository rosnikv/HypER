        "abstract": "Statin therapy is well established for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins may also reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity via a pleiotropic (non\u2013lipid-lowering) effect. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to determine the influence of statin treatment on adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac, vascular, or noncardiovascular surgery. Two independent authors abstracted data from 12 retrospective and 3 prospective trials (n = 223,010 patients). A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the overall effect of preoperative statin therapy on postoperative outcomes. Preoperative statin therapy was associated with 38% and 59% reduction in the risk of mortality after cardiac (1.9% vs. 3.1%; P = 0.0001) and vascular (1.7% vs. 6.1%; P = 0.0001) surgery, respectively. When including noncardiac surgery, a 44% reduction in mortality (2.2% vs. 3.2%; P = 0.0001) was observed. Preoperative statin therapy may reduce postoperative mortality in patients undergoing surgical procedures. However, the statin associated effects on postoperative cardiovascular morbidity are too variable to draw any conclusion.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nTo determine the strength of evidence for preoperative statin use for prevention of adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAfter literature search in major databases, 19 studies were identified [three RCT (randomized prospective clinical trials), 16 observational] that reported outcomes of 31 725 cardiac surgery patients with (n = 17 201; 54%) or without (n = 14 524; 46%) preoperative statin therapy. Outcomes that were analysed included early all-cause mortality (30-day mortality), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke and renal failure. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported using fixed or random effect models and publication bias was assessed. Preoperative statin therapy resulted in a 1.5% absolute risk reduction (2.2 vs. 3.7%; P < 0.0001) and 43% odds reduction for early all-cause mortality (OR 0.57; 95%CI: 0.49-0.67). A significant reduction (P < 0.01) in statin pretreated patients was also observed for AF (24.9 vs. 29.3%; OR 0.67, 95%CI: 0.51-0.88), stroke (2.1 vs. 2.9%, OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.60-0.91), but not for MI (OR 1.11; 95%CI: 0.93-1.33) or renal failure (OR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.46-1.31).

Early postoperative statin use was defined as statin treatment within the first postoperative day. Statin withdrawal was defined as the discontinuation of preoperative statin treatment before surgery until at least postoperative day 2. Logistic regression and propensity score modeling were used to control for AKI risk factors. Sixty-eight of 324 patients (21.0%) developed AKI. AKI patients stayed in the hospital longer (p = 0.03) and were more likely to develop pneumonia (p = 0.002) or die (p = 0.001). A higher body mass index (p = 0.003), higher central venous pressure (p = 0.03), and statin withdrawal (27.4 v 14.7%, p = 0.046) were associated with a higher incidence of AKI, whereas early postoperative statin use was protective (12.5% v 23.8%, p = 0.03). Preoperative statin use did not affect the risk of AKI. In multivariate logistic regression, age (p = 0.03), male sex (p = 0.02), body mass index (p < 0.001), and early postoperative statin use (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.72; p = 0.006) independently predicted AKI. Propensity score-adjusted risk assessment confirmed the association between early postoperative statin use and reduced AKI (odds ratio = 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.70; p = 0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly postoperative statin use is associated with a lower incidence of AKI among both chronic statin users and statin-naive cardiac surgery patients.",

        "abstract": "One of the most common health problems are diseases of the cardiovascular system with a great bulk of disease burden; while a considerable number of cardiac patients undergo cardiac surgery; cardiac surgical procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are nowadays among the top list of surgical procedures. More than half of a century has passed since the introduction of total cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). One of the main untoward effects of CPB is systemic inflammation; causing an \u201cacute phase reaction\u201d responsible for the production of other unwanted postoperative complications. The humoral and cellular components of the immune system are among the main parts of these compensatory mechanisms. There are a number of therapeutic agents used to suppress this inflammatory process. Since CPB is composed of a multitude of items, there are many studies assessing the possible methods and therapeutics for prevention or treatment of inflammation in patients undergoing CPB. According to a conventional classification, the anti-inflammatory methods are classified as either pharmacologic strategies or technical strategies. The pharmacologic strategies are those with the usage of one or more therapeutic agents; while the technical strategies are those that try to modify the CPB techniques. However, in this manuscript, the main pharmacological strategies are discussed.",

        "title": "Acute Effect of Intravenous Administration of Magnesium Sulfate on Serum Levels of Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Bypass Graft With Cardiopulmonary Bypass",
        "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular problems are among the most common health issues. A considerable number of cardiac patients undergo cardiac surgery, and coronary artery disease patients constitute about two-thirds of all these surgeries. The application of cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) usually results in some untoward effects. Objectives: Studies have suggested magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as an anti-inflammatory agent in a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). This study aimed to assess the effect of an IV MgSO4 infusion during elective CABG (with CBP) on the blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Materials and Methods: During a 12 month period, after review board approval and based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 90 patients were selected and entered randomly into one of the two study groups (MgSO4 or placebo). Anesthesia, surgery and CBP were performed in exactly the same way, except for the use of MgSO4 or a placebo. Both preoperative and postoperative plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were checked and compared between the two groups using an ELISA. Results: There was no difference found between the two groups with regard to; gender, basic variables, Ejection Fraction (EF), CBP time and aortic cross-clamp time. The preoperative levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were not different; however, their postoperative levels were significantly higher in the placebo group (P value = 0.01 for IL-6 and 0.005 for TNF-\u03b1). Conclusions: This study showed that MgSO4 infusion could suppress part of the inflammatory response after CABG with CBP. This was demonstrated by decreased levels of interleukin-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in postoperative serum levels in elective CABG with CBP.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nOpioid analgesics are a mainstay for acute pain management, but postoperative opioid administration has risks. We examined the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs) in a previously opioid-free surgical population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective, observational, cohort study using administrative, billing, clinical, and medication administration data from two hospitals. Data were collected for all adult patients who were opioid-free at admission, underwent surgery between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2016, and received postoperative opioids. Potential ORADEs were determined based on inpatient billing codes or postoperative administration of naloxone. We determined independent predictors of ORADE development using multivariable logistic regression. We measured adjusted inpatient mortality, hospital costs, length of hospital stay, discharge destination, and readmission within 30 days for patients with and without ORADEs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 13,389 hospitalizations where opioid-free patients had a single qualifying surgery, 12,218 (91%) received postoperative opioids and comprised the study cohort. Of these, we identified 1111 (9.1%) with a potential ORADE. Independent predictors of ORADEs included older age, several markers of disease severity, longer surgeries, and concurrent benzodiazepine use. Opioid-related adverse drug events were strongly associated with the route and duration of opioids administered postoperatively: 18% increased odds per day on intravenous opioids. In analyses adjusted for several covariates, presence of an ORADE was associated with 29% higher costs of hospitalization, 55% longer postoperative length of stay, 29% lower odds of discharge home, and 2.9 times the odds of death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrate a high rate and severe consequences of potential ORADEs in previously opioid-free patients receiving postoperative opioids. Knowledge of risk factors and predictors of ORADEs can help develop targeted interventions to minimize the development of these potentially dangerous and costly events.",

        "abstract": "Given the rising rate of opioid-related adverse drug events during postsurgical pain management, a nonpharmacologic therapy that could decrease analgesic medication requirements would be of immense value. We designed a prospective, placebo-and-randomized controlled trial to assess the clinical effect of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TEAS) on the postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) requirement for morphine, as well as side effects and recovery profile after inguinal hernia repair. Seventy-one subjects undergoing inguinal hernia repair with a standardized anesthetic technique were randomly assigned to one of three analgesic treatment regimens: PCA + TEAS (n = 24); PCA + sham-TEAS (no electrical stimulation) (n = 24), and PCA only (n = 23). The postoperative PCA requirement, pain scores, opioid-related side effects, and blood cortisol levels were recorded. TEAS treatment resulted in a twofold decrease in the analgesic requirement and decreased pain level reported by the patients. In addition, a significant reduction of cortisol level was reported in the TEAS group at 24 h postoperatively compared to the sham and control groups. We conclude that TEAS is a safe and effective option for reducing analgesic consumption and postoperative pain following inguinal hernia repair.",

        "abstract": "Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is an emerging therapeutic approach that combines the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with acupuncture point stimulation. Due to its noninvasive nature, it possesses relative advantages over traditional acupuncture and needle-based electrostimulation. Despite the large number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) describing the effectiveness of TEAS in different applications, its role and mechanism are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to systematically compare and summarize the latest studies examining a variety of TEAS applications in clinical practice. Databases, including Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched without any time restrictions (as of March 2021). The analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria. Out of 637 studies, only 22 RCTs were selected. Nine studies evaluated the impact of TEAS on nausea and vomiting (NV), showing beneficial effects compared to standard therapy. Eight RCTs examined the effectiveness of TEAS in pain management, reporting pain alleviation described using the visual analog scale (VAS) and lowering of total opioid doses. Improvement of postoperative recovery, in vitro fertilization and pregnancy outcomes, as well as display of cardioprotective properties were found to positively correlate with TEAS. As a noninvasive modality with advantages over classical acupuncture and needle-based electrostimulation, TEAS may be a valuable tool in clinical practice, particularly for pain and NV management. However, considering the methodological quality of the RCTs, rigorous large-scale clinical trials are required to evaluate the clinical utility of this method.",

        "abstract": "This study was to explore whether transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) treatment could mediate inflammation, apoptosis, and pyroptosis of neuronal cells and microglia activation through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway in the early stage of ischemic stroke. TEAS treatment at Baihui (GV20) and Hegu (LI4) acupoints of the affected limb was administered at 24, 48, and 72 h following middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R), with lasting for 30 min each time. Neurological impairment scores were assessed 2 h and 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). TTC staining was used to evaluate the volume of brain infarction. The histopathologic changes of hippocampus were detected by H&E staining. WB analysis was performed to assess the levels of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF-\u03baB p65/NF-\u03baB p65, and inflammation, apoptosis, pyroptosis-related proteins. TLR4 expression was measured using immunohistochemistry. The expression of inflammation-related proteins was also measured using ELISA. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression level of Iba1. Our findings demonstrated that TEAS intervention after I/R improved neurological function, reduced the volume of brain infarction, and mitigated pathological damage. Moreover, TEAS reduced the levels of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF-\u03baB p65/NF-\u03baB p65, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, Bax, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1/pro caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, GSDMD, and Iba1 while enhancing Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, the protective effects of TEAS could be counteracted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 agonist). In conclusion, TEAS can reduce cerebral damage and suppress inflammation, cell death, and microglia activation after ischemic stroke via inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway.",
