        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on inspiratory muscle function (IMF), diaphragm thickness, lung function, physical work capacity (PWC), and psychosocial status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwenty-nine adult patients with CF were randomly assigned to three groups. Two groups were required to complete an 8-week program of IMT in which the training intensity was set at either 80% of maximal effort (group 1; 9 patients) or 20% of maximal effort (group 2; 10 patients). A third group of patients did not participate in any form of training and acted as a control group (group 3; 10 patients).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nIn all patients, baseline and postintervention measures of IMF were determined by maximal inspiratory pressure (Pimax), and sustained Pimax (SPimax); pulmonary function, body composition, and physical activity status were also determined. In addition, diaphragm thickness was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) [TDIcont], and the diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) was calculated (TR = thickness during Pimax at FRC/mean thickness at FRC). Subjects also completed an incremental cycle ergometer test to exhaustion and two symptom-related questionnaires, prior to and following training.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing training, significant increases in Pimax and SPimax (p < 0.05), TDIcont (p < 0.05), TR (p < 0.05), vital capacity (p < 0.05), TLC (p < 0.05), and PWC (p < 0.05) were identified, and decreases in anxiety scores (p < 0.05) and depression scores (p < 0.01) were noted in group 1 patients compared to group 3 patients. Group 2 patients significantly improved Pimax and SPimax (both p < 0.05) only with respect to group 3 patients. No significant differences were observed in group 3 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn 8-week program of high-intensity IMT resulted in significant benefits for CF patients, which included increased IMF and thickness of the diaphragm (during contraction), improved lung volumes, increased PWC, and improved psychosocial status.",

        "abstract": "Romer LM, Polkey MI. Exercise-induced respiratory muscle fatigue: implications for performance. J Appl Physiol 104: 879\u2013888, 2008. First published December 20, 2007; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01157.2007.\u2014It is commonly held that the respiratory system has ample capacity relative to the demand for maximal O2 and CO2 transport in healthy humans exercising near sea level. However, this situation may not apply during heavy-intensity, sustained exercise where exercise may encroach on the capacity of the respiratory system. Nerve stimulation techniques have provided objective evidence that the diaphragm and abdominal muscles are susceptible to fatigue with heavy, sustained exercise. The fatigue appears to be due to elevated levels of respiratory muscle work combined with an increased competition for blood flow with limb locomotor muscles. When respiratory muscles are prefatigued using voluntary respiratory maneuvers, time to exhaustion during subsequent exercise is decreased. Partially unloading the respiratory muscles during heavy exercise using low-density gas mixtures or mechanical ventilation can prevent exercise-induced diaphragm fatigue and increase exercise time to exhaustion. Collectively, these findings suggest that respiratory muscle fatigue may be involved in limiting exercise tolerance or that other factors, including alterations in the sensation of dyspnea or mechanical load, may be important. The major consequence of respiratory muscle fatigue is an increased sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow to working skeletal muscle through a respiratory muscle metaboreflex, thereby reducing limb blood flow and increasing the severity of exerciseinduced locomotor muscle fatigue. An increase in limb locomotor muscle fatigue may play a pivotal role in determining exercise tolerance through a direct effect on muscle force output and a feedback effect on effort perception, causing reduced motor output to the working limb muscles.",

        "title": "Intercostal muscle blood flow limitation in athletes during maximal exercise",
        "abstract": "We investigated whether, during maximal exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow is as high as during resting hyperpnoea at the same work of breathing. We hypothesized that during exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow would be limited by competition from the locomotor muscles. Intercostal (probe over the 7th intercostal space) and vastus lateralis muscle perfusion were measured simultaneously in ten trained cyclists by near\u2010infrared spectroscopy using indocyanine green dye. Measurements were made at several exercise intensities up to maximal (WRmax) and subsequently during resting isocapnic hyperpnoea at minute ventilation levels up to those at WRmax. During resting hyperpnoea, intercostal muscle blood flow increased linearly with the work of breathing (R2= 0.94) to 73.0 \u00b1 8.8 ml min\u22121 (100 g)\u22121 at the ventilation seen at WRmax (work of breathing \u223c550\u2013600 J min\u22121), but during exercise it peaked at 80% WRmax (53.4 \u00b1 10.3 ml min\u22121 (100 g)\u22121), significantly falling to 24.7 \u00b1 5.3 ml min\u22121 (100 g)\u22121 at WRmax. At maximal ventilation intercostal muscle vascular conductance was significantly lower during exercise (0.22 \u00b1 0.05 ml min\u22121 (100 g)\u22121 mmHg\u22121) compared to isocapnic hyperpnoea (0.77 \u00b1 0.13 ml min\u22121 (100 g)\u22121 mmHg\u22121). During exercise, both cardiac output and vastus lateralis muscle blood flow also plateaued at about 80% WRmax (the latter at 95.4 \u00b1 11.8 ml min\u22121 (100 g)\u22121). In conclusion, during exercise above 80% WRmax in trained subjects, intercostal muscle blood flow and vascular conductance are less than during resting hyperpnoea at the same minute ventilation. This suggests that the circulatory system is unable to meet the demands of both locomotor and intercostal muscles during heavy exercise, requiring greater O2 extraction and likely contributing to respiratory muscle fatigue.",

        "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) patients have a reduced cardiac reserve and increased work of breathing. Increased locomotor muscle blood flow demand may result in competition between respiratory and locomotor vascular beds. We hypothesized that HF patients would demonstrate improved locomotor blood flow with respiratory muscle unloading during activity. Ten patients (ejection fraction = 31 \u00b1 3%) and 10 controls (CTL) underwent two cycling sessions (60% peak work). Session 1 (S1): 5 min of normal breathing (NB), 5 min respiratory muscle unloading with a ventilator, and 5 min of NB. Session 2 (S2): 5 min NB, 5 min of respiratory muscle loading with inspiratory resistance, and 5 min of NB. Measurements included: leg blood flow (LBF, thermodilution), cardiac output , and oesophageal pressure (Ppl, index of pleural pressure). S1: Ppl was reduced in both groups (HF: 73 \u00b1 8%; CTL: 60 \u00b1 13%, P < 0.01). HF: increased (9.6 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 11.3 \u00b1 0.8 l min\u22121, P < 0.05) and LBF increased (4.8 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 7.3 \u00b1 1.1 l min\u22121, P < 0.01); CTL: no changes in (14.7 \u00b1 1.0 vs. 14.8 \u00b1 1.6 l min\u22121) or LBF (10.9 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 10.3 \u00b1 1.7 l min\u22121). S2: Ppl increased in both groups (HF: 172 \u00b1 16%, CTL: 220 \u00b1 40%, P < 0.01). HF: no change was observed in (10.0 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 10.3 \u00b1 0.8 l min\u22121) or LBF (5.0 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 4.7 \u00b1 0.5 l min\u22121); CTL: increased (15.4 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 16.9 \u00b1 1.5 l min\u22121, P < 0.01) and LBF remained unchanged (10.7 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 10.3 \u00b1 1.8 l min\u22121). These data suggest HF patients preferentially steal blood flow from locomotor muscles to accommodate the work of breathing during activity. Further, HF patients are unable to vasoconstrict locomotor vascular beds beyond NB when presented with a respiratory load.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory muscle training (RMT) improves functional capacity in chronic heart-failure (HF) patients, but the basis for this improvement remains unclear. We evaluate the effects of RMT on the hemodynamic and autonomic function, arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and respiratory mechanics in rats with HF. Rats were assigned to one of four groups: sedentary sham (n = 8), trained sham (n = 8), sedentary HF (n = 8), or trained HF (n = 8). Trained animals underwent a RMT protocol (30 min/day, 5 day/wk, 6 wk of breathing through a resistor), whereas sedentary animals did not. In HF rats, RMT had significant effects on several parameters. It reduced left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (P < 0.01), increased LV systolic pressure (P < 0.01), and reduced right ventricular hypertrophy (P < 0.01) and pulmonary (P < 0.001) and hepatic (P < 0.001) congestion. It also decreased resting heart rate (HR; P < 0.05), indicating a decrease in the sympathetic and an increase in the vagal modulation of HR. There was also an increase in baroreflex gain (P < 0.05). The respiratory system resistance was reduced (P < 0.001), which was associated with the reduction in tissue resistance after RMT (P < 0.01). The respiratory system and tissue elastance (Est) were also reduced by RMT (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Additionally, the quasistatic Est was reduced after RMT (P < 0.01). These findings show that a 6-wk RMT protocol in HF rats promotes an improvement in hemodynamic function, sympathetic and vagal heart modulation, arterial BRS, and respiratory mechanics, all of which are benefits associated with improvements in cardiopulmonary interaction.",

However, whether different inspiratory resistive loading intensities can influence autonomic heart rate (HR) modulation remains unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective was to investigate HR modulation at three different inspiratory resistive loading intensities in healthy elderly men.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study that evaluated 25 healthy elderly men. Cardiac autonomic modulation was assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) indices. All of the volunteers underwent maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measurements according to standardized pulmonary function measurements. Three randomly-applied inspiratory resistive loading (30, 60 and 80% of MIP) intensities were then applied using an inspiratory resistance device (POWERbreathe, Southam, UK), during which the volunteers were asked to inhale for 2 seconds and exhale for 3 seconds and complete 12 breaths per minute.

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate heart rate variability during an inspiratory muscle endurance protocol at three different load levels [30%, 60% and 80% of maximal inspiratory pressure], in patients who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: Nineteen late postoperative myocardial revascularization patients participating in a cardiovascular rehabilitation program were studied. Maximal inspiratory pressure maneuvers were performed. An inspiratory muscle endurance protocol at 30%, 60% and 80% of maximal inspiratory pressure was applied for four minutes each, in random order. Heart rate and RR intervals were recorded and heart rate variability was analyzed by time (RMSSD-the mean of the standard deviations for all R-R intervals, and RMSM-root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals) and frequency domains indices (high and low frequency) in normalized units. ANOVA for repeated measurements was used to compare heart rate variability indices and Student t-test was used to compare the maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure values. Results: Heart rate increased during performance of maximal respiratory pressures maneuvers, and the maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure mean values were significantly lower than predicted values (P<0.05). RMSSD increased significantly at 80% in relation to rest and 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure and RMSM decreased at 30% and 60% of maximal inspiratory pressure in relation to rest (P<0.05). Additionally, there was significant and progressive decrease in low frequency and increase in high frequency at 30%, 60% and 80% of maximal inspiratory pressure in relation to the resting condition. Conclusion: These results suggest that respiratory muscle training at high intensities can promote greater parasympathetic activity and it may confer important benefits during a rehabilitation program in post-coronary artery bypass grafting.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting multiple sensorimotor and cognitive systems. The Pink1\u2212/\u2212 rat model exhibits vocal, cognitive, and limb use deficits seen in idiopathic PD. We sought to measure glucose metabolism in brain regions in Pink1\u2212/\u2212 and wild type (WT) rats, and to associate these to measures of ultrasonic vocalization, cognition, and limb use behavior. Methods Pink1\u2212/\u2212 (n\u2009=\u200912) and WT (n\u2009=\u200914) rats were imaged by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in a repeated measures design at approximately 10\u2009months of age and 6\u2009weeks later. Relative regional glucose metabolism was indexed by whole brain normalized FDG uptake, which was calculated for 18 regions identified a priori for comparison. Behavioral measures included tests of communication via ultrasonic vocalization, cognition with 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Test (5-CSRTT), and limb use with Cylinder Test and Challenge Beam. Results Relative glucose metabolism was significantly different in Pink1\u2212/\u2212 rats in prelimbic area, striatum, nucleus ambiguus, globus pallidus, and posterior parietal association cortex compared to WT controls. For behavioral measures, Pink1\u2212/\u2212 rats demonstrated quieter vocalizations with a restricted frequency range, and they showed increased number of foot-faults and hindlimb steps (shuffling) in limb motor tests. Significant behavior vs. brain correlations included associations of ultrasonic vocalization parameters with glucose metabolism indices in locus coeruleus and substantia nigra. Conclusion FDG PET reveals abnormalities in relative regional brain glucose metabolism in Pink1\u2212/\u2212 rats in brain regions that are important to cognition, vocalization, and limb motor control that are also impacted by Parkinson disease. This method may be useful for mechanistic studies of behavioral deficits and therapeutic interventions in translational studies in the Pink1\u2212/\u2212 PD model.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it explores the neurodegenerative condition of Parkinson's disease, which is also the focus of the source paper. The study uses a rat model to investigate glucose metabolism in brain regions, which is related to the respiratory and voice impairments discussed in the source paper."
