        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor peptide derived from the endothelium. We evaluated the contribution of endothelin to blood-pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension by studying the effect of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 293 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute reduction of 5.7 mm Hg at each dose), which was similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to elevated blood pressure in such patients. The favorable effect of treatment with bosentan on blood pressure occurred without reflexive neurohormonal activation.",

        "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that endothelin-1 plays an important role in vascular pathophysiology. Our objective was to examine whether molecular variations at the endothelin-1 locus were involved in susceptibility to myocardial infarction and variation in blood pressure. The entire coding sequence and 1.4 kb of the 5' flanking region were screened. Five polymorphisms were detected, which were genotyped in the ECTIM (Etude Cas-T\u00e9moin de l'Infarctus du Myocarde) Study, a multicenter study comparing 648 male patients who had survived a myocardial infarction and 760 population-based controls. The polymorphisms were not associated with myocardial infarction, nor did they contribute to blood pressure levels in the population at large. However, a G/T polymorphism predicting an Lys/Asn change (ET1/C198) strongly interacted (P<0.001) with body mass index in the determination of blood pressure levels. There was a steeper increase of blood pressure with body mass index in carriers of the T allele than in GG homozygotes. As a consequence, the T allele was associated with an increase of blood pressure in overweight subjects (body mass index >/=26 kg/m2), while no significant effect was observed in lean subjects (body mass index <26 kg/m2). To determine whether this finding could be replicated, the ET1/C198 was genotyped in the Glasgow Heart Scan Study, a population-based study including 619 men and 663 women. Subjects homozygous for the T allele had higher resting blood pressure levels than others (P<0.05). A similar interaction between the T allele and body mass index was observed on the maximum blood pressure achieved during a treadmill exercise test (P<0.001). In conclusion, results from 2 independent studies suggest that the ET1/C198 polymorphism is associated with blood pressure levels in overweight people.",

        "title": "Obesity is associated with tissue-specific activation of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme in vivo: evidence for a regulatory role of endothelin.",
        "abstract": "In the C57BL/6J mice model, we investigated whether obesity affects the function or expression of components of the tissue renin-angiotensin system and whether endothelin (ET)-1 contributes to these changes. ACE activity (nmol. L His-Leu. mg protein(-1)) was measured in lung, kidney, and liver in control (receiving standard chow) and obese animals treated for 30 weeks with a high-fat, low cholesterol diet alone or in combination with LU135252, an orally active ET(A) receptor antagonist. ACE mRNA expression was measured in the kidney, and the effects of LU135252 on purified human ACE were determined. Aortic and renal tissue ET-1 protein content was measured, and the vascular contractility to angiotensin II was assessed. Obesity was associated with a tissue-specific increase in ACE activity in the kidney (55+/-4 versus 33+/-3 nmol/L) but not in the lung (34+/-2 versus 32+/-2 nmol/L). Long-term LU135252 treatment completely prevented this activation (13.3+/-0.3 versus 55+/-4 nmol/L, P<0.05) independent of ACE mRNA expression, body weight, or renal ET-1 protein but did not affect pulmonary or hepatic ACE activity. Obesity potentiated contractions in response to angiotensin II in the aorta (from 6+/-2% to 33+/-5% KCl) but not in the carotid artery (4+/-1% to 3.6+/-1% KCl), an effect that was completely prevented with LU135252 treatment (6+/-0.4% versus 33+/-5% KCl). No effect of LU135252 on purified ACE was observed. Thus, obesity is associated with the activation of renal ACE in vivo independent of its mRNA expression and enhanced vascular contractility to angiotensin II. These effects are regulated by ET in an organ-specific manner, providing novel mechanisms by which ET antagonists may exert organ protection.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated vascular reactivity in response to acetylcholine, in the presence of acute inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, in the carotid artery and aorta of obese C57Bl6/J mice fed on a high-fat diet for 30 weeks, and of control mice. A subgroup of obese animals was also treated with the ET(A) receptor antagonist darusentan (50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)). In vascular rings from control animals, acetylcholine caused endothelium-dependent contractions in the carotid artery, but not in the aorta. In vascular rings from obese mice, contractility to acetylcholine was also evident in the aorta, and that in the carotid artery was increased compared with control mice. ET(A) receptor blockade by darusentan treatment of the obese mice prevented enhanced vasoconstriction to acetylcholine, resulting in mild vasodilatation. Thus obesity increases endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction in the absence of endothelial nitric oxide. This effect can be completely prevented by chronic ET(A) receptor blockade, suggesting that endothelin modulates increased endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction in obesity.",

        "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been shown to be impaired in obese adults. However, the mechanisms responsible for this impairment are not clear. We determined whether the blunted forearm vasodilator response to acetylcholine with obesity is due, at least in part, to reduced muscarinic receptor responsiveness. Twenty-eight sedentary middle-aged adults were studied: 14 normal weight (BMI, 23.6 \u00b1 0.5 kg/m2) and 14 obese (32.2 \u00b1 0.9 kg/m2). Forearm blood flow (FBF) was determined in response to intraarterial infusion of acetylcholine (8-128 \u03bcg/min) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP: 2.0-8.0 \u03bcg/min). Regardless of the dose, forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine were 25% (P < 0.01) lower in the obese (from 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 to 12.0 \u00b1 0.8 mL/100 mL tissue/min) compared with normal weight (4.4 \u00b1 0.3 to 16.9 \u00b1 1.0 mL/100 mL tissue/min) adults. Of note, forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine plateaued at doses higher than 32 \u03bcg/min in both groups, no further increase in forearm blood flow was observed at either 64 or 128 \u03bcg/min. EC50 for acetylcholine-stimulated vasodilation was not different between the obese (7.8 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcg/min) and normal weight (7.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/min) adults. There were no group differences in the vasodilator response to sodium nitroprusside. These results indicate that the obesity-related impairment in acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in the human forearm is not due to reduced muscarinic receptor responsiveness or sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "This study determined if altered vascular prostacyclin (PGI(2)) and/or thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) production with reduced Po(2) contributes to impaired hypoxic dilation of skeletal muscle resistance arterioles of obese Zucker rats (OZRs) versus lean Zucker rats (LZRs). Mechanical responses were assessed in isolated gracilis muscle arterioles following reductions in Po(2) under control conditions and following pharmacological interventions inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism and nitric oxide synthase and alleviating elevated vascular oxidant stress. The production of arachidonic acid metabolites was assessed using pooled arteries from OZRs and LZRs in response to reduced Po(2). Hypoxic dilation, endothelium-dependent in both strains, was attenuated in OZRs versus LZRs. Nitric oxide synthase inhibition had no significant impact on hypoxic dilation in either strain. Cyclooxygenase inhibition dramatically reduced hypoxic dilation in LZRs and abolished responses in OZRs. Treatment of arterioles from OZRs with polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase improved hypoxic dilation, and this improvement was entirely cyclooxygenase dependent. Vascular PGI(2) production with reduced Po(2) was similar between strains, although TxA(2) production was increased in OZRs, a difference that was attenuated by treatment of vessels from OZRs with polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase. Both blockade of PGH(2)/TxA(2) receptors and inhibition of thromboxane synthase increased hypoxic dilation in OZR arterioles. These results suggest that a contributing mechanism underlying impaired hypoxic dilation of skeletal muscle arterioles of OZRs may be an increased vascular production of TxA(2), which competes against the vasodilator influences of PGI(2). These results also suggest that the elevated vascular oxidant stress inherent in metabolic syndrome may contribute to the increased vascular TxA(2) production and may blunt vascular sensitivity to PGI(2).",

        "abstract": "Previous study suggests that with evolution of the metabolic syndrome, patterns of arteriolar reactivity are profoundly altered and may constrain functional hyperemia. This study investigated interactions between parameters of vascular reactivity at two levels of resistance arterioles in obese Zucker rats (OZR), translating these observations into perfusion regulation for in situ skeletal muscle. Dilation of isolated and in situ resistance arterioles from OZR to acetylcholine, arachidonic acid (AA), and hypoxia (isolated arterioles only) were blunted vs. lean Zucker rats (LZR), although dilation to adenosine was intact. Increased adrenergic tone (phenylephrine) or intralumenal pressure (ILP) impaired dilation in both strains (OZR>LZR). Treatment of OZR arterioles with Tempol (superoxide dismutase mimetic) or SQ-29548 (prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist) improved dilator reactivity under control conditions and with increased ILP, but had minimal effect with increased adrenergic tone. Arteriolar dilation to adenosine was well maintained in both strains under all conditions. For in situ cremasteric arterioles, muscle contraction-induced elevations in metabolic demand elicited arteriolar dilations and hyperemic responses that were blunted in OZR vs. LZR, although distal parallel arterioles were characterized by heterogeneous dilator and perfusion responses. alpha-Adrenoreceptor blockade improved outcomes at rest but had minimal effect with elevated metabolic demand. Treatment with Tempol or SQ-29548 had minimal impact at rest, but lessened distal arteriolar perfusion heterogeneity with increased metabolic demand. In blood-perfused gastrocnemius of OZR, perfusion was constrained primarily by adrenergic tone, while myogenic activation and endothelium-dependent dilation did not appear to contribute significantly to ischemia. These results of this novel, integrated approach suggest that adrenergic tone and metabolic dilation are robust determinants of bulk perfusion to skeletal muscle of OZR, while endothelial dysfunction may more strongly regulate perfusion distribution homogeneity via the impact of oxidant stress and AA metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the metabolic syndrome is associated with impaired skeletal muscle arteriolar function, although integrating observations into a conceptual framework for impaired perfusion in peripheral vascular disease (PVD) has been limited. This study builds on previous work to evaluate in situ arteriolar hemodynamics in cremaster muscle of obese Zucker rats (OZR) to integrate existing knowledge into a greater understanding of impaired skeletal muscle perfusion. In OZR cremaster muscle, perfusion distribution at microvascular bifurcations (\u03b3) was consistently more heterogeneous than in controls. However, while consistent, the underlying mechanistic contributors were spatially divergent as altered adrenergic constriction was the major contributor to altered \u03b3 at proximal microvascular bifurcations, with a steady decay with distance, while endothelial dysfunction was a stronger contributor in distal bifurcations with no discernible role proximally. Using measured values of \u03b3, we found that simulations predict that successive alterations to \u03b3 in OZR caused more heterogeneous perfusion distribution in distal arterioles than in controls, an effect that could only be rectified by combined adrenoreceptor blockade and improvements to endothelial dysfunction. Intravascular (125)I-labeled albumin tracer washout from in situ gastrocnemius muscle of OZR provided independent support for these observations, indicating increased perfusion heterogeneity that was corrected only by combined adrenoreceptor blockade and improved endothelial function. These results suggest that a defining element of PVD in the metabolic syndrome may be an altered \u03b3 at microvascular bifurcations, that its contributors are heterogeneous and spatially distinct, and that interventions to rectify this negative outcome must take a new conceptual framework into account.",

        "abstract": "A key outcome for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a progressive decay in skeletal muscle fatigue resistance with elevated metabolic demand. We have demonstrated that PVD in obese Zucker rats (OZR) is partially due to increased perfusion distribution heterogeneity (\u03b3) at successive microvascular bifurcations, with its cumulative impact being an increasingly heterogeneous distribution of perfusion across terminal arterioles, leading to greater tissue ischemia. To minimize this outcome, a likely compensatory mechanism against increased \u03b3 should be an increased temporal switching at bifurcations to blunt downstream deficits. Using in situ cremaster muscle, we determined that temporal activity was lower in OZR than in LZR, and this difference was present in both proximal (1A\u20102A) and distal (3A\u20104A) arteriolar bifurcations. While adrenoreceptor blockade (phentolamine) improved temporal activity in 1A\u20102A bifurcations in OZR, this was without impact in the distal microcirculation, where only interventions against oxidant stress (TEMPOL) and thromboxane A2 activity (SQ\u201029548) were effective. Analysis of the attractor for \u03b3 indicated that it was elevated in OZR, and also exhibited a reduced range, suggesting that the ability of the microcirculation to respond to any challenge is highly restricted, and may represent the major contributor to the poor muscle performance in OZR.",

We hypothesized that severe trauma leads to a greater increase in lung Kf in obesity due to exacerbated production of and/or vulnerability to oxidative stress. Severe trauma was induced in lean and obese Zucker rats by muscle injury, fibula fracture, and bone component injection to both hindlimbs, with or without 24-h treatments of apocynin, a NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor. Lung wet/dry weight ratios, lung vascular Kf, lung neutrophil counts, lung NOX and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and plasma IL-6 levels were measured 24 h after trauma. In an additional study, lungs were isolated from nontrauma lean and obese rats to determine the acute effect of phenazime methosulfate, a superoxide donor, on pulmonary vascular Kf. After trauma, compared with lean rats, obese rats exhibited greater increases in lung capillary Kf, neutrophil accumulation, NOX and MPO activity, and plasma IL-6. The lung wet/dry weight ratio was increased in obese rats but not in lean rats. Apocynin treatment decreased lung Kf, neutrophil counts, NOX and MPO activities, wet/dry weight ratio, and plasma IL-6 in obese rats. Phenazime methosulfate treatment resulted in a greater increase in lung Kf in nontrauma obese rats compared with nontrauma lean rats.

Local Angiotensin II (AngII) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. However, whether AngII can aggravate diabetic infectious lung injury is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of AngII on the permeability of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in high glucose states in vitro. HPMVECs were divided into five groups: a control group (CON), a high glucose group (HG), an LPS + high glucose group (LH), an LPS + high glucose + AngII group (LHA), and an LPS + high glucose + Losartan group (LHL). The HPMVECs permeability as well as the F-actin levels, cytoskeleton, apoptosis and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were evaluated. Compared to the CON group, the HG, LH and LHA groups had significantly higher cellular permeability, cellular apoptosis and TNF-\u03b1 levels, with more extensive cytoskeletal damage and lower F-actin levels. Additionally, cells in the LHA group exhibited significantly elevated permeability, apoptosis and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations, lower F-actin levels and more extensive cytoskeletal damage than either the LH or HG group. However, compared to the HG or LH group, the LHL group showed significantly lower cellular permeability, cell apoptosis, cytoskeletal damage and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and higher F-actin levels. This study suggests that in a diabetic infectious lung injury cellular model, AngII could aggravate the permeability of HPMVEC via F-actin dynamics and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking the Angiotension II Type 1 Receptor could significantly alleviate the hyperpermeability of HPMVECs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objectives: The high-salt diet (HSD) has been associated with cognitive dysfunction by attacking the cerebral microvasculature, through an adaptive response, initiated in the intestine and mediated by Th17 cells. In the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it has been described that NaCl causes an increase in T cell infiltration in the central nervous system. NaCl also promotes macrophage response and Th17 cell differentiation, worsening the course of the disease. HSD may trigger an activation of the immune system and enhance inflammation. However, certain studies not only do not support this possibility, but support the opposite, as the effect of salt on immune cells may not necessarily be pathogenic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of an over intake of salt in rats with EAE, based on the clinical course, oxidative stress, markers of inflammation and the gut dysbiosis. Methods: 15 Dark Agouti rats were used, which were divided into control group, EAE group and EAE\u2009+\u2009NaCl group. Daily 0.027\u2005g of NaCl dissolved in 300\u2005\u03bcl of H2O was administered through a nasogastric tube for 51 days. Results: NaCl administration produced an improvement in clinical status and a decrease in biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysbiosis. Conclusion: The underlying mechanism by which NaCl causes these effects could involve the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is blocked by high doses of salt.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper involves the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is the main focus of the source paper. However, the paper does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, but rather explores a different aspect of RAAS. Therefore, it is considered partially dependent on the source paper's findings."

        "abstract": "Background Recent studies reported a link between high salt diet (HSD) and clinical exacerbation in mouse models of autoimmune diseases, mainly through the induction of pathogenic Th17 cells and/or HSD-induced dysbiosis. However, the topic remains controversial and not fully understood. Purpose In this study, we investigated the effects of HSD on the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in C57BL/6J mice. Methods and results Unexpectedly, our data showed a significant attenuating effect of HSD on disease severity of native EAU, induced by direct immunization with IRBP peptide. That said, HSD had no effect on EAU disease severity induced by adoptive transfer of semi-purified auto-reactive IRBP-specific T lymphocytes. Accordingly, HSD did not affect IRBP-specific systemic afferent immune response as attested by no HSD-linked changes in T lymphocytes proliferation, cytokine production and Treg proportion. Gut microbiota analysis from cecal samples in na\u00efve and EAU mice demonstrated that HSD affected differentially \u03b1-diversity between groups, whereas \u03b2-diversity was significantly modified in all groups. Unknown Tannerellaceae was the only taxon associated to HSD exposure in all treatment groups. Interestingly, a significantly higher abundance of unknown Gastranaerophilales, with potential anti-inflammatory properties, appeared in HSD-fed native EAU mice, only. Discussion In conclusion, our study suggests a possible impact of HSD on gut microbiota composition and consequently on development and clinical severity of EAU. Further studies are required to investigate the potential beneficial role of Gastranaerophilales in EAU.",
