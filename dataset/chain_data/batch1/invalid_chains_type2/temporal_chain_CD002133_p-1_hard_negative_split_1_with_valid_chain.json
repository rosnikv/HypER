        "title": "A randomized comparison of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe clinical benefit of coronary-artery stenting performed in conjunction with coronary angioplasty is limited by the risk of thrombotic occlusion of the stent as well as hemorrhagic and vascular complications of intensive anticoagulation. We compared antiplatelet therapy with conventional anticoagulant therapy with respect to clinical outcomes 30 days after coronary-artery stenting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter successful placement of Palmaz-Schatz coronary-artery stents, 257 patients were randomly assigned to receive antiplatelet therapy (ticlopidine plus aspirin) and 260 to receive anticoagulant therapy (intravenous heparin, phenprocoumon, and aspirin). The primary cardiac end point was a composite measure reflecting death from cardiac causes or the occurrence of myocardial infarction, aortocoronary bypass surgery, or repeat angioplasty. The primary noncardiac end point comprised death from noncardiac causes, cerebrovascular accident, severe hemorrhage, and peripheral vascular events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy, 1.6 percent reached a primary cardiac end point, as did 6.2 percent of those assigned to anticoagulant therapy (relative risk, 0.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.06 to 0.77). With antiplatelet therapy, there was an 82 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction than in the anticoagulant-therapy group, and a 78 percent lower need for repeat interventions. Occlusion of the stented vessel occurred in 0.8 percent of the antiplatelet-therapy group and in 5.4 percent of the anticoagulant-therapy group (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.62). A primary noncardiac end point was reached by 1.2 percent of the antiplatelet-therapy group and 12.3 percent of the anticoagulant-therapy group (relative risk, 0.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.31). Hemorrhagic complications occurred only in the anticoagulant-therapy group (in 6.5 percent). An 87 percent reduction in the risk of peripheral vascular events was observed with antiplatelet therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with conventional anticoagulant therapy, combined antiplatelet therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents reduces the incidence of both cardiac events and hemorrhagic and vascular complications.",

        "title": "Randomized Comparison of Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel After Intracoronary Stent Implantation in a Broad Patient Population",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014Although clopidogrel is used to prevent subacute stent thrombosis, its safety and efficacy have not been compared with ticlopidine in a randomized manner in the United States. Methods and Results\u2014Patients with successful intracoronary stent implantation were randomly assigned to therapy with ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Loading doses were administered immediately after the procedure, and the drugs were prescribed for 2 weeks. One thousand sixteen patients were enrolled: 522 patients were randomly assigned to ticlopidine therapy and 494 to clopidogrel. High-risk characteristics included recent myocardial infarction in 41.4% of the cases, angiographically evident thrombus in 20.9%, and abrupt or threatened closure in 3.64%. An intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was used in 48.2% of the cases, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 1.43% of these patients. Failure to complete 2 weeks of therapy occurred in 3.64% of the patients treated with ticlopidine and in 1.62% of the patients treated with clopidogrel (P =0.043). Within 30 days, thrombosis of the stent occurred in 1.92% of the patients in the ticlopidine group and in 2.02% of the clopidogrel group (P =0.901). A major adverse cardiac event occurred in 4.60% of patients receiving ticlopidine and in 3.85% of patients receiving clopidogrel (P =0.551). Conclusions\u2014Clopidogrel is better tolerated than ticlopidine during a 2-week regimen after intracoronary stent implantation. Combining either thienopyridine with an intravenous platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitor appears to be safe. When applied to a broad spectrum of patients receiving stent implantation, clopidogrel confers similar protection as ticlopidine against subacute stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nControversy exists regarding the frequency of late stent thrombosis among patients treated with intracoronary stents and the most appropriate duration of treatment with a thienopyridine that is required to prevent this complication.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed the frequency of stent thrombosis and other ischemic events in the Antiplatelet Therapy alone versus Lovenox plus Antiplatelet therapy in patients at increased risk of Stent Thrombosis (ATLAST) trial. In the ATLAST trial, 1102 patients at increased risk of stent thrombosis (ST-elevation myocardial infarction within 48 hours, diffuse distal disease, a large amount of thrombus, acute closure, residual dissection, etc) were randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin (40 or 60 mg given every 12 hours for 14 days) or placebo; all patients received aspirin (325 mg daily) and ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) for only 14 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point, the 30-day combined incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization, was reached in 2.3% of patients (1.8% of patients taking enoxaparin vs 2.7% of patients taking placebo; P =.295). However, during the 15th through 30th days, the frequency of ischemic events was only 0.73%, and only 0.27% (3/1102) of patients had possible stent thrombosis (95% CI 0.06, 0.77).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe frequency of stent thrombosis and other adverse ischemic events in the 15th through 30th days after stent placement in even high-risk stent patients treated with ticlopidine for only 2 weeks is low whether or not enoxaparin is administered.",

        "abstract": "The use of ultrasound for cosmetic surgery has been introduced since the late 1980\u2019s, and the technique and equipment have been improved during the years. Authors experience on 1300 patients since 1994 has proven that the ultrasound assisted liposculpture UAL is a simplified safe procedure. UAL delivers ultrasonic energy directly to deep fat deposits through very tiny incisions in the skin. This technique enhances the current procedure in liposuction by adding ultrasonic waves to break down the magnified and giant fat cells in the deep fat deposits, preserving normal size microscopic fat cells in the superficial subdermal fat layer, which enables smooth results with UAL. This technique shortens the total multi-area operation time to about one hour or less and avoids possible mechanical damage to surrounding tissues. We use the ultrasound assisted liposculpture with tumescent infiltration and UAL thin probes to precise location of deep fat deposits. UAL should not be used as a dry method. Blood vessels, muscle cells, and other small bodily structures remain unharmed by the selected ultrasound wave. Once the ultrasound liquefies the targeted fat area, we use a very gentle suction internally to remove the fat. UAL is particularly useful for areas affected by scar tissue, large areas, or areas with dense fields of fat, but for us UAL is the best method for very fine body reshaping in skinny patients seeking for beautification. It is also popular in the treatment of gynecomastia. The UAL requires more specialized equipment. In the recent years the Vibration Amplification of Sound Energy at Resonance System[14] (VASER) became another method of liposuction using ultrasound and we use it with same atraumatic and aesthetic success in our practice in the last 3 years. Important aspects of patient selection, markings, surgical technique, and postoperative care are outlined.",
