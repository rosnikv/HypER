        "abstract": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are an important class of medication useful in the treatment of hypertension. Several observational studies have suggested an association between CCB therapy and gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Using administrative databases, the authors re\u2010examined in a post\u2010hoc analysis whether the Antihypertensive and Lipid\u2010Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) participants randomized to the CCB amlodipine had a greater risk of hospitalized GI bleeding (a prespecified outcome) compared with those randomized to the diuretic chlorthalidone or the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone did not have a reduced risk for GI bleeding hospitalizations compared with participants randomized to amlodipine (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92\u20131.28). Those randomized to lisinopril were at increased risk of GI bleeding compared with those randomized to chlorthalidone (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00\u20131.36). In a post\u2010hoc comparison, participants assigned to lisinopril therapy had a higher risk of hospitalized GI hemorrhage (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06\u20131.51) vs those assigned to amlodipine. In\u2010study use of atenolol prior to first GI hemorrhage was related to a lower incidence of GI bleeding (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57\u20130.83). Hypertensive patients on amlodipine do not have an increased risk of GI bleeding hospitalizations compared with those taking either chlorthalidone or lisinopril.",

        "abstract": "Objectives This post-trial data linkage analysis was to utilize the data of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) participants linked with their Medicare data to examine the risk of hospitalized and non-hospitalized gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with antihypertensives. Settings ALLHAT was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in a total of 42,418 participants aged \u226555 years with hypertension in 623 North American centers. Data for ALLHAT participants who were aged at \u226565 have been linked with their Medicare claims data. Participants A total of 16,676 patients (4,480 for lisinopril, 4,537 for amlodipine, and 7,659 for chlorthalidone) with complete Medicare claims data were available for the final analysis. Results The cumulative incidences through March 31, 2002 of hospitalized GI bleeding were 5.4%, 5.8% and 5.4% for amlodipine, lisinopril, and chlorthalidone arms, respectively, but were not statistically significant among the 3 arms after adjusting for confounders in Cox regression models. The cumulative incidences of non-hospitalized GI bleeding were also similar across the 3 arms (12.0%, 12.2% and 12.0% for amlodipine, lisinopril, and chlorthalidone, respectively). The increased risk of GI bleeding by age was statistically significant after adjusting for confounders (HR = 1.04 per year, 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.05). Smokers also had a significantly higher risk of having hospitalized GI bleeding (1.45, 1.19\u20131.76). Hispanics, those who used aspirin or atenolol in-trial, had diabetes, more education, and a history of stroke had a significantly lower risk of having GI bleeding than their counterparts. Other factors such as gender, history of CHD, prior antihypertensive use, use of estrogen in women, and obesity did not have significant effects on the risk of GI bleeding. Conclusion There were no statistically significant differences on the risk of hospitalized or non-hospitalized GI bleeding among the 3 ALLHAT trial arms (amlodipine, lisinopril, and chlorthalidone) during the entire in-trial follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to determine the 18-year risk of cancer, angioedema, insomnia, depression, and erectile dysfunction in association with antihypertensive drug use. Methods This is a post-trial passive follow-up study of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) participants between 1994 and 1998 that was conducted by linking their follow-up data with Medicare claims data until 2017 of subjects who were free of outcomes at baseline on 1 January 1999. The main outcomes were the occurrence of cancer (among n\u2009=\u200917,332), angioedema (among n\u2009=\u200917,340), insomnia (among n\u2009=\u200917,340), depression (among n\u2009=\u200917,330), and erectile dysfunction (among n\u2009=\u20097,444 men) over 18 years of follow-up. Results The 18-year cumulative incidence rate of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer from Medicare inpatient claims was 23.9% for chlorthalidone, 23.4% for amlodipine, and 25.3% for lisinopril. There were no statistically significant differences in the 18-year risk of cancer, depression, and erectile dysfunction among the three drugs based on the adjusted hazard ratios. The adjusted 18-year risk of angioedema was elevated in those receiving lisinopril than in those receiving amlodipine (hazard ratio: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.14\u20132.33) or in those receiving chlorthalidone (1.33, 1.00\u20131.79), whereas the adjusted 18-year risk of insomnia was statistically significantly decreased in those receiving lisinopril than in those receiving amlodipine (0.90, 0.81\u20131.00). Conclusions The 18-year risk of angioedema was significantly higher in patients receiving lisinopril than in those receiving amlodipine or chlorthalidone; the risk of insomnia was significantly lower in patients receiving lisinopril than in those receiving amlodipine; and the risk of cancer, depression, and erectile dysfunction (in men) was not statistically significantly different among the three drug groups.",
