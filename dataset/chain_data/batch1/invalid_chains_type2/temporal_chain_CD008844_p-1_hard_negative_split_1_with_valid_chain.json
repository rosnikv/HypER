        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nExperimental studies and early phase clinical trials suggest that transplantation of blood-derived or bone marrow-derived stem cells may improve cardiac regeneration and neovascularization after acute myocardial infarction. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces mobilization of bone marrow stem cells.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the value of stem cell mobilization by G-CSF therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients diagnosed with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction who had successful reperfusion by percutaneous coronary intervention within 12 hours after onset of symptoms in Germany between February 24, 2004, and February 2, 2005.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneously either a daily dose of 10 microg/kg of G-CSF or placebo for 5 days.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary end point was reduction of left ventricular infarct size according to technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy performed at baseline and at 4 to 6 months after randomization. Secondary end points included improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging and the incidence of angiographic restenosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 114 patients, 56 were assigned to receive treatment with G-CSF and 58 were assigned to receive placebo. Treatment with G-CSF produced a significant mobilization of stem cells. Between baseline and follow-up, left ventricular infarct size according to scintigraphy was reduced by a mean (SD) of 6.2% (9.1%) in the G-CSF group and 4.9% (8.9%) in the placebo group (P = .56) and left ventricular ejection fraction was improved by 0.5% (3.8%) in the G-CSF group and 2.0% (4.9%) in the placebo group (P = .14). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 19 (35.2%) of 54 patients in the G-CSF group and in 17 (30.9%) of 55 patients in the placebo group (P = .79). The most common adverse event among patients assigned to G-CSF was mild to moderate bone pain and muscle discomfort.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nStem cell mobilization by G-CSF therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and successful mechanical reperfusion has no influence on infarct size, left ventricular function, or coronary restenosis.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00126100.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) after myocardial infarction does not affect systolic function when compared with placebo. In contrast, intracoronary infusion of bone marrow cells appears to improve ejection fraction. We aimed to evaluate the G-CSF mobilization of subsets of stem cells. Methods and Results\u2014 We included 78 patients (62 men; 56\u00b18 years) with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous intervention <12 hours after symptom onset. Patients were randomized to double-blind G-CSF (10 &mgr;g/kg/d) or placebo. Over 7 days, the myocardium was exposed to 25\u00d7109 G-CSF mobilized CD34+ cells, compared with 3\u00d7109 cells in placebo patients (P<0.001); and to 4.9\u00d71011 mesenchymal stem cells, compared with 2.0\u00d71011 in the placebo group (P<0.001). The fraction of CD34+ cells/leukocyte increased during G-CSF treatment (from 0.3\u00b10.2 to 1.1\u00b10.9 \u00d710\u22123, P<0.001 when compared with placebo), whereas the fraction of putative mesenchymal stem cells/leukocyte decreased (from 22\u00b117 to 14\u00b111 \u00d710\u22123, P=0.01 when compared with placebo). An inverse association between number of circulating mesenchymal stem cells and change in ejection fraction was found (regression coefficient \u22126.8, P=0.004), however none of the mesenchymal cell subtypes analyzed, were independent predictors of systolic recovery. Conclusions\u2014 The dissociated pattern for circulating CD34+ and mesenchymal stem cells could be attributable to reduced mesenchymal stem cell mobilization from the bone marrow by G-CSF, or increased homing of mesenchymal stem cells to the infarcted myocardium. The inverse association between circulating mesenchymal stem cells and systolic recovery may be of clinical importance and should be explored further.",

        "abstract": "Personalized treatment using stem, modified or genetically engineered, cells is becoming a reality in the field of medicine, in which allogenic or autologous cells can be used for treatment and possibly for early diagnosis of diseases. Hematopoietic, stromal and organ specific stem cells are under evaluation for cell-based therapies for cardiac, neurological, autoimmune and other disorders. Cytotoxic or genetically altered T-cells are under clinical trial for the treatment of hematopoietic or other malignant diseases. Before using stem cells in clinical trials, translational research in experimental animal models are essential, with a critical emphasis on developing noninvasive methods for tracking the temporal and spatial homing of these cells to target tissues. Moreover, it is necessary to determine the transplanted cell's engraftment efficiency and functional capability. Various in vivo imaging modalities are in use to track the movement and incorporation of administered cells. Tagging cells with reporter genes, fluorescent dyes or different contrast agents transforms them into cellular probes or imaging agents. Recent reports have shown that magnetically labeled cells can be used as cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes, demonstrating the cell trafficking to target tissues. In this review, we will discuss the methods to transform cells into probes for in vivo imaging, along with their advantages and disadvantages as well as the future clinical applicability of cellular imaging method and corresponding imaging modality.",

        "abstract": "Cell-based therapies represent a new therapeutic approach for stroke. In 2007, investigators from academia, industry leaders, and members of the National Institutes of Health crafted recommendations to facilitate the translational development of cellular therapies as a novel, emerging modality for stroke from animal studies to clinical trials. This meeting was called Stem Cell Therapies as an Emerging Paradigm in Stroke (STEPS) and was modeled on the format of the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) meetings. Since publication of the original STEPS guidelines, there has been an explosive growth in the number of cellular products and in the number of new laboratory discoveries that impact the safety and potential efficacy of cell therapies for stroke. Any successful development of a cell product will need to take into consideration several factors, including the preclinical safety and efficacy profile, cell characterization, delivery route, in vivo biodistribution, and mechanism of action. In 2010, a second meeting called STEPS 2 was held to bring together clinical and basic science researchers with industry, regulatory, and National Institutes of Health representatives. At this meeting, participants identified critical gaps in knowledge and research areas that require further studies, updated prior guidelines, and drafted new recommendations to create a framework to guide future investigations in cell-based therapies for stroke.",

        "title": "Delayed Intranasal Delivery of Hypoxic-Preconditioned Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhanced Cell Homing and Therapeutic Benefits after Ischemic Stroke in Mice",
        "abstract": "Stem cell transplantation therapy has emerged as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. Effective delivery of exogenous cells and homing of these cells to the lesion region, however, have been challenging issues that hinder the efficacy and efficiency of cell-based therapy. In the present investigation, we tested a delayed treatment of noninvasive and brain-targeted intranasal delivery of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a mouse focal cerebral ischemia model. The investigation tested the feasibility and effectiveness of intranasal delivery of BMSCs to the ischemic cortex. Hypoxia preconditioning (HP) of BMSCs was performed before transplantation in order to promote their survival, migration, and homing to the ischemic brain region after intranasal transplantation. Hoechst dye-labeled normoxic- or hypoxic-pretreated BMSCs (1 \u00d7 106 cells/animal) were delivered intranasally 24 h after stroke. Cells reached the ischemic cortex and deposited outside of vasculatures as early as 1.5 h after administration. HP-treated BMSCs (HP-BMSCs) showed a higher level of expression of proteins associated with migration, including CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9. HP-BMSCs exhibited enhanced migratory capacities in vitro and dramatically enhanced homing efficiency to the infarct cortex when compared with normoxic cultured BMSCs (N-BMSCs). Three days after transplantation and 4 days after stroke, both N-BMSCs and HP-BMSCs decreased cell death in the peri-infarct region; significant neuroprotection of reduced infarct volume was seen in mice that received HP-BMSCs. In adhesive removal test of sensorimotor functional assay performed 3 days after transplantation, HP-BMSC-treated mice performed significantly better than N-BMSC- and vehicle-treated animals. These data suggest that delayed intranasal administration of stem cells is feasible in the treatment of stroke and hypoxic preconditioning of transplanted cells, significantly enhances cell's homing to the ischemic region, and optimizes the therapeutic efficacy.",

        "title": "Intranasal Delivery of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improved Neurovascular Regeneration and Rescued Neuropsychiatric Deficits after Neonatal Stroke in Rats",
        "abstract": "Neonatal stroke is a major cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in infants and children. Currently, very limited therapeutic strategies are available to protect the developing brain against ischemic damage and promote brain repairs for pediatric patients. Moreover, children who experienced neonatal stroke often have developmental social behavior problems. Cellular therapy using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has emerged as a regenerative therapy after stroke. In the present investigation, neonatal stroke of postnatal day 7 (P7) rat pups was treated with noninvasive and brain-specific intranasal delivery of BMSCs at 6 h and 3 days after stroke (1 \u00d7 106cells/animal). Prior to transplantation, BMSCs were subjected to hypoxic preconditioning to enhance their tolerance and regenerative properties. The effects on regenerative activities and stroke-induced sensorimotor and social behavioral deficits were specifically examined at P24 of juvenile age. The BMSC treatment significantly reduced infarct size and blood-brain barrier disruption, promoted angiogenesis, neurogenesis, neurovascular repair, and improved local cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cortex. BMSC-treated rats showed better sensorimotor and olfactory functional recovery than saline-treated animals, measured by the adhesive removal test and buried food finding test. In social behavioral tests, we observed functional and social behavioral deficits in P24 rats subjected to stroke at P7, while the BMSC treatment significantly improved the performance of stroke animals. Overall, intranasal BMSC transplantation after neonatal stroke shows neuroprotection and great potential as a regenerative therapy to enhance neurovascular regeneration and improve functional recovery observed at the juvenile stage of development.",

        "title": "Neuroprotective and regenerative roles of intranasal Wnt-3a administration after focal ischemic stroke in mice",
        "abstract": "Wnt signaling is a conserved pathway involved in expansion of neural progenitors and lineage specification during development. However, the role of Wnt signaling in the post-stroke brain has not been well-elucidated. We hypothesized that Wnt-3a would play an important role for neurogenesis and brain repair. Adult male mice were subjected to a focal ischemic stroke targeting the sensorimotor cortex. Mice that received Wnt-3a (2\u2009\u00b5g/kg/day, 1\u2009h after stroke and once a day for the next 2 days, intranasal delivery) had reduced infarct volume compared to stroke controls. Wnt-3a intranasal treatment of seven days upregulated the expression of brain-derived growth factor (BDNF), increased the proliferation and migration of neuroblasts from the subventricular zone (SVZ), resulting in increased numbers of newly formed neurons and endothelial cells in the peri-infarct zone. Both the molecular and cellular effects of Wnt-3a were blocked by the Wnt specific inhibitors XAV-939 or Dkk-1. In functional assays, Wnt-3a treatment enhanced the local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) in the peri-infarct, as well as improved sensorimotor functions in a battery of behavioral tests. Together, our data demonstrates that the Wnt-3a signaling can act as a dual neuroprotective and regenerative factor for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

        "title": "Enhanced Neurogenesis and Collaterogenesis by Sodium Danshensu Treatment After Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mice",
        "abstract": "Ischemic stroke remains a serious threat to human life. There are limited effective therapies for the treatment of stroke. We have previously demonstrated that angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the brain play an important role in functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Recent studies indicate that increased arteriogenesis and collateral circulation are determining factors for restoring reperfusion and outcomes of stroke patients. Danshensu, the Salvia miltiorrhiza root extract, is used in treatments of various human ischemic events in traditional Chinese medicine. Its therapeutic mechanism, however, is not well clarified. Due to its proposed effect on angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, we hypothesized that danshensu could benefit stroke recovery through stimulating neurogenesis and collaterogenesis in the post-ischemia brain. Focal ischemic stroke targeting the right sensorimotor cortex was induced in wild-type C57BL6 mice and transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to label smooth muscle cells of brain arteries. Sodium danshensu (SDS, 700 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 10 min after stroke and once daily until animals were sacrificed. To label proliferating cells, 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered, starting on day 3 after ischemia and continued once daily until sacrifice. At 14 days after stroke, SDS significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the peri-infarct region. SDS-treated animals showed increased number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. Greater numbers of proliferating endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were detected in SDS-treated mice 21 days after stroke in comparison with vehicle controls. The number of newly formed neurons labeled by NeuN and BrdU antibodies increased in SDS-treated mice 28 days after stroke. SDS significantly increased the newly formed arteries and the diameter of collateral arteries, leading to enhanced local cerebral blood flow recovery after stroke. These results suggest that systemic sodium danshensu treatment shows significant regenerative effects in the post-ischemic brain, which may benefit long-term functional recovery from ischemic stroke.",

Pharmacokinetic study was evaluated in doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg after intravenous administration of sodium danshensu. Bioavailability study was evaluated by comparing between 30 mg/kg (I.V.) and 180 mg/kg (P.O.) of sodium danshensu. Tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion were evaluated at 30 mg/kg (I.V.) of sodium danshensu. Following intravenous administration, sodium danshensu exhibited linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 15\u201360 mg/kg. Sodium danshensu appeared to be poorly absorbed after oral administration, with an absolute bioavailability of 13.72%. The primary distribution tissue was kidney, but it was also distributed to lung, stomach, muscle, uterus, heart, etc. Within 96 h after intravenous administration, 46.99% was excreted via urine and 1.16% was excreted via feces as the parent drug. Biliary excretion of sodium danshensu was about 0.83% for 24 h. Metabolites in urine were identified as methylation, sulfation, both methylation and sulfation, and acetylation of danshensu. Sodium danshensu can be developed as an injection because of its poor oral bioavailability. In conclusion, sodium danshensu is widely distributed, mainly phase II metabolized and excreted primarily in urine as an unchanged drug in rats.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of the mice pressure ulcers (PU) model, the protective effect and potential mechanism of sodium Danshensu (SDSS) cream against PU were investigated. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: the negative control group (cream without 0.5 g SDSS), the SDSS group (cream containing 0.5 g SDSS), and the positive group (0.5 g Hirudoid\u00ae). After 7 and 14 days of ointment application, the wound-healing rate of the SDSS and positive groups was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The results of hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining also indicated that SDSS has the potential to promote the healing of PU. In addition, the serum IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA levels decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after 14 days of SDSS treatment, while the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities increased significantly (p < 0.01).

        "abstract": "Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the resolution of infection or tissue damage. In addition, inflammation is considered a hallmark of aging, which in turn compromises wound healing. Thymbra capitata is an aromatic plant, whose infusion is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory and wound-healing agent. In this study, a T. capitata infusion was prepared and characterized by HPLC-PDA-ESI-MSn and its safety profile determined by the resazurin metabolic assay. The anti-inflammatory potential was revealed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages by assessing nitric oxide (NO) release and levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the interleukin-1\u03b2 pro-form (pro-IL-1\u03b2). Wound-healing capacity was determined using the scratch assay. The activity of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase was used to unveil the anti-senescent potential, along with the nuclear accumulation of yH2AX and p21 levels. The antiradical potential was assessed by DPPH and ABTS scavenging assays. The infusion contains predominantly rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acids. The extract decreased NO, iNOS, and pro-IL-1\u03b2 levels. Interestingly, the extract promoted wound healing and decreased \u03b2-galactosidase activity, as well as yH2AX and p21 levels. The present work highlights strong antiradical, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing capacities, corroborating the traditional uses ascribed to this plant. We have described, for the first time for this extract, anti-senescent properties.",
