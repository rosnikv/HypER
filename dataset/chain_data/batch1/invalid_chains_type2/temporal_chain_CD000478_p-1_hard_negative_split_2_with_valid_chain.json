        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether azathioprine can prevent relapse in ulcerative colitis. DESIGN--One year placebo controlled double blind trial of withdrawal or continuation of azathioprine. SETTING--Outpatient clinics of five hospitals. SUBJECTS--79 patients with ulcerative colitis who had been taking azathioprine for six months or more. Patients in full remission for two months or more (67), and patients with chronic low grade or corticosteroid dependent disease (12) were randomised separately. 33 patients in remission received azathioprine and 34 placebo; five patients with chronic stable disease received azathioprine and seven placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of relapse. Relapse was defined as worsening of symptoms or sigmoidoscopic appearance. RESULTS--For the remission group the one year rate of relapse was 36% (12/33) for patients continuing azathioprine and 59% (20/34) for those taking placebo (hazard rate ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.0). For the subgroup of 54 patients in long term remission (greater than six months before entry to trial) benefit was still evident, with a 31% (8/26) rate of relapse with azathioprine and 61% (17/28) with placebo (p less than 0.01). For the small group of patients with chronic stable colitis (six were corticosteroid dependent and six had low grade symptoms) no benefit was found from continued azathioprine therapy. Adverse events were minimal. CONCLUSIONS--Azathioprine maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis is beneficial for at least two years if patients have achieved remission while taking the drug. Demonstration of the relapse preventing properties of azathioprine has implications for a large number of patients with troublesome ulcerative colitis, who may benefit from treatment with azathioprine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine and its prodrug azathioprine are effective medications for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. However, use of these drugs has been limited by concerns about their toxicity. Colonic delivery of azathioprine may reduce its systemic bioavailability and limit toxicity. AIM: To determine the bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine after administration of azathioprine via three colonic delivery formulations. METHODS: Twenty four healthy human subjects each received 50 mg of azathioprine by one of four delivery formulations (each n = 6): oral; delayed release oral; hydrophobic rectal foam; and hydrophilic rectal foam. All subjects also received a 50 mg dose of intravenous azathioprine during a separate study period. Plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The bioavailabilities of 6-mercaptopurine after colonic azathioprine administration via delayed release oral, hydrophobic rectal foam, and hydrophilic rectal foam (7%, 5%, 1%; respectively) were significantly lower than the bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine after oral azathioprine administration (47%) by Wilcoxon rank sum pairwise comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine delivered to the colon by delayed release oral and rectal foam formulations considerably reduced systemic 6-mercaptopurine bioavailability. The therapeutic potential of these colonic delivery methods, which can potentially limit toxicity by local delivery of high doses of azathioprine, should be investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The use of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased in recent years. The pharmacology, patient response in controlled trials, new formulations and routes of administration and safety for these agents are reviewed. Pharmacology : AZA is rapidly converted to 6MP, which is then further metabolized to the active metabolites, the 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN). The half-life of 6TGN in erythrocytes is prolonged and weeks to months may be required to reach steady state. This prolonged time to 6TGN steady state may help explain the clinical observation that prolonged treatment (3-4 months) with 6MP/AZA for IBD is required before a therapeutic response occurs. Clinical response: Controlled trials of 6MP (1.5 mg/kg/d) or AZA (1.0-3.0 mg/kg/d) support the following treatment indications for 6MP/AZA: inflammatory Crohn's disease; fistulizing Crohn's disease; steroid-sparing; and remission maintenance.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe approval of azathioprine (AZA) for the long-term therapy of patients with Crohn's disease in The Netherlands.\n\n\nMETHODS\nReview and update of the literature on clinical efficacy and safety of AZA in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAZA and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the onset of the clinical response is delayed, requiring combination with other active medication in the early phase of treatment. Maintenance therapy with AZA/6-MP is also effective in the prevention of relapses in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Indications for AZA/6-MP therapy further include refractory, fistulizing and steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. It is not known whether or when AZA/6-MP can be withdrawn in patients in long-term remission, but most clinicians discontinue therapy after 3-5 years. Although fewer data are available, AZA/6-PM appears to be effective also in the therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis. Side effects of AZA/6-MP occur in about 15% of patients and include skin rash, pancreatitis and hepatitis, dose-related neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and risk of increased occurrence and severity of infections. Recent data suggest that the risk of malignancy, other than colorectal cancer, is not increased. Safety in pregnancy has not been studied extensively, but no increased prevalence of birth defects has been reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAZA/6-MP therapy is efficacious in patients with active Crohn's disease, but the drug is especially valuable in the long-term treatment of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Drug-related side effects are frequent and require discontinuation or dose-reduction of the AZA/6-MP therapy. Due to an increased risk of infections secondary to myelosuppression, careful follow-up is mandatory. Insufficient data are available on safety in pregnancy and on the risk of malignancies, but the limited data available in patients with inflammatory bowel disease appear to be reassuring.",

        "abstract": "Treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflect a continuing shift from empiricism to strategies based on improved understanding of the pathophysiology of disease. In susceptible individuals, IBD appears to be the result of defective regulation of mucosal immune interactions with the enteric microflora. This has prompted research directed at the interface of the traditional disciplines of immunology, microbiology, and epithelial cell biology. Whereas immunodiagnostics have been of limited clinical value in IBD, assessments of mucosal rather than systemic immune function are promising. Therapeutically, there is an increasing trend toward more aggressive and earlier use of immunomodulatory agents, particularly for prevention of relapse, with cytokine manipulation as a bridge therapy to achieve remission in patients with acute severe disease. Although most drug treatments are directed toward altering the host response, the rationale for manipulating the enteric flora appears sound and will be the basis of additional future therapeutic strategies. Notwithstanding the widening range of options for drug therapy in IBD, other outcome modifiers and well-established principles of managing chronic disease are as important as ever.",

The aim of this randomised placebo controlled study was to determine if Lactobacillus GG, given by mouth for one year, could prevent Crohn\u2019s recurrent lesions after surgery or to reduce their severity. Methods: Patients operated on for Crohn\u2019s disease in whom all of the diseased gut had been removed were randomly allocated to receive 12 billion colony forming units of Lactobacillus or identical placebo for one year. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at the end of the trial or at the onset of symptoms. Endoscopic recurrence was defined as grade 2 or higher of Rutgeerts scoring system. Results: Eight of 45 patients were excluded from the trial (three for non-compliance and five for protocol violations). Clinical recurrence was ascertained in three (16.6%) patients who received Lactobacillus and in two (10.5%) who received placebo. Nine of 15 patients in clinical remission on Lactobacillus (60%) had endoscopic recurrence compared with six of 17 (35.3%) on placebo (p=0.297). There were no significant differences in the severity of the lesions between the two groups.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Ileal lesions in 36.4% of patients with Crohn's disease are colonized by pathogenic adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro inhibitory effects of the probiotic strain, Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001, on adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells by adherent-invasive E. coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients. The experiments were performed with undifferentiated Intestine-407 cells and with undifferentiated or differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells were assessed by counting CFU. The inhibitory effects of L. casei were determined after coincubation with adherent-invasive E. coli or after preincubation of intestinal cells with L. casei prior to infection with adherent-invasive E. coli. Inhibitory effects of L. casei on adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion to differentiated and undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells reached 75% to 84% in coincubation and 43% to 62% in preincubation experiments, according to the cell lines used. Addition of L. casei culture supernatant to the incubation medium increased L. casei adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and enhanced the inhibitory effects of L. casei. The inhibitory effects on E. coli invasion paralleled those on adhesion. This effect was not due to a bactericidal effect on adherent-invasive E. coli or to a cytotoxic effect on epithelial intestinal cells. As Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 strongly inhibits interaction of adherent-invasive E. coli with intestinal epithelial cells, this finding suggests that the probiotic strain could be of therapeutic value in Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Lactobacillus casei has been shown to attenuate the severity of experimental colitis. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the effects of L. casei on colitis are related to modulation of leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed intestine. Rats with a colonic segment excluded from fecal transit were surgically prepared. The segment was decontaminated with antibiotics and recolonized with normal flora isolated from the inflamed rat colon, associated or not to L. casei. Control and colitic [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced] animals were studied. Leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions were characterized in the colonic microcirculation by intravital microscopy, and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression was measured by the radiolabeled antibody technique. Compared with the noninflamed colonic segment, induction of colitis by TNBS provoked a marked increase in the number of leukocytes firmly adherent to the venular wall (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.6 leukocytes/100 mum, P < 0.01). Colonization with L. casei significantly reduced the number of adherent leukocytes (1.3 +/- 0.4 leukocytes/100 mum; P < 0.05) but did not affect the increased rolling interactions associated with the induction of colitis. Compared with the noncolitic group, induction of colitis was associated with a marked increase in ICAM-1 expression (117 +/- 4 vs. 180 +/- 3 ng antibody/g tissue) that was abrogated when the colitic segment was colonized by L. casei (117 +/- 3 ng antibody/g tissue, P < 0.05). However, L. casei administration did not modify VCAM-1 upregulation in colitic animals. L. casei attenuates leukocyte recruitment observed in experimental colitis induced by TNBS. This effect is possibly related to abrogation of ICAM-1 upregulation.",

        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, are recurrent and aggressive inflammatory disorders that are most likely the result of an overly aggressive immune response to ubiquitous intestinal antigens in a genetically susceptible host. Despite decades of intense research, our knowledge of factors causing IBD remains incomplete and, therefore, conventional therapy to induce and maintain remission works in a symptomatic fashion, merely suppressing the immune response. Probiotic bacteria have long been known to confer health benefits, especially with regard to intestinal disorders. Although there is mounting evidence from in vitro and animal experiments supporting the use of probiotics in IBD, clinical trials have not provided definite evidence for the therapeutic effect of probiotic therapy in IBD to date. This is with the notable exception of pouchitis and the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, whereas Crohn\u2019s disease and active ulcerative colitis do not seem amenable to probiotic intervention. The next 5 years will see more trials targeting specific clinical settings using tailor-made probiotic combinations, taking into account our increasing knowledge of individual probiotic properties and the diversity of these microorganisms.",

While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways.

        "title": "A Proposal for a Study on Treatment Selection and Lifestyle Recommendations in Chronic Inflammatory Diseases: A Danish Multidisciplinary Collaboration on Prognostic Factors and Personalised Medicine",
        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), including Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel diseases, IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritides, hidradenitis suppurativa, and immune-mediated uveitis, are treated with biologics targeting the pro-inflammatory molecule tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) (i.e., TNF inhibitors). Approximately one-third of the patients do not respond to the treatment. Genetics and lifestyle may affect the treatment results. The aims of this multidisciplinary collaboration are to identify (1) molecular signatures of prognostic value to help tailor treatment decisions to an individual likely to initiate TNF inhibitor therapy, followed by (2) lifestyle factors that support achievement of optimised treatment outcome. This report describes the establishment of a cohort that aims to obtain this information. Clinical data including lifestyle and treatment response and biological specimens (blood, faeces, urine, and, in IBD patients, intestinal biopsies) are sampled prior to and while on TNF inhibitor therapy. Both hypothesis-driven and data-driven analyses will be performed according to pre-specified protocols including pathway analyses resulting from candidate gene expression analyses and global approaches (e.g., metabolomics, metagenomics, proteomics). The final purpose is to improve the lives of patients suffering from CIDs, by providing tools facilitating treatment selection and dietary recommendations likely to improve the clinical outcome.",

        "title": "Impact of red and processed meat and fibre intake on treatment outcomes among patients with chronic inflammatory diseases: protocol for a prospective cohort study of prognostic factors and personalised medicine",
        "abstract": "Introduction Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) are frequently treated with biological medications, specifically tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)). These medications inhibit the pro-inflammatory molecule TNF alpha, which has been strongly implicated in the aetiology of these diseases. Up to one-third of patients do not, however, respond to biologics, and lifestyle factors are assumed to affect treatment outcomes. Little is known about the effects of dietary lifestyle as a prognostic factor that may enable personalised medicine. The primary outcome of this multidisciplinary collaborative study will be to identify dietary lifestyle factors that support optimal treatment outcomes. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort study will enrol 320 patients with CID who are prescribed a TNFi between June 2017 and March 2019. Included among the patients with CID will be patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis), rheumatic disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis), inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa) and non-infectious uveitis. At baseline (pretreatment), patient characteristics will be assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, clinical assessments of disease activity, quality of life and lifestyle, in addition to registry data on comorbidity and concomitant medication(s). In accordance with current Danish standards, follow-up will be conducted 14\u201316 weeks after treatment initiation. For each disease, evaluation of successful treatment response will be based on established primary and secondary endpoints, including disease-specific core outcome sets. The major outcome of the analyses will be to detect variability in treatment effectiveness between patients with different lifestyle characteristics. Ethics and dissemination The principle goal of this project is to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from CID by providing evidence to support dietary and other lifestyle recommendations that may improve clinical outcomes. The study is approved by the Ethics Committee (S-20160124) and the Danish Data Protecting Agency (2008-58-035). Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, patient associations and presentations at international conferences. Trial registration number NCT03173144; Pre-results.",

        "title": "Intake of dietary fibre, red and processed meat and risk of late-onset Chronic Inflammatory Diseases: A prospective Danish study on the \u201cdiet, cancer and health\u201d cohort",
        "abstract": "Background: Human and animal studies support the involvement of diet in the development of CID -chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Objective: This cohort study aimed to investigate the association between intake of fibre, red and processed meat, and occurrence of late-onset CID (50+ years of age) in the DCH: Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort. We hypothesised that risk of late-onset CID would be lower among those with high intake of fibre and/or low intake of meat compared to individuals with low fibre and/or high meat intake. Methods: The DCH recruited 56,468 individuals, aged 50-64 years, between 1993 and 1997. At recruitment, diet intake was registered using food frequency questionnaires as well as lifestyle factors in 56,075 persons. Exposure variables were generated as sex-adjusted tertiles of fibre and meat (g/day). Development of CIDs was identified in national registries. Hazard ratios (HR) of late-onset CIDs (adjusted for age, sex, energy intake, alcohol, smoking, education, comorbidity, and civil status) were estimated for all three exposure variables. Results: During follow-up of 1,123,754 years (median (Interquartile range) = 22.2 (20.1-23.1)), 1,758 (3.1%) participants developed at least one CID. The adjusted HRs for developing CID (low fibre 1.04 [0.89-1.22] and medium fibre 1.04 [0.91-1.18] (high fibre as reference), and medium meat 0.96 [0.86-1.09] and high meat 0.94 [0.82-1.07] (low meat as reference)) or the individual diseases were not statistically significant. Conclusion: This large study did not support that a high intake of fibre and/or a low intake of meat had a high impact on the risk of late-onset CID.",

        "title": "Improvement of Inflammation and Pain after Three Months\u2019 Exclusion Diet in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease affecting the synovial joints and causing severe disability. Environmental and lifestyle factors, including diet, have been proposed to play a role in the onset and severity of RA. Dietary manipulation may help to manage the symptoms of RA by lowering inflammation and potentially decreasing pain. Methods: In 40 patients with long-standing RA with stable symptoms and treated with conventional (c-) and biological (b-) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the effect of a 3-month diet avoiding meat, gluten, and lactose (and all dairy products; privative diet) was evaluated in comparison with a control balanced diet including those foods. Both diets were designed to reduce weight since all patients were overweight or obese. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the diets, and RA was clinically assessed at Time 0 (T0), through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), for pain, and the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS 28) for RA activity. Patients were also administered the Short Form Health survey (SF-36) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). At T0, a blood sample was collected for laboratory tests and adipokines measurements, and anthropometric measurements were compared. These evaluations were repeated at the end of the 3 months\u2019 dietary regimens. Results: A significant decrease in VAS and the improvement of the overall state of physical and mental health, assessed through SF-36, was observed in patients assigned to the privative diet. Both dietary regimens resulted in the improvement of quality of life compared to baseline values; however, the change was significant only for the privative diet. With either diet, patients showed significant decreases in body weight and body mass index, with a reduction in waist and hips circumference and lower basal glucose and circulating leptin levels. A privative diet was also able to significantly reduce systolic (p = 0.003) and diastolic (p = 0.025) arterial pressure. The number of circulating leukocytes and neutrophils, and the level of hs-C-Reactive Protein also decreased after 3 months of the meat-, lactose-, and gluten-free diet. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a privative diet can result in a better control of inflammation in RA patients under stable optimized drug treatment.",

        "title": "Diet affects inflammatory arthritis: a Mendelian randomization study of 30 dietary patterns causally associated with inflammatory arthritis",
        "abstract": "Background The causal associations between dietary intake and the risk and severity of Inflammatory Arthritis (IA) are currently unknown. Objective In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between nine dietary categories (30 types of diet) and IA using Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods We analyzed data from 30 diets and IA in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could influence the results of MR analyses were screened out through the Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) test. SNPs were analyzed through two-sample bidirectional MR using inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median method. The multiplicity and heterogeneity of SNPs were assessed using MR-Egger intercept term tests and Cochran\u2019s Q tests. FDR correction was used to correct the p-values. Results IVW results showed that Beef intake [Odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20092.862; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.360\u20136.021, p\u2009=\u20090.006, p_fdr\u2009<\u20090.05] was positively associated with rheumatoid arthritis(RA); Dried fruit intake (OR\u2009=\u20090.522; 95% CI, 0.349\u20130.781, p\u2009=\u20090.002, p_fdr\u2009<\u20090.05), and Iron intake (OR\u2009=\u20090.864; 95%CI, 0.777\u20130.960, p\u2009=\u20090.007, p_fdr\u2009<\u20090.05) were negatively associated with RA, all of which were evidence of significance. Fresh fruit intake (OR\u2009=\u20092.528. 95% CI, 1.063\u20136.011, p\u2009=\u20090.036, p_fdr\u2009>\u20090.05) was positively associated with psoriatic arthritis (PsA); Cheese intake (OR\u2009=\u20090.579; 95% CI, 0.367\u20130.914, p\u2009=\u20090.019, p_fdr\u2009>\u20090.05) was negatively associated with PsA; both were suggestive evidence. Processed meat intake (OR\u2009=\u20090.238; 95% CI, 0.100\u20130.565, p\u2009=\u20090.001, p_fdr\u2009<\u20090.05) was negatively associated with reactive arthritis (ReA), a protective factor, and significant evidence. All exposure data passed the heterogeneity check (Cochrane\u2019s Q test p\u2009>\u20090.05) and no directional pleiotropy was detected. Leave-one-out analyses demonstrated the robustness of the causal relationship in the positive results. Conclusion Our study presents genetic evidence supporting a causal relationship between diet and an increased risk of IA. It also identifies a causal relationship between various dietary modalities and different types of IA. These findings have significant implications for the prevention and management of IA through dietary modifications.",
