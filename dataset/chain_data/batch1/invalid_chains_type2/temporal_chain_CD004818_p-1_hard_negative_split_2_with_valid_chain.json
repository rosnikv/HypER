        "abstract": "In a previous pilot study, we demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) appears to be feasible and safe in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and may result in an attenuated rise in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), more rapid resolution of pain and ST changes. This randomized multicenter trial was organized to further assess the safety and feasibility of this treatment in human subjects. Patients with an AMI treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) or streptokinase (STK), were randomized to treatment with HBO combined with either rTPA or STK, or rTPA or STK alone. An analysis included 112 patients, 66 of whom had inferior AMIs (p = NS). The remainder of the patients had anterior AMIs. The mean CPK at 12 and 24 h was reduced in the HBO patients by approximately 7.5% (p = NS). Time to pain relief was shorter in the HBO group. There were 2 deaths in the control and 1 in those treated with HBO. The left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) on discharge was 51.7% in the HBO group as compared to 48.4% in the controls (p = NS). The LVEF of the controls was 43.4 as compared to 47.6 for those treated, approximately 10% better (no significant difference). Treatment with HBO in combination with thrombolysis appears to be feasible and safe for patients with AMI and may result in an attenuated CPK rise, more rapid resolution of pain and improved ejection fractions. More studies are needed to assess the benefits of this treatment.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that raising myocardial O2 via diffusion of a hyperbaric oxygen solution (AO) administered through the anterior interventricular vein (AIV) will reduce infarct size by reducing reperfusion injury associated with reduced neutrophil activation. In three pilot open-chest swine experiments, myocardial tissue Po2 was monitored using an oxygen probe during coronary occlusion (Occl) and reperfusion (Rep). One control experiment had no AIV infusion; a second control received arterial blood drawn from the femoral artery infused into the AIV during Rep. In a third open-chest experiment, AO mixed with arterial blood was infused through the AIV at Rep. In controls, tissue Po2 in the risk region (RR) rose early in Rep and then fell to Occl levels, whereas in AO-treated animals, myocardial Po2 remained above baseline. The following three groups of five swine then underwent 60 min of left anterior descending coronary artery Occl and Rep: 1) arterial blood infused at Rep as controls (Con), 2) AO infused beginning 30 min after Rep (AO 30 min), and 3) AO infused immediately at Rep (AO 0 min). There were no differences among the three groups in hemodynamics or myocardial blood flow during baseline (BL) or Occl or in RR size. However, endocardial blood flow was significantly higher in RR during Rep in AO 0 min vs. control and AO 30 min (P=0.01). Both infarct size (IS) as %heart and IS as %RR were lower in AO 0 min compared with Con and AO 30 min (P <0.01 for both), and myeloperoxidase values were lower for epicardial (P <0.001), midmyocardial (P=0.03), and endocardial (P <0.001) layers in AO 0 min. AO infused into the AIV immediately at Rep diffuses into the RR and reduces IS by reducing Rep injury associated with neutrophil activation.",

        "title": "HYPERBARIC OXYGENATION APPLIED IMMEDIATELY AFTER CORONARY OCCLUSION REDUCES MYOCARDIAL NECROSIS AND ACUTE MORTALITY IN RATS",
        "abstract": "1 Because in ischaemia there is a critical lack of O2, it has been reasoned that increasing O2 delivery to the ischaemic myocardium could serve as adjunctive therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI). Accordingly, in the present study, the effect of early hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) on mortality and MI size after coronary occlusion was examined in rats. 2 After coronary occlusion, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive either HBO for 1 h in a hyperbaric chamber (100% O2 at 253 kPa; n = 106) or ambient O2 as the control (n = 111). The extent of myocardial necrosis was assessed (triphenyltetrazolium) immediately after treatment in the HBO (n = 50) and control (n = 47) groups. The remaining rats were evaluated 24 h after occlusion to enable calculation of MI size and mortality. 3 Immediately after therapy, the size of the MI was significantly greater in the control group compared with that in the HBO group (40 \u00b1 3 vs 27 \u00b1 2% of the left ventricle (LV), respectively; P < 0.001). The 24 h mortality of control rats was higher than that of HBO rats (34 vs 16%, respectively; P = 0.02). Control rats that survived 24 h had a larger MI than did HBO rats that survived 24 h (40 \u00b1 4 vs 29 \u00b1 3% of the LV, respectively; P = 0.005). Furthermore, large necrotic areas (> 40% of the LV) were more frequent in control than HBO rats (55 vs 27% of infarcted hearts, respectively; P = 0.01). There was less pulmonary congestion observed in HBO rats compared with control rats. 4 In conclusion, early therapy with HBO during the onset of an acute ischaemic event decreases the necrotic area and reduces acute mortality. These data support further investigation of HBO as an adjuvant therapy for acute MI.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo investigate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) chamber treatment in mouse models of retinal ischemia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUnilateral central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or optic nerve crush (ONC) was induced in 50 mice each, of which 30 were treated with 100% oxygen at 2 atm for 90 minutes immediately after injury and then daily for up to 14 days. Mice were euthanatized on days 1, 3, and 21 for histologic analysis, apoptosis assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction test. Findings were analyzed by injury and by treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHBO treatment reduced cell loss from 58% to 30% in the CRAO model and from 52% to 32% in the ONC model. In both models, it was associated with significantly increased cell survival in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Expression levels of the proapoptosis genes (bax, caspase-3) decreased minimally in the HBO-treated CRAO mice on day 1, but this trend was reversed on day 3. In the ONC group, levels of caspase-3, bax, and bcl-x increased on day 1 and dropped below baseline on day 3. The pattern of changes in the expression levels of the ischemia- and oxidative-stress-related genes (HO-1, SOD-1, GPX-1, NOX-2) and the effectiveness of HBO treatment varied by model. Overall, however, gene expression levels that increased in the untreated mice increased further with HBO treatment and levels that decreased, decreased further with treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHBO treatment protects injured neuronal cells from apoptosis. Response to treatment differs molecularly after ONC or CRAO. These results should prompt clinical trials of acute ischemic retinal damage.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo evaluate the effect of bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, on optic nerve edema and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in a mouse model of optic nerve crush (ONC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred C57BL/6 wild-type mice were anesthetized. Right ONC was induced in 150 mice, of which half (n = 75) received an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab immediately thereafter and half (n = 75) did not. The remaining 50 received only bevacizumab. The left eyes served as a control. Findings were analyzed by fluorescein angiography (days 0, 1, 3), histologic and immunohistochemical tests (days 1, 3, 4, 21), and quantitative real-time PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAngiography revealed a reduction in postinjury disc leakage following bevacizumab injection (days 1, 3), confirmed with IgG staining. On PCR, expression of HO-1 and SOD-1 mRNA increased following ONC and further increased with bevacizumab. VEGF gene expression decreased following bevacizumab injection without ONC, remained at baseline after ONC, and increased slightly after ONC+bevacizumab. Histologically, there was a 38% RGC loss 21 days after ONC alone, which dropped to 14% with bevacizumab treatment; it was close to 15% with bevacizumab alone. Mean (SEM) microvascular perfusion in the optic nerve 4 days after ONC was significantly higher in the bevacizumab-treated (85% \u00b1 10%) than the vehicle-treated (33% \u00b1 13%) animals.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBevacizumab treatment following ONC induction exerts a protective effect, manifested by reduced optic nerve head edema. The underlying mechanism probably involves a lesser interruption of axonal transport. Reduced expression of antioxidative and ischemic genes may contribute to RGC preservation.",

An additional group of mice (n = 7) received bevacizumab 6\u2009h after MCAO induction. The mice were euthanized 24 hours later and evaluated for infarct area and brain edema using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and ImageJ. In the saline-treated mice (n = 16), total stroke volume was 19.20 \u00b1 6.38\u2009mm3, mean penumbra area was 4.5 \u00b1 2.03\u2009mm3, and hemispheric asymmetry was 106.5%.

        "title": "Persistent Malfunction of Glymphatic and Meningeal Lymphatic Drainage in a Mouse Model of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",
        "abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that often is followed by permanent brain impairments. It is necessary to explore the pathogenesis of secondary pathological damages in order to find effective interventions for improving the prognosis of SAH. Blockage of brain lymphatic drainage has been shown to worsen cerebral ischemia and edema after acute SAH. However, whether or not there is persistent dysfunction of cerebral lymphatic drainage following SAH remains unclear. In this study, autologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna of mice to establish SAH model. One week after surgery, SAH mice showed decreases in fluorescent tracer drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) and influx into the brain parenchyma after injection into the cisterna magna. Moreover, SAH impaired polarization of astrocyte aquaporin-4 (AQP4) that is a functional marker of glymphatic clearance and resulted in accumulations of Tau proteins as well as CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the brain. In addition, pathological changes, including microvascular spasm, activation of glial cells, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis were observed in the hippocampus of SAH mice. Present results demonstrate persistent malfunction of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic drainage and related neuropathological damages after SAH. Targeting improvement of brain lymphatic clearance potentially serves as a new strategy for the treatment of SAH.",

        "title": "Cerebrovascular pathophysiology of delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
        "abstract": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a serious cerebrovascular disease. Even if SAH patients survive the initial insults, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) may occur at 4 days or later post-SAH. DCI is characteristics of SAH, and is considered to develop by blood breakdown products and inflammatory reactions, or secondary to early brain injury, acute pathophysiological events that occur in the brain within the first 72 hours of aneurysmal SAH. The pathology underlying DCI may involve large artery vasospasm and/or microcirculatory disturbances by microvasospasm, microthrombosis, dysfunction of venous outflow and compression of microvasculature by vasogenic or cytotoxic tissue edema. Recent clinical evidence has shown that large artery vasospasm is not the only cause of DCI, and that both large artery vasospasm-dependent and -independent cerebral infarction causes poor outcome. Animal studies suggest that mechanisms of vasospasm may differ between large artery and arterioles or capillaries, and that many kinds of cells in the vascular wall and brain parenchyma may be involved in the pathogenesis of microcirculatory disturbances. The impairment of the paravascular and glymphatic systems also may play important roles in the development of DCI. As pathological mediators for DCI, glutamate and several matricellular proteins have been investigated in addition to inflammatory molecules. Glutamate is involved in excitotoxicity contributing to cortical spreading ischemia and epileptic activity-related events. Microvascular dysfunction is an attractive mechanism to explain the cause of poor outcomes independently of large cerebral artery vasospasm, but needs more studies to clarify the pathophysiologies or mechanisms and to develop a novel therapeutic strategy.",

        "title": "Impaired Cerebral Autoregulation After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Quantitative Assessment Using a Mouse Model",
        "abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common form of hemorrhagic stroke associated with high rates of mortality and severe disability. SAH patients often develop severe neurological deficits days after ictus, events attributed to a phenomenon referred to as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Recent studies indicate that SAH-induced DCI results from a multitude of cerebral circulatory disturbances including cerebral autoregulation malfunction. Cerebral autoregulation incorporates the influence of blood pressure (BP) on arterial diameter in the homeostatic regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is necessary for maintaining constant brain perfusion during physiological swings in systemic BP. In this study, we quantitatively examined the impact of SAH on cerebral autoregulation using a mouse endovascular perforation model and a newly developed approach combining absolute and relative CBF measurements. This method enables a direct quantitative comparison of cerebral autoregulation between individual animals (e.g., SAH vs. control or sham-operated mice), which cannot be done solely using relative CBF changes by laser Doppler flowmetry. Here, absolute CBF was measured via injection of fluorescent microspheres at a baseline BP. In separate groups of animals, in vivo laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure relative CBF changes over a range of BP using phlebotomy and the pressor phenylephrine to lower and raise BP, respectively. Absolute CBF measurements from microspheres were then used to calibrate laser Doppler measurements to calculate the relationship between CBF and BP, i.e., \u201ccerebral autoregulation curves.\u201d Un-operated and sham-operated groups exhibited similar cerebral autoregulatory curves, showing comparable levels of relatively constant CBF over a range of BP from ~80 mmHg to ~130 mmHg. In contrast, SAH animals exhibited a narrower autoregulatory range of BP, which was primarily due to a decrease in the upper limit of BP whereby cerebral autoregulation was maintained. Importantly, SAH animals also exhibited a marked decrease in CBF throughout the entire range of BP. In sum, this study provides evidence of the dramatic reduction in cortical CBF and the diminished range of autoregulation after SAH. Furthermore, this novel methodology should pave the way for future studies examining pathological mechanisms and/or therapeutic strategies targeting impaired cerebral autoregulation, a pathology common to many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders.",

        "title": "Fluoxetine attenuates apoptosis in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage through Notch1/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe brain condition associated with a significantly high incidence and mortality. As a consequence of SAH, early brain injury (EBI) may contribute to poor SAH patient outcomes. Apoptosis is a signaling pathway contributing to post-SAH early brain injury and the diagnosis of the disease. Fluoxetine is a well-studied serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, its role in apoptosis has not been clearly understood. The present investigation assessed the effects of Fluoxetine in apoptosis and the potential Notch1/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway in EBI after SAH. Adult C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to SAH. Study mice (56) were randomly divided into 4 groups: the surgery without SAH (sham (n = 8), SAH+ vehicle; (SAH+V) (n = 16), surgery+ Fluoxetine (Fluox), (n = 16) and SAH+ Fluoxetine (n = 16). Various parameters were investigated 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after induction of SAH. Western blot analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry were carried out in every experimental group. According to the findings, the SAH downregulated NOTCH1 signaling pathway, Jlk6 inhibited Notch1, Notch1 inactivation increased apoptotic protein expression and suppressed Bax, and cytochrome C. Fluoxetine reversed the effects of notch1 inhibition in SAH. The Neuroprotective Fluoxetine effects involved suppression of apoptosis post-SAH. In summary, early Fluoxetine treatment significantly attenuates apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins after 72 h post-SAH. Fluoxetine may ameliorate early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage through anti-apoptotic effects and Notch1/ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Graphical Abstract",
