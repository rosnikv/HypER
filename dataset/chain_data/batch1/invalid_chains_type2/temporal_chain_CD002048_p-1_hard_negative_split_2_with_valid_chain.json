        "abstract": "A cross sectional analysis of the correlation between clinical, laboratory, and radiological markers of disease activity in 98 patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reported. The median age was 38 years, the median age at onset of disease 29 years, and the median duration of disease seven years. The Keitel function test (KFT) showed good correlation with the Ritchie articular index (RAI) (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.5) and the disability questionnaire (DQ) (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.6). The RAI and DQ correlated weakly with laboratory variables, while the KFT showed significant correlation with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and plasma viscosity (PV) (p less than 0.001; r = 0.4; 0.3; 0.4). Only the KFT showed significant correlations with bone mass measurements (p less than 0.01; r = -0.3; -0.4), and the Larsen index at the right wrist (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.4). Consensus analysis suggested that the KFT is a useful single clinical test of disease activity in RA. The hand functional index (HFI), a component of the KFT, showed significant correlation with the total KFT (r = 0.9). Prospective drug trials are needed to establish the value of the HFI in the monitoring of patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare sleep-spindle incidence (number of spindles per minute of non-rapid eye movement [NREM] stage 2 sleep) and duration, spindle wave time (seconds per epoch in NREM stage 2 sleep), spindle frequency activity, and pain measures (pressure pain threshold, number of tender points, skinfold tenderness) between midlife women with fibromyalgia (FM) and moderate to high pain to a control group of sedentary women without pain. A second goal was to explore the extent to which pain pressure thresholds, age, and depression explain the variance in spindle incidence.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cross-sectional descriptive study.\n\n\nSETTING\nA university-based sleep research laboratory and a referral clinic for chronic fatigue and pain.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nThirty-seven medication-free women with FM (mean age, 44.9 +/- 8 years) and 30 women with self-reported good sleep and no pain (mean age, 44.1 +/- 7.7 years) completed a psychiatric interview and the Beck Depression Inventory prior to 2 consecutive nights of polysomnography, with pain measures obtained in the morning. Time domain analysis of spindle incidence and spectral analysis of spindle frequency activity were conducted on night 2 of polysomnography recordings.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nNA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen with FM had fewer mean spindles per minute of NREM stage 2 sleep and lower mean spindle time per epoch of NREM stage 2 sleep (both P values < .02), but mean spindle duration, although slightly shorter, was not statistically significantly different (P < .06) compared to control women. Women with FM had a lower mean pressure pain threshold, a higher average number of positive tender points, and higher skinfold tenderness compared to control women (all P values < .001). Group differences in spindle frequency activity were found after controlling for age, depression, and psychiatric diagnosis in a general linear model (P < .02). One-way analysis of variance revealed significantly lower spindle activity in the 3 frequency bins (12-12.5 Hz, 13-13.5 Hz, 14-14.5 Hz) at C3 (all P values < .04), Fz (all P values < .02), and Cz (all P values < .02). Finally, after controlling for age and depression, pain pressure threshold significantly predicted spindles per minute and spindle time per epoch of NREM stage 2 sleep (r2 = .26; P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWomen with FM and pain have fewer sleep spindles and reduced electroencephalogram power in spindle frequency activity compared to control women of similar age. These data imply that some aspect of thalamocortical mechanisms of spindle generation might be impaired in FM.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nChronic widespread pain (CWP) is strongly associated with psychosocial distress both in a clinical setting and in the community. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of measures of psychosocial distress, health-seeking behaviour, sleep problems and traumatic life events to the development of new cases of CWP in the community.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a population-based prospective study, 3171 adults aged 25-65 yrs free of CWP were followed-up 15 months later to identify those with new CWP. Baseline data were available on their scores from a number of psychological scales including Illness Attitude Scales (IAS), Somatic Symptom Checklist (SSC), Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale, Sleep Problems Scale, and Life Events Inventory.\n\n\nRESULTS\n324 subjects [10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2, 11.3] developed new CWP at follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, three factors independently predicted the development of CWP: scoring three or more on the SSC [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1], scoring eight or more on the Illness Behaviour subscale of the IAS (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.3, 4.8), and nine or more on the Sleep Problem Scale (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6, 3.2). Subjects exposed to all three factors were at 12 times the odds of new CWP than those with low scores on all scales.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSubjects are at substantial increased odds of developing CWP if they display features of somatization, health-seeking behaviour and poor sleep. Psychosocial distress has a strong aetiological influence on CWP.",

        "abstract": "Objectives. Poor sleep is associated with chronic widespread pain (CWP). Conversely, good-quality sleep may play a role in the resolution of pain symptoms. Sleep is a multidimensional construct, comprising a number of diverse components. The aims of the current study were to examine the hypotheses that: (i) good sleep quality would predict the resolution of CWP, (ii) restorative sleep would predict the resolution of CWP and (iii) that these relationships would be independent of confounding psychological factors. Methods. Subjects in a population-based prospective study completed a pain questionnaire at baseline from which subjects with CWP were identified. Baseline sleep was measured using the Estimation of Sleep Problems Scale which measures sleep onset, maintenance, early wakening and restorative sleep. The questionnaire also contained scales examining psychosocial status. Subjects were followed up 15 months later and pain status was assessed. Results. A total of 1061 subjects reported CWP at baseline of whom 679 (75% of eligible subjects) responded at follow-up. Of those, a total of 300 (44%) no longer satisfied criteria for CWP. Univariate analysis revealed that three of the four sleep components were associated with the resolution of CWP: rapid sleep onset, odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.5; absence of early wakening, OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.4; and restorative sleep, OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.5, 4.8. After adjusting for the effect of psychosocial factors, which may have confounded the relationship, only restorative sleep (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.02, 3.8) was associated. Conclusions. Self-reported restorative sleep was independently associated with the resolution of CWP and return to musculoskeletal health.",

        "abstract": "There is evidence that virtual reality (VR) pain distraction is effective at improving pain-related outcomes. However, more research is needed to investigate VR environments with other pain-related goals. The main aim of this study was to compare the differential effects of two VR environments on a set of pain-related and cognitive variables during a cold pressor experiment. One of these environments aimed to distract attention away from pain (VRD), whereas the other was designed to enhance pain control (VRC). Participants were 77 psychology students, who were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions during the cold pressor experiment: (a) VRD, (b) VRC, or (c) Non-VR (control condition). Data were collected regarding both pain-related variables (intensity, tolerance, threshold, time perception, and pain sensitivity range) and cognitive variables (self-efficacy and catastrophizing). Results showed that in comparison with the control condition, the VRC intervention significantly increased pain tolerance, the pain sensitivity range, and the degree of time underestimation. It also increased self-efficacy in tolerating pain and led to a reduction in reported helplessness. The VRD intervention significantly increased the pain threshold and pain tolerance in comparison with the control condition, but it did not affect any of the cognitive variables. Overall, the intervention designed to enhance control seems to have a greater effect on the cognitive variables assessed. Although these results need to be replicated in further studies, the findings suggest that the VRC intervention has considerable potential in terms of increasing self-efficacy and modifying the negative thoughts that commonly accompany pain problems.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) mental health therapy has been studied extensively, and some of the resulting interventions are already used in clinical practice. However, high-quality VR systems are still relatively expensive. There are some indications that a cheaper, low-quality VR system produces different effects in its users, though studies remain scarce. We theorize that the effectiveness of a VR intervention is determined partly by how well it directs attention towards or away from the users real body. We therefore propose a study comparing how image-quality and biofeedback during a breathing task affect anxiety levels. We hypothesize that high image quality distracts from the task, making the intervention less effective. Conversely, placing biofeedback in the virtual environment could direct attention back to the users body, increasing effectiveness. Initial results suggest individual differences in how attention is managed. A full-scale study could inform a more structured, attentionbased design approach towards creating VR interventions.",
