        "title": "The Efficacy of Acarbose in the Treatment of Patients with NonInsulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: A Multicenter, Controlled Clinical Trial",
        "abstract": "The high morbidity and mortality and the increasing health care costs associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [1-4] suggest that current treatment strategies are unsatisfactory. Persisting hyperglycemia has been linked to the development of diabetic complications [5] and to the exaggeration of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion that characterizes the pathophysiology of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [6-9]. Diet therapy remains the cornerstone of the treatment strategies for noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; it is intended to achieve and maintain ideal body weight and to reverse, at least partially, the metabolic abnormalities associated with the disease [10, 11]. Sustained weight loss, however, is rarely attained. When diet fails, oral hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylurea or biguanide or both are added [12, 13]. These have been shown to increase fasting plasma glucose levels, but postprandial hyperglycemia persists in more than 60% of patients and probably accounts for sustained increases in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels [14]. Furthermore, secondary failure to oral agents is common, and more than 25% of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus require insulin to achieve acceptable glycemic control [15]. Insulin therapy, however, may promote weight gain and exacerbate insulin resistance [15]. Slowly absorbable or lente carbohydrates and high-fiber diets have been proposed as ways to delay glucose absorption and thus to blunt the postprandial increase in plasma glucose and insulin levels [16, 17]. Although these dietary manipulations have been shown to be effective, most patients find the regimen difficult to follow. An alternative approach to the problem of postprandial hyperglycemia is to use competitive inhibitors of small intestine brush-border -glucosidases such as acarbose [18-20]. Acarbose reduces postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses [21, 22] and may improve metabolic control in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus when combined with diet alone [23] or with sulfonylurea [24], but it was of no benefit when added to combined sulfonylurea and biguanide in one study [25]. However, most previous studies using acarbose were usually short or medium term, were often uncontrolled, and frequently had small numbers of patients [20]. No study has been done of acarbose in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who were being treated with insulin. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of acarbose in improving the metabolic control of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that was not well controlled by diet alone, diet and metformin, diet and sulfonylurea, or diet and insulin. We also evaluated the safety and tolerability of acarbose during the 1-year study period; detailed data will be reported in a separate paper (Ross SA, Chiasson JL, Josse RG, Hunt JA, Palmason C, Rodger NW, et al. The safety of acarbose in the treatment of patients with NIDDM. A Multicenter Trial. In preparation), but a summary of our major findings is included in this report. Methods Patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of at least 6 months' duration, the diagnosis of which was based on World Health Organization criteria [26], were recruited from among the seven participating facilities: Camp Hill Medical Center, Halifax, Canada; Hopital Hotel-Dieu de Montreal, Montreal Canada; St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada; St. Joseph's Hospital, London, Canada; Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Center, Edmonton, Canada; Foothills Hospital, Calgary, Canada; and Lion's Gate Hospital, Vancouver, Canada. Patients were recruited from the following four treatment groups: diet alone; diet and metformin; diet and sulfonylurea; and diet and insulin. Hemoglobin A1c levels at entry had to be greater than 7.0%, except in patients treated with diet alone, whose levels had to be greater than 6.5%. All patients had normal plasma creatinine levels and liver function test results. Patients with hypertension were included if their blood pressure was well controlled with antihypertensive medication; patients receiving therapy with -blockers or thiazide diuretics were excluded. All patients with documented gastrointestinal disease and those taking medications likely to alter gut motility or absorption were excluded, as were patients taking medications to lower serum lipid levels. All patients were placed on a weight-maintaining diet [27] and continued to take their hypoglycemic medication. After a 6-week pretreatment period, the patients in each treatment group were randomly assigned to receive either acarbose or placebo for 1 year. Patients were asked to take study medication with the first bite of each meal three times daily. The initial dose was 50 mg and, if necessary, was titrated upward on subsequent visits to 100 mg, and finally to a maximum of 200 mg. The dose was increased if the postprandial plasma glucose level was greater than 10 mmol/L and was adjusted according to the patients' tolerance to the drug. If the postprandial plasma glucose level was 10 mmol/L or less, the concurrent hypoglycemic medication was decreased by approximately 25%. Drug and dietary compliance was verified by pill counts at each visit and by 3-day recall nutritional diaries every 3 months. The efficacy values were measured before random selection and every 3 months throughout the study period. At those visits, fasting blood samples were drawn for HbA1c, plasma glucose, serum C-peptide, and serum lipid profiles. The patients were then given a standard breakfast of Enrich (450 kcal; Ross Laboratories, Montreal, Canada); this liquid meal contains 55% carbohydrates (61% starch, 29% sucrose, and 10% soya polysaccharide), 30.5% lipids, and 14.5% proteins. Acarbose or placebo was taken with the first sip of the liquid meal. The test meal was ingested over 10 minutes, and blood samples were drawn at 60, 90, and 120 minutes for plasma glucose and serum C-peptide levels. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each facility, and all patients gave informed consent. Plasma glucose levels were measured at each facility using the hexokinase method [28]; all other values were measured in a laboratory in Toronto. The HbA1c levels were measured using the mini-column chromatography technique (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California; normal range, 3.8% to 6.3%). Serum C-peptide levels were measured by radioimmunoassay [29]. Serum lipid levels were measured at the Lipid Research Laboratory at the University of Toronto, which is certified by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-Centers for Disease Control Lipid Standardization Program [30]. Samples were analyzed using the Technicon RA1000 and Technicon enzymatic reagents for total cholesterol (Technicon method SM4-0139G86), triglycerides (Technicon method SM4-0173G90), and triglyceride blank (reagent no. T01-2013-01) (Technicon-Miles, Mississauga, Ontario) [31]. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was measured as the cholesterol in the supernatant after precipitation of the non-HDL cholesterol using dextran sulfate magnesium chloride [31]. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was calculated for samples in which the triglyceride concentration was less than 4.5 mmol/L using the following formula: LDL = total cholesterol -(HDL + triglycerides)/2.2 [32]. The safety and tolerability of acarbose were assessed every 3 months throughout the study. Complete blood count and biochemistry profiles were done to check for toxicity, and possible malabsorption was assessed by measuring serum vitamins A, D, folate, and B12 and the minerals Fe, Zn, Mn, Mg, Cu, Cd, and Se. When adverse events and side effects occurred, they were documented and a questionnaire on symptoms was administered. Hypoglycemic reactions (plasma glucose levels <3.5 mmol/L) were also documented. The results of the safety parameters will be presented in detail and discussed in a separate paper (Ross SA, Chiasson JL, Josse RG, Hunt JA, Palmason C, Rodger NW, et al. The safety of acarbose in the treatment of patients with NIDDM. A Multicenter Trial. In preparation.) Sample size was calculated using a two-tailed of 0.025 (Bonferroni correction for two primary efficacy variables), power of 90%; the mean HbA1c difference was 1% between acarbose and placebo with a standard deviation of 1.2%. The four groups were treated as four separate studies. The total number of patients needed was calculated to be 76 for each treatment group: 38 for acarbose and 38 for placebo; thus, 304 patients were needed. Allowing for an approximately 15% dropout rate, we estimated that at least 350 patients should be enrolled. The primary analyses were comparisons of changes in HbA1c and plasma glucose values (incremental area under the curve, or curve area) between baseline and end of treatment. The fasting plasma glucose level was analyzed as a secondary variable. Unpaired t-tests were done to obtain P values. Patients were considered invalid for efficacy analysis if they dropped out or if they required an increase in concomitant hypoglycemic medication within 60 days of random assignment. The concomitant hypoglycemic medication was increased if patients became symptomatic or if fasting plasma glucose levels increased to 15 mmol/L or more. If these events occurred after 60 days, intent-to-treat analysis was done using the data from the last valid visit. The data on HbA1c and the plasma glucose curve area were also analyzed over time using repeated-measures analysis of covariance. The model included the following independent factors: treatment and facility as main effects, treatment by facility interaction and baseline values as covariates, and values at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months as the dependent factors [33]. Incremental area under the curve was calculated using the trapezoidal rule after subtraction of the fasting ",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To study the effect of acarbose, an \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor, on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin and insulin sensitivity in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Subjects with IGT were randomly treated in a double-blind fashion with placebo (n = 10) or acarbose (n = 8) at 100 mg t.i.d. for 4 months. All subjects were submitted before randomization and at the end of the study to a standardized breakfast and a 12-h daytime plasma glucose and plasma insulin profile, and insulin sensitivity was measured as steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) using the insulin suppression test. RESULTS While placebo had no effect on postprandial plasma glucose and plasma insulin incremental area under the curve (AUC) (3.03 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 3.76 \u00b1 0.6 mmol\u00b7h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121, P = NS; 1,488 \u00b1 229 vs. 1,609 \u00b1 253 pmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121, P = NS), acarbose resulted in a significant reduction for both glucose (1.44 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 4.45 \u00b1 0.9 mmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121, P = 0.002) and insulin (626.7 \u00b1 104.3 vs. 1,338.3 \u00b1 220.5 pmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121, P = 0.003). The reduction in 12-h plasma glucose and insulin AUC on acarbose (11.2 \u00b1 2.1 mmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121 and 7.5 \u00b1 0.7 nmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121) was significantly greater than that on placebo (4.0 \u00b1 1.6 mmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121 and 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 nmol \u00b7 h\u22121 \u00b7 l\u22121) (P = 0.014 and 0.041). While SSPG was not affected by placebo (13.9 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 13.8 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/l; P = NS), it was significantly improved by acarbose (10.9 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 13.1 \u00b1 1.5 mmol/l, P < 0.004) and was also significantly different from placebo at 4 months (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that in subjects with IGT, acarbose treatment decreases postprandial plasma glucose and insulin and improves insulin sensitivity. Acarbose may therefore be potentially useful to prevent the progression of IGT to NIDDM.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo revise and expand the 1992 edition of the clinical practice guidelines for the management of diabetes in Canada incorporating recent advances in diagnosis and outpatient management of diabetes mellitus and to identify and assess the evidence supporting these recommendations.\n\n\nOPTIONS\nAll aspects of ambulatory diabetes care, including organization, responsibilities, classification, diagnosis, management of metabolic disorders, and methods for screening, prevention and treatment of complications in all forms of diabetes were reviewed, revised as required and expressed as a set of recommendations.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nReclassification of types of diabetes based on pathogenesis; increased sensitivity of diagnostic criteria; recommendations for screening for diabetes; improved delivery of care; recommendations for tighter metabolic control; and optimal methods for screening, prevention and treatment of complications of diabetes.\n\n\nEVIDENCE\nAll recommendations were developed using a justifiable and reproducible process involving an explicit method for the citation and evaluation of the supporting evidence.\n\n\nVALUES\nAll recommendations were reviewed by an expert committee that included people with diabetes, family physicians, dietitians, nurses, diabetologists, as well as other subspecialists and methodologists from across Canada.\n\n\nBENEFITS, HARM AND COSTS\nMore aggressive screening strategies and more sensitive testing and diagnostic procedures will allow earlier detection and management of diabetes. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that this will lead to savings in health care costs relating to diabetes care by reducing the incidence of complications of diabetes. Similarly, tighter metabolic control in most people with diabetes, through intensive diabetes management, seeks to reduce the incidence of complications and, hence, their associated social and economic burdens.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThis document contains numerous detailed recommendations pertaining to all aspects of ambulatory diabetes care, ranging from service delivery to prevention and treatment of diabetes-related complications. The terms \"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" and \"non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" should be replaced by the terms \"type 1\" and \"type 2\" diabetes. Testing for diabetes using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level should be performed every 3 years in those over 45 years of age. More frequent or earlier testing should be considered for people with additional specific risk factors for diabetes. The FPG level at which diabetes is diagnosed should be reduced from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol/L to improve the sensitivity of the main diagnostic criterion and reduce the number of missed diagnoses. Depending on the type of diabetes and the therapy required to achieve euglycemia, people with diabetes should generally strive for close metabolic control to achieve optimal glucose levels. This entails receiving appropriate diabetes education through a diabetes health care team, diligent self-monitoring of blood glucose, attention to lifestyle and adjustments in diet and physical activity, and the appropriate and stepwise use of oral agents and insulin therapies needed to maintain glycemic control. Also highlighted is the need for appropriate surveillance programs for complications and management options.\n\n\nVALIDATION\nAll recommendations were graded according to the strength of the evidence and consensus of all relevant stakeholders. Collateral efforts of the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization and the input of international experts were also considered throughout the revision process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To determine the relation between systolic blood pressure over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: 23 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Participants: 4801 white, Asian Indian, and Afro-Caribbean UKPDS patients, whether randomised or not to treatment, were included in analyses of incidence; of these, 3642 were included in analyses of relative risk. Outcome measures: Primary predefined aggregate clinical outcomes: any complications or deaths related to diabetes and all cause mortality. Secondary aggregate outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, lower extremity amputation (including death from peripheral vascular disease), and microvascular disease (predominantly retinal photocoagulation). Single end points: non-fatal heart failure and cataract extraction. Risk reduction associated with a 10 mm Hg decrease in updated mean systolic blood pressure adjusted for specific confounders Results: The incidence of clinical complications was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure, except for cataract extraction. Each 10 mm Hg decrease in updated mean systolic blood pressure was associated with reductions in risk of 12% for any complication related to diabetes (95% confidence interval 10% to 14%, P<0.0001), 15% for deaths related to diabetes (12% to 18%, P<0.0001), 11% for myocardial infarction (7% to 14%, P<0.0001), and 13% for microvascular complications (10% to 16%, P<0.0001). No threshold of risk was observed for any end point. Conclusions: In patients with type 2 diabetes the risk of diabetic complications was strongly associated with raised blood pressure. Any reduction in blood pressure is likely to reduce the risk of complications, with the lowest risk being in those with systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg.",

        "abstract": "The optimal BP target for patients receiving hemodialysis is unknown. We randomized 126 hypertensive patients on hemodialysis to a standardized predialysis systolic BP of 110-140 mmHg (intensive arm) or 155-165 mmHg (standard arm). The primary objectives were to assess feasibility and safety and inform the design of a full-scale trial. A secondary objective was to assess changes in left ventricular mass. Median follow-up was 365 days. In the standard arm, the 2-week moving average systolic BP did not change significantly during the intervention period, but in the intensive arm, systolic BP decreased from 160 mmHg at baseline to 143 mmHg at 4.5 months. From months 4-12, the mean separation in systolic BP between arms was 12.9 mmHg. Four deaths occurred in the intensive arm and one death occurred in the standard arm. The incidence rate ratios for the intensive compared with the standard arm (95% confidence intervals) were 1.18 (0.40 to 3.33), 1.61 (0.87 to 2.97), and 3.09 (0.96 to 8.78) for major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and vascular access thrombosis, respectively. The intensive and standard arms had similar median changes (95% confidence intervals) in left ventricular mass of -0.84 (-17.1 to 10.0) g and 1.4 (-11.6 to 10.4) g, respectively. Although we identified a possible safety signal, the small size and short duration of the trial prevent definitive conclusions. Considering the high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events in patients receiving hemodialysis, a full-scale trial is needed to assess potential benefits of intensive hypertension control in this population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEvidence on the utility of ambulatory BP monitoring for risk prediction has been scarce and inconclusive in patients on hemodialysis. In addition, in cardiac diseases such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation (common among patients on hemodialysis), studies have found that parameters such as systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) have inverse or nonlinear (U-shaped) associations with mortality.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn total, 344 patients on hemodialysis (105 with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or both) underwent ambulatory BP monitoring for 24 hours, starting before a dialysis session. The primary end point was all-cause mortality; the prespecified secondary end point was cardiovascular mortality. We performed linear and nonlinear Cox regression analyses for risk prediction to determine the associations between BP and study end points.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the mean 37.6-month follow-up, 115 patients died (47 from a cardiovascular cause). SBP and PP showed a U-shaped association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the cohort. In linear subgroup analysis, SBP and PP were independent risk predictors and showed a significant inverse relationship to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation or heart failure. In patients without these conditions, these associations were in the opposite direction. SBP and PP were significant independent risk predictors for cardiovascular mortality; PP was a significant independent risk predictor for all-cause mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides evidence for the U-shaped association between peripheral ambulatory SBP or PP and mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Furthermore, it suggests that underlying cardiac disease can explain the opposite direction of associations.",

        "abstract": "Increased short-term blood pressure (BP) variability is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. The present study investigated the long-term prognostic significance of the short-term blood pressure variability in patients on hemodialysis. A total of 149 patients (53.0% male; mean age: 54.5\u00b115.1 years) receiving regular hemodialysis for >6 months were enrolled. They completed a 44-hour (excluding the hemodialysis session) ambulatory BP monitoring and comprehensive hemodynamic assessments, including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and pressure waveform decomposition (forward and backward wave amplitude). Blood pressure variability parameters, including average real variability (ARV) of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure (ARVp) during daytime, nighttime, and overall 44 hours were calculated. During a median follow-up of 14 years, 78 deaths (52.4%) were confirmed. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, none of the ambulatory BP parameters were predictive of mortality. In contrast, nighttime ARVp was consistently and significantly associated with all-cause mortality in multivariable Cox models adjusting for age, sex, albumin, hemodialysis treatment adequacy, and 44-hour systolic BP (continuous variable analysis, per 1-SD, hazard ratio=1.348; 95% CI, 1.029-1.767; categorical variable analysis, \u22658.5 versus <8.5 mm Hg; hazard ratio=1.825; 95% CI, 1.074-3.103). Forward wave amplitude and 44-hour systolic BP were identified as the 2 most important determinants of nighttime ARVp. Addition of nighttime ARVp to the base model significantly improved prediction of all-cause mortality (Net reclassification improvement =0.198; P=0.0012). In hemodialysis patients, increased short-term nighttime pulse pressure variability but not ambulatory BP levels were significantly predictive of long-term all-cause mortality.",

        "abstract": "Hemodialysis (HD) remains the most utilized treatment for End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) globally, mainly as conventional HD administered in 4 h sessions thrice weekly. Despite advances in HD delivery, patients with ESKD carry a heavy cardiovascular morbidity and mortality burden. This is associated with cardiac remodeling, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial stunning, hypertension, decreased heart rate variability, sleep apnea, coronary calcification and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, intensive HD regimens closer to renal physiology were developed. They include longer, more frequent dialysis or both. Among them, Nocturnal Hemodialysis (NHD), carried out at night while asleep, provides efficient dialysis without excessive interference with daily activities. This regimen is closer to the physiology of the native kidneys. By providing increased clearance of small and middle molecular weight molecules, NHD can ameliorate uremic symptoms, control hyperphosphatemia, improve quality of life by allowing a liberal diet and free time during the day facilitates vocational rehabilitation. Lastly, it improves reproductive biology leading to successful pregnancies. Conversion from conventional to NHD is followed by improved blood pressure control with fewer medications, regression of LVH, improved LV function, improved sleep apnea, and stabilization of coronary calcifications. These beneficial effects have been associated, among others, with better extracellular fluid volume control, improved endothelial dependent vasodilation, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased plasma norepinephrine levels and restoration of heart rate variability. Some of these effects represent improvements in outcomes used as surrogates of hard outcomes related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this review we consider the cardiovascular effects of NHD.",

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is significantly valuable for assessing the volume status of hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this article, we explore the correlation between the volume index measured by BIA and the cardiac function index assessed by echocardiography (ECG) in HD patients. Methods Between April and November 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving randomly selected 126 maintenance HD patients. Comprehensive data on medical history and laboratory test results were collected. Subsequently, we investigated the correlation between volume indices measured by BIA and cardiac function parameters by ECG. Results We discovered a significant correlation between the volume indices measured by BIA and various parameter of cardiac function. The Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) group exhibited higher levels of the percentage of Extracellular Water (ECW%) and the percentage of Total Body Water (TBW%) compared to the Non-LVH group. Extracellular Water (ECW) and Third Interstitial Fluid Volume (TSFV) were identified as independent risk factors for Left Ventricular Mass (LVM), and both demonstrated a high predictive value for LVM. ECW% emerged as an independent risk factor for the Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI), with a high predictive value for LVMI. Conclusion ECW and TSFV were found to be positively associated with cardiac function parameters in HD patients.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the correlation between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and cardiac function parameters by echocardiography (ECG) in hemodialysis (HD) patients, which is related to the cardiovascular effects of hemodialysis discussed in the source paper. However, it does not directly build upon or use the findings of the source paper as a sub-hypothesis."
