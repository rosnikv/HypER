        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite current treatments, patients who have acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation have high rates of major vascular events. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel when given with aspirin in such patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 12,562 patients who had presented within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms to receive clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, followed by 75 mg once daily) (6259 patients) or placebo (6303 patients) in addition to aspirin for 3 to 12 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe first primary outcome--a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--occurred in 9.3 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 11.4 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk with clopidogrel as compared with placebo, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). The second primary outcome--the first primary outcome or refractory ischemia--occurred in 16.5 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 18.8 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94; P<0.001). The percentages of patients with in-hospital refractory or severe ischemia, heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also significantly lower with clopidogrel. There were significantly more patients with major bleeding in the clopidogrel group than in the placebo group (3.7 percent vs. 2.7 percent; relative risk, 1.38; P=0.001), but there were not significantly more patients with episodes of life-threatening bleeding (2.2 percent [corrected] vs. 1.8 percent; P=0.13) or hemorrhagic strokes (0.1 percent vs. 0.1 percent).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has beneficial effects in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. However, the risk of major bleeding is increased among patients treated with clopidogrel.",

        "title": "Duration of dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "AIMS\nDual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) is a cornerstone in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but the optimal treatment duration is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of DAPT duration with clopidogrel and aspirin on the recurrence of ischaemic events and bleeding in a large, unselected ACS population.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe performed a prospective, observational cohort study of patients in Sweden (n = 56 440) admitted for ACS, with prescribed DAPT and hospitalized between January 2006 and July 2010. Patients were obtained from the SWEDEHEART register and data were merged with registers from the National Board of Health and Welfare. Depending on dispensed clopidogrel tablets, patients were divided into groups based on DAPT duration with clopidogrel and aspirin (3 months: 84-100 clopidogrel tablets (t); >3 months: >100 t; 6 months: 168-200 t; >6 months: >200 t). For the combined primary endpoint, defined as all-cause death, stroke, or re-infarction, only patients with an uneventful first 3-month period (no death, stroke, re-infarction, bleeding, stent thrombosis, or revascularization) were included. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 45 events per 1000 person-years in the >3 months DAPT group compared with 65 events per 1000 person-years in the 3 months DAPT group [adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI (0.75; 0.95)]. Bleeding was more common in the >3 months treatment group (adjusted HR 1.56, 95% CI (1.18; 2.07), but the number of events was small. For >6 vs. 6 months DAPT, the adjusted HR for the combined endpoint was 0.75 with 95% CI (0.59; 0.95).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this contemporary, large real-life ACS population, DAPT for more than 3 months compared with a shorter duration was associated with a lower risk of death, stroke, or re-infarction.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov (NCT01623700).",

        "title": "Are at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy needed for all patients with drug-eluting stents? Not all patients with drug-eluting stents need at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy.",
        "abstract": "Drs Becker and Helmy eloquently discuss the putative mechanisms of benefit of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stents and conclude that not all patients are candidates for such an intervention. While I agree with many of their arguments, I believe that 2 counterpoints need to be highlighted. First, both the DAPT study (HR=0.59; CI, 0.45\u20130.78; P <0.001), as well as the PEGASUS- TIMI-54 study (HR=0.83; CI, 0.72\u20130.95; P =0.005) report a significant reduction in non-stent thrombosis-related myocardial infarction. This is true secondary prevention. Second, while 2 trends may coexist in the same cohort, there is no clear evidence that they are related. Are the patients with severe bleeding the ones dying? The incidence of fatal bleeding was similar, and extremely low, in the short versus long DAPT groups in the DAPT study. Even accounting for bleeding-related deaths in DAPT explains only half of the non-cardiovascular deaths observed in the study. Moreover, studies randomizing patients immediately after PCI are very different from those enrolling patients free of events at 6\u201312 months. Finally, the impetus to treat for longer duration patients stented after an acute coronary syndrome may be greater than for those undergoing elective revascularization. While there is no doubt that dogmatic statements such as \u201call patients after [drug-eluting stents]\u2026\u201d are difficult to defend beyond their utility as a point for debate, we need to better understand the risks and benefits of prolonged DAPT and their effect in specific subgroups before potentially writing off a beneficial paradigm.",

        "title": "Drug-eluting balloons in the treatment of de-novo coronary lesions: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials",
        "abstract": "AimThe aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) plus bare-metal stents (BMS) for the treatment of de-novo coronary lesions. Methods and resultsEleven trials involving 1279 patients were included in this study. The main endpoints were as follows: late lumen loss (LLL), binary restenosis, stent thrombosis (ST), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). The definition of MACEs was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Compared with BMS alone, DEB plus BMS showed a lower risk for LLL (P=0.007) and MACEs (P=0.010). There were no significant differences in binary restenosis (P=0.212), ST (P=0.199), death (P=0.141), MI (P=0.439), and TLR (P=0.340). Compared with drug-eluting stents (DES), DEB plus BMS could increase the risk of LLL (P=0.002) and MACEs (P=0.026). The risks of binary restenosis (P=0.113), ST (P=0.832), death (P=0.115), MI (P=0.831), and TLR (P=0.111) were similar between DEB plus BMS and DES. ConclusionDEB plus BMS was better than BMS alone in reducing LLL and MACEs, especially when dilatation was performed after stenting for de-novo coronary lesions, but it was inferior to DES. Therefore, the treatment strategy with DEB plus BMS should not be recommended for de-novo coronary lesions, except for patients who have contraindications for DES.",

The paper's focus on DEBs is not directly related to the source paper's discussion of DAPT for DES."
