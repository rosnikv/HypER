In this randomized controlled trial, hip BMD was measured in postmenopausal women after a 24\u2010week whole body vibration (WBV) training program. Vibration training significantly increased BMD of the hip. These findings suggest that WBV training might be useful in the prevention of osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Deconditioning is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The physiology of vascular adaptation to deconditioning has not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of bed rest deconditioning on vascular dimension and function of leg conduit arteries. In addition, the effectiveness of resistive vibration exercise as a countermeasure for vascular deconditioning during bed rest was evaluated. Sixteen healthy men were randomly assigned to bed rest (BR-Ctrl) or to bed rest with resistive vibration exercise (BR-RVE). Before and after 25 and 52 days of strict horizontal bed rest, arterial diameter, blood flow, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation were measured by echo Doppler ultrasound. In the BR-Ctrl group, the diameter of the common femoral artery decreased by 13 +/- 3% after 25 and 17 +/- 1% after 52 days of bed rest (P < 0.001). In the BR-RVE group this decrease in diameter was significantly attenuated (5 +/- 2% after 25 days and 6 +/- 2% after 52 days, P < 0.01 vs. BR-Ctrl). Baseline blood flow did not change after bed rest in either group. After 52 days of bed rest, FMD and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation of the superficial femoral artery were increased in both groups, possibly by increased nitric oxide sensitivity. In conclusion, bed rest deconditioning is accompanied by a reduction in the diameter of the conduit arteries and by an increased reactivity to nitric oxide. Resistive vibration exercise effectively attenuates the diameter decrease of leg conduit arteries after bed rest.",

        "abstract": "Sedentary behavior has deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, including reduced endothelial functions. A 2-mo bed rest study in healthy women [women international space simulation for exploration (WISE) 2005 program] presented a unique opportunity to analyze the specific effects of prolonged inactivity without other vascular risk factors on the endothelium. We investigated endothelial properties before and after 56 days of bed rest in 8 subjects who performed no exercise (control group: No-EX) and in 8 subjects who regularly performed treadmill exercise in a lower body negative pressure chamber as well as resistance exercise (countermeasure group, EX). A functional evaluation of the microcirculation in the skin was assessed with laser Doppler. We studied endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation using iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively. We also measured circulating endothelial cells (CECs), an index of endothelial damage. In the No-EX group, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly reduced (35.4 +/- 4.8% vs. 24.1 +/- 3.8%, P < 0.05) by bed rest with a significant increase in the number of CECs (3.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 10.6 +/- 2.7 ml(-1), P < 0.05). In the EX group, endothelium-dependent vasodilation and number of CECs were preserved. Our study shows that in humans prolonged bed rest causes impairment of endothelium-dependent function at the microcirculatory level, along with an increase in circulating endothelial cells. Microcirculatory endothelial dysfunction might participate in cardiovascular deconditioning, as well as in several bed rest-induced pathologies. We therefore conclude that the endothelium should be a target for countermeasures during periods of prolonged deconditioning.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nExercise prescriptions for spaceflight include aerobic and resistive countermeasures, yet few studies have evaluated their combined effects on exercise responses after real or simulated microgravity. We hypothesized that upright aerobic capacity (VO2pk) is protected during a 60-d bed rest (BR) in which intermittent (40%-80% pre-BR VO2pk) aerobic exercise (supine treadmill exercise against lower body negative pressure) was performed 2-4 d x wk(-1) and resistive exercise (inertial flywheel exercises) was performed 2-3 d x wk(-1). Further, we hypothesized that ingestion of an amino acid supplement that was shown previously to counteract muscle atrophy, would reduce the decline in VO2pk in nonexercising subjects during BR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-four healthy women (8 nonexercise controls (CON), 8 exercisers (EX), and 8 nonexercisers with nutritional supplementation (NUT)) underwent a 20-d ambulatory baseline period, 60 d of 6 degrees head-down tilt BR, and 21 d of ambulatory recovery. VO2pk was measured pre-BR and on the third day of recovery from BR (R3).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the EX group, VO2pk (mean +/- SE) was not different from pre-BR (-3.3 +/- 1.2%) on R3, although it decreased significantly in the CON (-21.2 +/- 2.1%) and NUT (-25.6 +/- 1.6%) groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results indicate that alternating aerobic and resistive exercise on most days during prolonged microgravity simulated by BR is sufficient to preserve or allow quick recovery of upright aerobic capacity in women but that a nutritional supplementation alone is not effective.",

        "abstract": "Bone loss is a well\u2010documented change during and after long\u2010duration spaceflight. Many types of countermeasures to bone loss have been proposed, including vitamin K supplementation. The objective of this series of studies was to measure change in vitamin K status in response to microgravity under a variety of spaceflight and spaceflight analog (model) conditions, including long\u2010duration spaceflight studies (n\u2009=\u200915), three bed rest studies (n\u2009=\u200915, 49, and 24), and a 14\u2010day saturation dive (n\u2009=\u20096). In crew members who flew 2\u20136 months on the International Space Station, in\u2010flight and postflight plasma phylloquinone concentrations were unchanged from the preflight mean. Consistent with this finding, urinary \u03b3\u2010carboxyglutamic acid (GLA), a measure of vitamin K\u2010dependent protein turnover, did not change in response to flight. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), a measure of vitamin K function, was generally unchanged in response to flight. Spaceflight findings were corroborated by findings of no changes in phylloquinone, urinary GLA, or %ucOC during or after bed rest in three separate bed rest studies (21\u201390 days in duration) or after a 14\u2010day saturation dive.

        "abstract": "Exercise has shown little success in mitigating bone loss from long\u2010duration spaceflight. The first crews of the International Space Station (ISS) used the \u201cinterim resistive exercise device\u201d (iRED), which allowed loads of up to 297 lbf (or 1337 N) but provided little protection of bone or no greater protection than aerobic exercise. In 2008, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which allowed absolute loads of up to 600 lbf (1675 N), was launched to the ISS. We report dietary intake, bone densitometry, and biochemical markers in 13 crewmembers on ISS missions from 2006 to 2009. Of these 13, 8 had access to the iRED and 5 had access to the ARED. In both groups, bone\u2010specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase during flight toward the end of the mission (p\u2009=\u20090.06) and increased 30 days after landing (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Most markers of bone resorption were also increased in both groups during flight and 30 days after landing (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Bone densitometry revealed significant interactions (time and exercise device) for pelvis bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (p\u2009<\u20090.01), hip femoral neck BMD (p\u2009<\u20090.05), trochanter BMD (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and total hip BMD (p\u2009<\u20090.05). These variables were unchanged from preflight only for ARED crewmembers, who also returned from flight with higher percent lean mass and lower percent fat mass. Body mass was unchanged after flight in both groups. All crewmembers had nominal vitamin D status (75\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u2009nmol/L) before and during flight. These data document that resistance exercise, coupled with adequate energy intake (shown by maintenance of body mass determined by dual\u2010energy X\u2010ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and vitamin D, can maintain bone in most regions during 4\u2010 to 6\u2010month missions in microgravity. This is the first evidence that improving nutrition and resistance exercise during spaceflight can attenuate the expected BMD deficits previously observed after prolonged missions. \u00a9 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Mechanical unloading induces muscle atrophy and bone loss; however, the time course and interdependence of these effects is not well defined. We subjected 4\u2010month\u2010old C57BL/6J mice to hindlimb suspension (HLS) for 3 weeks, euthanizing 12 to 16 mice on day (D) 0, 7, 14, and 21. Lean mass was 7% to 9% lower for HLS versus control from D7\u201321. Absolute mass of the gastrocnemius (gastroc) decreased 8% by D7, and was maximally decreased 16% by D14 of HLS. mRNA levels of Atrogin\u20101 in the gastroc and quadriceps (quad) were increased 99% and 122%, respectively, at D7 of HLS. Similar increases in MuRF1 mRNA levels occurred at D7. Both atrogenes returned to baseline by D14. Protein synthesis in gastroc and quad was reduced 30% from D7\u201314 of HLS, returning to baseline by D21. HLS decreased phosphorylation of SK61, a substrate of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), on D7\u201321, whereas 4E\u2010BP1 was not lower until D21. Cortical thickness of the femur and tibia did not decrease until D14 of HLS. Cortical bone of controls did not change over time. HLS mice had lower distal femur bone volume fraction (\u221222%) by D14; however, the effects of HLS were eliminated by D21 because of the decline of trabecular bone mass of controls. Femur strength was decreased approximately 13% by D14 of HLS, with no change in tibia mechanical properties at any time point. This investigation reveals that muscle atrophy precedes bone loss during unloading and may contribute to subsequent skeletal deficits. Countermeasures that preserve muscle may reduce bone loss induced by mechanical unloading or prolonged disuse. Trabecular bone loss with age, similar to that which occurs in mature astronauts, is superimposed on unloading. Preservation of muscle mass, cortical structure, and bone strength during the experiment suggests muscle may have a greater effect on cortical than trabecular bone. \u00a9 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF\u2010\u03baB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan\u2010caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl\u2010valyl\u2010O\u2010methylaspartyl\u2010[\u20102,6\u2010difluorophenoxy]\u2010methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL\u2010producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and \u00b5CT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3\u2010 and 4\u2010fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3\u2010fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5\u2010fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU\u2010triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, \u00b5CT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse. \u00a9 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways have well established roles in skeletal development, with essential functions in both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. In mice, previous conditional knockout studies suggested distinct roles for FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling at different stages of osteogenesis and a role for FGFR2 in osteoblast maturation. However, the potential for redundancy among FGFRs and the mechanisms and consequences of stage-specific osteoblast lineage regulation were not addressed. Here, we conditionally inactivate Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in mature osteoblasts with an Osteocalcin-Cre or Dentin matrix protein 1-CreER driver. We find that young mice lacking both receptors or only FGFR1 are phenotypically normal. However, after 6 weeks of age these Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double-and Fgfr1 single-conditional knockout mice develop a high bone mass phenotype with increased periosteal apposition, increased endocortical woven bone with increased porosity, and biomechanical properties that reflect increased bone mass but reduced material properties. Histopathological and gene expression analyses show that this phenotype is preceded by a striking loss of osteocytes, and gradual activation of the Wnt/\u03b2Catenin signaling pathway. These data identify a role for FGFR1 signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes that is required for osteocyte survival during postnatal bone growth.
