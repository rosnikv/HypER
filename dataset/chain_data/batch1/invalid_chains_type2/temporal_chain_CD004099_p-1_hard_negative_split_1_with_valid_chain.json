        "title": "Crisis Intervention Program in Newly Diagnosed Diabetic Children",
        "abstract": "A group of 223 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, aged 7\u201324 yr, who had been under the regular care of our clinic up to 15 yr, were rated by two independent judges on a two-level scale of adjustment and maladjustment. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (N = 107) comprised those who had been under care from diagnosis of the disease and had been subjected to the special crisis intervention program offered to every family upon referral of a newly diagnosed patient. Group B (N = 116) comprised patients who were diagnosed and treated initially in a clinic that had no crisis intervention program. Significant differences between the two groups were found in respect to three of the four aspects studied, i.e., compliance, familial relationships, and sociability, with group A showing a better adjustment than group B. There was no significant difference in the fourth aspect studied, i.e., school achievement and work performance. It was found that it took three times the effort, i.e., the time invested in counseling and psychotherapeutic measures, to bring group B to a good level of adjustment than it did to achieve similar results with group A. It is suggested that the initial period after diagnosis of diabetes in a child should be considered a period of crisis, requiring special muitidisciplinary services to reduce future psychosocial maladjustments and improve compliance.",

        "title": "Coping with Predictable Crises of Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Although the role of emotional and psychosocial factors in diabetes is generally appreciated, most health care professionals, diabetic patients, and families of patients have no clear model that clarifies the nature of psychosocial variables and provides defined principles for effective treatment and preventative interventions. A multivariate clinical model for coping with predictable crises of diabetes is presented. The model is based on the constructs of crisis, coping, and social support as well as a developmental and life course perspective. The psychosocial tasks to be addressed in coping with crises, in general, as well as strategies of coping are defined and discussed. The specific predictable crises of diabetes are described with reference to the demands and sources of stress inherent in the critical situations and the associated strategies for coping with them. Special attention is given to coping with the initial diagnosis and onset of the disease, the role of health care professionals, and developmental issues in coping with diabetes.",

This paper deals with the management of diabetes from the perspective of people with diabetes. It is based on the analysis of qualitative data, collected by means of informal interviews. This analysis made it apparent that the entire life of most people with diabetes is dominated not only by the fact that they have to maintain a metabolic balance but also that they have to find an equilibrium in their relationships with others. Walking a fine line was the data-based core category, which analysis of the data singled out as being the most important for the understanding of the meaning and the management of diabetes.",

        "title": "Persons with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: acceptance and coping ability.",
        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe purposes of this study were to describe how persons with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) accept their disease and what sense of coherence they have, in order to determine whether a person's acceptance of the disease is related to his or her sense of coherence. Whether acceptance of the disease and sense of coherence are related to the disease duration, complications of the disease, metabolic control and demographic data would also be determined.\n\n\nDESIGN\nOne hundred and seven, randomly selected, insulin-dependent, diabetic subjects (47 men and 60 women) participated in the study. The Acceptance of Disability Scale Modified (ADM scale), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC scale), a study-specific questionnaire and the patients records were used to collect the data.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nIDDM implies a major change in way of life. Ingrained procedures and patterns of behaviour must be adapted to the disease and its treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results of the present study show that educational level seems to be an important factor for how well a person accepts the disease and the sense of coherence. Persons with higher scores on the ADM and the SOC scales had higher levels of education. Moreover, they also had a better metabolic control. Individuals with a poor metabolic control had more disease-related complications. A significant correlation between the ADM and the SOC scores was found, indicating that persons with a high degree of acceptance of the IDDM also had a high coping capability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is important to individualize the care of subjects with IDDM and to identify the persons with low acceptance of their disease and a low sense of coherence.",

        "abstract": "The coexistence of diabetes and depression occurs frequently among young and middle-age women. Unless one is resourceful, simultaneous management of the symptoms of both conditions is especially challenging. Skills constituting resourcefulness are learned throughout life and are important for the optimal performance of daily activities. Little is known about specific factors that influence resourcefulness. In this study, contextual factors (diabetic and depressive symptoms) and cognitive factors (positive cognitions and acceptance of diabetes) were examined as antecedents of learned resourcefulness in 82 women with type 2 diabetes. Regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms and positive cognitions were significant antecedents of learned resourcefulness: Positive cognitions mediated the effects of depressive symptoms on learned resourcefulness. The findings suggest the need for interventions that focus on development of positive cognitions to better promote resourcefulness in women with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for depression.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInvestigate psychosocial barriers to self-care and the prevalence of depression among Hispanic women with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS\nOne hundred twenty-six (126) Hispanic women living in Miami-Dade, South Florida were recruited through outpatient diabetes clinics, physicians' offices, or community referrals to participate in a cross-sectional survey to assess psychosocial factors that can interfere with type 2 diabetes self-care. The survey collected information on sociodemographics, performance of self-care regimens, a diabetes care profile (support, knowledge, empowerment, and attitudes), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), health locus of control, and perceived stress, as well as other data used to evaluate diabetes status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 4 of the 126 diabetic women interviewed reported having had depression previously assessed. Mean for depression scores was 12.76 +/- 8.71. Scores on the depression inventory indicated depression in 40.6% of subjects, with 23% categorized as mildly, 11.1% moderately, and 6.3% severely depressed. Greater self-assessed depression was associated with poorer self-rated health, understanding of diabetes, and diabetes knowledge scores. Subjects classified as severely depressed had lived with diabetes for a significantly longer mean number of years than those classified as moderately, mildly, or minimally depressed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDepression had not been previously assessed by any healthcare providers seen by participants or addressed in most participants in this study. While the literature abounds with findings on the depression in diabetes and potential for improved compliance when depression is treated, this concept seems to not yet be adopted into mainstream diabetes care for our Hispanic population.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this study was to explore knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about depression among Latinos with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight 90-minute focus groups were conducted, each moderated by a bilingual, bicultural woman. Participants included 45 self-identified Latino adults with diabetes. Discussion topics included diabetes management, perceived control, emotional barriers, conceptualization of depression, and help-seeking behavior. Themes pertinent to depression and emotional health were identified using a combined deductive/inductive approach and an iterative process of consensus coding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants' mean age was 40 years, 44% were male, and most were born in Mexico. The mean time with diabetes was 6.5 years. The primary theme identified was the bidirectional relationship between emotional health and diabetes. Diagnosis of diabetes led to feelings of hopelessness and upset, while difficulty with diabetes management led to feelings of anxiety and depression. Participants felt that being \"stressed out\" or sad directly affected their blood sugar. Participants described factors that influence the relationship between emotions and diabetes, including family and societal stressors, and they reported little discussion of depression with providers. Depression and emotional health are closely associated with diabetes in the minds of these Latino adults. It is important to ask patients with diabetes about their emotional health, to screen for depression, and to elicit preferences about treatment when indicated.",

        "abstract": "Introduction SONRISA is a Spanish/English mental health curriculum toolbox developed for promotores (community health workers) who work with Hispanic clients to prevent or manage diabetes. Promotoras and community members from a community-based project requested their university partner to help promotores address depression observed in their clients with diabetes. Methods Data collection included reviewing existing educational materials and conducting focus groups. Promotoras piloted the first version of SONRISA in a 1-day workshop. Results Four curricula from community agencies were reviewed, and 49 individuals participated in eight focus groups. Promotora feedback during the workshop informed the revision of SONRISA. The community-based participatory approach produced a highly relevant and culturally appropriate toolbox for general use by promotores and their clients. SONRISA provides training material to address depression and diabetes, educational material for clients, and approaches to prevent work-related emotional burnout. Conclusion SONRISA offers an innovative, integrated approach to training promotores to address depression among their clients with chronic illnesses. It is culturally appropriate and adaptable to other populations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective We assessed the feasibility and impact on knowledge, attitudes, and reported practices of psychological first-aid (PFA) training in a sample of Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) members. Data have been limited on the uptake of PFA training in surge responders (eg, MRC) who are critical to community response. Methods Our mixed-methods approach involved self-administered pre- and post-training surveys and within-training focus group discussions of 76 MRC members attending a PFA training and train-the-trainer workshop. Listen, protect, connect (a PFA model for lay persons) focuses on listening and understanding both verbal and nonverbal cues; protecting the individual by determining realistic ways to help while providing reassurance; and connecting the individual with resources in the community. Results From pre- to post-training, perceived confidence and capability in using PFA after an emergency or disaster increased from 71% to 90% (P < .01), but no significant increase was found in PFA-related knowledge. Qualitative analyses suggest that knowledge and intentions to use PFA increased with training. Brief training was feasible, and while results were modest, the PFA training resulted in greater reported confidence and perceived capability in addressing psychological distress of persons affected by public health threats. Conclusion PFA training is a promising approach to improve surge responder confidence and competency in addressing postdisaster needs. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2014;0:1-6)",

        "abstract": "There is an increased focus on the need for collaboration between first responders and the general public. This type of collaboration requires soft skills that are not necessarily included in more traditional command and control trainings for first responders. Learning to collaborate with the general public requires different didactics than learning technical skills. It also requires different support tools; tools that let the trainees experience the engagement with the target group. These didactics and their supporting tools are developed as part of the DRIVER activities. More specifically, two separate but complementary trainings with support tools have been developed in DRIVER. These two trainings will feed into the DRIVER portfolio of solutions. The first training is an Awareness training. The Awareness training will aid professionals to become aware of the possibility to see the general public as a resource. The aim is for first responders to be able to evaluate when the general public can be (safely) involved and what tasks they can (effectively) perform - primarily during the response phase. One scenario has been developed to help first responders practice in a digital environment facilitating the provision of immediate feedback to support efficient achievement of the Awareness training learning objectives. The second training is Psychological First Aid training. This training focuses specifically on psychosocial support from professionals to the general public. The aim is for first responders to be able to recognise and help those people that require immediate psychological first aid during the aftermath of a crisis to reduce initial psychological distress and to support short- and long-term recovery and coping thus supporting the affected people to be active survivors. Three scenarios have been developed to help first responders achieve the Psychological First Aid training learning objectives in a digital learning environment.",
