        "title": "Randomized comparison of coronary stenting with balloon angioplasty in selected patients with acute myocardial infarction.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough the benefits of primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction have been demonstrated, several areas for improvement remain. Therefore, a prospective randomized trial comparing primary stenting with balloon angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction was conducted.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to undergo either primary stenting (n=112) or balloon angioplasty (n=115). The clinical end points were death, recurrent infarction, subsequent bypass surgery, or repeat angioplasty of the infarct-related vessel. The overall mortality rate at 6 months was 2%. Recurrent infarction occurred in 8 patients (7%) after balloon angioplasty and in 1 (1%) after stenting (P=0.036). Subsequent target-vessel revascularization was necessary in 19 (17%) and 4 (4%) patients, respectively (P=0.0016). The cardiac event-free survival rate in the stent group was significantly higher than in the balloon angioplasty group (95% versus 80%; P=0.012).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn selected patients with acute myocardial infarction, primary stenting can be applied safely and effectively, resulting in a lower incidence of recurrent infarction and a significant reduction in the need for subsequent target-vessel revascularization compared with balloon angioplasty.",

        "abstract": "Background Coronary-stent implantation is frequently performed for treatment of acute myocardial infarction. However, few studies have compared stent implantation with primary angioplasty alone. Methods We designed a multicenter study to compare primary angioplasty with angioplasty accompanied by implantation of a heparin-coated Palmaz\u2013Schatz stent. Patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent emergency catheterization and angioplasty. Those with vessels suitable for stenting were randomly assigned to undergo angioplasty with stenting (452 patients) or angioplasty alone (448 patients). Results The mean (\u00b1SD) minimal luminal diameter was larger after stenting than after angioplasty alone (2.56\u00b10.44 mm vs. 2.12\u00b10.45 mm, P<0.001), although fewer patients assigned to stenting had grade 3 blood flow (according to the classification of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) (89.4 percent, vs. 92.7 percent in the angioplasty group; P=0.10). After six months, fewer patients in the stent group tha...",

        "title": "Treatment Algorithms and Critical Pathways for Acute Coronary Syndromes",
        "abstract": "Although numerous clinical trials have identified many advances in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), registries of clinical practice have identified that in clinical practice a large proportion of patients do not receive guideline-recommended therapies. In addition to development and dissemination of national guidelines, there is a need for specific tools to ensure that the guideline recommendations are implemented on a patient-by-patient basis. Better adherence to practice guidelines has been found to be associated with improved outcomes. Critical pathways and/or the process of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) are means of trying to improve care. Critical pathways are standardized protocols that aim to optimize and streamline patient care, which usually involve standardized order sets, (or computerized ones), and/or simple pocket cards, reminders, or checklists of the appropriate therapies. Another key part of an overall CQI effort is to monitor data on performance-i.e. utilization of guideline recommended therapies. Several well-conducted studies, showing that particular use of critical pathways, can lead to improve quality of care.",

This helps explain why reaction to it was so mixed at the Cannes International Film Festival, where I saw its world premiere in 1989 with an audience of international critics and journalists. Spectators applauded at the end, but their clapping seemed driven more by duty than enthusiasm, as if it were de rigueur to cheer a maverick movie by a spunky black filmmaker even if his message seemed cranky or cryptic.
