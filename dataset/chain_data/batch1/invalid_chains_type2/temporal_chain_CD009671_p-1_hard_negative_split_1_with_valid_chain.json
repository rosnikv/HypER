        "abstract": "Recent findings have raised concern about possible associations of high selenium exposure with diabetes and hyperlipidemia in the US, a population with high selenium status. In the UK, a population with lower selenium status, there is little data on the association of selenium status with cardio-metabolic risk factors in the general population. We examined the association of plasma selenium concentration with blood lipids in a nationally representative sample of British adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1042 white participants (aged 19-64 y) in the 2000-2001 UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey. Plasma selenium was measured by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. Total and HDL cholesterol were measured in nonfasting plasma samples. Mean plasma selenium concentration was 1.10 +/- 0.19 micromol/L. The multivariate adjusted differences between the highest (> or =1.20 micromol/L) and lowest (<0.98 micromol/L) quartiles of plasma selenium were 0.39 (95% CI 0.18, 0.60) mmol/L for total cholesterol, 0.38 (0.17, 0.59) for non-HDL cholesterol, and 0.01 (-0.05, 0.07) for HDL cholesterol. Higher plasma selenium (i.e., > or =1.20 micromol/L) was associated with increased total and non-HDL cholesterol levels but not with HDL in the UK adult population. These findings raise additional concern about potential adverse cardio-metabolic effects of high selenium status. Randomized and mechanistic evidence is necessary to assess causality and to evaluate the impact of this association on cardiovascular risk.",

        "title": "Effect of Supplementation With High-Selenium Yeast on Plasma Lipids",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHigh selenium status has been linked to elevated blood cholesterol levels in cross-sectional studies.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on plasma lipids.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study stratified by age and sex. Participants, research nurses, and persons assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment. (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register registration number: ISRCTN25193534)\n\n\nSETTING\n4 general practices in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n501 volunteers aged 60 to 74 years.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nParticipants received selenium, 100 mcg/d (n = 127), 200 mcg/d (n = 127), or 300 mcg/d (n = 126), as high-selenium yeast or a yeast-based placebo (n = 121) for 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nTotal and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were measured in nonfasting plasma samples stored from participants in the UK PRECISE (United Kingdom PREvention of Cancer by Intervention with SElenium) Pilot Study at baseline (n = 454) and at 6 months (n = 394). Non-HDL cholesterol levels were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean plasma selenium concentration was 88.8 ng/g (SD, 19.2) at baseline and increased statistically significantly in the treatment groups. The adjusted difference in change in total cholesterol levels for selenium compared with placebo was -0.22 mmol/L (-8.5 mg/dL) (95% CI, -0.42 to -0.03 mmol/L [-16.2 to -1.2 mg/dL]; P = 0.02) for 100 mcg of selenium per day, -0.25 mmol/L (-9.7 mg/dL) (CI, -0.44 to -0.07 mmol/L [-17.0 to -2.7 mg/dL]; P = 0.008) for 200 mcg of selenium per day, and -0.07 mmol/L (-2.7 mg/dL) (CI, -0.26 to 0.12 mmol/L [-10.1 to 4.6 mg/dL]; P = 0.46) for 300 mcg of selenium per day. Similar reductions were observed for non-HDL cholesterol levels. There was no apparent difference in change in HDL cholesterol levels with 100 and 200 mcg of selenium per day, but the difference was an adjusted 0.06 mmol/L (2.3 mg/dL) (CI, 0.00 to 0.11 mmol/L [0.0 to 4.3 mg/dL]; P = 0.045) with 300 mcg of selenium per day. The total-HDL cholesterol ratio decreased progressively with increasing selenium dose (overall P = 0.01).\n\n\nLIMITATION\nThe duration of supplementation was limited, as was the age range of the participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSelenium supplementation seemed to have modestly beneficial effects on plasma lipid levels in this sample of persons with relatively low selenium status. The clinical significance of the findings is unclear and should not be used to justify the use of selenium supplementation as additional or alternative therapy for dyslipidemia. This is particularly true for persons with higher selenium status, given the limitations of the trial and the potential additional risk in other metabolic dimensions.\n\n\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nThe Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK) and the University of Surrey.",

        "title": "Impact of dietary selenium intake on cardiac health: experimental approaches and human studies.",
        "abstract": "Selenium, a dietary trace mineral, essential for humans and animals, exerts its effects mainly through its incorporation into selenoproteins. Adequate selenium intake is needed to maximize the activity of selenoproteins, among which glutathione peroxidases have been shown to play a major role in cellular defense against oxidative stress initiated by excess reactive oxygen species. In humans, a low selenium status has been linked to increased risk of various diseases, including heart disease. The main objective of this review is to present current knowledge on the role of selenium in cardiac health. Experimental studies have shown that selenium may exert protective effects on cardiac tissue in animal models involving oxidative stress. Because of the narrow safety margin of this mineral, most interventional studies in humans have reported inconsistent findings. Major determinants of selenium status in humans are not well understood and several nondietary factors might be associated with reduced selenium status. In this review, we discuss recent studies regarding the role of selenoproteins in the cardiovascular system, the effect of dietary intake on selenium status, the impact of selenium status on cardiac health, and the cellular mechanisms that can be involved in the physiological and toxic effects of selenium.",

        "abstract": "Use of dietary supplements in the U.S. has increased steadily over the last 25 years. While misformulation is uncommon, the consequences can be serious. A March 2008 voluntary market recall removed supplement products responsible for the most serious selenium toxicity outbreak that has occurred in the U.S. We quantified selenium concentrations in the misformulated supplement products, measured the temporal response in the nail biologic monitor, and associated exposure to self-reported selenosis symptoms. Subjects recruited through state health departments and referrals provided samples of the misformulated supplement products, exposure information, monthly toenail and or fingernail clippings or onycholysitic nail fragments, and listed their newly onset adverse health effects attributed to selenium toxicity. Ninety-seven subjects enrolled and submitted at least one test sample. Peak selenium concentrations (up to 18.3 and 44.1 \u03bcg/g for toenails and fingernails, respectively) were measured. Multiple samples (52 total) of all six recalled supplement lots were analyzed ranging from 22,300 to 32,200 \u03bcg selenium per daily dose. Average consumption was 30.9 \u00b1 13.9 doses; 73 subjects provided follow-up data on selenosis symptoms at 2.50 \u00b1 0.14 years. Nail samples accurately reflect exposure in this selenium toxicity outbreak, which resulted in long-term/permanent adverse health effects.",

Information about placental concentrations and transfer of multiple potentially toxic metals from low to moderate exposure is lacking. We measured concentrations of Cd, Pb, Hg, Mn, Se, and Zn in 750 placentas collected from women enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study and examined the correlation between elements, and profiles of potentially toxic metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, and Mn) stratified by nutrient concentrations (Zn and Se) using principal components analyses. We further examined the indirect effects of maternal metal concentrations on infant metal concentrations through placental metal concentrations using structural equation models. Placental metal concentrations were all correlated, particularly Zn and Mn, and Zn and Cd, and the principal component of metals differed by stratum of high versus low Zn and Se. Associations were observed between placenta and maternal toenail Se (\u03b2 = 63.49; P < 0.0001) and Pb (\u03b2 = 0.90; P < 0.0001) but not other metals.

        "title": "Cadmium-Associated Differential Methylation throughout the Placental Genome: Epigenome-Wide Association Study of Two U.S. Birth Cohorts",
        "abstract": "Background Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous toxicant that during pregnancy can impair fetal development. Cd sequesters in the placenta where it can impair placental function, impacting fetal development. We aimed to investigate Cd-associated variations in placental DNA methylation (DNAM), associations with gene expression, and identify novel pathways involved in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. Methods Using placental DNAM and Cd concentrations in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS, n=343) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS, n=141), we performed an EWAS between Cd and DNAM, adjusting for tissue heterogeneity using a reference-free method. Cohort-specific results were aggregated via inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis, and variably methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We then performed functional enrichment analysis and tests for associations between gene expression and birth metrics. Results We identified 17 Cd-associated differentially methylated CpG sites with meta-analysis p-values < 1e-05, two of which were within a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Methylation levels at 9 of the 17 loci were associated with increased expression of 6 genes (5% FDR): TNFAIP2, EXOC3L4, GAS7, SREBF1, ACOT7, and RORA. Higher placental expression of TNFAIP2 and ACOT7, and lower expression of RORA, were associated with lower birth weight z-scores (p-values < 0.05). Conclusion Cd associated differential DNAM and corresponding DNAM-expression associations at these loci are involved in inflammatory signaling and cell growth. The expression levels of genes involved in inflammatory signaling (TNFAIP2, ACOT7, and RORA), were also associated with birth metrics, suggesting a role for inflammatory processes in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. Significance Cadmium is a toxic environmental pollutant that can impair fetal development. The mechanisms underlying this toxicity are unclear, though disrupted placental functions could play an important role. In this study we examined associations between cadmium concentrations and DNA methylation throughout the placental genome, across two US birth cohorts. We observed cadmium-associated differential methylation, and corresponding methylation-expression associations at genes involved in cellular growth processes and/or immune and inflammatory signaling. This study provides supporting evidence that disrupted placental epigenetic regulation of cellular growth and immune/inflammatory signaling could play a role in cadmium associated reproductive toxicity in human pregnancies.",

        "title": "Placental Expression of Imprinted Genes, Overall and in Sex-Specific Patterns, Associated with Placental Cadmium Concentrations and Birth Size",
        "abstract": "Background: Prenatal cadmium (Cd) exposure has been recognized to restrict growth, and male and female fetuses may have differential susceptibility to the developmental toxicity of Cd. Imprinted genes, which exhibit monoallelic expression based on parent of origin, are highly expressed in placental tissues. The function of these genes is particularly critical to fetal growth and development, and some are expressed in sex-specific patterns. Objectives: We aimed to examine whether prenatal Cd associates with the expression of imprinted placental genes, overall or in fetal sex-specific patterns, across two independent epidemiologic studies. Methods: We tested for Cd\u2013sex interactions in association with gene expression, then regressed the placental expression levels of 74 putative imprinted genes on placental log-Cd concentrations while adjusting for maternal age, sex, smoking history, and educational attainment. These models were performed within study- and sex-specific strata in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS; n=326) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS; n=211). We then used fixed-effects models to estimate the sex-specific and overall associations across strata and then examine heterogeneity in the associations by fetal sex. Results: We observed that higher Cd concentrations were associated with higher expression of distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5) (p=0.000025), and lower expression of h19 imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) (p=0.00027) and necdin, MAGE family member (NDN) (p=0.00064) across study and sex-specific strata, while three other genes [carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4), growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (GRB10), and integrin-linked kinase (ILK)] were significantly associated with Cd concentrations, but only among female placenta (pinteraction<0.05). Additionally, the expression of DLX5, H19, and NDN, the most statistically significant Cd-associated genes, were also associated with standardized birth weight z-scores. Discussion: The differential regulation of a set of imprinted genes, particularly DLX5, H19 and NDN, in association with prenatal Cd exposure may be involved in overall developmental toxicity, and some imprinted genes may respond to Cd exposure in a manner that is specific to infant gender. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4264",

        "abstract": "There is compelling evidence that developmental exposure to toxic metals increases risk for obesity and obesity-related morbidity including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. To explore the hypothesis that developmental Cd exposure increases risk of obesity later in life, male, and female CD-1 mice were maternally exposed to 500\u2009ppb CdCl2 in drinking water during a human gestational equivalent period (gestational day 0-postnatal day 10 [GD0-PND10]). Hallmark indicators of metabolic disruption, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome were evaluated prior to birth through adulthood. Maternal blood Cd levels were similar to those observed in human pregnancy cohorts, and Cd was undetected in adult offspring. There were no observed impacts of exposure on dams or pregnancy-related outcomes. Results of glucose and insulin tolerance testing revealed that Cd exposure impaired offspring glucose homeostasis on PND42. Exposure-related increases in circulating triglycerides and hepatic steatosis were apparent only in females. By PND120, Cd-exposed females were 30% heavier with 700% more perigonadal fat than unexposed control females. There was no evidence of dyslipidemia, steatosis, increased weight gain, nor increased adiposity in Cd-exposed male offspring. Hepatic transcriptome analysis on PND1, PND21, and PND42 revealed evidence for female-specific increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction with significant early disruption of retinoic acid signaling and altered insulin receptor signaling consistent with hepatic insulin sensitivity in adult females. The observed steatosis and metabolic syndrome-like phenotypes resulting from exposure to 500\u2009ppb CdCl2 during the pre- and perinatal period of development equivalent to human gestation indicate that Cd acts developmentally as a sex-specific delayed obesogen.",

        "abstract": "Maternal exposure to cadmium causes obesity and metabolic changes in the offspring, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-like pathology. However, whether maternal cadmium exposure accelerates liver cancer in the offspring is unknown. This study investigated the impact of early-life exposure to cadmium on the incidence and potential mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in offspring subjected to postweaning HCC induction. HCC in C57BL/6J mice was induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection at weaning, followed by a long-term high-fat choline-deficient (HFCD) diet. Before weaning, liver cadmium levels were significantly higher in mice with early-life cadmium exposure than in those without cadmium exposure. However, by 26 and 29 weeks of age, hepatic cadmium fell to control levels, while a significant decrease was observed in copper and iron in the liver. Both male and female cadmium-exposed mice showed increased body weight compared to non-cadmium-treated mice. For females, early-life cadmium exposure also worsened insulin intolerance but did not significantly promote DEN/HFCD diet-induced liver tumors. In contrast, in male mice, early-life cadmium exposure enhanced liver cancer induction by DEN/HFCD with high incidence and larger liver tumors. The liver peritumor tissue of early-life cadmium-exposed mice exhibited greater inflammation and disruption of fatty acid metabolism, accompanied by higher malondialdehyde and lower esterified triglyceride levels compared to mice without cadmium exposure. These findings suggest that early-life exposure to low-dose cadmium accelerates liver cancer development induced by a DEN/HFCD in male mice, probably due to chronic lipotoxicity and inflammation caused by increased uptake but decreased consumption of fatty acids.",
