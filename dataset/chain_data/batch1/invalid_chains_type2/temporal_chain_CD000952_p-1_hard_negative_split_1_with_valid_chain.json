        "title": "Calcium and Vitamin D3 Supplementation Prevents Bone Loss in the Spine Secondary to Low-Dose Corticosteroids in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Long-term administration of low doses of corticosteroids is common in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, and allergic conditions. Although treatment with high doses of corticosteroids causes osteoporosis (especially in trabecular bone, such as that found in the lumbar spine [1]), use of corticosteroids in low doses (<10 mg/d) was thought to be associated with few substantial side effects [2]. However, recent research suggests that use of low doses of corticosteroids is also associated with loss of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine [3-6] and that patients receiving continuous therapy with low-dose corticosteroids have a higher rate of vertebral fracture [7-9]. Corticosteroids cause osteoporosis by several mechanisms, such as decreasing levels of sex steroids [10, 11] and direct effects on osteoblast [12] and osteoclast function [13]. Use of corticosteroids also decreases absorption of intestinal calcium [14-17], thereby causing secondary hyperparathyroidism [18]. Some studies [19, 20] have shown that vitamin D3 and its more potent analogues can improve calcium absorption in patients receiving corticosteroids. Treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and calcium stabilized bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in patients receiving moderate to high doses of corticosteroids [21]. However, calcitriol is a potent vitamin D analogue that can cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria [22]. The associated toxicity and expense make it impractical for widespread use for prevention of bone loss in all patients receiving long-term treatment with low-dose corticosteroids. Vitamin D3, the parent compound, is generally well tolerated and rarely causes side effects when used in the recommended dosage (400 to 800 IU/d). It has been suggested that vitamin D3 and calcium should be given to all patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy [23]. However, few data support this approach. Early studies [24] suggested that calcium and pharmacologic dosages of vitamin D3 (50 000 IU three times a week) increased bone mineral density in patients taking long-term corticosteroids, but bone mineral density was measured only in the radius. Adachi and colleagues [25] recently reported that treatment with calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (50 000 IU/wk) did not prevent bone loss associated with moderate- to high-dose treatment with corticosteroids, but Healy and colleagues [26] found that calcium and vitamin D3 prevented substantial loss of bone mineral density in a similar group of patients starting corticosteroid treatment. No randomized, controlled, clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation for prevention of bone loss secondary to long-term low-dose corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, we studied the effects of calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (500 IU/d) supplementation on the bone mineral density of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and contrasted the efficacy of this supplementation in patients who were and those who were not receiving corticosteroids. Methods Patients Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were followed at the University of Vermont, College of Medicine (n = 354) were identified through a computer listing by diagnostic code. All identified patients were contacted by mail and asked whether they were interested in participating in a study of the effects of rheumatoid arthritis and medication on bone mineral density. Patients were eligible if they were between 18 and 65 years of age and had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis as defined by the revised American College of Rheumatology criteria [27], serum creatinine level less than 176.8 mol/L, and normal liver function. Patients were excluded if they were receiving an anticonvulsant medication, hydrochlorothiazide, bisphosphonates, fluoride, calcitonin, or calcitriol or if they had a history of malabsorption, hyperparathyroidism, immobilization, metabolic bone disease, or thyroid disease with an abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone. One hundred thirty patients met these criteria, agreed to participate, and entered the study between January 1991 and January 1992. Study Design The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the University of Vermont, and informed consent was obtained as patients entered the study. Patients were stratified by sex, menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal without estrogen replacement, or postmenopausal with estrogen replacement), and current dosage of prednisone (<10 mg/d or 10 mg/d). Patients were randomly assigned in blocks of four to a treatment group using a random-number table. Group assignment was kept in sealed envelopes to ensure blinding. Patients received either calcium carbonate (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (500 IU/d) (two tablets twice a day of Os-Cal 250 + D, SmithKline Beecham Healthcare, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) or an identical placebo. Study medication was taken with breakfast and dinner. Measurement Demographic information and information about risk factors for osteoporosis, such as smoking history, use of alcohol, menstrual history, parity, fracture history, and use of medications (including thyroid medication and estrogen replacement therapy) were obtained from questionnaires given at the beginning of the study and annually thereafter. Calcium intake was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire [28] and 3-day dietary history. Disease-related information included activity level, measured by the Framingham Activity Index [29]; disease severity, measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire [30]; and a severity score, based on radiologic findings [31]. Information about disease duration and use of prednisone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was ascertained by chart review. Bone mineral densities of the femur (femoral neck, Ward triangle, and trochanter) and lumbar spine were measured in all patients by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Corp., Madison, Wisconsin) at the beginning of the study and at yearly follow-up visits. All studies were done using the same machine. Stability of measurement was assured with daily quality-assurance calibration by the manufacturer, weekly Lunar aluminum phantom in water bath, and Hologic spine phantom three times weekly. The coefficient of variation (calculated using 11 patients and three measurements) was 1.2% for the anteroposterior spine and 2.2% for the femoral neck. At the start of the study, the lateral scan of the spine was thought to be the most sensitive measurement for detecting changes induced by cortico-steroids [32]. However, we and others [33] have found the reproducibility of this view with the available technology to be suboptimal, especially in patients with arthritis, because correct positioning is difficult. We subsequently obtained anteroposterior scans of the spine. For patients from whom only the lateral view of the spine was available at baseline (n = 48 [20 patients in the treatment group and 28 in the placebo group]), we determined the anteroposterior value by adding the difference between the anteroposterior and lateral scans obtained after the first year of the study to the lateral scan obtained at baseline. This provided adequate measurement because the differences between anteroposterior and lateral views for each patient remained relatively constant (within 0.10 0.07 g/cm2 for 87% of patients). Patients were seen by the study coordinator at 6-month intervals to assess compliance. At these visits, pills were counted and patients were questioned about side effects of medication. Statistical Analysis Because loss of bone mineral density over time is presumed to be proportional to the amount of bone mineral density remaining, the yearly rate of change () was estimated using data from the three time points (baseline, year 1, and year 2) in the following equation: Equation 1 Differences in rates for the two treatment groups were assessed by using the t-test. The effect of treatment after adjustment for group differences in disease severity and duration was examined by linear regression analysis. Patients who received prednisone during the study and those who did not were analyzed separately and in combination. Clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square tests. Potential interactions between treatment effects and patient characteristics were examined by analysis of variance. All analyses were done using SPS statistical software (SPS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Results Baseline characteristics of the patients completing both years of the study are listed in Table 1. The patients studied were primarily middle-aged white women. Although study groups were similar for most characteristics, the patients receiving calcium and vitamin D3 tended to have disease of greater severity (by radiologic stage) and longer duration than did those receiving placebo. Among patients who were receiving corticosteroids, the mean dosage of prednisone at the initial visit was 5.9 mg/d for the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 5.0 mg/d for the placebo group. During the first year of study, 68% of patients were taking prednisone (mean dosage, 5.5 mg/d; range, 1 to 20 mg/d); during the second year, 65% were taking prednisone (mean dosage, 5.6 mg/d; range, 0.5 to 20 mg/d). Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Patients Who Had Bone Mineral Density Measurements Available for All Time Points* During the 2-year study period, 29 of the original 130 patients (22%) dropped out of the study. Fifteen of the patients who dropped out had been in the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 14 had been in the placebo group. Fourteen patients withdrew for personal reasons, 1 patient died, and 3 patients developed serious illness (inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Eleven patients (7 in the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 4 in the placebo group) dropped out of the study because",

        "title": "Update in Pulmonary Medicine: Evidence Published in 2016",
        "abstract": "This report summarizes some of the most relevant studies in pulmonary medicine published in 2016. Selected articles were among the most frequently accessed and highest-ranked articles from JournalWise and ACP Journal Club, published by the American College of Physicians. After years of uncertainty, 2 recent clinical trials indicate that the use of long-acting -agonists (LABAs) for patients with asthma, at least in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), does not increase the risk for adverse events or death. A systematic review found that for discharge of patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), utilization of COPD discharge bundles helped reduce hospital readmissions. We continue to have a better understanding of the overlap between COPD and asthma; among a large cohort of patients with COPD, 15% had asthmaCOPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), and these patients had a better 1-year prognosis than similar patients without ACOS. In addition, for patients with COPD, a home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program was shown to be as effective as facility-based programs in the short term, with lower cost and higher attendance and adherence rates. For patients with unexplained chronic cough (UCC), new treatment guidelines recommend gabapentin and multimodal speech pathologybased cough suppression as effective interventions, and they recommend against morphine, empirical antireflux medication, or ICSs. For critically ill patients at high risk for reintubation, high-flow nasal cannula immediately after extubation was noninferior to noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in terms of risk for postextubation respiratory failure (PERF). Finally, a recent randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease was not able to demonstrate a reduction in subsequent major cardiovascular events among those who used CPAP, although the study had several limitations, including suboptimal adherence to CPAP. Asthma LABAs Were Not Found to Increase the Risk for Adverse Events or Death in Asthma Peters SP Bleecker ER Canonica GW et al Serious asthma events with budesonide plus formoterol vs. budesonide alone. N Engl J Med 2016 375 850 60 27579635 Stempel DA Raphiou IH Kral KM et al AUSTRI Investigators Serious asthma events with fluticasone plus salmeterol versus fluticasone alone. N Engl J Med 2016 374 1822 30 26949137 Background: Previous studies have indicated that use of LABAs might lead to higher rates of asthma-related complications and deaths (1, 2). Two RCTs published in 2016 aimed to further clarify this risk among patients with asthma. Findings: Each study randomly assigned more than 11000 patients to receive either a LABA combined with an ICS (budesonideformoterol in one RCT and fluticasonesalmeterol in the other) or the ICS alone (budesonide and fluticasone, respectively). There was no difference in serious asthma-related events or deaths between the LABAICS and ICS-only groups in either study: Compared with ICSs alone, the hazard ratio was 1.07 (95% Cl, 0.70 to 1.65) for budesonideformoterol and 1.03 (CI, 0.64 to 1.66) for fluticasonesalmeterol. Compared with ICSs alone, asthma exacerbation rates were reduced by both of the LABAICS combinations. Cautions: In general, the studies excluded patients with unstable or life-threatening asthma and were of short duration (26 weeks), which may limit generalizability. Also, relatively few serious events occurred in each study. Implications: LABAs have long proven their benefit in patients with asthma. These 2 large studies indicate that when used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids, LABAs seem to be safe, which justifies more widespread use of these agents. COPD Utilization of COPD Discharge Bundles Reduces Hospital Readmissions Ospina MB Mrklas K Deuchar L et al A systematic review of the effectiveness of discharge care bundles for patients with COPD. Thorax 2017 72 31 9 27613539 Background: Care bundles are combined sets of distinct interventions used to improve patient outcomes. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of care bundles for the discharge of patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD. Findings: Fourteen relevant studies were included in the final analysis, and included RCTs, interrupted time-series, and beforeafter studies. The bundles included 2 to 12 individual elements, and a total of 26 elements among all bundles. The most common bundle elements were demonstration of proper inhaler technique, self-management education, creation of individual care plans, referral for pulmonary rehabilitation, arrangement of outpatient follow-up, and referral for tobacco cessation. Meta-analysis of 4 RCTs with moderate to high risk of bias showed that bundles reduced hospital readmissions (pooled risk ratio, 0.80 [CI, 0.65 to 0.99]). Evidence was insufficient regarding an effect on mortality or COPD-related quality of life. Cautions: Relatively few high-quality RCTs were available for review, and among those included, many had significant bias. Differences in the methodologies of the bundles used in the various studies limited pooled analyses. Implications: Overall, this study indicates that discharge bundles for an acute exacerbation of COPD have modest benefits, specifically for the reduction of readmissions. These bundles include many high-impact individual interventions, such as referral to pulmonary rehabilitation and tobacco cessation. However, the current evidence does not allow endorsement of any specific bundle of interventions. While we wait for future studies, the key for program interventions is to achieve a balance between the number and complexity of interventions for a chosen bundle, while maintaining consistency and quality. Many Patients With COPD Have ACOS, and Their 1-Year Prognosis Is Better Than That of COPD Patients Without Asthma Cosio BG Soriano JB Lpez-Campos JL et al CHAIN Study Defining the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome in a COPD cohort. Chest 2016 149 45 52 26291753 Background: Some patients with COPD also exhibit characteristics historically related to asthma, a phenomenon described as asthmaCOPD overlap syndrome (3). This study used data from a longitudinal cohort to validate proposed diagnostic criteria (4) for ACOS and to compare outcomes with those of patients with COPD who did not have asthma. In the study, ACOS was defined as the presence of at least 1 major criterion (a previously established history of asthma or a response to -agonist >15% and FEV1 of 400 mL) or at least 2 minor criteria (immunoglobulin E level >100 IU, history of atopy, 2 separate bronchodilator responses >12% and FEV1 of 200 mL, or blood eosinophil level >5%). Findings: Among the 831 patients in the study, 15% were found to have ACOS at baseline. After 1 year of follow-up, another 10% of new ACOS cases were identified among those not initially identified at baseline. One-year survival was significantly higher for the ACOS group than the COPD-alone group (94.7% vs. 87.3%; P< 0.05), even after correction for baseline clinical differences. Cautions: There is still no gold standard for identifying asthma among patients with COPD. In addition, these patients were recruited from a hospital-based COPD clinic and had access to universal health care, so the results may not be globally generalizable. Finally, 1 year of follow-up may be too short to evaluate other outcomes, such as exacerbations. Implications: Currently, the primary unique recommendation for patients with ACOS is early initiation of ICS treatment (5). The ultimate goal of establishing criteria to identify this unique subset of patients is to provide more individualized and effective care. Furthermore, establishing clinical criteria may help avoid the need for more complicated, expensive, and less readily available tests, such as sputum eosinophil count. Home-Based Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Patients With COPD Was as Effective as a Facility-Based Program, With Lower Cost and Higher Adherence Rates Holland AE Mahal A Hill CJ et al Home-based rehabilitation for COPD using minimal resources: a randomised, controlled equivalence trial. Thorax 2017 72 57 65 27672116 Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are a critical component to improving quality of life and reducing health care use in patients with COPD, and they are a strong recommendation in current treatment guidelines for the care of these patients (6, 7). In this trial, patients with stable COPD were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of standard facility-based pulmonary rehabilitation or a novel home-based model consisting of 1 home visit and 7 weekly phone consultations thereafter. Findings: In total, 166 patients were randomly assigned. At the end of 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation, the home-based intervention was noninferior to the facility-based program in terms of change in 6-minute walk distance, although the results were inconclusive at 12 months of follow-up. Dyspnea-related quality-of-life scores were noninferior at the end of the pulmonary rehabilitation program and at 12-month follow-up. Direct program costs per participant for the home and facility-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs were $298 and $312, respectively. Cautions: The generalizability of this study may be limited by several factors. Although similar to other studies (8), the completion rate for facility-based pulmonary rehabilitation was only 49%. Finally, patients who were recently ill or hospitalized were excluded, and only 5% of participants were receiving long-term oxygen therapy. Implications: Despite their known benefits, pulmonary rehabilitation programs are reported to have an attendance and completion rate as low as 10% (9). This study indicates that it is possible to deliver an effective pulmonary rehabilitation program in a home setting. In-home pulmonary rehabilitation programs may be a viable alternative to incr",
