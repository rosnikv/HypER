        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation is significantly reduced by prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulins (HBIG) or antiviral drugs in nonreplicating patients and by the combination of both drugs in replicating patients. However, the load of HBV DNA, which defines replicating status in patients undergoing liver transplantation, remains unclear. This study analyzes the correlation between the viral load, tested with a single amplified assay, at the time of liver transplantation, and the risk of hepatitis B recurrence in 177 HBV carriers who underwent transplantation in a single center from 1990 to 2002. Overall, HBV relapsed after surgery in 15 patients (8.5%) with a 5\u2010 and 8\u2010year actuarial rate of recurrence of 8% and 21%, respectively. After liver transplantation hepatitis B recurred in 9% of 98 selected subjects treated only with immune globulins and in 8% of 79 viremic patients who received immune globulins and lamivudine (P = NS). A linear correlation was observed between recurrence and viral load at the time of surgery. In transplant patients with HBV DNA higher than 100,000 copies/mL, 200\u201399,999 copies/mL, and DNA undetectable by amplified assay, hepatitis B recurred in 50%, 7.5%, and 0% of patients, respectively. Overall, a viral load higher than 100,000 copies/mL at the time of liver transplantation was significantly associated with hepatitis B recurrence (P = .0003). In conclusion, spontaneous or antiviral\u2010induced HBV DNA viral load at the time of surgery classifies the risk of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation and indicates the best prophylaxis strategy.

        "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the outcomes of liver transplant recipients receiving either lamivudine (LAM) monotherapy or LAM combined with low\u2010dose intramuscular (IM) hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) therapy. We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of patients that had had liver transplantation in a single center for HBV\u2010related liver diseases from December 1999 to June 2004. A total of 165 patients received LAM monotherapy (51 patients) or combined prophylaxis (114 patients) post\u2010liver transplantation (LT) with a mean follow\u2010up of 20.13 months. Hepatitis B relapsed in 21 patients of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers who received LAM monotherapy, with a 1\u2010 and 2\u2010yr actuarial risk of 27.4% and 39.7%. Recurrence occurred in 16 patients of 114 patients receiving the combined prophylaxis, with a 1\u2010 and 2\u2010yr recurrence rate of 13.5% and 15.2% (P= 0.024). A total of 25 cases (67.6%) with YMDD mutants were detected in all the 37 patients, 14 cases (66.7%) in the monotherapy group and 11 cases (68.8%) in the combination group. In conclusion, LAM and low\u2010dose intramuscular HBIG treatment demonstrates a better result than LAM monotherapy, as prophylaxis against post\u2010LT reinfection of the graft, but the safety and efficacy as a substitution for high\u2010dose intravenous HBIG with LAM needs to be investigated further.

        "abstract": "The prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence is essential after liver transplantation in patients infected with HBV. We evaluated the efficacy of primary high\u2010dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy in 639 HBV\u2010infected adult patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) between February 1997 and December 2004. The overall 5\u2010year survival rate was 80.7%, and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was the most common cause of late mortality. Pretransplant HBV replication was observed in 392 (61.3%) patients. The interval of 10,000\u2010IU HBIG administration to maintain antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen > 500 IU/L was 30 days in 11.4% patients, 40 to 50 days in 72.1%, and 60 days in 16.5%. At the last follow\u2010up, 3.9% of the patients without HBV recurrence were receiving combination therapy. Overall 1\u2010year, 3\u2010year, 5\u2010year, and 10\u2010year HBV recurrence rates were 1.4%, 5.5%, 7.3%, and 8.5%, respectively. HBV recurrence occurred after a mean of 25.7 \u00b1 16.4 months after LDLT. After HBV recurrence, 5 of 9 patients died from rapidly progressive liver failure before treatment with adefovir, and only 1 of 29 patients died after treatment with adefovir. Need for frequent HBIG infusions (\u226430 days), active pretransplant HBV replication, and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence were significant risk factors for HBV recurrence and indications for combination therapy. Our posttransplant HBV prophylaxis regimen resulted in a 5\u2010year HBV recurrence rate of 7.3% and a mortality rate of 13.2% after HBV recurrence, showing the effectiveness of high\u2010dose HBIG monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy.

        "abstract": "https://jkms.org The Milan criteria (1 lesion smaller than 5 cm or up to 3 lesions, each smaller than 3 cm) have long been used to identify patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are candidates for liver transplantation (LT).1 However, these criteria may exclude some patients who would benefit from LT. Accordingly, there have been many attempts to expand the Milan criteria, such as the University of California San Francisco criteria or the up-to-Seven criteria.2 In contrast to Western countries, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) accounts for the majority of LT in Asian countries. As the social organ allocation system does not control grafts from living related donors, the wishes of the donor sometimes outweigh the recipient's overall prognosis or the risk of HCC recurrence after LT.",

        "abstract": "Background. Sorafenib (SOR) is currently used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurring after liver transplantation (LT) when HCC is unsuitable for surgical/locoregional treatments. We evaluated safety and effectiveness of early introduction of SOR after HCC-recurrence. Methods. All patients with HCC-recurrence after LT treated with SOR in 2 centers were included (January 2008 to June 2018). Baseline and on-treatment data were collected. Results. Fifty patients early treated with SOR for HCC-recurrence after LT (74% mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor [mTORi], 54% HCC-treated at baseline) were enrolled. During 7.3 (0.3\u201388) months of SOR, all patients had at least one adverse event (AE), 56% graded 3\u20134. SOR was reduced in 68%, being AEs the main cause of reduction, and discontinued in 84% (60% symptomatic progression, 33% AE). Objective response was obtained in 16% and stable disease in 50%. Median time to radiological progression was 6 months (95% confidence Interval [CI], 4-8). Thirty-three patients (69%) died, 94% for HCC progression. Median overall survival (OS) was 18 months (95% CI, 8-27); 5-year OS was 18% (95% CI, 4%-32%). Baseline predictors of OS were SOR+mTORi (hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = 0.04), previous curative treatments (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P = 0.003) and alpha-fetoprotein > 100 ng/mL (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.0, P = 0.02). At multivariate analysis, HCC curative treatment was the only independent predictor (HR, 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-1.0; P = 0.04). Conclusions. Early and combined treatment with SOR and mTORi resulted in a favorable safety profile, while its effectiveness should be confirmed by meta-analysis of previous studies or by larger studies. Curative treatment for HCC resulted the only independent predictor of OS.",

        "abstract": "Safety of regorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) has been recently demonstrated. We aimed to assess the survival benefit of regorafenib compared with best supportive care (BSC) in LT patients after sorafenib discontinuation. This observational multicenter retrospective study included LT patients with HCC recurrence who discontinued first\u2010line sorafenib. Group 1 comprised regorafenib\u2010treated patients, whereas the control group was selected among patients treated with BSC due to unavailability of second\u2010line options at the time of sorafenib discontinuation and who were sorafenib\u2010tolerant progressors (group 2). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) of group 1 compared with group 2. Secondary endpoints were safety and OS of sequential treatment with sorafenib + regorafenib/BSC. Among 132 LT patients who discontinued sorafenib included in the study, 81 were sorafenib tolerant: 36 received regorafenib (group 1) and 45 (group 2) received BSC. Overall, 24 (67%) patients died in group 1 and 40 (89%) in group 2: the median OS was significantly longer in group 1 than in group 2 (13.1 versus 5.5 months; P < 0.01). Regorafenib treatment was an independent predictor of reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16\u20100.89; P = 0.02). Median treatment duration with regorafenib was 7.0 (95% CI, 5.5\u20108.5) months; regorafenib dose was reduced in 22 (61%) patients for adverse events and discontinued for tumor progression in 93% (n = 28). The median OS calculated from sorafenib start was 28.8 months (95% CI, 17.6\u201040.1) in group 1 versus 15.3 months (95% CI, 8.8\u201021.7) in group 2 (P < 0.01).

We report a case of a 49-year-old man who underwent LT for hepatitis B-related end-stage liver disease and HCC (single 4.5 cm lesion [T1N0], without vascular invasion) in 2016. Eighteen months later, adrenal metastasis and hepatitis B seropositive conversion were developed with normal serum tumor. Adrenal metastasis was treated with radiation therapy (RT) and hepatitis B showed spontaneous seronegative conversion. However, 35 months later, spinal metastasis occurred with elevation of the protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) level (197 mAU/mL), along with hepatitis B seropositive conversion. After sorafenib, sequential regorafenib with RT led to partial response of the spinal lesions, along with hepatitis B seronegative conversion and normal PIVKA-II levels. After 9 months of regorafenib combined with RT, two recurrent lesions were found, as well as hepatitis B seropositive conversion and lesions were treated with transarterial chemoembolization. The patient survived for more than 71 months after LT and 53 months after recurrence under various combinations of therapy. Combined systemic and locoregional therapies can be a treatment option for HCC recurrence, even in LT patients.",
