        "title": "Cluster-Randomized Trial of a Mobile Phone Personalized Behavioral Intervention for Blood Glucose Control",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To test whether adding mobile application coaching and patient/provider web portals to community primary care compared with standard diabetes management would reduce glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A cluster-randomized clinical trial, the Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study, randomly assigned 26 primary care practices to one of three stepped treatment groups or a control group (usual care). A total of 163 patients were enrolled and included in analysis. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin levels over a 1-year treatment period. Secondary outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, depression, and other clinical (blood pressure) and laboratory (lipid) values. Maximal treatment was a mobile- and web-based self-management patient coaching system and provider decision support. Patients received automated, real-time educational and behavioral messaging in response to individually analyzed blood glucose values, diabetes medications, and lifestyle behaviors communicated by mobile phone. Providers received quarterly reports summarizing patient\u2019s glycemic control, diabetes medication management, lifestyle behaviors, and evidence-based treatment options. RESULTS The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were 1.9% in the maximal treatment group and 0.7% in the usual care group, a difference of 1.2% (P = 0.001) over 12 months. Appreciable differences were not observed between groups for patient-reported diabetes distress, depression, diabetes symptoms, or blood pressure and lipid levels (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood glucose data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines to providers substantially reduced glycated hemoglobin levels over 1 year.",

        "title": "Online disease management of diabetes: Engaging and Motivating Patients Online With Enhanced Resources-Diabetes (EMPOWER-D), a randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate an online disease management system supporting patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nEngaging and Motivating Patients Online With Enhanced Resources for Diabetes was a 12-month parallel randomized controlled trial of 415 patients with type 2 diabetes with baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) values \u22657.5% from primary care sites sharing an electronic health record. The intervention included: (1) wirelessly uploaded home glucometer readings with graphical feedback; (2) comprehensive patient-specific diabetes summary status report; (3) nutrition and exercise logs; (4) insulin record; (5) online messaging with the patient's health team; (6) nurse care manager and dietitian providing advice and medication management; and (7) personalized text and video educational 'nuggets' dispensed electronically by the care team. A1C was the primary outcome variable.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with usual care (UC, n=189), patients in the intervention (INT, n=193) group had significantly reduced A1C at 6 months (-1.32% INT vs -0.66% UC; p<0.001). At 12 months, the differences were not significant (-1.14% INT vs -0.95% UC; p=0.133). In post hoc analysis, significantly more INT patients had improved diabetes control (>0.5% reduction in A1C) than UC patients at 12 months (69.9 (95% CI 63.2 to 76.5) vs 55.4 (95% CI 48.4 to 62.5); p=0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA nurse-led, multidisciplinary health team can manage a population of diabetic patients in an online disease management program. INT patients achieved greater decreases in A1C at 6 months than UC patients, but the differences were not sustained at 12 months. More INT than UC patients achieved improvement in A1C (>0.5% decrease). Trial registered in clinical trials.gov: #NCT00542204.",

        "title": "The eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model: A Theory Derivation Approach",
        "abstract": "Background Chronic illnesses are significant to individuals and costly to society. When systematically implemented, the well-established and tested Chronic Care Model (CCM) is shown to improve health outcomes for people with chronic conditions. Since the development of the original CCM, tremendous information management, communication, and technology advancements have been established. An opportunity exists to improve the time-honored CCM with clinically efficacious eHealth tools. Objective The first goal of this paper was to review research on eHealth tools that support self-management of chronic disease using the CCM. The second goal was to present a revised model, the eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model (eCCM), to show how eHealth tools can be used to increase efficiency of how patients manage their own chronic illnesses. Methods Using Theory Derivation processes, we identified a \u201cparent theory\u201d, the Chronic Care Model, and conducted a thorough review of the literature using CINAHL, Medline, OVID, EMBASE PsychINFO, Science Direct, as well as government reports, industry reports, legislation using search terms \u201cCCM or Chronic Care Model\u201d AND \u201ceHealth\u201d or the specific identified components of eHealth. Additionally, \u201cChronic Illness Self-management support\u201d AND \u201cTechnology\u201d AND several identified eHealth tools were also used as search terms. We then used a review of the literature and specific components of the CCM to create the eCCM. Results We identified 260 papers at the intersection of technology, chronic disease self-management support, the CCM, and eHealth and organized a high-quality subset (n=95) using the components of CCM, self-management support, delivery system design, clinical decision support, and clinical information systems. In general, results showed that eHealth tools make important contributions to chronic care and the CCM but that the model requires modification in several key areas. Specifically, (1) eHealth education is critical for self-care, (2) eHealth support needs to be placed within the context of community and enhanced with the benefits of the eCommunity or virtual communities, and (3) a complete feedback loop is needed to assure productive technology-based interactions between the patient and provider. Conclusions The revised model, eCCM, offers insight into the role of eHealth tools in self-management support for people with chronic conditions. Additional research and testing of the eCCM are the logical next steps.",

        "abstract": "Cancer survivors' acceptance and use of eHealth/mHealth applications for self-management can be unique and are not fully understood. We used data from the Health Information National Trends Survey 4 Cycle 4 to examine cancer survivors' acceptance and use of eHealth/mHea applications for key self-management processes, and conducted logistic regression and Rao-Scott design-adjusted Chi-square tests to assess bivariate associations between potential predictors and actual use. Potential factors were selected based on the Individual and Family Self-Management theory. High acceptance of eHealth applictions was identified, and adoption of mHealth was relatively low. Younger, higher educated, married, employed, and higher income survivors tended to use eHealth/mHealth applications for self-management. Survivors who were newly diagnosed or still on treatment were more likely to look for cancer information online or communicate with health providers electronically. BMI and rural residency were associated with use of mHealth apps to achieve a health-related goal and treatment decision-making.",

        "title": "Patient portal utilization: before and after stage 2 electronic health record meaningful use",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPatient portal functionalities, such as patient-physician e-communication, can benefit patients by improving clinical outcomes. Utilization has historically been low but may have increased in recent years due to the implementation of Stage 2 Meaningful Use for electronic health records. This study has 2 objectives: 1) to compare patient portal utilization rates before Stage 2 (2011-2013) and after Stage 2 (2014-2017), and 2) to examine whether disparities in patient portal utilization attenuate after Stage 2.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe conducted an observational study using a pooled cross-sectional analysis of 2011-2017 National Health Interview Survey data (n\u2009=\u2009254\u00a0183).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean percent use of patient portals significantly increased from the pre-Stage 2 to the post-Stage 2 period (6.9%, 95% CI, 6.2-7.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Non-Hispanic Black individuals (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.76-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.0001) and Hispanic individuals (OR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.74-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.0001) have lower odds of using patient portals compared to non-Hispanic White individuals. Although we found independent effects of race/ethnicity, we did not find a statistically significant interaction between race/ethnicity and time. We found a similar level of increase in patient portal utilization from the pre- to postperiod across racial and ethnic groups.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nHealth care policies such as Stage 2 Meaningful Use are likely contributing to increased patient portal utilization across all patients and helping to attenuate disparities in utilization between subgroups of patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFurther research is needed to explore which patient portal functionalities are perceived as most beneficial to patients and whether patients have access to those functionalities.",

        "title": "Patient Portal Barriers and Group Differences: Cross-Sectional National Survey Study",
        "abstract": "Background Past studies examining barriers to patient portal adoption have been conducted with a small number of patients and health care settings, limiting generalizability. Objective This study had the following two objectives: (1) to assess the prevalence of barriers to patient portal adoption among nonadopters and (2) to examine the association between nonadopter characteristics and reported barriers in a nationally representative sample. Methods Data from this study were obtained from the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey. We calculated descriptive statistics to determine the most prevalent barriers and conducted multiple variable logistic regression analysis to examine which characteristics were associated with the reported barriers. Results The sample included 4815 individuals. Among these, 2828 individuals (58.73%) had not adopted a patient portal. Among the nonadopters (n=2828), the most prevalent barriers were patient preference for in-person communication (1810/2828, 64.00%), no perceived need for the patient portal (1385/2828, 48.97%), and lack of comfort and experience with computers (735/2828, 25.99%). Less commonly, individuals reported having no patient portal (650/2828, 22.98%), no internet access (650/2828, 22.98%), privacy concerns (594/2828, 21.00%), difficulty logging on (537/2828, 18.99%), and multiple patient portals (255/2828, 9.02%) as barriers. Men had significantly lower odds of indicating a preference for speaking directly to a provider compared with women (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.94; P=.01). Older age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02; P<.001), having a chronic condition (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.44-2.33; P<.001), and having an income lower than US $20,000 (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.11-2.34; P=.01) were positively associated with indicating a preference for speaking directly to a provider. Hispanic individuals had significantly higher odds of indicating that they had no need for a patient portal (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.05; P<.001) compared with non-Hispanic individuals. Older individuals (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06; P<.001), individuals with less than a high school diploma (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.79-5.53; P<.001), and individuals with a household income of less than US $20,000 (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.88-4.11; P<.001) had significantly higher odds of indicating that they were uncomfortable with a computer. Conclusions The most common barriers to patient portal adoption are preference for in-person communication, not having a need for the patient portal, and feeling uncomfortable with computers, which are barriers that are modifiable and can be intervened upon. Patient characteristics can help predict which patients are most likely to experience certain barriers to patient portal adoption. Further research is needed to tailor implementation approaches based on patients\u2019 needs and preferences.",

        "title": "Electronic Medical Record\u2013Based Electronic Messaging Among Patients with Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background \u2003Electronic medical record (EMR) systems and electronic messages are an increasingly common conduit between physicians and patients. Clear benefits of this type of communication have been established, especially among cancer patients. Studies suggest that patient portals and electronic messaging platforms can help with care coordination between oncology providers and facilitate asynchronous patient-provider communication. Despite the many benefits, there is little research regarding EMR and secure messaging use, particularly among patients with breast cancer. Objectives \u2003The objective of this systematic review was to examine the evidence supporting the use of EMR-based messaging systems in patients with breast cancer. Methods \u2003A systematic literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science CINAHL, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Studies were required to be published between 2005 and 2022 and report data on demographic information and electronic messaging between patients and providers. Studies were excluded if they reported insufficient data, did not include breast cancer patients, or were not published in English. Results \u2003This study identified 10 articles that met inclusion criteria. The resulting studies investigated topics such as: patterns of messaging and medication adherence, cancer screening, messaging as a predictor of behavior or outcomes, and symptom management. The literature indicates that electronic messaging with providers was associated with clinical benefits for breast cancer patients and improved screening behaviors. Conclusion \u2003This review uncovered multiple areas to focus future research on, including ideal volume of electronic messages sent and their relation to prescription adherence, studies focusing solely on the breast cancer population, racial disparities in electronic messaging, and provider perceptions of electronic messaging. It is vital that more work be done to understand barriers and gaps in EMR usage to ensure that all individuals can access this increasingly essential medical service while minimizing physician workload and burnout.",

        "title": "The Positive Effect of an Online Appointment Portal on a Breast Cancer Screening Program",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background \u2003The adoption of web-based appointment methods by health care systems is increasing. Objectives \u2003This study primarily aimed to evaluate in the setting of an organized breast cancer screening program the actual usage of an online appointment portal by the target population, i.e., how the online tool was used (type and timing of the actions performed) and by whom (users' characteristics); the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on its usage was also investigated. The effect of adopting this tool on the attendance to breast cancer screening was contextually investigated. Methods \u2003Electronic data records of 75,903 women (45\u201374 years old, residing in the territory of Bologna Local Health Authority) were retrospectively reviewed. Results \u2003In total, 12.4% of women logged into the online portal at least once. Most of them (79.9%) rescheduled, 15.7% viewed, and 4.4% cancelled their own appointment. In addition, 40.6% of all rescheduling actions were performed by the online portal; the remaining was performed by the toll-free number/dedicated email address. The highest peak (13.8%) of web accesses was registered at 10 a.m. Monday to Friday, when the toll-free number service is available. Percentages of portal usage were higher: (1) among the younger women, of Italian nationality, and for the first time invited to mammographic screening ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001), and (2) in the pandemic period versus the prepandemic period (12.5 vs. 8.6%, respectively; p \u2009<\u20090.001). Finally, when compared to not using, the online portal usage led to an overall reduction in the no-show rate of almost 20% ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001). Conclusion \u2003The action mainly performed by using the online appointment portal was the appointment rescheduling. The usage of this tool had a positive effect on the no-show rate and it can be speculated that has led to a reduction of the request load to be handled by the center's screening staff. Finally, this study confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic boosted the use of digital technologies.",
