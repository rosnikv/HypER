        "abstract": "Objectives To examine the use of endoscopy in the UK for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) and compare with published standards. To assess the organisation of endoscopy services for AUGIB in the UK. To examine the relationship between outcomes and out of hours (OOH) service provision. Design Multi-centre cross sectional clinical audit. Setting All UK hospitals accepting admissions with AUGIB. Patients All adults (\u226516\u2005yrs) presenting with AUGIB between 1st May and 30th June 2007. Data Collection A custom designed web-based reporting tool was used to collect data on patient characteristics, comorbidity and haemodynamic status at presentation to calculate the Rockall score, use and timing of endoscopy, treatment including endoscopic, rebleeding and in-hospital mortality. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect data on facilities and service organisation. Results Data on 6750 patients (median age 68\u2005years) were analysed from 208 hospitals. 74% underwent inpatient endoscopy; of these 50% took place within 24\u2005h of presentation, 82% during normal working hours and 3% between midnight and 8\u2005am. Of patients deemed high-risk (pre-endoscopy Rockall score \u22655) only 55% were endoscoped within 24\u2005h and 14% waited \u226572\u2005h for endoscopy. Lesions with a high risk of rebleeding were present in 28% of patients of whom 74% received endoscopic therapy. Further bleeding was evident in 13% and mortality in those endoscoped was 7.4% (95% CI 6.7% to 8.1%). In 52% of hospitals a consultant led out of hours (OOH) endoscopy rota existed; in these hospitals 20% of first endoscopies were performed OOH compared with 13% in those with no OOH rota and endoscopic therapy was more likely to be administered (25% vs 21% in hospitals with no OOH rota). The risk adjusted mortality ratio was higher (1.21, p=0.10, (95%CI 0.96 to 1.51)) in hospitals without such rotas. Conclusions This audit has found continuing delays in performing endoscopy after AUGIB and underutilisation of standard endoscopic therapy particularly for variceal bleeding. In hospitals with a formal OOH endoscopy rota patients received earlier endoscopy, were more likely to receive endoscopic therapy and may have a lower mortality.",

        "title": "Insulin resistance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: necessary but not sufficient \u2013 death of a dogma from analysis of therapeutic studies?",
        "abstract": "Studies on pathogenesis tend to blame insulin resistance as the chief pathogenic agent in the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this article, studies reporting histological changes induced by pharmacological therapy and nonpharmacological interventions in NASH are critically reviewed, assuming that analysis of morphological findings can provide further insight into the pathogenesis of NASH. PubMed database analysis provided 16 studies describing light microscopy in adults and three in children; ultrastructural analysis was conducted through electron microscopy in two human and four animal studies. Analysis of the data disclosed methodological issues, such as variable histological criteria, limited series, failure to stratify enrolled patients for their risk of progression and very few electron microscopy studies. Moreover, no particularly convincing \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 study that might assist in understanding the pathogenesis of NASH was found. It is noteworthy that insulin sensitizers fail to treat NASH in all cases, do not reverse or even worsen mitochondrial abnormalities in NASH and, conversely, histological improvement of disease, at least in some patients, is observed with agents acting through mechanisms other than insulin sensitization, such as vitamin E. The finding that correction of insulin resistance may not be sufficient to successfully treat NASH in the majority of patients seems to conflict with studies on pathogenesis. This might imply that NASH is the shared end result of varying pathogenic mechanisms concurring to determine liver damage to a variable extent in the individual patients. If this hypothesis is true, we should try to tailor treatment to each subject.",

        "title": "Liver and diabetes. A vicious circle",
        "abstract": "The complex and bi\u2010directional relationship linking the liver and diabetes has recently gained intense new interest. This critical review of the published work aims to highlight the most recent basic and clinical data underlying the development of type 2 diabetes, in those with non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, the potentially detrimental effects of type 2 diabetes in liver injury are also discussed in each of the two sections of the present paper. Fatty liver and diabetes share insulin resistance as their chief pathogenic determinant. The roles of the hypothalamus, the intestinal microbiome, white adipose tissue and inflammation are discussed in detail. Molecular insights into hepatocyte insulin resistance as the initiator of systemic insulin resistance are also presented with full coverage of the danger of fatty acids. Lipotoxicity, apoptosis, lipoautophagy, endoplasmic reticular stress response and recent developments in genetics are discussed. Closing the circle, special emphasis is given to biochemical pathways and clinical evidence supporting the role of type 2 diabetes as a risk factor for the development of progressive liver disease, including non\u2010alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. In conclusion, data support non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease as a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes which is, in turn, a major contributor to progressive liver disease. This pathway leading from fatty liver to type 2 diabetes and back from the latter to the progressive liver disease is a vicious circle.",

        "title": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity: biochemical, metabolic and clinical presentations.",
        "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the world. Presentation of the disease ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome that includes central abdominal obesity along with other components. Up to 80% of patients with NAFLD are obese, defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2). However, the distribution of fat tissue plays a greater role in insulin resistance than the BMI. The large amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in morbidly obese (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) individuals contributes to a high prevalence of NAFLD. Free fatty acids derived from VAT tissue, as well as from dietary sources and de novo lipogenesis, are released to the portal venous system. Excess free fatty acids and chronic low-grade inflammation from VAT are considered to be two of the most important factors contributing to liver injury progression in NAFLD. In addition, secretion of adipokines from VAT as well as lipid accumulation in the liver further promotes inflammation through nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways, which are also activated by free fatty acids, and contribute to insulin resistance. Most NAFLD patients are asymptomatic on clinical presentation, even though some may present with fatigue, dyspepsia, dull pain in the liver and hepatosplenomegaly. Treatment for NAFLD and NASH involves weight reduction through lifestyle modifications, anti-obesity medication and bariatric surgery. This article reviews the available information on the biochemical and metabolic phenotypes associated with obesity and fatty liver disease. The relative contribution of visceral and liver fat to insulin resistance is discussed, and recommendations for clinical evaluation of affected individuals is provided.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo determine the discriminatory performance of fatty liver index (FLI) for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe data of 5052 subjects aged over 18 years were analyzed. FLI was calculated from body mass index, waist circumference (WC), triglyceride, and gamma glutamyl transferase data. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between FLI and NAFLD. The discriminatory performance of FLI in the diagnosis of NAFLD was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Area under the curves (AUCs) and related confidence intervals were estimated. Optimal cutoff points of FLI in the diagnosis of NAFLD were determined based on the maximum values of Youden's index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of men and women in the study population were 44.8 \u00b1 16.8 and 43.78 \u00b1 15.43, respectively (P = 0.0216). The prevalence of NAFLD was 40.1% in men and 44.2% in women (P < 0.0017).

        "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered as the most common chronic liver disease, which can contribute to some clinical conditions varying from simple steatosis to hepatic cirrhosis. Consequently, the early diagnosis of NAFLD is vital. The present study aimed at investigating the ability of FLI (fatty liver index) in predicting NAFLD. Methods: A total of 212 individuals over the age of 18 years (103 males and 109 females) were recruited from those admitted to a gastrointestinal clinic in Mashhad, northeastern Iran. Anthropometric parameters were measured and blood samples were collected. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were identified by FibroScan. FLI from body mass index, waist circumference (WC), triglyceride, and gamma glutamyltransferase data were calculated. Logistic regression was applied to establish a relationship among FLI, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis. The sensitivity and specificity of FLI and its optimal cut-off point were detected by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: The mean age of the participants was 39.26 \u00b1 14.18 years. FLI was significantly associated with NAFLD (OR = 1.062, 95%CI: 1.042 - 1.082, P < 0.001) and hepatic fibrosis (OR = 1.022, 95%CI: 1.011 - 1.032, P < 0.001). The AUC of FLI was 0.85 (95%CI = 0.79 - 0.9) in the diagnosis of NAFLD, and its optimal cut-off point was 26.2 (sensitivity = 0.83, specificity = 0.7). Also, the optimal cut- off point of FLI was 30.4 in males (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.71) and 20.7 in females (sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.66). Conclusions: Fatty liver index (FLI) is a suitable and simple predictor for liver steatosis. However, performance of FLI in predicting NAFLD is not more effective than WC. Although FLI is a predictor for liver steatosis, it has a positive association with liver fibrosis and can perhaps predict liver fibrosis too.",

        "title": "Links between gut microbiome composition and fatty liver disease in a large population sample",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in the world. Its connection with the gut microbiome has been known for at least 80 y, but this association remains mostly unstudied in the general population because of underdiagnosis and small sample sizes. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the link between the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), a well-established proxy for fatty liver disease, and gut microbiome composition in a representative, ethnically homogeneous population sample of 6,269 Finnish participants. We based our models on biometric covariates and gut microbiome compositions from shallow metagenome sequencing. Our classification models could discriminate between individuals with a high FLI (\u226560, indicates likely liver steatosis) and low FLI (<60) in internal cross-region validation, consisting of 30% of the data not used in model training, with an average AUC of 0.75 and AUPRC of 0.56 (baseline at 0.30). In addition to age and sex, our models included differences in 11 microbial groups from class Clostridia, mostly belonging to orders Lachnospirales and Oscillospirales. Our models were also predictive of the high FLI group in a different Finnish cohort, consisting of 258 participants, with an average AUC of 0.77 and AUPRC of 0.51 (baseline at 0.21). Pathway analysis of representative genomes of the positively FLI-associated taxa in (NCBI) Clostridium subclusters IV and XIVa indicated the presence of, e.g., ethanol fermentation pathways. These results support several findings from smaller case\u2013control studies, such as the role of endogenous ethanol producers in the development of the fatty liver.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Our previous reports showed that ginsenoside Rk3 provided excellent efficacy in alleviating the intestinal inflammatory response and protecting the liver, but its mechanism for HCC prevention remains to be explored. Here, the results suggested that Rk3 displayed potent antitumor effects against a dimethyl nitrosamine- and CCl4-induced HCC mouse model. Results revealed that Rk3 application inhibited liver injury, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. In parallel, Rk3 lowered the inflammatory response by decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inducing apoptosis, and blocking the cell cycle. Meanwhile, Rk3 effectively ameliorated the gut microbiota dysbiosis. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway, which was inhibited by Rk3, plays a key role in preventing HCC. To conclude, our research provides valuable insights into how Rk3 application targets the gut-liver axis and suppresses HCC development, suggesting that Rk3 might be a promising candidate for clinical treatment of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary In this study, we investigated the potential of TLR4 to improve the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is a serious health concern worldwide, and finding new ways to combat it is crucial. Our study focused on understanding how TLR4 can enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy, a treatment approach that harnesses the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer cells. We demonstrated that targeting TLR4 can stimulate the immune response against HCC cells, leading to their destruction. This exciting finding suggests that TLR4 could serve as a valuable target for developing new therapies for HCC. The implications of this study extend beyond the realm of medical research. If successful, these new strategies could offer renewed hope to HCC patients and potentially improve the overall survival rates. Furthermore, the insights gained from our study may pave the way for similar approaches in treating other types of cancer. In summary, our research highlights the significant role of TLR4 in enhancing immunotherapy for HCC. This knowledge brings us one step closer to developing more effective treatments and improving the lives of cancer patients. Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Immunotherapy has emerged as the mainstay treatment option for unresectable HCC. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by recognizing and responding primarily to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. In addition to its role in the innate immune system, TLR4 has also been implicated in adaptive immunity, including specific anti-tumor immune responses. In particular, the TLR4 signaling pathway seems to be involved in the regulation of several cancer hallmarks, such as the continuous activation of cellular pathways that promote cell division and growth, the inhibition of programmed cell death, the promotion of several invasion and metastatic mechanisms, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and epigenetic modifications. Emerging evidence further suggests that TLR4 signaling holds promise as a potential immunotherapeutic target in HCC. The aim of this review was to explore the multilayer aspects of the TLR4 signaling pathway, regarding its role in liver diseases and HCC, as well as its potential utilization as an immunotherapy target for HCC.",

        "abstract": "Background This study seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as to optimize the assessment of immunotherapy response. Methods A training set comprising 305 HCC cases was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Initially, a screening process was undertaken to identify prognostically significant immune-related genes (IRGs), followed by the application of logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression methods for gene modeling. Subsequently, the final model was constructed using support vector machines-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Following model evaluation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed to examine the gene expression profiles in tissue samples obtained from our cohort of 54 patients with HCC and an independent cohort of 231 patients, and the prognostic relevance of the model was substantiated. Thereafter, the association of the model with the immune responses was examined, and its predictive value regarding the efficacy of immunotherapy was corroborated through studies involving three cohorts undergoing immunotherapy. Finally, the study uncovered the potential mechanism by which the model contributed to prognosticating HCC outcomes and assessing immunotherapy effectiveness. Results SVM-RFE modeling was applied to develop an OS prognostic model based on six IRGs (CMTM7, HDAC1, HRAS, PSMD1, RAET1E, and TXLNA). The performance of the model was assessed by AUC values on the ROC curves, resulting in values of 0.83, 0.73, and 0.75 for the predictions at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. A marked difference in OS outcomes was noted when comparing the high-risk group (HRG) with the low-risk group (LRG), as demonstrated in both the initial training set (P <0.0001) and the subsequent validation cohort (P <0.0001). Additionally, the SVMRS in the HRG demonstrated a notable positive correlation with key immune checkpoint genes (CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1). The results obtained from the examination of three cohorts undergoing immunotherapy affirmed the potential capability of this model in predicting immunotherapy effectiveness. Conclusions The HCC predictive model developed in this study, comprising six genes, demonstrates a robust capability to predict the OS of patients with HCC and immunotherapy effectiveness in tumor management.",
