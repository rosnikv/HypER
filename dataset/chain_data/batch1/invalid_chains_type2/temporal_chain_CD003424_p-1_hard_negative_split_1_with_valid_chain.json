        "title": "Effect of cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate on pancreatic replacement therapy in cystic fibrosis.",
        "abstract": "Fifteen patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency were studied during four randomised seven day treatment periods in which they received only pancreatic supplement (Pancrelipase, 27 capsules per day) or supplement plus cimetidine (20 mg/kg body weight/24 h) or sodium bicarbonate (15 g/m2/24 h) alone or in combination. Dietary intake was not fixed but was restricted to foods of known fat and nitrogen content from which daily intakes could be computed. Faecal fat and nitrogen were calculated as g/24 h and percentage of intake. Addition of either cimetidine or bicarbonate resulted in significant improvement in fat and nitrogen excretion, which was not greater with the combination of both drugs. Cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate in these doses are therefore sufficient to produce maximal improvement in digestive activity of pancreatic supplements. Fat excretion per gram of intake fell with cimetidine and bicarbonate from 12 times the normal level, to normal, in patients consuming less than 120 g fat daily. Above this intake the dose of pancreatic supplement appeared to be inadequate. Faecal nitrogen excretion increased with nitrogen intake in all four periods, but, in contrast with fat excretion, the response to cimetidine and bicarbonate was not affected by the level of intake. Dietary intake appears to be a significant factor in determining the faecal output of fat and nitrogen in patients with pancreatic insufficiency and should be considered when determining the optimum amount of pancreatic supplementation.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic lipase and colipase secretion was assessed in 64 patients with pancreatic disease, 24 of whom had steatorrhea, and in 14 control subjects. A wide range of lipase and colipase secretion was seen in patients both with and without steatorrhea. Considerable loss of pancreatic lipase and colipase secretion had to occur before steatorrhea developed, as the highest hourly secretion of lipase and colipase in this group of patients was less than 4% and less than 2%, respectively, of the lowest values recorded in normal subjects. Colipase and lipase outputs were very strongly correlated (r = 0.96) throughout the range of pancreatic function. Lipase was always unsaturated with respect to colipase, but in only a limited number of patients with relatively low pancreatic secretion was the degree of unsaturation greater than 2 standard deviations below the mean. The importance of low saturation or low colipase secretion was evident in a group of 11 patients with a narrow range of lipase secretion in a transitional zone between secretion rates associated with steatorrhea and with normal fat excretion. In this group, 7 patients were identified in whom colipase deficiency appeared to be the sole cause of steatorrhea. The correlation of colipase secretion with the level of fecal fat excretion was highly significant (p less than 0.001) and indicated that fat digestion and subsequent fat absorption depended on colipase secretion up to at least a level of 25% fecal fat excretion. Nonpancreatic factors could well govern the extent of fat absorption above this level, as colipase secretory values in this range were uniformly low.",

        "title": "Age-Related Alterations of Immunoreactive Pancreatic Cationic Trypsinogen in Sera from Cystic Fibrosis Patients with and without Pancreatic Insufficiency",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Serum immunoreactive cationic trypsinogen levels were determined in 99 control subjects and 381 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. To evaluate the status of the exocrine pancreas all CF patients had previously undergone fecal fat balance studies and/or pancreatic stimulation tests. Three hundred fourteen CF patients had fat malabsorption and/or had inadequate pancreatic enzyme secretion (pancreatic insufficiency) requiring oral pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals. Sixty-seven CF patients did not have fat malabsorption and/or had adequate enzyme secretion (pancreatic sufficiency) and were not receiving pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals. Mean serum trypsinogen in 99 control subjects was 31.4 \u00b1 14.8 \u00b5g/liter (\u00b1 2 SD) and levels did not vary with age or sex. In CF infants (< 2 yr) with pancreatic insufficiency, mean serum trypsinogen was significantly above the non-CF values (p<0.001). Ninety-one percent of the CF infants had elevated levels. Serum trypsinogen values in the pancreatic insufficient group declined steeply up to 5 years, reaching subnormal values by age 6. An equation was developed which described these age-related changes very accurately. Only six CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency had serum trypsinogen levels above the 95% confidence limits of this equation. In contrast, there was no age related decline in serum trypsinogen among the CF group with pancreatic sufficiency. Under 7 yr, serum trypsinogen failed to distinguish the two groups. In those over 7 yr of age, however, serum trypsinogen was significantly higher than the CF group with pancreatic insufficiency (p<0.001), and 93% had values within or above the control range. In conclusion, serum trypsinogen appears to be a useful screening test for CF in infancy. Between 2 and 7 yr of age this test is of little diagnostic value. After 7 yr of age, serum trypsinogen can reliably distinguish between CF patients with and without pancreatic insufficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Neonatal cystic fibrosis (CF) screening has been performed in New Zealand for a total of 7 years. This study reports the experience with this procedure in New Zealand over a 4 year period and compares it with 2 years when diagnoses of CF were suggested by clinical features only. A total of 72 infants were confirmed as having CF during 4 years of screening. Twenty\u2010eight infants were found to have CF during 2 years in which screening was not performed. There were 29 false positive diagnoses during the screening years and six false negative diagnoses. Three of the false negative diagnoses occurred because of laboratory error, but three occurred because either the first or second measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) was normal. Faecal chymotrypsin was measured in samples from 434 infants at the time of the second IRT and assisted with the diagnosis for one infant which might otherwise have been missed. Only 42.5% of infants were asymptomatic at the time of the confirmatory sweat test. Significant morbidity and mortality was associated with meconium ileus which occurred in 24% of infants with CF. Improved ascertainment of cases of CF has occurred since screening began. Further follow\u2010up is required to determine other benefits of newborn screening.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the effectiveness of a two tier neonatal screening strategy for cystic fibrosis, which combines estimation of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by direct gene analysis in dried blood spot samples collected at age 5 days. DESIGN--Prospective study of two tier screening strategy. The first tier of testing immunoreactive trypsinogen concentration was measured in dried blood spot samples from neonates aged 4-5 days. In the second tier direct gene analysis to detect cystic fibrosis mutations deltaF508 and deltaI506 was performed in those blood spot samples which produced the highest 1% of immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Direct gene analysis was also performed on blood spot samples from infants with suspected or confirmed meconium ileus, regardless of the immunoreactive trypsinogen value. SETTING--The South Australian Neonatal Screening Programme, operating from the department of chemical pathology at Adelaide Children's Hospital. Subjects--All 12,056 neonates born in South Australia between December 1989 and June 1990. No selection criteria were applied. INTERVENTIONS--All infants found to have two recognised cystic fibrosis mutations on direct gene analysis were referred directly for clinical management, and those with one recognised cystic fibrosis mutation were recalled for a sweat test; their families were given genetic counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Direct or exclusion of cystic fibrosis by sweat testing of neonates identified as being at high risk of cystic fibrosis on screening and of those at minimum risk but whose subsequent clinical history raised suspicion about the disease. RESULTS--Of the 12,056 infants screened, 11,907 (98.8%) were reported as \"cystic fibrosis not indicated\" on the basis of low immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Of the 148 (1.23%) infants with raised immunoreactive trypsinogen values and one (0.008%) with meconium ileus, 132 (1.09%) were reported as cystic fibrosis not indicated, four (0.033%) were identified as having cystic fibrosis, and 13 (0.108%) were recalled for sweat testing after direct gene analysis for the presence of the deltaF508 and deltaI506 cystic fibrosis mutations. No cases of affected infants are known to have been missed to date. CONCLUSION--The strategy of measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by direct gene analysis is a highly specific neonatal screen for cystic fibrosis, requiring only 2.8 families to be contacted for every case of cystic fibrosis diagnosed.",

        "title": "The Neonatal Detection of Cystic Fibrosis by Measurement of Immunoreactive Trypsin in Blood",
        "abstract": "Although enzymically active trypsin is not present in blood, a very small amount of the zymogen secreted by the endocrine pancreas appears to enter the circulation directly and is normally detectable in the blood by immunoassay (immunoreactive trypsin, lRT). An early stage of the exocrine pancreatic pathology in newborn infants affected by cystic fibrosis (CF) results in greater than normal amounts of IRT entering the circulation, and this occurs whether or not there are clinical symptoms and signs of the disease. For this reason measurement of IRT in whole blood spots has been proposed as a method for the detection of CF through newborn population screening. During the past decade the performance of this test has been evaluated in several population screening trials; this review describes the assays used and the results obtained. The screening strategy generally adopted is aimed at identifying infants who have prolonged neonatal hypertrypsinaemia, who are then sweat tested to confirm the diagnosis. With fairly few exceptions these trials have succeeded in detecting 91-981170 of affected infants following repeat IRT testing of 0'3-0\u00b77% of the population initially screened, with a predictive value for CF in infants with positive repeat tests of 52-86%.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND--A study was undertaken to evaluate whether an early diagnosis by neonatal screening may improve the long term prognosis of patients with cystic fibrosis and to assess the influence of expert management started immediately after the diagnosis. METHODS--Comparative clinical follow up in three birth cohorts of patients with cystic fibrosis was performed at the Cystic Fibrosis centre in Groningen in close collaboration with paediatricians in general hospitals in the north-eastern part of the Netherlands. The first birth cohort (n = 19) was detected by screening and the two other cohorts were detected clinically, one (n = 30) consisting of patients born during the screening programme and the other (n = 32) of patients born during the six years immediately after the screening programme ended. The total number of patients in the three birth cohorts included all patients with cystic fibrosis born in this area during a 12 year period. Cumulative survival rates and the variation with time of lung function, the levels of immunoglobulins, and growth patterns were used as main outcome measures. RESULTS--Patients born during the screening programme but detected clinically appeared to have a reduced life expectancy compared with patients detected by screening. The patients detected by screening showed less deterioration in lung function (annual decrease 1.2% of FEV1 % pred), a smaller increase in immunoglobulin levels, and minimal catch-up growth compared with an annual decrease of 3.25% of FEV1 % pred in the non-screened birth cohort of the same age, a higher rise in immunoglobulins leading to increased levels at the end of the observation period, and catch-up growth for weight as well as height. Differences between patients treated in a cystic fibrosis centre and those not referred to a specialist centre were smaller but similar, in favour of treatment at a cystic fibrosis clinic. CONCLUSIONS--Expert management started immediately after an early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by neonatal screening results in important beneficial effects on the outcome and clinical course of the condition. The institution of very early treatment may be critical for the outcome and long term prognosis for most patients with cystic fibrosis. Neonatal screening programmes for cystic fibrosis should be introduced more widely.",

A novel three-stage screening protocol was compared with the previously introduced two-stage immunoreactive trypsin-DNA protocol. Design\u2014 (a) Collection of data from a 41/2 year period (phase 1) of two-stage immunoreactive trypsin screening. The initial dried blood samples were obtained at 6 days of age and repeat samples at 27 days of age from babies with results above the 99.5th centile. Babies with persistent hypertrypsinaemia were referred for a diagnostic sweat test. (b) Retrospective DNA analysis: Patients with cystic fibrosis diagnosed in phase 1 were genotyped and most samples from babies with increased initial immunoreactive trypsin but normal results in the second sample were analysed for the \u03b4F508 mutation, (c) Phase 2, a prospective study of a three-stage neonatal screening protocol, in which only babies heterozygous for the \u03b4F508 cystic fibrosis mutation progressed to the second immunoreactive trypsin test. Setting\u2014 The Trent neonatal screening programme. Subjects\u2014 437 859 babies born between August 1989 and March 1996. Main outcome measures\u2014 Proportions of unaffected babies requiring a second blood sample or a sweat test. Overall sensitivity for the detection of cystic fibrosis. Results\u2014 The two-stage screen failed to identify six out of 94 cases of cystic fibrosis (without meconium ileus). The introduction of the DNA analysis step would have resulted in one additional case being missed. With the three-stage screen there was a 92% reduction in babies requiring a second blood sample and an 80% reduction in negative sweat tests, results close to the predictions of the retrospective study.
