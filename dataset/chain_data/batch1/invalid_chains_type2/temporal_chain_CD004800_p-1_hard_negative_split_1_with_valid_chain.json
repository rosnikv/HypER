        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether sulfasalazine (SSZ) at a dosage of 2,000 mg/day is effective for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) that is not controlled with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred sixty-four patients with AS were recruited from 15 clinics, randomized (double-blind) to SSZ or placebo treatment, and followed up for 36 weeks. Treatment response was based on morning stiffness, back pain, and physician and patient global assessments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhile longitudinal analysis revealed a trend favoring SSZ in the middle of treatment, no difference was seen at the end of treatment. Response rates were 38.2% for SSZ and 36.1% for placebo (P = 0.73). The Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined more with SSZ treatment than with placebo (P < 0.0001). AS patients with associated peripheral arthritis showed improvement that favored SSZ (P = 0.02). Adverse reactions were fewer than expected and were mainly due to nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSSZ at a dosage of 2,000 mg/day does not seem to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of AS patients with chronic, longstanding disease. SSZ is well tolerated and may be more effective than placebo in the treatment of AS patients with peripheral joint involvement. This effect is more pronounced in treatment of the peripheral arthritis in this subgroup of AS patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine if the peripheral articular manifestations of the seronegative spondylarthropathies (SNSA) respond differently than the axial manifestations to treatment with sulfasalazine (SSZ).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a reanalysis of a previously reported series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials comparing the effects of SSZ, 2,000 mg/day, and placebo on the axial and peripheral articular manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and reactive arthritis (ReA; Reiter's syndrome). Patients were classified as treatment responders on the basis of meeting predefined improvement criteria in 4 outcome measures: namely, patient and physician global assessments in all patients, morning stiffness and back pain in patients with axial manifestations, and joint pain/tenderness scores and joint swelling scores in patients with peripheral articular manifestations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix hundred nineteen SNSA patients (264 AS, 221 PsA, and 134 ReA) were studied. One hundred eighty-seven of these patients had only axial manifestations of their disease, while 432 patients had peripheral articular manifestations. Of the patients with axial disease, 40.2% of the SSZ group and 43.3% of the placebo group met the predefined response criteria (P = 0.67). Of the peripheral articular group, 59.0% of the SSZ-treated patients and 42.7% of the placebo-treated patients showed a response (P = 0.0007).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn a large group of affected individuals, the response of SNSA patients to SSZ appears to be related to the articular manifestations of their disease. These data demonstrate that the axial and peripheral articular manifestations of SNSA respond differently to treatment with SSZ. In SNSA patients with persistently active peripheral arthritis, SSZ is safe, well tolerated, and effective.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a loading dose regimen of three intravenous infusions with infliximab in patients with active spondyloarthropathy. METHODS A monocentre, open-label pilot study of 21 patients with different subtypes of spondyloarthropathy was conducted. Treatment resistant patients with active disease (fulfilling inclusion criteria) received three infusions of 5 mg/kg infliximab (at weeks 0, 2, and 6). Standard clinical assessments were performed at baseline, and on days 3, 7, and 14, and from then on every two weeks. In patients who fulfilled criteria for ankylosing spondylitis, axial assessment was performed at baseline and on days 14, 42, and 84. RESULTS In all global assessments (visual analogue scale of patient global assessment, patient pain assessment, doctor global assessment), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein, a highly significant decrease could be seen already at day 3 (compared with baseline), which was maintained up to day 84. In patients with peripheral disease (n=18), tender and swollen joint count significantly decreased. In patients with axial disease (n=11), functional and disease activity indices significantly improved. Moreover in eight patients with psoriatic arthritis a significant decrease of the psoriasis area and severity index was observed. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients; no significant adverse events were seen. CONCLUSION In this open-label pilot study of a loading dose regimen of three infusions of chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 in patients with active spondyloarthropathy, there was a fast and significant improvement of axial and peripheral articular manifestations, without major adverse experiences.",

In 8 patients, synovial biopsy tissues obtained at baseline, week 2, and week 12 were used for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn all 8 patients (3 with ankylosing spondylitis, 1 with undifferentiated SpA, and 4 with psoriatic arthritis), there was a clear clinical improvement in the peripheral arthritis after anti-TNFalpha therapy. Histologic analysis of the synovial biopsy tissues indicated that the synovial lining layer thickness tended to decrease, with a significant reduction of CD55+ synoviocytes, at week 12. In the sublining layer, vascularity was reduced at week 12, with a decreased endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 but not intercellular adhesion molecule 1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin. Although at week 2 and week 12, the number of neutrophils and CD68+ macrophages in the sublining layer was decreased, the overall degree of inflammatory infiltration remained unchanged. This could be related to the lymphocyte infiltration since at week 12, only CD4+ cells (but not CD3+, CD45RO+, and CD8+ cells) tended to decrease, while CD20+ lymphocytes and plasma cells were clearly increased.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe reduction in lining layer thickness, vascularity, and infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages paralleled the beneficial effect of anti-TNFalpha therapy on peripheral synovitis in 8 patients with different subtypes of SpA. The adhesion molecule expression, T cell infiltration, and, most important, B cell infiltration seemed to contrast with previous observations in RA. Although these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort, they suggest distinct immunomodulatory mechanisms of anti-TNFalpha in SpA.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo describe the composition and distribution of total costs of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and to identify predictors of high total costs among patients with AS.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective longitudinal study, 241 patients with AS reported information on health status, health care utilization, treatments, and work limitations on biannually mailed questionnaires. Annual direct costs were estimated on the basis of reported ambulatory care visits, hospitalizations, diagnostic tests, medications, assistive devices, nonallopathic treatments, travel to visits, and paid household help. Indirect costs were estimated from the number of work days missed or, for retirees and homemakers, the number of days of activity limitation. A similar analysis was performed for cumulative costs over 5 years in a subset of 111 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnnual total costs averaged $6,720 (in 1999 US dollars; median $1,495). Indirect costs comprised 73.6% and direct costs comprised 26.4% of total costs, although only 95 patients (39%) contributed to the indirect costs. Functional disability was the most important predictor of high total costs. The likelihood of having high (>$10,000) total costs increased by a factor of 3 with each 1-point increase in the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index modified for the spondylarthropathies (HAQ-S; range 0-3). Results were similar in the subgroup of 111 patients who were followed up for 5 years, among whom the likelihood of high cumulative total costs (>$50,000 over 5 years) increased by >6 times with each 1-point increase in the HAQ-S.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFunctional disability is the most important predictor of total costs in patients with AS.

        "title": "The burden of ankylosing spondylitis and the cost-effectiveness of treatment with infliximab (Remicade).",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nIn the past, treatment options for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been limited, and the introduction of new treatments such as infliximab will have a noticeable impact on health-care budgets. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the current burden of the disease and estimate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab treatments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional retrospective observational study of resource consumption and utility related to disease severity was performed in patients who had participated in a population survey between 1992 and 1994 at the University of Bath and patients regularly followed at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath for up to 9 years. Mean costs and utility were estimated using a regression model including age, gender, disease duration, disease activity and functional status, and disease development was expressed as annual progression of functional disability. Cost-effectiveness of infliximab was modelled using a 3-month placebo-controlled clinical trial with open 1-yr extension in 70 patients, over a total time frame of 2 yr. In the model, costs and utility controlled for disease severity and age from the observational study were assigned to individual patients. The effect of long-term treatment was evaluated in a hypothetical model over 30 yr.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-seven per cent of patients answered the questionnaires. The mean age was 57 (s.d. 11.2) yr, 74% were male and mean disease duration was 30.2 (11.7) yr. Mean total costs were estimated at pound 6765 (s.d. pound 166). Indirect costs represented 57.9% and non-medical costs such as investments and informal care accounted for 16.5% of total costs. Mean utility was 0.67 (0.21). In the main model, mean costs for untreated patients are estimated at pound 25,128. For the infliximab group, mean costs (excluding treatment) are estimated at pound 17,240, a reduction of 31%. Thus, part of the treatment cost was offset by savings in other resources ( pound 7888), leaving an incremental cost of pound 6214. Treatment increased the number of quality-adjusted live years (QALYs) by 0.175 QALYs, leading to a cost per QALY gained of pound 35,400 for the first year of treatment. When treatment is assumed to continue for the full 2 yr, the cost per QALY is pound 32,800. When infliximab infusions are given every 8 weeks instead of every 6 weeks, the cost per QALY is reduced to pound 17,300. In the long-term model, the cost per QALY is estimated at pound 9600.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNon-medical costs and production losses dominate costs in AS, and economic evaluation must therefore adopt a societal perspective. The cost of treatment with infliximab is partly offset by reductions in the cost of the disease and patients' quality of life is increased, leading to a cost per QALY gained in the vicinity of pound 30,000 to pound 40,000 in the short term, but potentially below pound 10,000 in the long term.",

We investigated resource utilization and utility of patients with AS in Canada.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional retrospective observational study was performed in a cohort of 545 patients with AS in Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, and Manitoba. Patients completed a questionnaire asking about their healthcare consumption, out of pocket expenses, work capacity, and need for informal care during the past 3 months. Patients' current functional status and disease activity level was assessed using the Bath AS functional and disease activity indexes (BASFI and BASDAI), and utility was determined using the EQ-5D 5-dimensional health status classification. Descriptive analysis was performed to estimate costs and utility for the sample and by level of disease severity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients' mean age was 49.6 years and the mean disease duration was 22.3 years; 64% were male, and 63% of patients in the sample were working. The mean BASDAI score was 4.3 and BASFI 3.6, although 13% of patients in the sample had a BASFI score > or = 7. The mean annual cost per patient is estimated at 9,008 Canadian dollars (SD 17,724 Canadian dollars), and direct healthcare represented 28.9% of these costs. Patients' out of pocket costs represented 33.1%, and lost work capacity accounted for 38%. Costs increased significantly with diminishing physical function and high disease activity, covering a range of 4,000 Canadian dollars to 30,000 Canadian dollars per patient and year. The estimated cost-increase per unit-increase in the BASFI score at values < 5 was around 1,000 Canadian dollars, and more than 5,000 Canadian dollars at values > 7. The mean utility was 0.65 (SD 0.23). Utility was significantly correlated with age, sex, BASFI, and BASDAI, covering a range from 0.87 for patients with BASFI/BASDAI < or = 2 to 0.20 for patients with BASFI/BASDAI > or = 8. On average, utility decreased by 0.075 for each unit-increase in the BASFI.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll types of costs accelerate steeply with increasing loss of function (BASFI) and disease activity (BASDAI) in patients with AS, while utility decreases significantly. Treatments that control disease activity and maintain patients' function are likely to offset the high cost and low quality of life of severe disease. Our findings provide information on the burden of AS and a baseline for assessing the cost-effectiveness of the new biological agents in this indication.",

To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) medications in a real-world environment for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Methods. We created a database of patients with RA, PsA, or AS treated with anti-TNF agents (etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab) at a large outpatient rheumatology clinic. Patient characteristics, baseline HAQ prior to treatment, subsequent yearly HAQ, and reasons for termination were collected. The cost based on percentage of patients achieving \u2265 0.2 improvement in HAQ (minimal clinically important difference, MCID) was calculated using the 2008 direct cost (Cdn) of the medication. Results. Data were available on 297 patients (206 with RA, 57 PsA, 34 AS). The mean age was 55 years, with 12 years of disease, and the mean baseline HAQ (standard error, SE) was 1.37 (0.04). The changes in HAQ (SE) at Years 1, 2, and 3 were \u22120.31 (0.04), \u22120.24 (0.06), and \u22120.27 (0.07) for annual cost to achieve MCID of $41,636, $42,077, and $42,147, respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 1.94 (RA), 1.88 (PsA), and 2.30 (AS). There were no statistical differences between the diseases studied. Conclusion. We obtained data on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF drugs using the HAQ score, which is known to be an excellent predictor of work disability, morbidity, and mortality. HAQ scores decreased with treatment and were sustained throughout the 3\u20135 years of followup. The NNT of approximately 2 seems favorable and was similar between diseases.",

With the increasingly widespread and prolonged use of these drugs an assessment of their long-term safety is extremely important. An additional concern regarding biological agents is their higher costs compared with conventional drugs. We examined safety data regarding ETN from clinical reports, clinical trials, review articles, databases and registries. In addition, evidence was reviewed about the cost effectiveness of ETN in the treatment of patients with SpA. Our review suggests that ETN is well tolerated as long-term, continuous treatment of SpA with a favourable risk-benefit ratio maintained from 4 to 5 years. Diversity in structure and mode of action could explain some differences in the safety profile of ETN with respect to the other anti-TNF agents. In particular, ETN is less immunogenic and is less likely to induce tuberculosis re-activation than the other TNF-\u03b1 antagonists. Although ETN is considerably more expensive than conventional therapy, it reduces direct and indirect costs associated to SpA by improving disease activity and quality of life. Recent pharmacoeconomic studies have demonstrated its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of SpA.",

Adipokine levels were also determined immediately after administration of an infliximab dose.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant correlation between adiponectin concentrations and insulin sensitivity (QUICKI at the time of the study) was seen (r=0.384; p=0.05). Also, a marginally significant negative correlation between adiponectin serum levels and the body mass index was observed (r=-0.367; p=0.07). Circulating adiponectin and resistin concentrations did not correlate with disease duration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, BASDAI or VAS at the time of the study. However, AS patients with hip involvement or synovitis and/or enthesitis in other peripheral joints had higher adiponectin concentrations than those who did not have these complications (p-value for both comparisons =0.01). Adiponectin and resistin levels did not change upon infliximab administration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study shows that in non-diabetic patients with AS on treatment with infliximab adiponectin and resistin serum levels do not correlate with disease activity. Nevertheless, adiponectin concentration correlates with insulin sensitivity.

After 12 weeks of infliximab treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, lipid parameters, body\u2013mass index, waist circumference and waist\u2013hip ratio, whereas fasting glucose levels (p = 0.001), triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (p = 0.043) and total cholesterol/HDL (p = 0.041) ratio increased significantly from baseline. A significant decrease was observed for both systolic blood pressures (p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.003) in the 12th-week visit. A significant decrease was also found in terms of Framingham risk scores (p = 0.028) after treatment. Conclusions. Study results suggest that infliximab treatment may reduce cardiovascular risk and blood pressures without changing IR.",

        "title": "Impact of TNF-\u03b1 Inhibitors on Body Weight and BMI: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
        "abstract": "Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies was to ascertain to effects of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor therapy on body weight and BMI. Methods Three databases (PubMed, OVID, and EMBASE) were systematically searched from inception to August 2018. We identified prospective, retrospective, and randomized controlled studies in adults with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases treated with TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors based on pre-specified inclusion criteria. A random-effects model was used to estimate standardised mean change (SMCC). Results Twenty-six longitudinal studies with a total of 1,245 participants were included in the meta-analysis. We found evidence for a small increase in body weight (SMCC = 0.24, p = .0006, 95% CI [0.10, 0.37]) and in BMI (SMCC = 0.26, p < .0001, 95% CI [0.13, 0.39]). On average, patients gained 0.90kg (SD = 5.13) under infliximab, 2.34kg (D = 5.65) under etanercept and 2.27kg (SD = 4.69) during treatment with adalimumab within the duration of the respective studies (4\u2013104 weeks). Conclusion Our results yield further support the for the view that TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors increase body weight and BMI as a potential side effect. Modulating cytokine signaling could be a future therapeutic mechanism to treat disorders associated with weight changes such as anorexia nervosa.",

        "title": "Infliximab Is Not Associated With a General Long-Term Weight Gain in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Nationwide Study",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) may lose weight during periods of active disease and may gain weight when inflammation heals. Studies have hypothesized an association between antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-\u03b1) and unintended weight gain during maintenance therapy, and this association has not been previously clarified. METHODS: In a nationwide observational study based on Danish national health registries, we included patients who initiated therapy with infliximab and followed changes in weight during induction therapy (0\u201390 days) and maintenance therapy (91\u2013270 days). The association between the use of infliximab and weight gain was analyzed by a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model. RESULTS: Among 851 patients with CD and UC who initiated infliximab therapy, long-term weight gain was not observed during maintenance therapy in most of the patients. Women with CD who were underweight at the initiation of therapy had an average weight gain of 7.5 kg. Men and women with CD and UC with normal or increased body mass index had an average weight gain of <2 kg during maintenance therapy. Underweight men with CD and UC gained 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval 2.1\u20133.6) and 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval 1.9\u20133.9), respectively, in the first 90 days, although neither group had statistically significant weight gain in the maintenance period. Less than 3% of the patients had weight gain greater than 10% of their baseline body weight during the study period. DISCUSSION: Weight gain among patients treated with anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapies is unlikely to be due to an effect from anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy.",
