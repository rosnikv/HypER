        "abstract": "Until a cure for Crohn's disease(s) is found, strategies that prolong the time spent in remission offer the greatest hope for reducing the morbidity and significant social costs associated with the disease. Medical therapy to date has been disappointing, and the search for a safe, effective therapy that could be offered at low cost continues. The aminosalicylates, so effective in ulcerative colitis, have shown, at best, minimal efficacy in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Conventional corticosteroids are not effective, and any reduction in time to relapse for budesonide-treated patients is measured in weeks not months. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are effective in maintaining remission, but all three have significant side effects. Antibiotics may have a role to play. Biological therapy may be considered, but the issues of cost and long-term safety require evaluation. Future studies should segregate patients into two groups, those with a medically induced remission and patients whose concern is the prevention of postoperative recurrence.",

        "title": "Maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease",
        "abstract": "The aetiology of Crohn's disease is unknown and therefore no curative treatments are available for the disease. The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by recurrent flare\u2010ups of symptoms. Several drug treatments are effective in inducing clinical remission. However, no drug treatments are available in order to prevent clinical relapses, although several drug regimens may delay clinical flare\u2010ups. Crohn's disease treatment for maintaining clinical remission needs to be tailored in relation to specific characteristics of each patient. The frequency of clinical relapse indeed shows marked variations in subgroups of patients, as the likelyhood of relapse is higher in patients in clinical remission for less than 6\u2003months. Treatment strategies for maintaining remission may therefore differ among inactive patients. In chronically active, steroid\u2010dependent or steroid\u2010refractory Crohn's disease patients immunomodulatory drugs (azathioprine 2\u20132.5\u2003mg/kg by mouth, 6\u2010mercaptopurine 1\u20131.5\u2003mg/kg by mouth, or methotrexate 15\u201325\u2003mg/i.m./week) should be added to oral mesalazine (2.4\u2003g/day), while in long\u2010term inactive Crohn's disease patients mesalazine alone may be effective in delaying relapse. Recently, treatment with anti\u2010tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies (Infliximab or CDP571) has shown efficacy in delaying relapse in responsive patients. One other issue which needs to be considered before selecting drug treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease, is that Crohn's disease activity is currently assessed on the basis of standard clinical scores which may not appropriately reflect the biological activity of the disease. Clinical remission as defined by standardized scores may include heterogeneous subgroups of patients showing different endoscopic and histological activity or persistence of activated immunocompetent cells within the gut. Several sub\u2010clinical markers of relapse have indeed been reported in quiescent Crohn's disease, although their usefulness in clinical practice in currently uncertain.",

Although no available pharmacologic data support the assumption that the bioavailability of methotrexate is diminished in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, most such patients receive methotrexate parenterally. Methods: The oral bioavailability of methotrexate was determined in 11 pediatric patients being treated with methotrexate for inflammatory bowel disease. Serial plasma methotrexate concentrations were determined after equal subcutaneous and oral doses of methotrexate. Results: The mean bioavailability of methotrexate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was 84% \u00b1 38%. Interpatient variability in drug exposure was similar after oral and subcutaneous administration. Conclusions: The bioavailability of methotrexate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is no different from that observed in other disease states. Subcutaneous administration of methotrexate does not appear to decrease the interpatient variability in drug exposure. There is no sound pharmacologic basis for favoring administration of methotrexate via the subcutaneous route for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "title": "Role of Methotrexate in the Management of Crohn Disease",
        "abstract": "Background: The majority of children with Crohn disease (CD) are likely to need some form of immunomodulatory therapy to maintain remission and to avoid long-term corticosteroid usage. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, some children are unresponsive or intolerant to these drugs. Biological agents like infliximab are being increasingly used in these circumstances, but long-term safety has yet to be established. Methotrexate has been shown to induce and maintain remission in CD in many adult studies, but pediatric data are limited. The present report describes our experience of using methotrexate in CD in children. Patients and Methods: All children with CD treated with methotrexate were identified by the departmental database. Case records were reviewed for site of disease, Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, medications, time to achieve remission, duration of remission, and complications. Results: A total of 10 children received methotrexate, 7 of whom were female and 3 of whom were male. All of the children had colonic involvement and had active disease despite previous standard medical treatments. Seven children exhibited remission with methotrexate treatment. Median time to achieve remission was 12 weeks and median duration of remission was 21 months to the point of assessment. One child had transient increase of alanine aminotransferase levels and another developed neutropenia, which remitted with dose reduction. None needed discontinuation of methotrexate treatment. Conclusions: Methotrexate is effective and well tolerated in children with CD. It should be considered in those patients who do not experience a remission with standard medications because it may avoid the use of biological agents and their potential uncertain long-term side effects.",

        "abstract": "Background: Immunomodulatory drugs play a major role in maintaining remission and steroid sparing in children with Crohn disease. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, unresponsiveness or intolerance to these drugs is common. The efficacy of methotrexate in maintenance of remission has been shown in adult Crohn disease; however, pediatric data are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in induction and maintenance of clinical remission in children with active Crohn disease who failed thiopurine treatment. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective multicenter study, efficacy of methotrexate in inducing and maintaining remission or response was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, paediatric Crohn disease activity index and steroid use, in 25 children with Crohn disease, refractory or intolerant to thiopurine analogues. Results: Crohn disease was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 \u00b1 3.1 years and methotrexate was initiated at age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1 years. The median methotrexate dose was 12.5 mg/m2. Remission was achieved in 16 patients (64%), and response in 6 patients (24%). Out of 18 patients treated for longer than 6 months, 83% were in remission or response after 12 months of treatment. The mean duration of remission and response was 10.8 \u00b1 8.8 months. Steroid withdrawal was possible in 12/16 patients (75%) receiving steroids at methotrexate introduction. Adverse effects were observed in 6 patients (24%) including nausea and vomiting in 3, elevation of liver enzymes in 2 and pancreatitis in 1 patient. Conclusions: Methotrexate is beneficial in maintaining remission and steroid-sparing treatment in children with Crohn disease following failure of thiopurine therapy.",

        "abstract": "Ileal lesions in Crohn's disease (CD) patients are abnormally colonized by pathogenic adherent\u2010invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). AIEC bacteria are able to replicate within epithelial cells after lysis of the endocytic vacuole and within macrophages in a large vacuole. CD\u2010associated polymorphisms in NOD2, ATG16L1 and IRGM affect bacterial autophagy, a crucial innate immunity mechanism. We previously determined that defects in autophagy impaired the ability of epithelial cells to control AIEC replication. AIEC behave differently within epithelial cells and macrophages and so we investigated the impact of defects in autophagy on AIEC intramacrophagic replication and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine response. AIEC bacteria induced the recruitment of the autophagy machinery at the site of phagocytosis, and functional autophagy limited AIEC intramacrophagic replication. Impaired ATG16L1, IRGM or NOD2 expression induced increased intramacrophagic AIEC and increased secretion of IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in response to AIEC infection. In contrast, forced induction of autophagy decreased the numbers of intramacrophagic AIEC and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine release, even in a NOD2\u2010deficient context. On the basis of our findings, we speculate that stimulating autophagy in CD patients would be a powerful therapeutic strategy to concomitantly restrain intracellular AIEC replication and slow down the inflammatory response.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nLevels of microRNAs are altered in intestinal tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which colonize the ileal mucosa of patients with CD, adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells. We investigated the mechanism by which AIEC infection alters the expression of microRNAs and the host immune response.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLevels of microRNAs in human intestinal epithelial T84 cells and in mouse enterocytes were measured using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Luciferase assays were used to measure binding of microRNAs to the 3'-untranslated region of messenger RNA targets. Binding of nuclear factor-\u03baB to promoters of genes encoding microRNAs was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Autophagy was measured by immunoblot analyses and immunofluorescent labeling of LC3. Anti-microRNAs were transferred to mice using ileal loops. Biopsy specimens from the terminal ileum of patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 20), CD (n = 20), or individuals without inflammatory bowel disease undergoing surveillance colonoscopies (controls, n = 13) were collected during endoscopic examination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAIEC infection up-regulated levels of microRNA (MIR) 30C and MIR130A in T84 cells and in mouse enterocytes by activating nuclear factor-\u03baB. Up-regulation of these microRNAs reduced the levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1 and inhibited autophagy, leading to increased numbers of intracellular AIEC and an increased inflammatory response. In ileal biopsy samples of patients with CD, there was an inverse correlation between levels of MIR30C and MIR130A and those of ATG5 and ATG16L1, supporting in vitro findings. Inhibition of MIR30C and MIR130A in cultured intestinal epithelial cells and in mouse enterocytes blocked AIEC-induced inhibition of ATG5 and ATG16L1 expression and restored functional autophagy. This resulted in more effective clearance of intracellular AIEC and reduced AIEC-induced inflammation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInfection with AIEC up-regulates microRNAs to reduce expression of proteins required for autophagy and autophagy response in intestinal epithelial cells. Ileal samples from patients with CD have increased levels of these same microRNAs and reduced levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, is believed to develop as a result of a deregulated inflammatory response to environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Despite advances in understanding the genetic risks of IBD, associated single nucleotide polymorphisms have low penetrance, monozygotic twin studies suggest a low concordance rate, and increasing worldwide IBD incidence leave gaps in our understanding of IBD heritability and highlight the importance of environmental influences. Operating at the interface between environment and heritable molecular and cellular phenotypes, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Studies to date have identified unique miRNA expression profile signatures in IBD and preliminary functional analyses associate these deregulated miRNAs to canonical pathways associated with IBD pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize and discuss the miRNA expression signatures associated with IBD in tissue and peripheral blood, highlight miRNAs with potential future clinical applications as diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and provide an outlook on how to develop miRNA based therapies.",

We sought to evaluate the role of microRNAs in neoplasia development in this high-risk population. Experimental Design: Tissue from 12 controls, 9 ulcerative colitis patients without neoplasia, and 11 ulcerative colitis patients with neoplasia was analyzed. miRNA array analysis was performed and select miRNAs assayed by real-time PCR on the discovery cohort and a validation cohort. DNA methylation of miR-193a was assessed. Following transfection of miR-193a-3p, proliferation, IL17RD expression, and luciferase activity of the 3\u2032UTR of IL17RD were measured. Tumor growth in xenografts as well as EGFR signaling were assessed in HCT116 cells expressing IL17RD with either a mutant 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) or wild-type (WT) 3\u2032UTR. Results: miR-31, miR-34a, miR-106b, and miR-193a-3p were significantly dysregulated in ulcerative colitis-neoplasia and adjacent tissue. Significant down-regulation of miR-193a-3p was also seen in an independent cohort of ulcerative colitis cancers. Changes in methylation of miR-193a or expression of pri-miR-193a were not observed in ulcerative colitis cancer. Transfection of miR-193a-3p resulted in decreased proliferation, and identified IL17RD as a direct target of miR-193a-3p. IL17RD expression was increased in ulcerative colitis cancers, and miR-193a-3p treatment decreased growth and EGFR signaling of HCT116 cells in xenografts expressing both IL17RD with WT 3\u2032UTR compared with cells expressing IL17RD with mutant 3\u2032UTR.

Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in cancer development and progression. Our previous study showed an inverse relationship between miR-193a-3p expression and the prognosis of CRC. However, the exact biological functions of miR-193a-3p in CRC are still poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of miR-193a-3p in CRC. Methods Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to examine the expression levels of RNA and protein, respectively. A dual luciferase assay was performed to validate predicted targets of miR-193a-3p. Loss and gain-of-function studies were carried out to reveal the effects and potential mechanism of the miR-193a-3p in the proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis of CRC cells. Results The expression levels of miR-193a-3p in human CRC cell lines were significantly decreased compared with that in normal colonic epithelium cell line. Furthermore, plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) was validated as a direct target gene of miR-193a-3p. Over-expression of miR-193a-3p inhibited proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of HT-29 cell, whereas forced expression of PLAU could rescue the inhibitory effects.

        "abstract": "Background Metastasis is a major event for survival and prognosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). A primary cause of metastasis is the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) is involved in the transformation of plasminogen to plasmin leading to hydrolyzation of ECM-related proteins. However, the role of PLAU expression in HNSCC is unclear and the worth being investigated. Methods PLAU expression profiles and clinical parameters from multiple HNSCC datasets were used to investigate the relationship of PLAU expression and HNSCC survival. GO and PPI network were established on PLAU-related downstream molecular. The stroma score was deconvoluted for analysis of PLAU\u2019s association with the immune environment. ROC analysis was applied to show the performance of PLAU in predicting HNSCC prognosis. Results PLAU mRNA was significantly elevated, as opposed to its methylation, in HNSCC tumor samples over normal specimens (all p < 0.01). Univariate and multivariate cox analysis showed PLAU could be an independent indicator for HNSCC prognosis. Combining with neck lymph node status, the AUC of PLAU in predicting 5-years overall survival reached to 0.862. GO enrichment analysis showed the major biological process (extracellular matrix organization and the P13K-Akt signaling pathway) may involve to the possible mechanism of PLAU\u2019s function on HNSCC prognosis. Furthermore, PLAU expression was positively correlated with stroma cell score, M1 type macrophages, and negatively associated with CD4 + T cell, Tregs cell, and follicular helper T cell. Conclusions PLAU might be an independent biomarker for predicting outcomes of HNSCC patients. The elevated expression of PLAU was associated with HPV positivity and neck node status.

The different steps of the metastatic cascade rely on reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are regarded as a significant component in the TME of OSCC. However, the precise mechanisms regulating CAFs in OSCC are poorly understood. Methods Thirteen genes related to the arecoline were analyzed to explore the significant ones involved in arecoline-related OSCC metastasis. The GSE139869 (n = 10) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-OSCC data (n = 361) were mined for the identification of the differentially expressed genes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to identify the independent prognostic signatures. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted to explore the functional enrichment of selected genes, and gene set enrichment analysis of cuproptosis-related genes was completed. Spearman\u2019s analysis and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) were used to visualize the correlation between the infiltration of CAFs and the gene expression. The correlation analysis of the cells and different genes, including CAF infiltration and transcripts per million expression, was assessed. The relationship between arecoline and CAFs was confirmed by cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8). CancerSEA was searched to identify the single-cell phenotype. Result Arecoline-associated fibrosis-related OSCC differentially expressed genes (AFOC-DEGs), namely, PLAU, IL1A, SPP1, CCL11, TERT, and COL1A2, were screened out and selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and TCGA database. AFOC-DEGs were highly expressed in OSCC, which led to poor survival of patients. Functional enrichment analysis, protein\u2013protein interaction network construction, and Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis all suggested that AFOC-DEGs were closely associated with cuproptosis. Cellular experiments demonstrated that arecoline stimulation could significantly increase the cell viability of CAFs. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) results showed that GLS and MTF1 were highly expressed when fibroblasts proliferated at high enrichment levels. In addition, analysis of single-cell sequencing results suggested that OSCC cells with high expression of AFOC-DEGs were associated with OSCC metastasis. Conclusion We found a close association between arecoline, cuproptosis, and CAFs, which might play an important role in the metastasis of OSCC.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the role of PLAU in the metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is related to the role of PLAU in HNSCC studied in the source paper."

        "abstract": "Introduction Sepsis is a worldwide epidemic, with high morbidity and mortality. Cuproptosis is a form of cell death that is associated with a wide range of diseases. This study aimed to explore genes associated with cuproptosis in sepsis, construct predictive models and screen for potential targets. Methods The LASSO algorithm and SVM-RFE model has been analysed the expression of cuproptosis-related genes in sepsis and immune infiltration characteristics and identified the marker genes under a diagnostic model. Gene-drug networks, mRNA-miRNA networks and PPI networks were constructed to screen for potential biological targets. The expression of marker genes was validated based on the GSE57065 dataset. Consensus clustering method was used to classify sepsis samples. Results We found 381 genes associated with the development of sepsis and discovered significantly differentially expressed cuproptosis-related genes of 16 cell types in sepsis and immune infiltration with CD8/CD4 T cells being lower. NFE2L2, NLRP3, SLC31A1, DLD, DLAT, PDHB, MTF1, CDKN2A and DLST were identified as marker genes by the LASSO algorithm and the SVM-RFE model. AUC > 0.9 was constructed for PDHB and MTF1 alone respectively. The validation group data for PDHB (P=0.00099) and MTF1 (P=7.2e-14) were statistically significant. Consistent clustering analysis confirmed two subtypes. The C1 subtype may be more relevant to cellular metabolism and the C2 subtype has some relevance to immune molecules.The results of animal experiments showed that the gene expression was consistent with the bioinformatics analysis. Discussion Our study systematically explored the relationship between sepsis and cuproptosis and constructed a diagnostic model. And, several cuproptosis-related genes may interfere with the progression of sepsis through immune cell infiltration.",
