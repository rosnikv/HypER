        "title": "Impact of automated calls with nurse follow-up on diabetes treatment outcomes in a Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe evaluated automated telephone disease management (ATDM) with telephone nurse follow-up as a strategy for improving diabetes treatment processes and outcomes in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinics. We also compared the results with those of a prior ATDM trial conducted in a county health care system.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 272 VA patients with diabetes using hypoglycemic medications were randomized. During the 1-year study period, intervention patients received biweekly ATDM health assessment and self-care education calls, and a nurse educator followed up with patients based on their ATDM assessment reports. Telephone surveys were used to measure patients' self-care, symptoms, and satisfaction with care. Outpatient service use was evaluated using electronic databases and self-reports, and glycemic control was measured by HbA1c and serum glucose testing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 12 months, intervention patients reported more frequent glucose self-monitoring and foot inspections than patients receiving usual care and were more likely to be seen in podiatry and diabetes specialty clinics. Intervention patients also were more likely than control patients to have had a cholesterol test. Among patients with baseline HbA1c levels > or =8%, mean end-point values were lower among intervention patients than control patients (8.7 vs. 9.2%, respectively; P = 0.04). Among intervention and control patients with baseline values > or =9%, mean end-point values were 9.1 and 10.2%, respectively (P = 0.04). At follow-up, intervention patients reported fewer symptoms of poor glycemic control than control patients and greater satisfaction with their health care.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis intervention improved the quality of VA diabetes care. Intervention effects for most end points replicated findings from the prior county clinic trial, although intervention-control differences in the current study were smaller because of the relatively good self-care and health status among the current study's enrollees.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis study evaluated the efficacy of a nurse-care management system designed to improve outcomes in patients with complicated diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nIn this randomized controlled trial that took place at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, CA, 169 patients with longstanding diabetes, one or more major medical comorbid conditions, and HbA(lc) >10% received a special intervention (n = 84) or usual medical care (n = 85) for 1 year. Patients met with a nurse-care manager to establish individual outcome goals, attended group sessions once a week for up to 4 weeks, and received telephone calls to manage medications and self-care activities. HbA(lc), LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and psychosocial factors were measured at baseline and 1 year later. Annualized physician visits were determined for the year before and during the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 1 year, the mean reductions in HbA(lc), total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol were significantly greater for the intervention group compared with the usual care group. Significantly more patients in the intervention group met the goals for HbA(1c) (<7.5%) than patients in usual care (42.6 vs. 24.6%, P < 0.03, chi(2)). There were no significant differences in any of the psychosocial variables or in physician visits.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA nurse-care management program can significantly improve some medical outcomes in patients with complicated diabetes without increasing physician visits.",

Exposure patients had one or more contacts with a care manager; controls were matched on utilization, demographics, testing, and baseline glucose control. Using role-specific information technology to support their efforts, care managers assessed patients' readiness for change, followed guidelines, and educated and motivated patients.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION\nPatient data collected as part of an electronic patient record were combined with care manager-created databases to assess timely testing of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and changes in LDL and HbA1c levels.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nIn a multivariable model, the odds of being overdue for testing for HbA1c decreased by 21 percent in the exposure group (n=1,185) versus the control group (n=4,740). The odds of being tested when overdue for HbA1c or LDL increased by 49 and 26 percent, respectively, and the odds of HbA1c <7.0 percent also increased by 19 percent in the exposure group. The average HbA1c levels decreased more in the exposure group than in the controls.

        "title": "Implementing a multidisease chronic care model in primary care using people and technology.",
        "abstract": "Management of chronic disease is performed inadequately in the United States in spite of the availability of beneficial, effective therapies. Successful programs to manage patients with these diseases must overcome multiple challenges, including the recognized fragmentation and complexity of the healthcare system, misaligned incentives, a focus on acute problems, and a lack of team-based care. In many successful programs, care is provided in settings or episodes that focus on a single disease. While these programs may allow for streamlined, focused provision of care, comprehensive care for multiple diseases may be more difficult. At Intermountain Healthcare (Intermountain), a generalist model of chronic disease management was formulated to overcome the limitations associated with specialization. In the Intermountain approach, which reflects elements of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), care managers located within multipayer primary care clinics collaborate with physicians, patients, and other members of a primary care team to improve patient outcomes for a variety of conditions. An important part of the intervention is widespread use of an electronic health record (EHR). This EHR provides flexible access to clinical data, individualized decision support designed to encourage best practice for patients with a variety of diseases (including co-occurring ones), and convenient communication between providers. This generalized model is used to treat diverse patients with disparate and coexisting chronic conditions. Early results from the application of this model show improved patient outcomes and improved physician productivity. Success factors, challenges, and obstacles in implementing the model are discussed.",

        "title": "VA Healthcare Costs of a Collaborative Intervention for Chronic Pain in Primary Care",
        "abstract": "Background:Chronic pain is costly to individuals and the healthcare system, and is often undertreated. Collaborative care models show promise for improving treatment of patients with chronic pain. The objectives of this article are to report the incremental benefit and incremental health services costs of a collaborative intervention for chronic pain from a veterans affairs (VA) healthcare perspective. Methods:Data on VA treatment costs incurred by participants were obtained from the VA's Decision Support System for all utilization except certain intervention activities which were tracked in a separate database. Outcome data were from a cluster-randomized trial of a collaborative intervention for chronic pain among 401 primary care patients at a VA medical center. Intervention group participants received assessments and care management; stepped-care components were offered to patients requiring more specialized care. The main outcome measure was pain disability-free days (PDFDs), calculated from Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. Results:Participants in the intervention group experienced an average of 16 additional PDFDs over the 12-month follow-up window as compared with usual care participants; this came at an adjusted incremental cost of $364 per PDFD for a typical participant. Important predictors of costs were baseline medical comorbidities, depression severity, and prior year's treatment costs. Conclusions:This collaborative intervention resulted in more pain disability-free days and was more expensive than usual care. Further research is necessary to identify if the intervention is more cost-effective for some patient subgroups and to learn whether pain improvements and higher costs persist after the intervention has ended.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFatigue is a prevalent and burdensome symptom for patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent and is associated with reduced quality of life. Psychosocial interventions seem promising for management of fatigue among cancer patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for fatigue in adult patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and seven clinical trial registries; we also searched the reference lists of articles. The date of our most recent search was 29 November 2016.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial interventions in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing cancer treatment with palliative intent for incurable cancer versus usual care or other controls. Psychosocial interventions were defined as various kinds of interventions provided to influence or change cognitions, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these. Psychosocial interventions of interest to this review had to involve at least two interactions between the patient and the care provider in which the care provider gave the patient personal feedback concerning changes sought by these interventions. We included trials that reported fatigue as an outcome of interest.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data, including information on adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 14 studies (16 reports) that met inclusion criteria for this review and involved 3077 randomised participants in total. Most of these studies included a mixed sample of participants; we obtained data for the subset of interest for this review (diagnosis of incurable cancer and receiving cancer treatment) from the study investigators of 12 studies, for which we included 535 participants in the subset meta-analysis for fatigue post intervention. Researchers investigated a broad range of psychosocial interventions with different intervention aims and durations. We identified sources of potential bias, including lack of description of methods of blinding and allocation concealment and inclusion of small study populations.Findings from our meta-analysis do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing fatigue post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.50 to 0.00; not significant; 535 participants, 12 studies; very low-quality evidence). First follow-up findings on fatigue suggested benefit for participants assigned to the psychosocial intervention compared with control (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.32; 147 participants, four studies; very low-quality evidence), which was not sustained at second follow-up (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.30; not significant; very low-quality evidence).Results for our secondary outcomes revealed very low-quality evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in improving physical functioning post intervention (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; 307 participants, seven studies). These findings were not sustained at first follow-up (SMD 0.37, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.94; not significant; 122 participants, two studies; very low-quality evidence). Findings do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving social functioning (mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI -11.20 to 19.53; not significant; 141 participants, four studies), role functioning (MD 3.49, 95% CI -12.78 to 19.76; not significant; 143 participants, four studies), emotional functioning (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.35; not significant; 115 participants, three studies), or cognitive functioning (MD -2.23, 95% CI -12.52 to 8.06; not significant; 86 participants, two studies) post intervention. Only three studies evaluated adverse events. These studies found no difference between the number of adverse events among participants in the intervention versus control group.Using GRADE, we considered the overall quality of evidence for our primary and secondary outcomes to be very low. Therefore, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate, and the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Limitations in study quality and imprecision due to sparse data resulted in downgrading of the quality of data. Additionally, most studies were at high risk of bias owing to their small sample size for the subset of patients with incurable cancer (fewer than 50 participants per arm), leading to uncertainty about effect estimates.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nWe found little evidence around the benefits of psychosocial interventions provided to reduce fatigue in adult patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent. Additional studies with larger samples are required to assess whether psychosocial interventions are beneficial for addressing fatigue in patients with incurable cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fatigue often interferes with functioning in patients with advanced cancer, resulting in increased family caregiver burden. Acceptance and commitment therapy, a promising intervention for cancer-related suffering, has rarely been applied to dyads coping with advanced cancer. Aim: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for patient-caregiver dyads coping with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Primary outcomes were patient fatigue interference and caregiver burden. Design: In this pilot trial, dyads were randomized to six weekly sessions of telephone-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy or education/support, an attention control. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2\u2009weeks and 3\u2009months post-intervention. Setting/participants: Forty patients with stage III\u2013IV gastrointestinal cancer and fatigue interference and family caregivers with burden or distress were recruited from two oncology clinics and randomized. Results: The eligibility screening rate (54%) and retention rate (81% at 2\u2009weeks post-intervention) demonstrated feasibility. At 2\u2009weeks post-intervention, acceptance and commitment therapy participants reported high intervention helpfulness (mean\u2009=\u20094.25/5.00). Group differences in outcomes were not statistically significant. However, when examining within-group change, acceptance and commitment therapy patients showed moderate decline in fatigue interference at both follow-ups, whereas education/support patients did not show improvement at either follow-up. Acceptance and commitment therapy caregivers showed medium decline in burden at 2\u2009weeks that was not sustained at 3\u2009months, whereas education/support caregivers showed little change in burden.

A total of eight patients attended all sessions over the three cycles, and 90% participated in at least one cycle. Furthermore, attendance was associated with a statistically significant improvement in Quality of Life (QoL). Each additional session was associated with a mean increase in overall QoL score of more than one point (\u03b2 = 1.09 [0.13; 2.04], p = 0.02). The fatigue dimensions decreased with session attendance: physical (\u03b2 = \u22122.24 [\u22123.63; \u22120.85]), emotional (\u03b2 = \u22122.60 [\u22124.11; \u22121.09]), and interference with daily life (\u03b2 = \u22122.33 [\u22123.95; \u22120.72]). The qualitative section demonstrated that patients learned skills and shared their ability to \u201clet go\u201d. Patients rated the degree of importance of the program at 8.36/10 (SD \u00b1 1.64). Conclusion This study highlights the feasibility and acceptability of an original program that combines ACT and mindfulness practices in cancer patients. Future studies are required to demonstrate the efficacy of the MAEVA program. The MAEva pilot study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT04751201.
