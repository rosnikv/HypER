        "title": "Efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin for secondary sleep disorders and sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction: meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Objective To conduct a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in managing secondary sleep disorders and sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. Data sources 13 electronic databases and reference lists of relevant reviews and included studies; Associated Professional Sleep Society abstracts (1999 to 2003). Study selection The efficacy review included randomised controlled trials; the safety review included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Quality assessment Randomised controlled trials were assessed by using the Jadad Scale and criteria by Schulz et al, and non-randomised controlled trials by the Downs and Black checklist. Data extraction and synthesis One reviewer extracted data and another reviewer verified the data extracted. The inverse variance method was used to weight studies and the random effects model was used to analyse data. Main results Six randomised controlled trials with 97 participants showed no evidence that melatonin had an effect on sleep onset latency in people with secondary sleep disorders (weighted mean difference \u221213.2 (95% confidence interval \u221227.3 to 0.9) min). Nine randomised controlled trials with 427 participants showed no evidence that melatonin had an effect on sleep onset latency in people who had sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction (\u22121.0 (\u22122.3 to 0.3) min). 17 randomised controlled trials with 651 participants showed no evidence of adverse effects of melatonin with short term use (three months or less). Conclusions There is no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. There is evidence that melatonin is safe with short term use.",

        "title": "Experimental and clinical aspects of melatonin and clock genes in diabetes",
        "abstract": "The pineal hormone melatonin influences insulin secretion, as well as glucagon and somatostatin secretion, both in vivo and in vitro. These effects are mediated by two specific, high\u2010affinity, seven transmembrane, pertussis toxin\u2010sensitive, Gi\u2010protein\u2010coupled melatonin receptors, MT1 and MT2. Both isoforms are expressed in the \u03b2\u2010cells, \u03b1\u2010cells as well as \u03b4\u2010cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and are involved in the modulation of insulin secretion, leading to inhibition of the adenylate cyclase\u2010dependent cyclic adenosine monophosphate as well as cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation in pancreatic \u03b2\u2010cells by inhibiting the soluble guanylate cyclase, probably via MT2 receptors. In this way, melatonin also likely inhibits insulin secretion, whereas using the inositol triphosphate pathway after previous blocking of Gi\u2010proteins by pertussis toxin, melatonin increases insulin secretion. Desynchrony of receptor signaling may lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. This notion has recently been supported by genomewide association studies pinpointing variances of the MT2 receptor as a risk factor for this rapidly spreading metabolic disturbance. As melatonin is secreted in a clearly diurnal fashion, it is safe to assume that it also has a diurnal impact on the blood\u2010glucose\u2010regulating function of the islet. Observations of the circadian expression of clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1,2,3, and Cry1,2) in pancreatic islets, as well as in INS1 rat insulinoma cells, may indicate that circadian rhythms are generated in the \u03b2\u2010cells themselves. The circadian secretion of insulin from pancreatic islets is clock\u2010driven. Disruption of circadian rhythms and clock function leads to metabolic disturbances, for example, type 2 diabetes. The study of melatonin\u2013insulin interactions in diabetic rat models has revealed an inverse relationship between these two hormones. Both type 2 diabetic rats and patients exhibit decreased melatonin levels and slightly increased insulin levels, whereas type 1 diabetic rats show extremely reduced levels or the absence of insulin, but statistically significant increases in melatonin levels. Briefly, an increase in melatonin levels leads to a decrease in stimulated insulin secretion and vice versa. Melatonin levels in blood plasma, as well as the activity of the key enzyme of melatonin synthesis, AA\u2010NAT (arylalkylamine\u2010N\u2010acetyltransferase) in pineal, are lower in type 2 diabetic rats compared to controls. In contrast, melatonin and pineal AA\u2010NAT mRNA are increased and insulin receptor mRNA is decreased in type 1 diabetic rats, which also indicates a close relationship between insulin and melatonin. As an explanation, it was hypothesized that catecholamines, which reduce insulin levels and stimulate melatonin synthesis, control insulin\u2013melatonin interactions. This conviction stems from the observation that catecholamines are increased in type 1 but are diminished in type 2 diabetes. In this context, another important line of inquiry involves the fact that melatonin protects \u03b2\u2010cells against functional overcharge and, consequently, hinders the development of type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to rise worldwide and is reaching pandemic proportions. The notion that this is due to obesity, resulting from excessive energy consumption and reduced physical activity, is overly simplistic. Circadian de-synchrony, which occurs when physiological processes are at odds with timing imposed by internal clocks, also promotes obesity and impairs glucose tolerance in mouse models, and is a feature of modern human lifestyles. The purpose of this review is to highlight what is known about glucose metabolism in animal and human models of circadian de-synchrony and examine the evidence as to whether shifts in meal timing contribute to impairments in glucose metabolism, gut hormone secretion and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Lastly, we examine whether restricting food intake to discrete time periods, will prevent or reverse abnormalities in glucose metabolism with the view to improving metabolic health in shift workers and in those more generally at risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",

        "title": "The factors influencing the eating behaviour of shiftworkers: what, when, where and why",
        "abstract": "Shiftwork leads to altered eating patterns, with workers often eating foods at all times across the 24\u2005h period. Strategies to reduce the burden of shiftwork on the workers should be prioritised and altering these eating patterns is an important area for change. This narrative review examines the current evidence on the individual and environmental factors influencing the eating behaviours of shiftworkers. A systematic search was conducted and yielded 62 articles. These were split into four themes that influence eating patterns; When shiftworkers eat, What type of foods shiftworkers eat, Where the food is sourced from, and Why shiftworkers choose to eat on shift. Irregular working hours was the biggest influence on when workers ate on shift, shift-type was the biggest influence on what workers ate, the majority of food was sourced from canteens and cafeterias, and socialising with colleagues was the biggest reason why workers chose to eat. While more research is needed to explore multiple industries and shift-types, and to investigate the ideal size, type and timing of food on shift, this review has highlighted that future research into shiftworker eating needs to adopt an integrative approach and consider the different individual and social contexts that influence eating patterns.",

        "abstract": "The workers and employees in various institutions are subjected to different shifts and work schedules. The employees work not only at daytime but also during odd hours at night. The biological clock of an individual is often altered during night shifts. This affects the psychosocial well-being and circadian nutritional intake of the worker. Disturbance in circadian rhythm results in the development of metabolic disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, and abdominal obesity. In the present review, we discuss the nature of shift work, sleep/wake cycle of an individual, chrononutrition, dietary habits, and meal changes with regard to timing and frequency, related to shift work. We also discuss the relationship between nutritional intake and psychosocial well-being among shift workers. The review may be beneficial for prevention of metabolic disorders and maintaining sound psychological condition in shift workers.",

        "abstract": "The synthesis and secretion of cortisol are controlled by the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. Cortisol exhibits a proper 24-h circadian rhythm that affects the brain, the autonomic nervous system, the heart, and the vasculature that prepares the cardiovascular system for optimal function during these anticipated behavioral cycles. A literature search was conducted using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. Relevant search terms included \u201ccircadian rhythm and cardiovascular\u201d, \u201ccortisol\u201d, \u201ccortisol and acute coronary syndrome\u201d, \u201ccortisol and arrhythmias\u201d, \u201ccortisol and sudden cardiac death\u201d, \u201ccortisol and stroke\u201d, and \u201ccardioprotective agents\u201d. A total of 120 articles were obtained on the basis of the above search. Lower levels of cortisol were seen at the beginning of sleep, while there was a rise towards the end of sleep, with the highest level reached at the moment the individual wakes up. In the present review, we discuss the role of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD1), which is a novel molecular target of interest for treating metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes mellitus. 11\u03b2-HSD1 is the major determinant of cortisol excess, and its inhibition alleviates metabolic abnormalities. The present review highlights the role of cortisol, which controls the circadian rhythm, and describes its effect on the cardiovascular system. The review provides a platform for future potential cardioprotective therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) belong to the group of steroid hormones. Their representative in humans is cortisol. GCs are involved in most physiological processes of the body and play a significant role in important biological processes, including reproduction, growth, immune responses, metabolism, maintenance of water and electrolyte balance, functioning of the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. The availability of cortisol to the glucocorticoid receptor is locally controlled by the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1). Evidence of changes in intracellular GC metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular complications highlights the role of selective 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibition in the pharmacotherapy of these diseases. This paper discusses the role of 11\u03b2-HSD1 in MetS and its cardiovascular complications and the importance of selective inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD1.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a series of nine new 2-(cyclopentylamino)thiazol-4(5H)-one derivatives were synthesized, and their anticancer, antioxidant, and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD) inhibitory activities were tested. Anticancer activity has been assessed using the MTS (MTS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay against human colon carcinoma (Caco-2), human pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1), glioma (U-118 MG), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), and skin melanoma (SK-MEL-30) cancer cell lines. Cell viability reductions, especially in the case of Caco-2, MDA-MB-231, and SK-MEL-30 lines, were observed for most compounds. In addition, the redox status was investigated and oxidative, but nitrosative stress was not noted at a concentration of 500 \u00b5M compounds tested. At the same time, a low level of reduced glutathione was observed in all cell lines when treated with compound 3g (5-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(cyclopentylamino)thiazol-4(5H)-one) that most inhibited tumor cell proliferation. However, the most interesting results were obtained in the study of inhibitory activity towards two 11\u03b2-HSD isoforms. Many compounds at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M showed significant inhibitory activity against 11\u03b2-HSD1 (11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1). The compound 3h (2-(cyclopentylamino)-1-thia-3-azaspiro[4.5]dec-2-en-4-one) showed the strongest 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitory effect (IC50 = 0.07 \u00b5M) and was more selective than carbenoxolone.

        "abstract": "The presented study depicts the synthesis of 11 carborane\u2013thiazole conjugates with anticancer activity, as well as an evaluation of their biological activity as inhibitors of two enzymes: tyrosinase and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1). The overexpression of tyrosinase results in the intracellular accumulation of melanin and can be observed in melanoma. The overexpression of 11\u03b2-HSD1 results in an elevation of glucocorticoid levels and has been associated with the aggravation of metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Recently, as the comorbidity of melanomas and metabolic disorders is being recognized as an important issue, the search for new therapeutic options has intensified. This study demonstrates that carborane\u2013thiazole derivatives inhibit both enzymes, exerting beneficial effects. The antiproliferative action of all newly synthesized compounds was evaluated using three cancer cell lines, namely A172 (human brain glioblastoma), B16F10 (murine melanoma) and MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma), as well as a healthy control cell line of HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells). The results show that 9 out of 11 newly synthesized compounds demonstrated similar antiproliferative action against the B16F10 cell line to the reference drug, and three of these compounds surpassed it. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate dual inhibitory action of carborane\u2013thiazole derivatives against both tyrosinase and 11\u03b2-HSD1. Therefore, it represents the first step towards the simultaneous treatment of melanoma and comorbid diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus.",
