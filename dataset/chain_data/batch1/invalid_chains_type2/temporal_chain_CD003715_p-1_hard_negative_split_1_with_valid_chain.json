        "abstract": "Until a cure for Crohn's disease(s) is found, strategies that prolong the time spent in remission offer the greatest hope for reducing the morbidity and significant social costs associated with the disease. Medical therapy to date has been disappointing, and the search for a safe, effective therapy that could be offered at low cost continues. The aminosalicylates, so effective in ulcerative colitis, have shown, at best, minimal efficacy in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Conventional corticosteroids are not effective, and any reduction in time to relapse for budesonide-treated patients is measured in weeks not months. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are effective in maintaining remission, but all three have significant side effects. Antibiotics may have a role to play. Biological therapy may be considered, but the issues of cost and long-term safety require evaluation. Future studies should segregate patients into two groups, those with a medically induced remission and patients whose concern is the prevention of postoperative recurrence.",

        "title": "Maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease",
        "abstract": "The aetiology of Crohn's disease is unknown and therefore no curative treatments are available for the disease. The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by recurrent flare\u2010ups of symptoms. Several drug treatments are effective in inducing clinical remission. However, no drug treatments are available in order to prevent clinical relapses, although several drug regimens may delay clinical flare\u2010ups. Crohn's disease treatment for maintaining clinical remission needs to be tailored in relation to specific characteristics of each patient. The frequency of clinical relapse indeed shows marked variations in subgroups of patients, as the likelyhood of relapse is higher in patients in clinical remission for less than 6\u2003months. Treatment strategies for maintaining remission may therefore differ among inactive patients. In chronically active, steroid\u2010dependent or steroid\u2010refractory Crohn's disease patients immunomodulatory drugs (azathioprine 2\u20132.5\u2003mg/kg by mouth, 6\u2010mercaptopurine 1\u20131.5\u2003mg/kg by mouth, or methotrexate 15\u201325\u2003mg/i.m./week) should be added to oral mesalazine (2.4\u2003g/day), while in long\u2010term inactive Crohn's disease patients mesalazine alone may be effective in delaying relapse. Recently, treatment with anti\u2010tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies (Infliximab or CDP571) has shown efficacy in delaying relapse in responsive patients. One other issue which needs to be considered before selecting drug treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease, is that Crohn's disease activity is currently assessed on the basis of standard clinical scores which may not appropriately reflect the biological activity of the disease. Clinical remission as defined by standardized scores may include heterogeneous subgroups of patients showing different endoscopic and histological activity or persistence of activated immunocompetent cells within the gut. Several sub\u2010clinical markers of relapse have indeed been reported in quiescent Crohn's disease, although their usefulness in clinical practice in currently uncertain.",

Although no available pharmacologic data support the assumption that the bioavailability of methotrexate is diminished in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, most such patients receive methotrexate parenterally. Methods: The oral bioavailability of methotrexate was determined in 11 pediatric patients being treated with methotrexate for inflammatory bowel disease. Serial plasma methotrexate concentrations were determined after equal subcutaneous and oral doses of methotrexate. Results: The mean bioavailability of methotrexate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was 84% \u00b1 38%. Interpatient variability in drug exposure was similar after oral and subcutaneous administration. Conclusions: The bioavailability of methotrexate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is no different from that observed in other disease states. Subcutaneous administration of methotrexate does not appear to decrease the interpatient variability in drug exposure. There is no sound pharmacologic basis for favoring administration of methotrexate via the subcutaneous route for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "title": "Role of Methotrexate in the Management of Crohn Disease",
        "abstract": "Background: The majority of children with Crohn disease (CD) are likely to need some form of immunomodulatory therapy to maintain remission and to avoid long-term corticosteroid usage. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, some children are unresponsive or intolerant to these drugs. Biological agents like infliximab are being increasingly used in these circumstances, but long-term safety has yet to be established. Methotrexate has been shown to induce and maintain remission in CD in many adult studies, but pediatric data are limited. The present report describes our experience of using methotrexate in CD in children. Patients and Methods: All children with CD treated with methotrexate were identified by the departmental database. Case records were reviewed for site of disease, Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, medications, time to achieve remission, duration of remission, and complications. Results: A total of 10 children received methotrexate, 7 of whom were female and 3 of whom were male. All of the children had colonic involvement and had active disease despite previous standard medical treatments. Seven children exhibited remission with methotrexate treatment. Median time to achieve remission was 12 weeks and median duration of remission was 21 months to the point of assessment. One child had transient increase of alanine aminotransferase levels and another developed neutropenia, which remitted with dose reduction. None needed discontinuation of methotrexate treatment. Conclusions: Methotrexate is effective and well tolerated in children with CD. It should be considered in those patients who do not experience a remission with standard medications because it may avoid the use of biological agents and their potential uncertain long-term side effects.",

        "abstract": "Background: Immunomodulatory drugs play a major role in maintaining remission and steroid sparing in children with Crohn disease. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, unresponsiveness or intolerance to these drugs is common. The efficacy of methotrexate in maintenance of remission has been shown in adult Crohn disease; however, pediatric data are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in induction and maintenance of clinical remission in children with active Crohn disease who failed thiopurine treatment. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective multicenter study, efficacy of methotrexate in inducing and maintaining remission or response was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, paediatric Crohn disease activity index and steroid use, in 25 children with Crohn disease, refractory or intolerant to thiopurine analogues. Results: Crohn disease was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 \u00b1 3.1 years and methotrexate was initiated at age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1 years. The median methotrexate dose was 12.5 mg/m2. Remission was achieved in 16 patients (64%), and response in 6 patients (24%). Out of 18 patients treated for longer than 6 months, 83% were in remission or response after 12 months of treatment. The mean duration of remission and response was 10.8 \u00b1 8.8 months. Steroid withdrawal was possible in 12/16 patients (75%) receiving steroids at methotrexate introduction. Adverse effects were observed in 6 patients (24%) including nausea and vomiting in 3, elevation of liver enzymes in 2 and pancreatitis in 1 patient. Conclusions: Methotrexate is beneficial in maintaining remission and steroid-sparing treatment in children with Crohn disease following failure of thiopurine therapy.",

        "title": "A Single-center Experience With Methotrexate After Thiopurine Therapy in Pediatric Crohn Disease",
        "abstract": "Background and Aim: Thiopurines are a common, effective means of maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). Methotrexate (MTX) may be considered for those intolerant of or unresponsive to thiopurines. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of MTX as maintenance therapy in patients previously treated with thiopurines. Patients and Methods: All of the patients at Nationwide Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2007 with an International Classification of Diseases code indicative of CD were identified. Patients with a diagnosis of CD, a history of prior thiopurine use, no current infliximab therapy, and at least 6 months of follow-up after MTX initiation were included. The primary outcome was defined as steroid-/infliximab-free remission determined by the physician global assessment at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included subsequent treatment with infliximab and/or corticosteroids, rate of discontinuation of MTX, and adverse events (AEs). Results: Twenty-seven patients (17 boys, 63%) with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.3 \u00b1 0.7 years and mean disease duration of 1.49 \u00b1 0.3 years were identified. Indications for MTX included nonresponse to thiopurines, AE, and poor adherence to thiopurines. At 6 and 12 months, 13 of 27 patients (48.1%) and 9 of 27 patients (33.3%), respectively, were in steroid-/infliximab-free remission. A total of 10 patients (37.0%) required infliximab therapy during the 12-month period and 5 patients discontinued MTX. Nausea was the most commonly reported AE. Transient transaminase elevation occurred in 4 patients and transient leukopenia in 2 patients. Conclusions: MTX can be effective as maintenance therapy for patients with pediatric CD previously intolerant of or unresponsive to thiopurines; however, greater than one third of this cohort required escalation to antitumor necrosis factor therapy within 12 months following MTX initiation. MTX was well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Unintended variation in the care of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) may prevent achievement of optimal outcomes. We sought to improve chronic care delivery and outcomes for children with inflammatory bowel disease by using network-based quality improvement methods. METHODS: By using a modified Breakthrough Series collaborative structure, 6 ImproveCareNow Network care centers tested changes in chronic illness care and collected data monthly. We used an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of these changes. RESULTS: Data were available for 843 children with CD and 345 with UC. Changes in care delivery were associated with an increase in the proportion of visits with complete disease classification, measurement of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) before initiation of thiopurines, and patients receiving an initial thiopurine dose appropriate to their TPMT status. These were significant in both populations for all process variables (P < .01) except for measurement of TPMT in CD patients (P = .12). There were significant increases in the proportion of CD (55%\u201368%) and UC (61%\u201372%) patients with inactive disease. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of CD patients not taking prednisone (86%\u201390%). Participating centers varied in the success of achieving these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the outcomes of patients with CD and UC were associated with improvements in the process of chronic illness care. Variation in the success of implementing changes suggests the importance of overcoming organizational factors related to quality improvement success.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: ImproveCareNow (ICN) is the largest pediatric learning health system in the nation and started as a quality improvement collaborative. To test the feasibility and validity of using ICN data for clinical research, we evaluated the effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (anti-TNF\u03b1) agents in the management of pediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Data were collected in 35 pediatric gastroenterology practices (April 2007 to March 2012) and analyzed as a sequence of nonrandomized trials. Patients who had moderate to severe CD were classified as initiators or non-initiators of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. Among 4130 patients who had pediatric CD, 603 were new users and 1211 were receiving anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy on entry into ICN. RESULTS: During a 26-week follow-up period, rate ratios obtained from Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for patient and disease characteristics and concurrent medications, were 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20\u20131.96) for clinical remission and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.33\u20132.29) for corticosteroid-free remission. The rate ratio for corticosteroid-free remission was comparable to the estimate produced by the adult SONIC study, which was a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. The number needed to treat was 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4\u201311.1) for clinical remission and 5.0 (95% CI, 3.4\u201310.0) for corticosteroid-free remission. CONCLUSIONS: In routine pediatric gastroenterology practice settings, anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy was effective at achieving clinical and corticosteroid-free remission for patients who had Crohn disease. Using data from the ICN learning health system for the purpose of observational research is feasible and produces valuable new knowledge.",

        "abstract": "The third paper in a series on how learning health systems can use routinely collected electronic health data (EHD) to advance knowledge and support continuous learning, this review describes how analytical methods for individual-level electronic health data EHD, including regression approaches, interrupted time series (ITS) analyses, instrumental variables, and propensity score methods, can also be used to address the question of whether the intervention \u201cworks.\u201d The two major potential sources of bias in non-experimental studies of health care interventions are that the treatment groups compared do not have the same probability of treatment or exposure and the potential for confounding by unmeasured covariates. Although very different, the approaches presented in this chapter are all based on assumptions about data, causal relationships, and biases. For instance, regression approaches assume that the relationship between the treatment, outcome, and other variables is properly specified, all of the variables are available for analysis (i.e., no unobserved confounders) and measured without error, and that the error term is independent and identically distributed. The instrumental variables approach requires identifying an instrument that is related to the assignment of treatment but otherwise has no direct on the outcome. Propensity score methods approaches, on the other hand, assume that there are no unobserved confounders. The epidemiological designs discussed also make assumptions, for instance that individuals can serve as their own control. To properly address these assumptions, analysts should conduct sensitivity analyses within the assumptions of each method to assess the potential impact of what cannot be observed. Researchers also should analyze the same data with different analytical approaches that make alternative assumptions, and to apply the same methods to different data sets. Finally, different analytical methods, each subject to different biases, should be used in combination and together with different designs, to limit the potential for bias in the final results.",
