        "abstract": "Much work has been done, using both non-pharmacological and pharmacological intervention strategies, to prevent type 2 diabetes. Non-pharmacological methods of prevention, such as diet and physical exercise, have been proven to be successful in the prevention of diabetes.[2] However, these methods are successful only if accompanied by intensive lifestyle counseling. This requires trained manpower and time, both of which are difficult to access and are expensive. Non-pharmacological preventative therapy may not always be possible because of age, presence of various diabetic complications (hypertension, heart disease, retinopathy), and comorbid conditions (osteoarthritis, obesity).[3]",

        "abstract": "Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder defined as glucose intolerance with the onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Women with GDM are at increased risk for adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome. The complications associated with GDM can be prevented by early recognition, intense monitoring and proper treatment. Aims: The present study was done to screen the high-risk pregnancy group for GDM, to find the incidence of abnormal results on screening and to correlate the abnormal results with the maternal and fetal outcomes. The study was done in a tertiary care hospital and teaching institute. It was a prospective cohort study. Materials and Methods: Selective screening for GDM was done in 150 pregnant women with high-risk factors. Screening was done with 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) after 18 weeks, and if GCT was negative then the test was repeated after 28 weeks of pregnancy. The patients who were having an abnormal GCT were subjected to 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All GDM patients were followed up and treated with diet and/or insulin therapy till delivery to know maternal and fetal outcomes. The period of study was from April 2008 to March 2009. Results: 7.3% of study population was OGCT positive. 6% of the study population was OGTT positive. Age >25 years, obesity, family history of DM, and past history of GDM were the risk factors significantly associated with GDM. One newborn had hypoglycemia and one had hyperbilirubinemia. The fetal and maternal outcome in GDM patients was good in our study due to early diagnosis and intervention. Conclusion: Women with GDM are at an increased risk for adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome. The increased morbidity in GDM is preventable by meticulous antenatal care.",

Although the source paper does not specifically address GDM, it discusses the prevention of type 2 diabetes, which is a related topic. However, the connection is not strong enough to consider this paper's hypothesis as dependent on the source paper's findings. Instead, it can be seen as inspired by the broader context of diabetes prevention."

        "abstract": "Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder defined as glucose intolerance with the onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Women with GDM are at increased risk for adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome. Hence, it is imperative that an early detection and management of the disease is done to ensure better maternal and fetal outcomes. Aims: This study was done to evaluate the prevalence of gestational diabetes using diabetes in pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) criteria and further assess its feto-maternal outcome in western Rajasthan. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in 500 patients between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, attending the antenatal outdoor. These patients were given 75 g oral glucose irrespective of the meals and their plasma glucose was estimated at 2 h. Patients with plasma glucose values \u0383140 mg/dl were labeled as GDM and the rest as the control or the non-GDM group. All GDM patients were followed up and treated with diet and/or insulin therapy till delivery to know maternal and fetal outcomes. Results: The prevalence of GDM in this study was 6.6%. Maternal and fetal complications in the GDM group were much higher than in the non-GDM group. Hypertension, vaginal candidiasis, and abruptio placentae were the common maternal complications, while macrosomia and stillbirths occurred in the fetuses. Conclusion: GDM as a disease entity adversely affects maternal and fetal outcomes. This also builds a strong case for following DIPSI guidelines in diagnosis and management of GDM.",

GDM is an important public health problem in India. Method: The present study was carried out in 300 antenatal women. Fasting blood glucose was measured after which they were given 75 g oral glucose and plasma glucose was estimated at 2 h. Patients with plasma glucose >140 mg/dl were labelled as GDM. Thus WHO criteria were used for diagnosing GDM. Data was collected from all subjects on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, education level, parity, family history of diabetes and/or hypertension, BMI, etc. and pregnancy outcome was studied. Results: Prevalence of GDM was found to be 8.33%. Gestational diabetes mellitus was found to be significantly associated with age, parity, BMI, socioeconomic status, education level and was also found to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: GDM adversely affects maternal and fetal outcomes and its prevalence is steadily rising. Appropriate interventions are required for its control.",

        "abstract": "Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus ((GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance of varying degree of severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM is associated with adverse fetomaternal outcome. Its early detection and management is essential for better perinatal outcome. The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus among pregnant women of western U.P. using diabetes in pregnancy study group in India (DIPSI) criteria and further assess its impact on fetomaternal outcome. Methods: This was a prospective study conducted at UP RIMS & R, Saifai, Uttar Pradesh, India including 225 pregnant women between 24-28 weeks gestational age who attended the antenatal OPD from January 2014 to January 2015.All women were given 75 gm oral glucose irrespective of their meals. Women with blood sugar values >140mg/dl were labeled as GDM and rest as control or non GDM group. All the GDM patients were followed up either with diet or insulin therapy till delivery to study fetomaternal outcome. Results: Out of 225 Women 22 women (9.7%) were diagnosed as having GDM and among risk factors, higher BMI was shown to be significant association (p<0.05). There was also significant difference among birth weight and neonatal complications in GDM and NON-GDM group (P<0.05). Conclusions: Due to high prevalence of GDM in India in our study we concluded that screening is very essential for all pregnant women even in low-risk group. As in our study which was done by single step method of DIPSI which was easy to performed, feasible for remote population. But more studies are needed to further conclude that DIPSI is sufficient for Indian population.",

        "title": "Diagnostic Significance of Ultrasonographic Markers and Score in Detection of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in the Indian Subcontinent",
        "abstract": "Abstract In most countries, only high-risk women are screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In addition, a onetime early screening test may miss GDM as it may be diagnosable between 24 and 28 weeks. Thus, it is preferable to have alternative tests to classify women as high risk for GDM and keep them under regular follow-up. A total of 120 women with singleton pregnancies and established maternal and/or pregnancy-related risk factors for GDM and who provided informed consent were subjected to an obstetric ultrasound scan at/or after 24 weeks' gestation followed by administration of a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Various ultrasound markers were determined/measured. Each ultrasound GDM marker was assigned 1 point to create the ultrasound gestational diabetes screening (UGDS) score. All ultrasound GDM markers positively correlated to the disease (P < 0.0001). The strongest independent predictor of GDM was an immature appearance of placenta (relative risk, 49.09; 95% confidence interval, 7.04\u2013342.28; P < 0.0001). Receiver operator characteristics showed an area under the curve of 96.9%, confirming good ability of the UGDS to discriminate between positive and negative oral glucose tolerance test. A UGDS score of 4, providing diagnostic efficiency of 92%, sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 92%, positive predictive value of 85.4%, and negative predictive value of 96.4%, is proposed by this study. This study suggests that ultrasound markers significantly vary in GDM compared with normal pregnancy women and that UGDS is a good predictor of GDM. The UGDS may be considered an adjunct to current screening tools for GDM.",
