        "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial. Fourteen patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis documented by cholestatic serum enzyme pattern, liver histological appearance and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were included in the trial. Six patients received ursodeoxycholic acid (13 to 15 mg/kg body wt/day), and eight patients received placebo. Two patients had to be withdrawn from the study, one because of UDCA\u2010related diarrhea and the other because of worsening of the disease during placebo treatment. Patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group improved significantly during 1 yr of treatment with respect to serum levels of bilirubin (median = \u2212 50%), alkaline phosphatase (median = \u2212 67%), \u03b3\u2010glutamyltransferase (median = \u2212 53%), AST (median = \u2212 54%) and ALT (median = \u2212 36%) compared with the placebo group, but not with respect to serum levels of hydrophobic bile acids. During ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, histopathological features also improved significantly, as evaluated by multiparametric score. Expression of human leukocyte antigen class I molecules appeared to be markedly reduced on liver cells after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. We conclude that ursodeoxycholic acid is beneficial in reducing disease activity in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (HEPATOLOGY 1992;16:707\u2013714.)",

        "title": "Tauroursodeoxycholic acid stimulates hepatocellular exocytosis and mobilizes extracellular Ca++ mechanisms defective in cholestasis.",
        "abstract": "To assess the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on bile excretory function, we examined whether TUDCA modulates vesicular exocytosis in the isolated perfused liver of normal rats in the presence of high (1.9 mM) or low (0.19 mM) extracellular Ca++ and in cholestatic rats 24 h after bile duct ligation. In addition, the effects of TUDCA on Ca++ homeostasis were compared in normal and in cholestatic hepatocytes. In the isolated perfused rat liver, TUDCA (25 microM) stimulated a sustained increase in the biliary excretion of horseradish peroxidase, a marker of the vesicular pathway, in the presence of high, but not low extracellular Ca++ or in the cholestatic liver. In contrast, TUDCA stimulated bile flow to the same extent regardless of the concentration of extracellular Ca++ or the presence of cholestasis. In indo-1-loaded hepatocytes, basal cytosolic free Ca++ ([Ca++]i) levels were not different between normal and cholestatic cells. However, in cholestatic cells [Ca++]i increases induced by TUDCA (10 microM) and its 7 alpha-OH epimer taurochenodeoxycholic acid (50 microM) were reduced to 22% and 26%, respectively, compared to normal cells. The impairment of TUDCA-induced [Ca++]i increase in cholestatic cells could be mimicked by exposing normal cells to low extracellular Ca++ (21%) or to the Ca++ channel blocker NiCl2 (23%). These data indicate that (a) dihydroxy bile acid-induced Ca++ entry may be of functional importance in the regulation of hepatocellular vesicular exocytosis, and (b) this Ca++ entry mechanism across the plasma membrane is impaired in cholestatic hepatocytes. We speculate that the beneficial effect of ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic liver diseases may be related to the Ca+(+)-dependent stimulation of vesicular exocytosis by its conjugate.",

Scanning electron micrographs showed loss of 70% of canalicular microvilli in BADP, 13% loss and pathologic changes in the remaining 75% of microvilli in BAPP, and no canalicular changes in BACIP. Cholestasis was not due to hydromechanical obstruction of bile ductules or bile Ca2+ depletion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBilirubin causes cholestasis in BADP by injuring canalicular microvilli.

        "abstract": "AIMS\nPreclinical results suggest therapeutic potential of mild hyperbilirubinemia in T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Translational data are limited, because an appropriate bilirubin formulation for parenteral human use is lacking. Considering its use in both clinical practice and medical research in the past, we explored the feasibility to reintroduce parenteral bilirubin for translational experiments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe developed a preparation method in accordance with good manufacturing practice and evaluated the parenteral applicability in healthy volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Explorative pharmacokinetic and safety data were compared to the results from a literature study on the former parenteral use of bilirubin. Bilirubin was administered intra-arterially to raise the local plasma concentration in the forearm vascular bed (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and intravenously to raise the systemic plasma concentration (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Finally, pharmacokinetic characteristics were studied following a single bolus infusion (n\u00a0=\u00a03).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring parenteral application, no side effects occurred. Adverse events mentioned during the two-week observation period were in general mild and self-limiting. Three more significant adverse events (appendicitis, asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmia and atopic eczema) were judged unrelated by independent physicians. A dose-concentration relationship appeared sufficiently predictable for both intra-arterial and intravenous administration. In line with existing knowledge, bilirubin pharmacokinetics could be described best according to a two-compartment model with a volume of distribution of 9.9 (\u00b12.0) l and a total plasma clearance of 36 (\u00b116) ml per minute.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSupported by previous reports, our data suggest that it is both feasible and safe to perform translational experiments with parenteral albumin bound bilirubin.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIslet transplantation is a promising option for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, the current lack of practical techniques for the isolated islets preservation still hampers the advancement of life-saving islet transplantation. Islet suffers from internal or external stimuli induced oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation during preservation, which leads to disappointing outcomes regarding islet yield, survival and function. ROS overproduction is the primary cause of oxidative stress that induces islet loss and dysfunction. Thus, in this paper, we hypothesized that an endogenous antioxidant, bilirubin, that could efficiently scavenge ROS and inhibit inflammatory reactions could be beneficial for islet preservation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHerein, we studied the effect of bilirubin on the hypothermic preserved (4\u00b0C) islets, and evaluate the islets viability, insulin secretory function, oxidative stress levels, and in vivo transplantation performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBilirubin could prevent cellular damages during short-term preservation, and maintain the co-cultured islets viability and function. The protective role of bilirubin is associated with its antioxidative ability, which dramatically increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH-Px), and decreased the levels of ROS and MDA. Diabetic mice transplanted with bilirubin preserved islets were normoglycemic for 28 days, even overmatched the diabetic mouse transplanted with fresh islets. Mice receiving bilirubin co-cultured islets required the least time to achieve normoglycemia among all groups and exhibited minimum inflammatory responses during the early transplantation stage.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy utilizing bilirubin, we achieved highly viable and functional islets after hypothermic preservation to reverse diabetes in mice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Acute pancreatitis is a sudden inflammation and only last for a short time, but might lead to a life-threatening emergency. Traditional drug therapy is an essential supportive method for acute pancreatitis treatment, yet, failed to achieve satisfactory therapeutic outcomes. To date, it is still challenging to develop therapeutic medicine to redress the intricate microenvironment promptly in the inflamed pancreas, and more importantly, avoid multi-organ failure. The understanding of the acute pancreatitis, including the causes, mechanism, and severity judgment, could help the scientists bring up more effective intervention and treatment strategies. New formulation approaches have been investigated to precisely deliver therapeutics to inflammatory lesions in the pancreas, and some even could directly attenuate the pancreatic damages. In this review, we will briefly introduce the involved pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of acute pancreatitis, as well as the traditional Chinese medicine and the new drug option. Most of all, we will summarize the drug delivery strategies to reduce inflammation and potentially prevent the further development of pancreatitis, with an emphasis on the bifunctional nanoparticles that act as both drug delivery carriers and therapeutics.",

        "title": "Heparin Protects Severe Acute Pancreatitis by Inhibiting HMGB-1 Active Secretion from Macrophages",
        "abstract": "Heparin has shown benefits in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) therapy, but the underlying mechanisms were unknown. Extracellular high-mobility group protein-1 (HMGB-1) has been regarded as a central mediator contributing to inflammation exacerbation and disease aggravation. We hypothesized heparin attenuated the disease by targeting HMGB-1-related pathways. In the present study, the possible therapeutic roles of heparin and its non-anticoagulant derivatives, 6-O-desulfulted heparin and N-acylated-heparin, were determined on mouse models induced by \u201cTwo-Hit\u201d of L-arginine. The compounds exhibited potent efficiency by substantially decreasing the pancreatic necrosis, macrophage infiltration, and serum inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) concentration. Moreover, they greatly reduced the rapidly increasing extracellular HMGB-1 levels in the L-arginine injured pancreases. As a result, multiple organ failure and mortality of the mice were inhibited. Furthermore, the drugs were incubated with the RAW264.7 cells activated with damaged pancreatic tissue of SAP mice in vitro. They were found to inhibit HMGB-1 transfer from the nucleus to the plasma, a critical step during HMGB-1 active secretion from macrophages. The results were carefully re-examined with a caerulein and LPS induced mouse model, and similar results were found. The paper demonstrated heparin alleviated SAP independent of the anti-coagulant functions. Therefore, non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives might become promising approaches to treat patients suffering from SAP.",
