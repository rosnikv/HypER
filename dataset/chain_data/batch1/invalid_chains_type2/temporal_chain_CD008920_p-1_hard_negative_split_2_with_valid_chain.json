        "abstract": "Forty-seven patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated in a 32 week, double blind, crossover trial of amitriptyline, desipramine, trazodone, and placebo. All drug regimens produced significant changes on pain measures relative to baseline, but only amitriptyline exceeded placebo. Amitriptyline was associated with a significant reduction in the number of painful/tender joints. Our study supports the efficacy of a moderate dose of amitriptyline as an adjunct drug for the treatment of pain in both depressed and nondepressed patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling techniques to examine potential interrelationships among psychological factors, immunologic activation, and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The subjects were 80 male patients with a diagnosis of classic or definite RA. Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Arthritis Helplessness Index, and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) pain score. Joint counts and immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes also were collected. Path analysis showed that percentage of HLA-DR+ cells in the peripheral blood and helplessness were related to join count. In addition, joint count had an effect upon depression. Depression had an effect upon pain, but there was no reciprocal effect of pain upon depression. This study describes a preliminary path model of interrelationships among psychological factors, immunologic activation, and disease activity in RA.",

        "abstract": "Depression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects many, but by no means all, persons with the disease. There is evidence that depression bears a significant relationship to pain in RA, although the causal direction is not entirely clear. Likewise, there is strong evidence that depression is a major contributor to the RA disability. Therefore, prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive treatment of depression are needed to minimize the disability associated with RA.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy of an adjunctive cognitive-behavioral treatment compared with rheumatological treatment alone in unselected rheumatoid arthritis outpatients.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA prospective randomized control design was used. Change in medication during treatment was controlled by matching therapy- and control-group subjects according to this change in medication, sex, age, duration of disease, and functional class.\n\n\nSETTING\nA rheumatological outpatient clinic, University of Goettingen, Germany.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nFifty-five consecutive outpatients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (age 52.7 years, 74.5% female, duration of disease 9.4 years) finished the study.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nSubjects received routine care by the rheumatologists and routine medical treatment. Cognitive-behavioral treatment subjects (n = 19) received adjunctive standardized cognitive-behavioral group treatment with 12 weekly sessions.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nOutcome measures included disease activity variables, pain variables (pain intensity, affective pain), psychological symptoms, and coping.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects mostly demonstrated an increasing disease activity during treatment; change in medication during treatment was necessary in some patients. In the cognitive-behavioral treatment group the course of rheumatoid arthritis seemed less progressive than in the control group. The core effects of cognitive-behavioral treatment pertain more to improved coping, emotional stabilization, and reduced impairment than to reduced pain intensity. Passive, emotion-focused coping, helplessness, depression, anxiety, affective pain, and fluctuation of pain are reduced, \"Acceptance of Illness\" is improved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCognitive-behavioral therapy has proven an effective adjunct to standard treatment of rheumatoid arthritis outpatients. These effects were shown in an unselected sample with increasing disease activity and with comparable changes in medication during treatment. We recommend cognitive-behavioral treatment as an desirable adjunct to standard medical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the relation between pessimistic explanatory style and cardiac health among a sample of cardiovascular disease patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Data were collected from 72 patients at the beginning and end of their cardiac rehabilitation programs. Participants completed questionnaires assessing explanatory style, depressive symptoms, and subjective appraisals of cardiac health. Objective indicators of cardiovascular health were collected from participants' medical files. Results showed that the stable dimension of pessimistic explanatory style had a direct and negative effect on self-reported cardiac health appraisals over the course of cardiac rehabilitation. Although there was support for partial mediation cross-sectionally, findings did not support prospective mediation by depressive symptoms for the relation between pessimistic explanatory style and cardiac health appraisals.",

The present study examines other psychosocial factors, such as dispositional personality and social relationships, in order to investigate their influence on the well-being of 160 older adults with OA (80% women). Method: Older adults were recruited for self-reported knee or hip OA. Participants completed self-report measures of optimism and pessimism, social support, social strain, and life satisfaction using the computer program MediaLab. Measures were taken twice 9\u201312 months apart. Results: Results showed that, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, pessimism was related to lower social support and higher social strain. In addition, pessimism was mediated by social support in its relationship to life satisfaction. Discussion: Our models support the combined roles of pessimism and social support influencing life satisfaction over time. Future interventions may want to concentrate on improving the social relationships of people with OA to enhance psychological well-being.",

The true incidents of non-cancer related chronic oedema / lymphoedema is not certain and is generally thought to be underestimated. The impact of this condition on a person's life is multifaceted and is an individual experience for each patient which should not be underestimated. Social support for patients with chronic oedemas can be viewed as the emotional or tangible assistance that one receives or can expect from others in times of need and is theorized to buffer against illness providing the person with coping strategies. Such support can help reduce psychological distress such as depression and anxiety and helps promote psychological adjustment to this chronic condition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background and objective: Vulvar edema is a condition rarely reported and without defined treatment that may result in functional limitation. The aim of the report is to describe a case series of patients with disabling vulvar edema of different etiologies that were treated with manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) and multilayer compression therapy (MCT). Case series: Four cases of vulvar edema are described: one in a woman with cervical cancer; one in a woman in the postoperative period of bilateral adrenalectomy for pheocromocytoma; and two in pregnant women with preeclampsia. All cases were treated with MLD and MCT during hospitalization. Outcomes: Total resolution of the edema occurred in 2 to 5 d of treatment. Conclusion: The present case series is the first to report the use of the MLD and MCT in the successful management of female genital edema. This report suggests that the vulvar edemas for these four patients treated with MLD and MCT seem to resolve faster than expected based on previously reported untreated edemas or edemas treated with different therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by degeneration of the myelin sheath of an axon resulting in decreased transmission of nerve impulses. It is an autoimmune disease with periods of exacerbation and remission. Types of MS include relapsing-remitting, acute progressive, chronic progressive attack-remitting, and benign. Symptoms vary from patient to patient. Common symptoms include fatigue, spasticity, swelling, and altered gait. MS is commonly treated with medications that help relieve symptoms and prolong disease progression. Massage Therapy (MT), specifically Swedish techniques, have been effective in treating MS. Objective: To examine the effects of MT on mobility, fatigue, and edema in a patient with MS. Methods: An MT student from MacEwan University\u2019s 2,200-hour Massage Therapy program administered five MT treatments over a six-week period to a 58-year-old female diagnosed with MS 11 years earlier. She presented with symptoms of decreased mobility, fatigue, and left ankle edema. Assessment included active and passive range of motion (ROM), myotomes, dermatomes, reflexes, and orthopedic tests. Goals for the treatment sessions were to increase mobility, decrease fatigue, and decrease edema. Assessment measures included the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test for mobility, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) to measure fatigue, and Figure-8 ankle measurement to measure edema. Techniques used included Swedish massage, passive ROM, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), and home-care exercises. Results: Little change was noted in mobility. The patient\u2019s fatigue level and left ankle edema decreased. Conclusion: The results suggest that MT is effective in reducing fatigue and edema in a patient with MS. Future studies are needed to evaluate the correlation between mobility and massage.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The previous studies showed that fatigue is a very common symptom in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and has the greatest effect on their activities of daily living. Benson relaxation technique (BRT) is one of the most relaxation techniques used to decrease fatigue, improve emotional status and quality of life in patients with several chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of BRT on fatigue level of patients diagnosed with MS in Jordan.Methods: This is a quasi-experimental repeated measure study. It involved six neurological clinics in the Ministry of Health and five neurological clinics at private hospitals. In this study, 95 patients returned the completed questionnaire and attended BRT.Results: The mean age of the patients was 33 years. Females accounted for 60% of the patients and almost half of the patients were single. All patients reported having a university degree and three-quarters of the patients were employed. Almost, two-thirds of the patients reported having not more than 1 time of relapse in the past 2 years. The majority of them reported <3 years from the confirmed diagnosis. Findings showed a statistical significant reduction in the overall level of fatigue including physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fatigue of patients with MS after BRT (p < 0.001).Conclusions: Results suggested that this technique is a very effective strategy for reducing fatigue in patients with MS. Therefore, in addition to prescribing medication, it is recommended that this method be applied in the care of patients diagnosed with MS.",

        "abstract": "Psychological and physical problems often occur in hemodialysis patients such as anxiety, sleep quality and fatigue which if not treated immediately, can reduce the patient's quality of life. Benson relaxation and deep breathing can lower anxiety, sleep quality, and fatigue in hemodialysis patients. With decreased anxiety, higher sleep quality and decreased fatigue, the patient's quality of life could be enhanced. This study aims to determine the differences in anxiety, sleep quality and fatigue in hemodialysis patients treated using the Benson relaxation technique and deep breathing. The research method used quasi-experimental on several 52 respondents who were selected through the simple random sampling technique and were divided into 2 intervention and control groups. The Kruskal-walis test showed that the p-value = 0.000 <0.05 was obtained in anxiety. The difference rank value is higher in the Benson relaxation of 37.96. on sleep quality, p-value = 0.000 <0.05. The rank difference is higher in the Benson relaxation of 34.56. At the same time, the data management results on fatigue obtained a p-value = 0.014 <0.05. The difference in Rank value is higher in the Benson relaxation of 34.56. It can be concluded that Benson's relaxation therapy can reduce anxiety, sleep quality, and fatigue because it uses spiritual values that can improve the quality of life of hemodialysis patients.",
