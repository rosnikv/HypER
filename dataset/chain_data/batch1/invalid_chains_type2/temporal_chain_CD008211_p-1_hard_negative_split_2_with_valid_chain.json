        "title": "Technical Considerations and Patient Comfort in Total Colonoscopy with and without a Transparent Cap: Initial Experiences from a Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS\nEven though colonoscopy was introduced 30 years ago, endoscopists still leave a small percentage of the colonic mucosal surface unexamined because of the limitations of the procedure, so there is still room for technical improvements. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of attaching a transparent cap to the tip of the colonoscope, partly to gather basic data and experience for planning a larger randomized study, and partly to evaluate any technical advantages or disadvantages, and also to appraise the patients' experiences.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn 50 consecutive patients examined by a single experienced endoscopist, a prospective pilot study was carried out comparing the use of a colonoscope fitted with a transparent cap (in half of the colonoscopies) with the use of an ordinary colonoscope without a cap (in the remaining 25 patients). The following parameters were recorded: indication for colonoscopy, time to reach the cecum, total time for the colonoscopy, findings, diagnosis, type of colonoscopy (diagnostic or therapeutic, partial or total, ileal intubation), the amount of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy, and complications. At the end of the examination and also before leaving the hospital, the patients were asked by a nurse to estimate pain experienced during the colonoscopy, using a visual analogue scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time for the procedure, the ability to perform a complete colonoscopy (including ileal intubation when it was medically relevant), and the complication rate turned out to be similar in both groups. There were no differences between the amounts of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy or between the patients' estimations of the pain experienced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe time to reach the cecum and the total time for the colonoscopy is the same with or without the cap, which is well tolerated by patients. Using the cap greatly facilitates the possibility of finding small polyps behind folds in the colon, because the folds can be straightened, thereby improving the view, although in this small pilot study it could not be proven that the number of polyps found was greater using a cap-fitted colonoscope.",

        "title": "Detection of Intestinal Metaplasia in Barrett's Esophagus",
        "abstract": "TO THE EDITOR: The article by Sawhney et al. compares the prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasm in nonanemic patients and anemic patients with a variety of ferritin levels (1). While the use of odds ratios in Table 3 is correctly interpreted in the text, the likelihood ratios in Table 4 are not clearly discussed in the text. Guyatt et al. define an odds ratio as \u201ca ratio of the odds of an event in an exposed group to the odds of the same event in a group that is not exposed\u201d (2). Using the data from Table 3, Sawhney et al. correctly state patients with ferritin <50 ng/mL and ferritin 51\u2013100 ng/mL are almost 5 times more likely to have advanced colonic neoplasia than those patients with ferritin >100 ng/mL or nonanemic controls. A likelihood ratio is defined by Guyatt et al. as the relative likelihood that a given test would be expected in a patient with as opposed to one without a disorder of interest (2). Fletcher and Wagner state likelihood ratios reflect the probability of that test result in people with the disease divided by the probability of the result in people without disease (3). Therefore, using the likelihood ratios in Table 4, the authors should have clarified in the text that a ferritin >100 ng/mL is 0.27 times as likely to occur in a patient with colonic neoplasm compared to a patient without colonic neoplasm. If a statement defining likelihood ratios was included, readers could more readily interpret the results. The likelihood ratio and the odds ratio could then be expressed to a patient in terms that the patient could understand and weigh the risks and benefits.",

        "title": "Influence of age and sex on endoscopic findings of gastrooesophageal reflux disease: an endoscopy database study",
        "abstract": "Background Barrett's oesophagus (BO) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma are more common with increasing age and among men. Symptoms of gastrooesophageal reflux disease are equally common in both sexes and at all ages. We hypothesized that reduced postmenopausal female sex hormone levels may remove protection from acid reflux injury, leading to increased oesophagitis and its complications in older women. Aim To examine the incidence of gastrooesophageal reflux disease and its complications in men and women in a large endoscopy database. Methods Anonymized data were extracted from endoscopy databases covering an 11-year period. Patients with an endoscopic diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis (RO), BO, hiatus hernia and benign oesophageal stricture and total number and indications for endoscopies were identified. Results Out of 154 406 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, 24 240 (15.7%) patients had RO {13 148 male, 11 092 female, mean age 59 [standard deviation (SD) 17] years}. The incidence of RO increased with age {odds ratio 1.029 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.026\u20131.032], P<0.001} but this increase was more marked in women with increasing age [1.01 (1.01\u20131.02), P<0.001] compared with men. Increasing age was associated with an increased incidence of benign oesophageal stricture [1.02 (1.017\u20131.023)] and BO [1.02 (1.019\u20131.021)]. Although the increase in benign oesophageal stricture was more marked in women [1.024 (1.02\u20131.028) P<0.001] than in men, this was not the case in BO. Conclusion RO and its complications, BO and benign oesophageal stricture increase with age. RO, BO and stricture are more common in absolute and relative terms among younger men than younger women. RO and stricture increase more rapidly in women than men so that the prevalence in elderly patients is similar in both sexes.",

        "title": "Is hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women associated with a reduced risk of oesophageal cancer?",
        "abstract": "Purpose The rise in oesophageal adenocarcinoma incidence in women with age is delayed compared with men until the post-menopausal period. A matched cohort study was therefore undertaken of post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to examine the association between HRT, oesophageal cancer and the potentially associated conditions, reflux oesophagitis and Barrett\u2019s oesophagus. Methods Women aged over 50 years within the UK General Practice Research Database with a history of HRT exposure were matched by age and general practice with controls without HRT exposure (1:1). Matched Cox-regression analysis was performed to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. Results 51,851 HRT users and controls were studied. Prolonged HRT use for 5\u201310 years (hazard ratio 0.25 (95% CI 0.07\u20130.95)) and time-dependent covariates for increasing duration of HRT use (0.06 (0.01\u20130.43)) were associated with a reduced oesophageal cancer risk. HRT use was associated with reflux oesophagitis (1.27 (1.12\u20131.43)), but when analysis was confined to women with codes for both reflux oesophagitis and endoscopy there was no association (1.1 (0.81\u20131.44)), suggesting increased reporting of reflux symptoms among HRT users rather than an association with endoscopic reflux oesophagitis. Conclusion Long-term post-menopausal HRT may be associated with a reduced risk of oesophageal cancer.",

        "title": "Sex and Gender Differences in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease",
        "abstract": "It is important to understand sex and gender-related differences in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) because gender-related biologic factors might lead to better prevention and therapy. Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) affects more women than men. GERD symptoms are more frequent in patients with NERD than in those with reflux esophagitis. However, men suffer pathologic diseases such as reflux esophagitis, Barrett\u2019s esophagus (BE), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) more frequently than women. The prevalence of reflux esophagitis is significantly increased with age in women, especially after their 50s. The mean age of EAC incidence in women is higher than in men, suggesting a role of estrogen in delaying the onset of BE and EAC. In a chronic rat reflux esophagitis model, nitric oxide was found to be an aggravating factor of esophageal injury in a male-predominant way. In addition, the expression of esophageal occludin, a tight junction protein that plays an important role in the esophageal defense mechanism, was up-regulated in women. This explains the male predominance of reflux esophagitis and delayed incidence of BE or EAC in women. Moreover, the symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and extra-esophageal symptoms have been more frequently reported by women than by men, suggesting that sex and gender play a role in symptom perception. Differential sensitivity with augmented symptoms in women might have diagnostic and therapeutic influence. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that hormone replacement therapy has a protective effect against esophageal cancer. However, an anti-inflammatory role of estrogen remains compelling, which means further study is necessary in this area.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims Male predominance has been observed in the erosive reflux disease (ERD), but reverse finding in nonerosive reflux disease (NERD). This suggests sex-specific medicine approach is needed but its mechanism is remained to be elucidated. We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and mRNA expression levels of tight junction-related proteins between male and female gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Methods Sixteen healthy controls, 45 ERD, and 14 NERD patients received upper endoscopies and completed questionnaires. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions of occludin (OCLN), zonal occludens (ZO) 1, claudin-1 (CLDN1) and claudin-4 (CLDN4), and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) were performed in the distal esophageal mucosal specimen. These results were analyzed by sex. Results Female GERD patients were affected more by reflux symptoms than males. The impairment of overall quality of life was more prominent in female patients with reflux symptoms than male patients (5.6\u00b10.2 vs 4.9\u00b10.6, p=0.009). The levels of OCLN mRNA expression were significantly lower in the male ERD group. On the other hand, those of CLDN1, CLDN4, and NK1R except ZO-1 were significantly higher in the male ERD group. Conclusions We demonstrated that female ERD/NERD patients were affected more by GERD and male ERD patients showed significant changes of tight junction protein mRNA expression levels.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims Emerging evidence shows that the mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with neurotrophic factors and tight junction proteins (TJPs). It is known that there are sex differences in the pathophysiology of IBS. The aim of the present study is to determine expression levels of neurotrophic factors, TJPs, and cytokines according to IBS subtype and sex. Methods From 59 IBS (33 IBS-constipation, 21 IBS-diarrhea, and 5 IBS-mixed) and 36 control patients, colonic mucosa mRNA expression levels of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and various TJPs were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was performed to determine levels of zonular occludens-1 (ZO-1). Serum levels of cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results TRPV1, GDNF, and NGF mRNA levels were significantly increased in those with IBS-constipation compared to those in controls (all P < 0.05). However, they showed no significant difference between those with IBS-diarrhea and controls. Expression level of TRPV1 correlated with that of GDNF (r = 0.741, P < 0.001) and NGF (r = 0.935, P < 0.001). ZO-1 RNA expression levels were lower (P = 0.021) in female IBS-diarrhea than those in controls, although they showed no significant differences between male IBS-diarrhea and controls. Serum IL-1\u03b2 levels in female IBS were significantly higher than those of male IBS, especially in IBS-constipation (P < 0.001). Conclusion Our results suggest that neurotrophic factors and IL-1\u03b2 are closely related to IBS-constipation and that decrease of ZO-1 is an important factor in female with IBS-diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aim: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder. Sensory, motor and barrier dysfunctions are the key physiological endophenotypes of IBS. Our aim is to review studies evaluating barrier dysfunction in adults and children with IBS, as well as to link those changes with IBS symptomatology and quality of life. Methods: A comprehensive and systematic review of multiple databases was performed up to March 2020 to identify studies comparing intestinal permeability in IBS patients with healthy controls. Both in vivo and in vitro studies were considered. Results: We identified 66 studies, of which 27 used intestinal probes to quantify barrier function. The prevalence of barrier dysfunction differed between PI-IBS (17\u201350%), IBS-D (37\u201362%) and IBS-C (4\u201325%). At a group level, permeability was increased compared with healthy controls in IBS-D (9/13 studies) and PI-IBS (4/4 studies), but only a minority of IBS-C (2/7 studies) and not in the only IBS-M study. All four studies in children with IBS demonstrated loss of barrier function. A heterogeneous set of tight junction genes were found to be altered in small and large intestines of adults with IBS, but these have not been evaluated in children. Positive associations were identified between barrier dysfunction and bowel disturbances (6/9 studies), abdominal pain (9/13 studies), overall symptom severity (1/6 studies), depression and anxiety (1/1 study) and quality of life (1/4 studies). Fecal slurry or supernatants of IBS patients were found to induce barrier disruption in animal models (5/6 studies). Conclusions: Barrier dysfunction is present in a significant proportion of adult and all pediatric IBS studies, especially in the IBS-D and PI-IBS subtype. The majority of studies indicated a positive association between loss of barrier function and symptoms such as abdominal pain and changes in the bowel function.",

However, irisin has demonstrated beneficial effects on myocardial I/R injury, thus increasing interest in exploring its mechanism.

Irisin was found to reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells and fracture in myocardial tissue, myocardial enzyme levels, and the myocardial infarction (MI) area. In addition, the data showed that irisin reverses I/R-induced gut dysbiosis as indicated by the decreased abundance of Actinobacteriota and the increased abundance of Firmicutes, and maintains intestinal barrier integrity, reduces metabolic endotoxemia, and inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).
