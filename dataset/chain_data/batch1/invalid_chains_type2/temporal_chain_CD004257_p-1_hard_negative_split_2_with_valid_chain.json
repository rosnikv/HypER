        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose.",

        "abstract": "1. Whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) usage in the elderly elevates blood pressure or antagonises the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive medication is presently unknown. The primary aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of NSAID usage, to evaluate the prescription of NSAIDs for arthritis and to determine whether NSAID usage was an independent predictor of hypertension in a large elderly community. 2. All non-institutionalised elderly (> 60 years) residents of Dubbo, NSW who attended for a baseline assessment were enrolled (1237 males, 1568 females). A questionnaire was administered and blood pressure was measured according to the Prineas protocol. The frequency of NSAID usage was determined, with stratification by age, sex, blood pressure group and history of arthritis. 3. NSAID usage was 26% overall (females 28%, males 23%), increased with age and was higher in females than males for every age group studied. Amongst patients with a past history of 'arthritis', 45% were using NSAIDs. Twelve percent were taking NSAIDs and antihypertensive medication concurrently, constituting the population at risk of an adverse drug-drug interaction. Employing a multiple logistic regression model which adjusted for several confounders in the cross-sectional analysis, NSAID usage significantly predicted the presence of hypertension (odds ratio: 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-1.7) with an attributable risk of 29%. 4. Amongst non-institutionalised elderly persons, NSAID usage may be an independent risk factor for hypertension. Considering the substantial consumption of NSAIDs by elderly patients, physicians should review their NSAID prescribing patterns for this community group.",

Persistence rates with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors were significantly higher than those seen with cholestyramine (64.3% vs 36.6% of days with drug available, respectively). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease had significantly higher rates of persistence with lipid-lowering regimens. In New Jersey, multivariable analysis indicated that the poorest patients (those enrolled in Medicaid) had lower rates of drug use than less indigent patients (those enrolled in Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled) after adjusting for possible confounders, despite virtually complete drug coverage in both programs. When rates of use were measured in the US population for the 5 years following the study year, only 52% of surviving patients who were initially prescribed lipid-lowering drugs were still filling prescriptions for this drug class.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn all populations studied, patients who were prescribed lipid-lowering drug regimens remained without filled prescriptions for over a third of the study year on average. Rates of persistence varied substantially with choice of agent prescribed, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status, despite universal coverage of prescription drug costs. After 5 years, about half of the surviving original cohort in the United States had stopped using lipid-lowering therapy altogether.",

This study characterizes and identifies predictors of the persistence of use of statins in a clinical cohort of subsidized new users of similar age to the WOSCOPS trial subjects.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMedical, pharmaceutical, and demographic records for the period January 1, 1987 through December 31, 1994 were extracted from the databases of Qu\u00e9bec's provincial health plan for a 10% random sample of social assistance recipients. Patients remained eligible for inclusion if they had received a first dispensation of a statin between January 1, 1987 and July 31, 1994. Persistence was defined as the number of days on treatment with a statin while continuing to renew dispensations within a defined time limit.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNew users of statins included 983 social assistance recipients who were observed for a total of 2,439,153 person-days. Median persistence on statin treatment was 173 (95% CI = 155, 204) days. Only 13% of patients persisted for 5 years of treatment. A higher index of chronic morbidity, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and previous use of nicotinic acid were predictive of longer persistence on statin medication. Those patients whose first statin dispensation was for lovastatin discontinued treatment earlier than those whose first dispensation was for pravastatin or simvastatin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNew users showed low persistence on statins in a cohort of socially assisted persons aged 45-64, in spite of the minimal financial cost of the drug for such beneficiaries of Qu\u00e9bec's provincial health plan.",

        "abstract": "Little is currently known of the effect of switching statin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes. Using The Health Improvement Network database, patients who had received atorvastatin for \u2265 six months were identified. They were classified as 'switch' if they were subsequently switched to simvastatin, and were matched to up to four 'control' patients who remained on atorvastatin. Time to death or first major cardiovascular event was compared, controlling for the matching co-variates, prior statin exposure and baseline cholesterol concentration. A total of 2,511 switch patients and 9,009 controls were identified. The risk of death or first major cardiovascular event was significantly associated with switching therapy (hazard ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.64) compared with patients who did not switch. Major cardiovascular events and stroke were also significantly associated with switching. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality. While recognising the observational nature of database research, this study has highlighted the potential for poorer cardiovascular outcomes in patients switching statin therapy, compared with patients maintained on their current treatment. This raises concerns for policies that encourage widespread statin switching without careful consideration of individual patient circumstances and cardiovascular risk, and highlights the need for formal trials to assess the consequences of switching statin treatment.",

Methods: In a retrospective cohort analysis among adult enrollees in over 90 US health plans, the authors identified adult patients who switched from a branded to generic statin from July\u2013December 2006 (simvastatin became generic in June 2006). Patients were classified by type of statin switch: GS (e.g., branded simvastatin\u2009\u2192\u2009generic simvastatin), and TS (e.g., branded atorvastatin\u2009\u2192\u2009generic simvastatin). Demographic and clinical data were collected from claims before switch through 6 months follow-up. Separate outcomes of interest included proportion of patients that switched to a less potent daily dose, that switched back to previous branded statin after switch, and that were at least 80% adherent during the 6 months after initial switch. Significant predictors of each clinical outcome were identified using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for differences between groups in covariates and potential confounders. Results: The 6-month TS (n\u2009=\u20093807) and GS (n\u2009=\u200940,165) groups were generally similar demographically. Compared to GS, TS patients were significantly more likely to be switched to a less potent dose (26.2% vs. 0.5%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] in patients with high-potency index medication\u2009=\u200983.4, p\u2009<\u20090.0001); 33% less likely to be adherent in the 6 months after switch (67.7% vs. 75.9%, AOR in patients with no switch in first 6 months follow-up = 0.67, p\u2009<\u20090.0001); and four times more likely to switch back to previous branded statin (11.3% vs. 2.9%, AOR = 4.1, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Limitations: This study did not account for co-payment changes, lipid measurements, or changes in pill burden. Conclusions: While this study did not have data on why patients had TS (e.g., for cost or clinical reasons), TS was more likely to involve a subsequent disruption to statin therapy than GS. TS could potentially lead to adverse impacts on patients\u2019 outcomes, and should be studied further.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: As clinical trials have shown the benefits of more intensive cholesterol control, treatment targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have decreased progressively. At the same time, physicians have been encouraged to contain costs by prescribing cheaper, generic statins for cholesterol management. To determine how these possibly conflicting goals are managed in clinical practice, we examined LDL-C control in patients switched from a potent, branded statin (atorvastatin) to a less potent, generic statin (simvastatin). Methods: Patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin between July 2006 and January 2008 were retrospectively identified from a US medical and pharmacy claims database, and matched with controls remaining on atorvastatin. Outcomes measured were the number of switched patients receiving a simvastatin milligram dose \u2265 2 times their previous atorvastatin dose, changes in LDL-C levels, and percentage of patients achieving recommended LDL-C targets. All study variables were analyzed descriptively. Results: After applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, 1048 patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin and 1048 matched controls who remained on atorvastatin were included. Among the switchers, 379 (36%) received an inappropriately low dose of simvastatin (< 2 times atorvastatin dose). In patients remaining on atorvastatin, mean LDL-C decreased from 105.7 mg/dL to 102.3 mg/dL after 44 weeks, whereas in switched patients, LDL-C remained similar, at 105.9 mg/dL on atorvastatin and 105.8 mg/dL on simvastatin. Before switching, when all patients were receiving atorvastatin, 67.4% of switchers and 69.9% of controls achieved recommended LDL-C targets. After switching, significantly fewer switchers than controls met LDL-C targets (69.1% vs 74.6%; P = 0.005). However, among patients who switched to an equivalent dose of simvastatin (\u2265 2 times prior atorvastatin dose), similar proportions met LDL-C targets (72.8% vs 74.6% of controls; P = 0.402), whereas among patients who switched to inappropriate non-equivalent dose of simvastatin, a significantly lower proportion met LDL-C targets (62.5% vs 74.6% of controls; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Continuing atorvastatin was associated with lower LDL-C levels and better LDL-C target attainment compared with switching to simvastatin. Patients switched to an equivalent simvastatin dose had lower LDL-C levels and were more likely to achieve LDL-C targets than patients switched to a non-equivalent dose, suggesting physicians must consider dosage equivalence when switching statins, and should measure LDL-C and titrate statins as necessary to achieve LDL-C control.",

We assessed the relationship between cardiovascular (CV) risk and atorvastatin adherence in primary- and secondary-prevention patients, adjusting for healthy-adherer bias by incorporating preventive service use into the model. Medical and pharmacy claims from employee-based plans from 2002 to 2008 were analyzed for patients who initiated atorvastatin in 2003\u20132004. Adherent patients were defined as having \u226560% of days covered in the year after atorvastatin initiation and were required to have pill coverage in months 10\u201312. CV events were identified as hospitalizations with a primary CV diagnosis and assessed from month 13 after atorvastatin initiation until the end of follow-up (\u226436 months). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between atorvastatin adherence and CV event risk, adjusting for covariates including preventive service use. The study included 94,287 atorvastatin users (79,010 primary- and 15,277 secondary-prevention patients). In both populations, nearly one-half of the patients discontinued atorvastatin after 1 year.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Statins are efficacious in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events for both primary and secondary prevention, yet long-term adherence is poor. Their effectiveness could be compromised in actual practice when patients are not adherent to the treatments. Higher copayments have been shown to be associated with lower adherence to statins. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect on patient adherence of moving branded atorvastatin and rosuvastatin from the second to the first tier by a Medicare Part D plan sponsor. METHODS: Pharmacy claims and eligibility records between July 1, 2009, and July 31, 2011, of Medicare Part D members not receiving the low-income subsidy were analyzed. New atorvastatin and rosuvastatin users in January 2010 (2010 cohort) were compared with those in January 2011 (2011 cohort) after this formulary tier change (tier-reduction group). Adherence was defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) over 6 months. The impact of tier reduction on adherence was evaluated via logistic regression for binary outcome (PDC\u22650.8) and generalized linear regression for continuous PDC by comparing the 2011 cohort with the 2010 cohort, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Other statin users (97% on generic statins) were also analyzed, serving as a nontier-reduction comparator group. RESULTS: We identified 12,437 members in the tier-reduction group. Between the 2010 and 2011 cohorts, mean PDC increased from 0.77 to 0.83, and the proportion of members with high adherence increased from 62.0% to 72.9% (both P\u2009 less than \u20090.001). After regression adjustment, members in the 2011 cohort were more likely to be adherent (OR=1.68; 95% CI=1.55-1.82) and had a 5.9% increase in PDC (P\u2009 less than \u20090.05). There was no significant increase in adherence observed in the comparator nontier-reduction group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that financial incentives may improve medication adherence. Future studies should evaluate whether such formulary strategies improve long-term adherence and patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nSuboptimal adherence to medications taken chronically for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g., aspirin) continues to burden the healthcare system despite the well-established benefits of prevention. We conducted a literature search to examine patient adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD-as evaluated by prescription refill data, electronic medication monitors, pill counts, and physiologic markers-to better identify an unmet need for measures to improve patient adherence to these therapies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEnglish-language articles were obtained from the PubMed database using the following key words or combinations thereof \"adherence,\" \"compliance,\" \"secondary prevention,\" and \"cardiovascular disease.\" Publications that provided adherence data only for primary prevention, lacked data on medication adherence (e.g., focus on guideline adherence), emphasized quality-of-care outcomes, or focused on outcomes of acute interventions were excluded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultiple patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors may contribute to poor adherence to treatment regimens, and therefore, a multifactorial approach will likely be needed to improve compliance with prescribed treatments for CVD. Although no magic bullet exists to assure full adherence, adherence programs coupled with patient counseling and education (inclusive of over-the-counter therapies), along with treatments that are less complex or avoid bothersome adverse effects, are more likely to be associated with successful outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven the burden of CVD to the community and the healthcare system, nonadherence to CVD-preventative medications such as aspirin remains a substantial area of unmet need and represents a key opportunity for the development of quality-of-care enhancement programs to improve health outcomes in this patient population.",

        "title": "Access and adherence to medications for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Singapore: a qualitative study",
        "abstract": "Background Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a growing public health threat globally, and many individuals remain undiagnosed, untreated, and their condition remains uncontrolled. The key to effective ASCVD management is adherence to pharmacotherapy, and non-adherence has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and complications such as stroke, further impacting a patient\u2019s ability to be adherent. Our qualitative study aimed to explore factors influencing medication adherence in the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD in Singapore. We propose a synthesized framework, which expands on current understandings of the factors of medication adherence, as a frame of analysis in this study. Methods We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 patients over the age of 40 with ASCVD and/or its risk factors in Singapore. QSR Nvivo 11 was used to conduct thematic analysis using an inductive approach. Results Using a synthesized framework, we reported that complex medication regimens, the lack of support received during regimen changes, and the perceived seriousness of a condition could impact a patient\u2019s medication adherence. Key findings suggest that the relationship between health care professionals and patients impacted patient acceptability of the medication regimen and consequently medication adherence. Different patient beliefs regarding diagnosis, medication, and adherence had some bearing on the ability to perceive the need to adhere to their medication. Patients also reported that they could afford medication, sometimes with the help of family members. Patients also largely reported not needing help managing their medication, considering it an individual responsibility. Conclusion We identified key factors which future interventions looking to improve medication adherence ought to consider. These include changing patient perceptions of health systems, diagnosis, medication, and adherence; patient-centeredness in developing interventions that facilitate adherence through building self-efficacy and stronger support networks via patient empowerment and engagement; decreasing patient co-payments on medication; and cultivating a trusting patient\u2013provider relationship.",
