        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo identify the optimal treatment for extrahepatic bile duct stones using endoscopy, laparoscopy, and the combination of the two in different conditions and to develop phasic treatment protocols for their minimally invasive treatment.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOf 2718 cases of extrahepatic bile duct stones collected from June 2005 to December 2011, 50 were randomly selected to receive open bile duct exploration and T-tube drainage, serving as the control group. For the rest, a one-scope protocol, two-scope protocol (two-scope protocol A or two-scope protocol B), or three-scope protocol was adopted according to the specific conditions of stones and the endoscopic treatment results. The treatment outcomes and postoperative clinical indicators of the minimally invasive treatment protocols were analyzed and compared with those of the control group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 2668 cases of extrahepatic bile duct stones receiving the phasic minimally invasive treatment, the treatment success rate was 97.79%, and there were no severe postoperative complications. Compared with the control group, the minimally invasive treatment protocols had higher success rates, less trauma, and significantly shortened hospital stays.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe protocols were applied step by step based on the different types and levels of extrahepatic bile duct stones, fully embodying the advantages of the combined minimally invasive treatment of endoscopy and laparoscopy, thus expanding the scope of minimally invasive surgical treatment for extrahepatic bile duct stones and improving treatment success rate.",

        "title": "Comparison of the clinical effects of dual-modality endoscopy and traditional laparotomy for the treatment of intra- and extrahepatic bile duct stones",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Bile duct stones (BDSs) may cause patients to develop liver cirrhosis or even liver cancer. Currently, the success rate of surgical treatment for intrahepatic and extrahepatic BDSs is not satisfactory, and there is a risk of postoperative complications. AIM To compare the clinical effects of dual-modality endoscopy (duodenoscopy and laparoscopy) with those of traditional laparotomy in the treatment of intra- and extrahepatic BDSs. METHODS Ninety-five patients with intra- and extrahepatic BDSs who sought medical services at Wuhan No.1 Hospital between August 2019 and May 2023 were selected; 45 patients in the control group were treated by traditional laparotomy, and 50 patients in the research group were treated by dual-modality endoscopy. The following factors were collected for analysis: curative effects, safety (incision infection, biliary fistula, lung infection, hemobilia), surgical factors [surgery time, intraoperative blood loss (IBL) volume, gastrointestinal function recovery time, and length of hospital stay], serum inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8], and oxidative stress [glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and advanced protein oxidation products (AOPPs)]. RESULTS The analysis revealed markedly better efficacy (an obviously higher total effective rate) in the research group than in the control group. In addition, an evidently lower postoperative complication rate, shorter surgical duration, gastrointestinal function recovery time and hospital stay, and lower IBL volume were observed in the research group. Furthermore, the posttreatment serum inflammatory marker (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8) levels were significantly lower in the research group than in the control group. Compared with those in the control group, the posttreatment GSH-Px, SOD, MDA and AOPPs in the research group were equivalent to the pretreatment levels; for example, the GSH-Px and SOD levels were significantly higher, while the MDA and AOPP levels were lower. CONCLUSION Dual-modality endoscopy therapy (duodenoscopy and laparoscopy) is more effective than traditional laparotomy in the treatment of intra- and extrahepatic BDSs and has a lower risk of postoperative complications; significantly shortened surgical time; shorter gastrointestinal function recovery time; shorter hospital stay; and lower intraoperative bleeding volume, while having a significant inhibitory effect on excessive serum inflammation and causing little postoperative oxidative stress.",
