        "title": "Long-term safety of tofacitinib up to 9.5 years: a comprehensive integrated analysis of the rheumatoid arthritis clinical development programme",
        "abstract": "Objective Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We report the largest integrated safety analysis of tofacitinib, as of March 2017, using data from phase I, II, III, IIIb/IV and long-term extension studies in adult patients with RA. Methods Data were pooled for patients with RA who received \u22651 tofacitinib dose. Incidence rates (IRs; patients with events/100 patient-years [PY]; 95% CIs) of first-time occurrences were obtained for adverse events (AEs) of interest. Results 7061 patients received tofacitinib (total exposure: 22 875 PY; median [range] exposure: 3.1 [0 to 9.6] years). IRs (95% CI) for serious AEs, serious infections, herpes zoster (all), opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis [TB]) and TB were 9.0 (8.6 to 9.4), 2.5 (2.3 to 2.7), 3.6 (3.4 to 3.9), 0.4 (0.3 to 0.5) and 0.2 (0.1 to 0.2), respectively. IRs (95% CI) for malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]), NMSC and lymphomas were 0.8 (0.7 to 0.9), 0.6 (0.5 to 0.7) and 0.1 (0.0 to 0.1), respectively. IRs (95% CI) for gastrointestinal perforations, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism and major adverse cardiovascular events were 0.1 (0.1 to 0.2), 0.2 (0.1 to 0.2), 0.1 (0.1 to 0.2), 0.3 (0.2 to 0.3), 0.4 (0.3 to 0.5) and 0.4 (0.3 to 0.5), respectively. IR (95% CI) for mortality was 0.3 (0.2 to 0.3). IRs generally remained consistent across 6-month intervals to >78 months. Conclusion This represents the largest clinical dataset for a JAK inhibitor in RA to date. IRs remained consistent with previous reports from the tofacitinib RA clinical development programme, and stable over time.

        "abstract": "Objective To report long-term safety from the completed extension trial of baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase inhibitor, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Treatment-emergent adverse events are summarised from an integrated database (9 phase III/II/Ib and 1 long-term extension) of patients who received any baricitinib dose (All-bari-RA). Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) were estimated. Additional analysis was done in a subset of patients who had ever taken 2\u2009mg or 4\u2009mg baricitinib. Results 3770 patients received baricitinib (14\u2009744 patient-years of exposure (PYE)). All-bari-RA incidence rates (IRs) per 100 patient-years at risk were 2.6, 3.0 and 0.5 for serious infections, herpes zoster and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), respectively. In patients aged \u226550 with \u22651 cardiovascular risk factor, the IR for MACE was 0.77 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.04). The IR for malignancy (excluding NMSC) during the first 48 weeks was 0.6 and remained stable thereafter (IR 1.0). The SIR for malignancies excluding NMSC was 1.07 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.26) and the SMR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.92). All-bari-RA IRs for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), DVT and PE were 0.5 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.61), 0.4 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.45) and 0.3 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.35), respectively. No clear dose differences were noted for exposure-adjusted IRs (per 100 PYE) for deaths, serious infections, DVT/PE and MACE. Conclusions In this integrated analysis including long-term data of baricitinib from 3770 patients (median 4.6 years, up to 9.3 years) with active RA, baricitinib maintained a similar safety profile to earlier analyses. No new safety signals were identified. Trial registration number NCT01185353, NCT00902486, NCT01469013, NCT01710358, NCT02265705, NCT01721044, NCT01721057, NCT01711359 and NCT01885078.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To estimate the association of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) with the incidence of malignancy, compared with placebo, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors (TNFi) and methotrexate. Methods Systematic searches of databases were performed, to December 2022, to identify phase II/III/IV randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and long-term extension (LTE) studies of JAKi (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib, peficitinib) compared with placebo, TNFi or methotrexate, in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, axial spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or atopic dermatitis. Network and pairwise meta-analyses were performed to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for malignancy between JAKi and comparators. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool. Results In 62 eligible RCTs and 16 LTE studies, there were 82\u2009366 person-years of exposure to JAKi, 2924 to placebo, 7909 to TNFi and 1074 to methotrexate. The overall malignancy incidence rate was 1.15 per 100 person-years in RCTs, and 1.26 per 100 person-years across combined RCT and LTE data. In network meta-analyses, the incidence of all malignancies including non-melanomatous skin cancers (NMSCs) was not significantly different between JAKi and placebo (IRR 0.71; 95%\u2009CI 0.44 to 1.15) or between JAKi and methotrexate (IRR 0.77; 95%\u2009CI 0.35 to 1.68). Compared with TNFi, however, JAKi were associated with an increased incidence of malignancy (IRR 1.50; 95%\u2009CI 1.16 to 1.94). Findings were consistent when analysing NMSC only and when analysing combined RCT/LTE data. Conclusions JAKi were associated with a higher incidence of malignancy compared with TNFi but not placebo or methotrexate. Cancers were rare events in all comparisons.

        "title": "JAK inhibitors in systemic lupus erythematosus: Translating pathogenesis into therapy.",
        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-organ autoimmune disease marked by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear structures, formation of immune complexes, and chronic inflammation triggered by their tissular deposition. SLE is characterized by alternating periods of relapse and remission and each flare has the potential to cause new organ damage related to either the disease process or the medication toxicity. Despite remarkable progress across its multiple domains, SLE is still an area with many unmet needs, calling for innovative and practical solutions. The efforts of the drug development programme in lupus have led to considerable growth in the last decade, owing to the approval of belimumab, anifrolumab, and voclosporin. The increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease has enabled the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. New discoveries in the intricate cytokine kaleidoscope of lupus have made the concept of targeted therapy an attractive and promising research focus. JAK inhibitors are oral targeted therapies approved for a wide variety of diseases across the Rheumatology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology, and Haematology fields. Multiple JAKis are currently being investigated in SLE. This paper aims to summarize existing data coming from both clinical trials and case reports regarding the use of JAK inhibitors in SLE.",
