        "abstract": "Objective To define the cardiovascular effects of lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease. Design Collaborative prospective meta-analysis of randomised trials. Data sources and eligibility Participating randomised trials of drugs to lower blood pressure compared with placebo or each other or that compare different blood pressure targets, with at least 1000 patient years of follow-up per arm. Main outcome measures Major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) in composite and individually and all cause death. Participants 26 trials (152\u2009290 participants), including 30\u2009295 individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Data extraction Individual participant data were available for 23 trials, with summary data from another three. Meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated with a random effects model. Results Compared with placebo, blood pressure lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced eGFR (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P=1.00 for homogeneity). The results were similar irrespective of whether blood pressure was reduced by regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics/\u03b2 blockers. There was no evidence that the effects of different drug classes on major cardiovascular events varied between patients with different eGFR (all P>0.60 for homogeneity). Conclusions Blood pressure lowering is an effective strategy for preventing cardiovascular events among people with moderately reduced eGFR. There is little evidence from these overviews to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease.",

        "title": "Practical Clinical Trials in Psychopharmacology: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Abstract Practical clinical trials (PCTs) are randomized experiments under typical practice conditions with the aim of testing the \u201creal-life\u201d benefits and risks of therapeutic interventions. Influential PCTs have been conducted in cardiology, oncology, and internal medicine. Psychotropic medications are widely and increasingly used in medical practice. This review examines recent progress in conducting PCTs in psychopharmacology. The January 2000 to October 2014 MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications of PCTs with at least 100 subjects per treatment arm. Most PCTs in psychiatry evaluated mental health services or psychosocial interventions rather than specific pharmacotherapies. Of 157 PCTs in psychiatry, 30 (19%) were in psychopharmacology, with a median of 2 publications per year and no increase during the period of observation. Sample size ranged from 200 to 18,154; only 11 studies randomized 500 patients or more. Psychopharmacology PCTs were equally likely to be funded by industry as by public agencies. There were 10 PCTs of antidepressants, for a total of 4206 patients (in comparison with at least 46 PCTs of antihypertensive medications, for a total of 208,014 patients). Some psychopharmacology PCTs used suicidal behavior, treatment discontinuation, or mortality as primary outcome and produced effectiveness and safety data that have influenced both practice guidelines and regulatory decisions. Practical clinical trials can constitute an important source of information for clinicians, patients, regulators, and policy makers but have been relatively underused in psychopharmacology. Electronic medical records and integrated practice research networks offer promising platforms for a more efficient conduct of PCTs.",

        "title": "Twenty years of progress in paediatric psychopharmacology: accomplishments and unmet needs",
        "abstract": "The systematic assessment of the efficacy and safety of psychiatric medications in children and adolescents started about 20 years ago. Since then, a considerable number of randomised clinical trials have been conducted, including also a series of publicly funded comparative effectiveness studies to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of medications relative to psychosocial interventions, alone or combined with medications. On the whole, these studies have been informative of the paediatric pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of the most commonly used psychotropics. As a consequence, a number of meta-analyses have been conducted that have documented both the benefits and harms of the most common medication groups, such as stimulants, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Evidence-based practice guidelines have been produced, and clinicians can now better estimate the therapeutic value and the risk of treatment, at least at the group mean level. However, most clinical trials have been conducted in research settings, and this limits the generalisability of the results. There is a need for evaluating treatment effects under usual practice conditions, through practical trials. The ongoing debate about the proper role of pharmacotherapy in child mental health can be advanced by comparative effectiveness research to assess the benefit/risk ratio of pharmacotherapy vis-\u00e0-vis alternative treatment modalities. In addition, analyses of large population databases can better inform on the impact of early treatment on important distal outcomes, such as interpersonal functioning, social and occupational status, quality of life and risk for disability or mortality. Thus far, paediatric psychopharmacology has been mostly the application to children of medications that were serendipitously discovered and developed for adults. By focusing on the neurobiological mechanisms of child psychopathology, it may be possible to identify more precise pharmacological targets and arrive at a truly developmental psychopharmacology.",

        "title": "Antidepressants in Children and Adolescents: Meta-Review of Efficacy, Tolerability and Suicidality in Acute Treatment",
        "abstract": "Antidepressants are prescribed for the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, however there is still controversy about whether they should be used in this population. This meta-review aimed to assess the effects of antidepressants for the acute treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders (ADs), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), enuresis, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. Efficacy was measured as response to treatment (either as mean overall change in symptoms or as a dichotomous outcome) and tolerability was measured as the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. Suicidality was measured as suicidal ideation, behavior (including suicide attempts) and completed suicide. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched (until 31 October 2019) for existing systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of double-blind randomized controlled trials. The quality of the included reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Our meta-review included nine systematic reviews/meta-analyses (2 on ADHD; 1 on AD; 2 on ASD; 1 on enuresis; 1 on MDD, 1 on OCD and 1 on PTSD). In terms of efficacy this review found that, compared to placebo: fluoxetine was more efficacious in the treatment of MDD, fluvoxamine and paroxetine were better in the treatment of AD; fluoxetine and sertraline were more efficacious in the treatment of OCD; bupropion and desipramine improved clinician and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms; clomipramine and tianeptine were superior on some of the core symptoms of ASD; and no antidepressant was more efficacious for PTSD and enuresis. With regard to tolerability: imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine were less well tolerated in MDD; no differences were found for any of the antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety disorders (ADs), ADHD, and PTSD; tianeptine and citalopram, but not clomipramine, were less well tolerated in children and adolescents with ASD. For suicidal behavior/ideation, venlafaxine (in MDD) and paroxetine (in AD) were associated with a significantly increased risk; by contrast, sertraline (in AD) was associated with a reduced risk. The majority of included systematic reviews/meta-analyses were rated as being of high or moderate in quality by the AMSTAR-2 critical appraisal tool (one and five, respectively). One included study was of low quality and two were of critically low quality. Compared to placebo, selected antidepressants can be efficacious in the acute treatment of some common psychiatric disorders, although statistically significant differences do not always translate into clinically significant results. Little information was available about tolerability of antidepressants in RCTs of OCD and in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and PTSD. There is a paucity of data on suicidal ideation/behavior, but paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidality in the treatment of AD and venlafaxine for MDD. Findings from this review must be considered in light of potential limitations, such as the lack of comparative information about many antidepressants, the short-term outcomes and the quality of the available evidence.",

        "title": "Important adverse events to be evaluated in antidepressant trials and meta-analyses in depression: a large international preference study including patients and healthcare professionals",
        "abstract": "Background Non-serious adverse events (NSAEs) should be captured and reported because they can have a significant negative impact on patients and treatment adherence. However, the reporting of NSAEs in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is limited. Objective To identify the most important NSAEs of antidepressants for patients and clinicians, to be evaluated in RCTs and meta-analyses. Methods We conducted online international surveys in English, German and French, including (1) adults prescribed an antidepressant for a depressive episode and (2) healthcare professionals (HCPs) prescribing antidepressants. Participants ranked the 30 most frequent NSAEs reported in the scientific literature. We fitted logit models for sets of ranked items and calculated for each AE the probability to be ranked higher than the least important AE. We also identified additional patient-important AEs not included in the ranking task via open-ended questions. Findings We included 1631 patients from 44 different countries (1290 (79.1%) women, mean age 39.4 (SD 13), 289 (37.1%) with severe depression (PHQ-9 score \u226520)) and 281 HCPs (224 (79.7%) psychiatrists). The most important NSAEs for patients were insomnia (95.9%, 95% CI 95.2% to 96.5%), anxiety (95.2%, 95% CI 94.3% to 95.9%) and fatigue (94.6%, 95% CI 93.6% to 95.4%). The most important NSAEs for HCPs were sexual dysfunction (99.2%, 95% CI 98.5% to 99.6%), weight gain (98.9%, 95% CI 97.7% to 99.4%) and erectile problems (98.8%, 95% CI 97.7% to 99.4%). Participants reported 66 additional NSAEs, including emotional numbing (8.6%), trouble with concentration (7.6%) and irritability (6%). Conclusions These most important NSAEs should be systematically reported in antidepressant trials. Clinical implications The most important NSAEs should contribute to the core outcome set for harms in depression.",

        "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants, significantly impacting patients\u2019 quality of life and treatment adherence. This study investigates the relationship between sexual dysfunction and antidepressants by analyzing data from VigiBase\u2122, the World Health Organization\u2019s global database of individual case safety reports. In this study, we examined, for the first time, reports related to sexual response\u2014desire, arousal, and orgasm\u2014by grouping appropriate side effect terms and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) for various antidepressants. The findings of this study highlight a high disproportional reporting of sexual dysfunction, particularly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. In contrast, agents such as agomelatine, bupropion, and mirtazapine showed a lower association. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between reporting odds ratios and the binding affinities of antidepressants to specific neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, unveiling significant relationships that provide insights into the pharmacodynamic pathways underlying these adverse effects. For instance, a positive correlation was observed between the serotonin transporter and side effects in the category desire: r (19) = 0.67, p = 0.001 These insights underscore the necessity for clinicians to consider sexual side effects when prescribing antidepressants and to monitor and address these issues to improve patient outcomes.",
