        "abstract": "The use of alternative medicine was assessed by questionnaire in 96 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, 143 patients with organic upper gastrointestinal disorders and 222 patients with Crohn's disease of comparable age and sex. Significantly more patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (16%) had consulted practitioners of alternative medicine about their condition than had patients in either of the other groups. Similarly, significantly more irritable bowel syndrome patients said they would consult an alternative medicine practitioner (41%) if conventional treatment failed. Current usage of alternative medicine remedies was significantly greater in the irritable bowel syndrome patients (11%) than in patients with Crohn's disease (4%) and tended to be greater than in patients with organic upper gastrointestinal disorders (6%). This study has shown that the use of alternative medicine is common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and this does not appear to be explicable in terms of the nature, chronicity or refractoriness to treatment of symptoms.",

        "abstract": "We carried out a study to determine the proportion of patients attending a university-based gastroenterology outpatient clinic who sought alternative medical care for the same health problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. After the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire, the gastroenterologist gave a diagnosis and assigned a functional rating. Of the 395 patients 287 (73%) had not used alternative medicine, and 36 (9%) had sought alternative medical care for the problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. There were no significant differences between alternative medicine users and nonusers in sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services or general health status. Patients with a functional disease were more likely to seek alternative medical care than those with organic disease (33% v. 7%) (p less than 0.0001). Fewer alternative medicine users (54%) than nonusers (85%) were satisfied with conventional medicine (p less than 0.001), and more alternative medicine users (49%) than nonusers (13%) were very sceptical of conventional medicine (p less than 0.0001).",

        "abstract": "In the past 20 years, dramatic changes have occurred in the movement toward global economies and free/liberalized markets. Various trade agreements have been increasing international trade, challenging \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices and pushing to \u201charmonize\u201d and coordinate regulations, taxation, policies and other public and private enterprises. Could these trade agreements affect alcohol and injury control policies? Furthermore, could trade agreements ultimately affect injury trends? Unfortunately research studies and data on this topic are scarce. This paper presents information on the principles underlying international trade agreements and indicates how these principles could potentially affect the sales, regulations and taxation of alcohol and impact on injuries. The call is for researchers to conduct the research needed to address these questions and potential impacts.",

        "title": "The GATS: Impacts of the international \u201cservices\u201d treaty on health-based alcohol regulation",
        "abstract": "There is an underlying incompatibility between public health-focused alcohol regulation and the World Trade Organization's \u201cservices\u201d treaty. This treaty, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), is very broad, extending beyond border measures to reach into many areas formerly considered purely matters of legitimate domestic regulation. Essentially unknown to the public, the GATS is currently being re-negotiated to broaden the number and types of services it covers and to place greater restrictions on the scope of governments' regulatory ability. All services, including services relating directly and indirectly to alcohol, are on the negotiating table. These negotiations can be expected to affect most adversely those alcohol policies that are considered to be the most effective in protecting public health. The European Commission and the United States are strong advocates for expanding the GATS and formally propose that countries liberalize their distribution systems, including systems for distributing alcohol. If adopted, this proposal would preclude many health-based policy options in developing countries and is likely to place increased pressure on alcohol policy in Europe, when other countries request reciprocal commitments from the EC. The paper examines threats that the treaty and its proposed expansion pose for alcohol monopolies, advertising restrictions, governments' control over availability and access to alcohol, international health-based alcohol initiatives, and alcohol policy in developing countries. Alcohol researchers and public health advocates are encouraged to play a more proactive role in international treaties to achieve more balanced results, rather than acceding to ratchet-like constraints that make the adoption of an ever-greater number of public policy options increasingly difficult.",

        "abstract": "Why injury prevention is essentially political\n\nWhen advocating for prevention strategies, public health professionals need to recognize who the stakeholders are and the conflicting values they bring to negotiations. In politics, deals are struck and decisions are made, dependent upon the relative power and valued \u201cgoods\u201d held by divergent interested parties. In the politics of safety, it is the responsibility of injury prevention advocates to further the interests of public health and safety as powerfully as possible.\n\nThis has never been an easy task and new, widely unrecognized challenges may now make it even harder. The movement towards globalization and unfettered free trade has extreme relevance to the international politics of safety, and for national, regional, and local jurisdictions as well.\n\nGlobalization and trade issues may seem far afield from the day to day concerns of the injury prevention community. But colleagues in other fields, like environmental protection, have been active in trying to influence decision making. Injury prevention cannot remain uninvolved.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dr William Haddon proposed that we apply fundamental principles of disease prevention to injury control\u2014host, agent, and environment, as factors amenable to modification, and thus prevention. Efforts to modify host factors through behavior modification are usually politically safe because they place responsibility on the individual to change, not on the corporations that manufacture these products.\n\nEfforts to change agents or vectors, most often consumer products, however, involve decisions about design, manufacture, and sale. These are based on a variety of concerns that sometimes include safety. Debates about how to balance these factors are often contentious, pitting consumer advocates against antiregulatory and proindustry forces. These debates are usually associated with the regulatory and/or legislative process.\n\nTraditionally, establishing health and safety regulations has been the prerogative of national and sometimes regional governments acting on behalf of their \u2026",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study describes the support of parents and other community members for child pedestrian safety measures, their willingness to pay in terms of volunteer time and money for efforts to make child pedestrian safety improvements in their neighborhood, and their views on how to affect child pedestrian safety improvements in their communities. In partnership with four city public elementary schools, data were collected through focus groups of parents and other caregivers and through a written survey distributed to parents and caregivers. The findings reveal that parents and caregivers are aware of a full range of prevention measures for the child pedestrian injury problem but are especially supportive of speed bumps, safety education for parents, and better traffic enforcement. Parents and caregivers are uncertain about what kind of strategies would work well to get changes made in their communities to protect child pedestrians. They also reveal that they are willing to get involved in trying to get changes made. Parents and other community members can be willing and effective partners in injury prevention, but they can benefit from receiving more information about the value of environmental prevention measures and from skill-building in injury prevention advocacy.",

We surveyed 732 parents from four elementary schools in urban neighborhoods that differed in income, and child pedestrian injury risks. Findings indicated that most parents taught their children street safety. Few (16%) knew basic pedestrian safety facts; 46% believed children younger than 10 years could safely cross streets alone; 50% believed a child pedestrian crash was likely. Parents in lower income neighborhoods reported the highest rates of unpleasant walking environments and concerns about drug dealers, crime, violence, and trash. We conclude that education should focus on children\u2019s risk, developmental capabilities, and supervision needs. Promoting physical activity in urban neighborhoods, especially lower income ones, must address concerns about the physical and social environment.",

On the pretend road, younger children, boys, and children with less behavioral control engaged in riskier pedestrian behaviors. Children with less behavioral control responded more noticeably to increases in parental supervision.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults are discussed in relation to children's development and injury prevention.",

        "abstract": "Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for children and adolescents between the ages of 1 and 18 in the United States, accounting for more deaths than the next 20 causes of mortality combined. It is estimated that pediatric injury accounts for more than $50 billion in annual losses from medical care costs, future wages, and quality of life. Despite these numbers, much remains to be learned about the behavioral risks for pediatric unintentional injury. This article reviews behavioral risk factors for pediatric unintentional injury risk, with a particular focus on four broad areas. First, we discuss the effects of demographic risk factors, including gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Second, we present information about child-specific risk factors, including temperament, personality, psychopathology, and cognitive development. Third, we discuss the influence of parents and other primary caregivers on childhood injury risk, with a particular focus on the effects of supervision and parenting quality and style. Finally, we discuss the role of peers on child injury risk. We conclude with a discussion of the ways in which the material reviewed has been translated into injury prevention techniques, with a focus on how pediatricians might use knowledge about etiological risk to prioritize safety counseling topics. We also present thoughts on four priorities for future research: injury risk in diverse nations and cultures; developmental effects of injury; the influence of multiple risk factors together on injury risk; and translation of knowledge about risk for injury into intervention and prevention techniques.",

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in September and October, 2006. Age-specific and sex-specific injury rates were calculated. Results: 3019 students were interviewed in six schools. Of these, 1182 were identified as \u201cleft-behind\u201d; 62.3% had both parents away from home, and 37.7% had one parent away from home. The annual injury rate per 1000 among left-behind children was more than twice that of children living with both parents: 252.9 (95% CI 233.0 to 273.0) and 119.8 (95% CI 105 to 134), respectively. Male left-behind children had the highest annual injury rate: 316.4 (95% CI 295 to 338) per 1000. The three leading external causes of injury were similar for both groups of children: falls (33.8%); mechanical injuries (16.2%); and animal bites (14.5%).The location where injuries occurred were home (32.0%), school (26.0%) and roadways (23.9%) for left-behind children. There were no significant associations between the identified guardian and injury mechanism. Conclusions: A large proportion of students in the schools of rural Macheng are left-behind children. Left-behind children have a higher injury rate than those in the care of both parents. This may be important in the development of injury prevention strategies in rural communities in China.",
