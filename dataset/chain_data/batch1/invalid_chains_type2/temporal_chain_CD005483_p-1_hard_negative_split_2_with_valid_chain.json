        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nPrevious studies of testosterone supplementation in HIV-infected men failed to demonstrate improvement in muscle strength. The effects of resistance exercise combined with testosterone supplementation in HIV-infected men are unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of testosterone replacement with and without resistance exercise on muscle strength and body composition in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels and weight loss.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nPlacebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from September 1995 to July 1998 at a general clinical research center.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nSixty-one HIV-infected men aged 18 to 50 years with serum testosterone levels of less than 12.1 nmol/L (349 ng/dL) and weight loss of 5% or more in the previous 6 months, 49 of whom completed the study.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: placebo, no exercise (n = 14); testosterone enanthate (100 mg/wk intramuscularly), no exercise (n = 17); placebo and exercise (n = 15); or testosterone and exercise (n = 15). Treatment duration was 16 weeks.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nChanges in muscle strength, body weight, thigh muscle volume, and lean body mass compared among the 4 treatment groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBody weight increased significantly by 2.6 kg (P<.001) in men receiving testosterone alone and by 2.2 kg (P = .02) in men who exercised alone but did not change in men receiving placebo alone (-0.5 kg; P = .55) or testosterone and exercise (0.7 kg; P = .08). Men treated with testosterone alone, exercise alone, or both experienced significant increases in maximum voluntary muscle strength in leg press (range, 22%-30%), leg curls (range, 18%-36%), bench press (range, 19%-33%), and latissimus pulls (range, 17%-33%). Gains in strength in all exercise categories were greater in men assigned to the testosterone-exercise group or to the exercise-alone group than in those assigned to the placebo-alone group. There was a greater increase in thigh muscle volume in men receiving testosterone alone (mean change, 40 cm3; P<.001 vs zero change) or exercise alone (62 cm3; P = .003) than in men receiving placebo alone (5 cm3; P = .70). Average lean body mass increased by 2.3 kg (P = .004) and 2.6 kg (P<.001), respectively, in men who received testosterone alone or testosterone and exercise but did not change in men receiving placebo alone (0.9 kg; P = .21). Hemoglobin levels increased in men receiving testosterone but not in those receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data suggest that testosterone and resistance exercise promote gains in body weight, muscle mass, muscle strength, and lean body mass in HIV-infected men with weight loss and low testosterone levels. Testosterone and exercise together did not produce greater gains than either intervention alone.",

        "abstract": "Forty years after the introduction of estrogens, the debate over the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women is still not entirely settled. In contrast, the issues of testosterone replacement in older men are just beginning to be addressed. There is agreement that total, free, and bioavailable testosterone (ie, not bound by sex hormone-binding globulin) levels decline progressively with advancing age (Harman and Tsitouras, 1980, 1982; Murono et al, 1982; Nieschlag et al, 1982; Zumoff et al, 1982; Bremner and Prinz, 1983; Davidson et al, 1983; Nankin and Calkins, 1986; Tenover et al, 1987; Gray et al, 1991; Vermeulen, 1991; Simon et al, 1992; Rudman and Shetty, 1994; Morley et al, 1997; Zmuda et al, 1997; Harmon et al, in press), and that many of the physiological changes that occur with advancing age such as loss of bone and muscle mass; increased fat mass; impairment of physical, sexual, and cognitive functions; loss of body hair; and decreased hemoglobin levels, are similar to those associated with androgen deficiency in young men. However, the beneficial effects of testosterone replacement on health-related outcomes in older men with low testosterone levels have yet to be demonstrated, and the risks of long-term testosterone administration, particularly the risks of prostate cancer and heart disease, remain unknown. Therefore, it is premature to make a general recommendation about testosterone supplementation in older men. Despite the paucity of efficacy and safety data, the sales of testosterone and other androgenic products have witnessed explosive growth recently",

        "abstract": "T is now well accepted that serum testosterone (T) levels decline progressively with aging in men (1\u20105). This decline is associated with alterations in body composition; diminished energy, muscle strength, and physical function; reduced sexual function; depressed mood; and decreased cognitive function. Similar changes occur in young men with androgen deficiency and are improved with T replacement therapy. However, the physiological and clinical significance of the aging-associated decline in serum T levels in men is unclear, particularly because T levels may remain within the normal range for young men. From a practical clinical standpoint, it is most appropriate to define \u201candropause\u201d as an age-related decline in serum T levels in older men to below the normal range in young men that is associated with a clinical syndrome (i.e., symptoms and signs) consistent with androgen deficiency. The decline in T levels is a consequence both of aging per se and age-associated comorbid illnesses and medications that are used to treat them",

        "abstract": "Aging in men is accompanied by a progressive, but individually variable decline of serum testosterone production, more than 20% of healthy men over 60 yr of age presenting with serum levels below the range for young men. Albeit the clinical picture of aging in men is reminiscent of that of hypogonadism in young men and decreased testosterone production appears to play a role in part of these clinical changes in at least some elderly men, the clinical relevancy of the age-related decline in sex steroid levels in men has not been unequivocally established. In fact, minimal androgen requirements for elderly men remain poorly defined and are likely to vary between individuals. Consequently, borderline androgen deficiency cannot be reliably diagnosed in the elderly, and strict differentiation between \"substitutive\" and \"pharmacological\" androgen administration is not possible. To date, only a few hundred elderly men have received androgen therapy in the setting of a randomized, controlled study, and many of these men were not androgen deficient. Most consistent effects of treatment have been on body composition, but to date there is no evidence-based documentation of clinical benefits of androgen administration to elderly men with normal or moderately low serum testosterone in terms of diminished morbidity or of improved survival or quality of life. Until the long-term risk-benefit ratio for androgen administration to elderly is established in adequately powered trials of longer duration, androgen administration to elderly men should be reserved for the minority of elderly men who have both clear clinical symptoms of hypogonadism and frankly low serum testosterone levels.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 The relation between endogenous testosterone concentrations and health in men is controversial. Methods and Results\u2014 We examined the prospective relationship between endogenous testosterone concentrations and mortality due to all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in a nested case-control study based on 11 606 men aged 40 to 79 years surveyed in 1993 to 1997 and followed up to 2003. Among those without prevalent cancer or cardiovascular disease, 825 men who subsequently died were compared with a control group of 1489 men still alive, matched for age and date of baseline visit. Endogenous testosterone concentrations at baseline were inversely related to mortality due to all causes (825 deaths), cardiovascular disease (369 deaths), and cancer (304 deaths). Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for mortality for increasing quartiles of endogenous testosterone compared with the lowest quartile were 0.75 (0.55 to 1.00), 0.62 (0.45 to 0.84), and 0.59 (0.42 to 0.85), respectively (P<0.001 for trend after adjustment for age, date of visit, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, blood cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, alcohol intake, physical activity, social class, education, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstanediol glucuronide, and sex hormone binding globulin). An increase of 6 nmol/L serum testosterone (\u22481 SD) was associated with a 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.92, P<0.01) multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for mortality. Inverse relationships were also observed for deaths due to cardiovascular causes and cancer and after the exclusion of deaths that occurred in the first 2 years. Conclusions\u2014 In men, endogenous testosterone concentrations are inversely related to mortality due to cardiovascular disease and all causes. Low testosterone may be a predictive marker for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease.",

However, it is unclear whether lower testosterone levels predict major cardiovascular events.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe examined whether lower serum testosterone was an independently significant risk factor for symptomatic cerebrovascular events in older men.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a prospective observational study with median follow-up of 3.5 yr.\n\n\nSETTING\nCommunity-dwelling, stroke-free older men were studied.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 3443 men at least 70 yr of age participated in the study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBaseline serum total testosterone, SHBG, and LH were assayed. Free testosterone was calculated using mass action equations. Incident stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA first stroke or TIA occurred in 119 men (3.5%). Total and free testosterone concentrations in the lowest quartiles (<11.7 nmol/liter and <222 pmol/liter) were associated with reduced event-free survival (P = 0.014 and P = 0.01, respectively). After adjustment including age, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and medical comorbidity, lower total testosterone predicted increased incidence of stroke or TIA (hazard ratio = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-2.99). Lower free testosterone was also associated (hazard ratio = 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.48), whereas SHBG and LH were not independently associated with incident stroke or TIA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn older men, lower total testosterone levels predict increased incidence of stroke or TIA after adjusting for conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Men with low-normal testosterone levels had increased risk. Further studies are warranted to determine whether interventions that raise circulating testosterone levels might prevent cerebrovascular disease in men.",

        "abstract": "Context The literature provides no clear answer as to whether low endogenous testosterone increases risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in healthy men. Objective Our purpose was to estimate the predictive value of testosterone for CVD and to identify study features explaining conflicting results. Data Sources Articles were identified by a Medline and Embase search and citation tracking. Study Selection Eligible were prospective population-based cohort and nested case-control studies of testosterone and atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, death from coronary heart disease or mortality. Data extraction Two independent researchers re-expressed associations of testosterone and CVD in a uniform manner to be used in meta-regression analyses for identification of study features explaining conflicting results, and to estimate the predictive value of testosterone for CVD. Results and Conclusions 19 potentially eligible articles were identified. Overall, a weak independent association was found with an estimated summary RR of 0.89 for a change of one standard deviation in total testosterone level (95% CI 0.83 to 0.96). Age of study population and year of publication modified the relationship between testosterone and CVD. The estimated summary RR was 1.01 (0.95 to 1.08) for studies of men younger than 70 years of age, and 0.84 (0.76 to 0.92) for studies including men over 70 years of age. The latter studies showed a particular pronounced association if published after 1 January 2007. Results were largely confirmed by separate analyses of free- and bioavailable testosterone. The systematic review displayed no association between endogenous testosterone and risk for CVD in middle-aged men. In elderly men, testosterone may weakly protect against CVD. Alternatively, low testosterone may indicate a poor general health.",

The search was restricted to data from January 1, 1969, up to January 1, 2011.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 1178 retrieved articles, 70 were included in the study. Among cross-sectional studies, patients with CVD have significantly lower testosterone and higher 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E(2)) levels. Conversely, no difference was observed for DHEAS. The association between low testosterone and high E(2) levels with CVD was confirmed in a logistic regression model, after adjusting for age and body mass index (hazard ratio (HR)=0.763 (0.744-0.783) and HR=1.015 (1.014-1.017), respectively, for each increment of total testosterone and E(2) levels; both P<0.0001). Longitudinal studies showed that baseline testosterone level was significantly lower among patients with incident overall- and CV-related mortality, in comparison with controls. Conversely, we did not observe any difference in the baseline testosterone and E(2) levels between case and controls for incident CVD. Finally, TRT was positively associated with a significant increase in treadmill test duration and time to 1\u200amm ST segment depression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLower testosterone and higher E(2) levels correlate with increased risk of CVD and CV mortality. TRT in hypogonadism moderates metabolic components associated with CV risk.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nLate-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is diagnosed when declining testosterone concentrations in the aging male cause unwanted symptoms such as erectile dysfunction (ED), reduced bone density and muscle strength, and increased visceral obesity. Testosterone deficiency is also associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Restoring testosterone to physiological concentrations has beneficial effects on many of these symptoms; however, it is not known whether these effects can be sustained in the long term.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo investigate whether treatment with testosterone undecanoate (TU) has a long-term and sustained effect on parameters affected by the MetS in men with LOH and ED, to determine whether long-term testosterone treatment can improve the overall health-related quality of life in these men, and to establish the safety of long-term testosterone treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred sixty-one patients (mean age 59.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4 years) diagnosed with LOH and ED were treated with long-acting TU in a prospective, observational, and longitudinal registry study. Men received intramuscular injections of 1,000\u2009mg TU at day 1, at week 6, and every 3 months thereafter.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nParameters affected by the MetS, including obesity parameters (body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index [BMI]), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, glucose, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), and blood pressure, as well as total testosterone levels and health-related quality of life, were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found TU significantly improved obesity parameters (body weight, waist circumference, and BMI) and lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c , and blood pressure over the 5-year study. HDL cholesterol was increased. TU treatment resulted in a sustained improvement in erectile function and muscle and joint pain, which contributed to an improvement in long-term health-related quality of life. Furthermore, we found a relationship between health-related quality of life and waist circumference. Finally, we found no evidence that long-term treatment with TU increases the risk of prostate carcinoma.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLong-term TU in men with LOH and ED reduces obesity parameters and improves metabolic syndrome and health-related quality of life.",

The aim of this study is to investigate effects of long-term testosterone therapy (TTh) with testosterone undecanoate in men with hypogonadism and ED. Patients and methods: Observational, prospective registry of 805 hypogonadal men with different degrees of ED, evaluated by the International Index of Erectile Function \u2013 Erectile Function Domain. Four hundred and twelve patients underwent TTh, 393 patients served as controls, with an observation period up to 12\u2009years. Results: TTh led to substantial and sustained reduction of ED; improvement in erectile function was significant for each successive year until year 9. This was accompanied by improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and urinary function throughout the 12-year follow-up period. Benefits of TTh were stronger for patients with moderate/severe ED than for patients with no/minor ED. Incidence of prostate cancer, major adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality were significantly lower in men on TTh compared with untreated men. Conclusion: Long-term TTh for up to 12\u2009years alleviates ED, improves cardiometabolic risk factors, and reduces prostate cancer. Patients must stay on TTh consistently for a long time to achieve maximum benefits of TTh.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with testosterone deficiency and is a symptom of functional hypogonadism. A correlation between ED and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been recognized, and ED has been proposed as an early marker of CVD. However, the relationship between ED and CVD risk in hypogonadism requires clarification and whether testosterone therapy (TTh) can be a beneficial treatment strategy, but long-term data are limited. This study investigates long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism and ED with a history of CVD. Methods Seventy-seven patients with a history of CVD and diagnosed with functional hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction (erectile function domain score <21 on the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire (IIEF questions 1\u20135)) were enrolled and TTh effects on anthropometric and metabolic parameters investigated for a maximum duration of 12 years. All men received long-acting injections of testosterone undecanoate at 3-monthly intervals. Eight-year data were analysed. Data collection registry started in November 2004 till January 2015. Results In hypogonadal men receiving TTh, IIEF increased by 5.4 (p<0.001). Total weight loss was 23.6 \u00b1 0.6 kg after 8 years. HbA1c had declined by an average of 2.0% (P<0.0001). Total cholesterol levels significantly declined following TTh after only 1 year (P<0.0001), and HDL increased from 1.6\u00b10.5 at baseline to 2\u00b10.5 mmol/L following 8 years of TTh (P<0.0001). SBP decreased from 164\u00b114 at baseline to 133\u00b19 mmHg, signifying a reduction of 33\u00b11 mmHg (P<0.0001). Conclusion In hypogonadal men with a history of CVD, TTh improves and preserves erectile function over prolonged periods with concurrent sustained improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors. Measuring ED and testosterone status may serve as an important male health indicator predicting subsequent CVD-related events and mortality and TTh may be an effective add-on treatment in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in hypogonadal men with a history of CVD.",

        "title": "LDR-adapted liver-derived cytokines have potential to induce atherosclerosis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease that causes cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The association between radiation and atherosclerosis has already been demonstrated; however, the effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure on atherosclerosis have not been reported. Our study aims to propose that LDR may cause atherosclerosis phenotypes by the upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and downregulation of androgen receptor (AR), which are cytokines secreted from the liver. Methods Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor deficient (Ldlr\u2212/\u2212) mice were irradiated at 50 mGy, 100 mGy, and 1000 mGy. LDR irradiated Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice serum was analyzed by cytokine array and proteomics with silver staining. Oil Red O staining and BODIPY staining were performed to determine lipid accumulation in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Foam cell formation and monocyte recruitment were assessed through co-culture system with HUVECs and THP-1 cells. Results After irradiation with LDR (100 mGy) the mice showed atherosclerotic phenotypes and through analysis results, we selected regulated cytokines, PAI-1 and AR, and found that these were changed in the liver. LDR-regulated cytokines have the potential to be transported to endothelial cells and induce lipid accumulation, inflammation of monocytes, increased oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and foam cells formation, that were series of phenotypes lead to plaque formation in endothelial cells and induces atherosclerosis. As a further aspect of this study, testosterone undecanoate (TU) was found to pharmacologically inhibit a series of atherosclerotic phenotypes exhibited by LDR. This study suggests a role for PAI-1 and AR in regulating the development of atherosclerosis after LDR exposure. Targeting PAI-1 and AR could serve as an attractive strategy for the management of atherosclerosis following LDR exposure.",

        "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose radiation on the abdominal aorta of mice and vascular endothelial cells. Methods Wild-type and tumor-bearing mice were exposed to 15 sessions of low-dose irradiation, resulting in cumulative radiation doses of 187.5, 375, and 750 mGy. The effect on the cardiovascular system was assessed. Immunohistochemistry analyzed protein expressions of PAPP-A, CD62, P65, and COX-2 in the abdominal aorta. Microarray technology, Gene Ontology analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis evaluated gene expression changes in endothelial cells exposed to 375 mGy X-ray. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. Immunofluorescence staining measured \u03b3-H2AX levels, and real-time polymerase chain reaction quantified mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), ICAM-1, and Cx43. Results Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed thickening of the inner membranes and irregular arrangement of smooth muscle cells in the media membrane at 375 and 750 mGy. Inflammation was observed in the inner membranes at 750 mGy, with a clear inflammatory response in the hearts of tumor-bearing mice. Immunohistochemistry indicated increased levels of PAPP-A, P65, and COX-2 post-irradiation. Microarray analysis showed 425 up-regulated and 235 down-regulated genes, associated with processes like endothelial cell-cell adhesion, IL-6, and NF-\u03baB signaling. Cell Counting Kit 8 assay results indicated inhibited viability at 750 mGy in EA.hy926 cells. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in \u03b3-H2AX foci. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR results showed increased expression of IL6, ICAM-1, and Cx43 in EA.hy926 cells post 750 mGy X-ray exposure. Conclusion Repeated low-dose ionizing radiation exposures triggered the development of pro-atherosclerotic phenotypes in mice and damage to vascular endothelial cells.",
