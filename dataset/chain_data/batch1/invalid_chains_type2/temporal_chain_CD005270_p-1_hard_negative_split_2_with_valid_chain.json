        "title": "Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus by changes in lifestyle among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nType 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.",

        "title": "The role of inflammation in diabetic kidney disease",
        "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has been the leading cause of chronic kidney disease for over 20 years. Yet, over these two decades, the clinical approach to this condition has not much improved beyond the administration of glucose-lowering agents, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers for blood pressure control, and lipid-lowering agents. The proportion of diabetic patients who develop DKD and progress to end-stage renal disease has remained nearly the same. This unmet need for DKD treatment is caused by the complex pathophysiology of DKD, and the difficulty of translating treatment from bench to bed, which further adds to the growing argument that DKD is not a homogeneous disease. To better capture the full spectrum of DKD in our design of treatment regimens, we need improved diagnostic tools that can better distinguish the subgroups within the condition. For instance, DKD is typically placed in the broad category of a non-inflammatory kidney disease. However, genome-wide transcriptome analysis studies consistently indicate the inflammatory signaling pathway activation in DKD. This review will utilize human data in discussing the potential for redefining the role of inflammation in DKD. We also comment on the therapeutic potential of targeted anti-inflammatory therapy for DKD.",

        "title": "Tubular injury in diabetic kidney disease: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic perspectives",
        "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a chronic complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Currently, there are limited therapeutic drugs available for DKD. While previous research has primarily focused on glomerular injury, recent studies have increasingly emphasized the role of renal tubular injury in the pathogenesis of DKD. Various factors, including hyperglycemia, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, RAAS, ER stress, inflammation, EMT and programmed cell death, have been shown to induce renal tubular injury and contribute to the progression of DKD. Additionally, traditional hypoglycemic drugs, anti-inflammation therapies, anti-senescence therapies, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and stem cell therapies have demonstrated their potential to alleviate renal tubular injury in DKD. This review will provide insights into the latest research on the mechanisms and treatments of renal tubular injury in DKD.",

        "title": "Molecular Targets of Novel Therapeutics for Diabetic Kidney Disease: A New Era of Nephroprotection",
        "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a chronic microvascular complication in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Although glomerulosclerosis, tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis are typical damages of DKD, the interplay of different processes (metabolic factors, oxidative stress, inflammatory pathway, fibrotic signaling, and hemodynamic mechanisms) appears to drive the onset and progression of DKD. A growing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms, and the development of new therapeutics, is opening the way for a new era of nephroprotection based on precision-medicine approaches. This review summarizes the therapeutic options linked to specific molecular mechanisms of DKD, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, SGLT2 inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, and aldosterone synthase inhibitors. In a new era of nephroprotection, these drugs, as pillars of personalized medicine, can improve renal outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals with DKD.",
