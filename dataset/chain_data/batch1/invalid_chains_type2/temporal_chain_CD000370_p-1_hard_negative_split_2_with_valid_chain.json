        "title": "Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with recombinant interferon alfa. A multicenter randomized, controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C (non-A, non-B hepatitis) is a common and often progressive viral liver disease. To assess the efficacy of therapy with the antiviral agent interferon alfa, we randomly assigned 166 patients with chronic hepatitis C to treatment with either 3 million or 1 million units of recombinant interferon alfa three times weekly for 24 weeks, or to no treatment. The probability of normalization or near normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase levels after six months of interferon therapy was 46 percent in patients treated with 3 million units of interferon (P less than 0.001) and 28 percent in those treated with 1 million units (P less than 0.02), but only 8 percent in untreated patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase level became completely normal in 22 of the 26 patients (85 percent) who responded to treatment with 3 million units of interferon and 9 of the 16 patients (56 percent) who responded to treatment with 1 million units. The patients who received 3 million units of interferon had histologic improvement because of the regression of lobular and periportal inflammation. Relapse within six months after the completion of treatment occurred in 51 percent of the patients treated with 3 million units of interferon and 44 percent of those treated with 1 million units. We conclude that a 24-week course of interferon therapy is effective in controlling disease activity in many patients with hepatitis C, although relapse after the cessation of treatment is common.",

We studied the efficacy of recombinant \u03b1\u2010interferon or \u03b3\u2010interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Ten patients received 7.5 MU \u03b1\u2010interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo. Ten patients were treated with \u03b3\u2010interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment.",

        "title": "Predictors of spontaneous viral clearance and outcomes of acute hepatitis C infection",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims This study evaluated the predictors of spontaneous viral clearance (SVC), as defined by two consecutive undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA tests performed \u226512 weeks apart, and the outcomes of acute hepatitis C (AHC) demonstrating SVC or treatment-induced viral clearance. Methods Thirty-two patients with AHC were followed for 12-16 weeks without administering antiviral therapy. Results HCV RNA was undetectable at least once in 14 of the 32 patients. SVC occurred in 12 patients (37.5%), among whom relapse occurred in 4. SVC was exhibited in 8 of the 11 patients exhibiting undetectable HCV RNA within 12 weeks. HCV RNA reappeared in three patients (including two patients with SVC) exhibiting undetectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks. SVC was more frequent in patients with low viremia than in those with high viremia (55.6% vs. 14.3%; P=0.02), and in patients with HCV genotype non-1b than in those with HCV genotype 1b (57.1% vs. 22.2%; P=0.04). SVC was more common in patients with a \u22652 log reduction of HCV RNA at 4 weeks than in those with a smaller reduction (90% vs. 9.1%, P<0.001). A sustained viral response was achieved in all patients (n=18) receiving antiviral therapy. Conclusions Baseline levels of HCV RNA and genotype non-1b were independent predictors for SVC. A \u22652 log reduction of HCV RNA at 4 weeks was a follow-up predictor for SVC. Undetectable HCV RNA occurring after 12 weeks was not sustained. All patients receiving antiviral therapy achieved a sustained viral response. Antiviral therapy should be initiated in patients with detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after the diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "There is scarce data pertaining to acute hepatitis C (aHC) infection in South America. We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and evolution of aHC in a South American cohort. A retrospective survey was conducted at 13 hepatology units. All patients \u226516 years old with aHC diagnosis were included. Demographic, clinical and outcome information were registered in a standardized ad hoc questionnaire. Sixty\u2010four patients were included. The majority were middle\u2010aged (median age: 46 years) and female (65.6%); most of them were symptomatic at diagnosis (79.6%). HCV\u20101 was the most prevalent genotype (69.2%). Five patients had liver failure: three cases of severe acute hepatitis, one case of fulminant hepatitis and one case of acute\u2010on\u2010chronic liver failure. Nosocomial exposure was the most prevalent risk factor. Evolution was assessed in 46 patients. In the untreated cohort, spontaneous resolution occurred in 45.8% and was associated with higher values of AST/ALT and with the absence of intermittent HCV RNA viremia (P\u2009=\u20090.01, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively). In the treated cohort, sustained virological response was associated with nosocomial transmission and early treatment initiation (P\u2009=\u20090.04 each). The prevalence of nosocomial transmission in this South\u2010American cohort of aHC stresses the importance of following universal precautions to prevent HCV infection. J. Med.
