        "title": "Group- vs home-based exercise training in healthy older men and women. A community-based clinical trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\n--To determine the effectiveness of group- vs home-based exercise training of higher and lower intensities among healthy, sedentary older adults.\n\n\nDESIGN\n--Year-long randomized, controlled trial comparing (1) higher-intensity group-based exercise training; (2) higher-intensity home-based exercise training; (3) lower-intensity home-based exercise training; or (4) assessment-only control.\n\n\nSETTING\n--General community located in northern California.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n--One hundred sixty women and 197 men 50 to 65 years of age who were sedentary and free of cardiovascular disease. One out of nine persons contacted through a community random-digit-dial telephone survey and citywide promotion were randomized.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\n--For higher-intensity exercise training, three 40-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 73% to 88% of peak treadmill heart rate. For lower-intensity exercise training, five 30-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 60% to 73% of peak treadmill heart rate.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\n--Treadmill exercise test performance, exercise participation rates, and heart disease risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\n--Compared with controls, subjects in all three exercise training conditions showed significant improvements in treadmill exercise test performance at 6 and 12 months (P less than .03). Lower-intensity exercise training achieved changes comparable with those of higher-intensity exercise training. Twelve-month exercise adherence rates were better for the two home-based exercise training conditions relative to the group-based exercise training condition (P less than .0005). There were no significant training-induced changes in lipid levels, weight, or blood pressure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n--We conclude that (1) this community-based exercise training program improved fitness but not heart disease risk factors among sedentary, healthy older adults; (2) home-based exercise was as effective as group exercise in producing these changes; (3) lower-intensity exercise training was as effective as higher-intensity exercise training in the home setting; and (4) the exercise programs were relatively safe.",

        "title": "Cardiorespiratory Responses to Exercise Training in Septuagenarian Women",
        "abstract": "Cardiorespiratory responses to a 12wk moderate exercise training program were examined in 30 sedentary elderly women (mean age = 73.6 +/- 0.7 yr). In addition, 12 highly conditioned (HC) older women (mean age = 72.5 +/- 1.8 yr; 11.2 +/- 1.2 yr training; 1.6 +/- 0.2 hr.d-1 aerobic activity) were tested at baseline for cross-sectional comparisons. The VO2max and VEmax of the HC subjects were 67% and 36% higher, respectively, (p < 0.001) than the combined sedentary subjects at baseline. Sedentary subjects were randomly assigned to a walking (WALK) or calisthenics control (CAL) group. The WALK group exercised 5 d.wk-1 for 30-40 min per session at 60.0 +/- 1.9% heart rate reserve while the CAL group engaged in mild musculoskeletal exercise. The WALK group demonstrated significant improvement in VO2max compared to CAL subjects at 12 wk (12.6% vs 2.2%, F = 5.74, p = 0.005). These data show that septuagenarian women demonstrate significant improvement in maximal cardiorespiratory fitness through moderate exercise training.",

        "title": "The effect of minimal exercise on fitness in elderly women after hip surgery.",
        "abstract": "To determine the effect of minimal exercise on functional fitness following total hip replacement in elderly women, 20 women (13 exercisers, 7 controls) who had undergone unilateral or bilateral hip replacement surgery for primary osteoarthritis were studied. An exercise treadmill test with respiratory gas and blood lactate analyses, and a field test of walking speed on a measured course, were administered before and after a twice weekly exercise programme of three months' duration. Markers of cardiorespiratory fitness, including peak achieved oxygen uptake (VO2) and ventilatory and lactate thresholds were measured. Maximum self-selected walking speed was also measured over a flat course. Peak VO2 increased in the exercise group when compared to baseline (P < 0.05) but did not differ from the control group. The exercise group significantly improved their walking speed by 10.1% compared with non-exercising controls (1.41 vs 1.20 m/sec, P < 0.05), and increased VO2 at lactate threshold. The improvements occurred despite the twice weekly exercise sessions being below the recommended frequency of exercise for improving cardiorespiratory fitness. Minimal exercise in elderly women after hip surgery can substantially improve submaximal exercise capacity, as well as walking speed.",
