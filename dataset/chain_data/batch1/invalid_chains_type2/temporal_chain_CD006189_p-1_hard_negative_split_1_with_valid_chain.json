        "title": "Short course prednisolone for adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder or stiff painful shoulder): a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether a short course of prednisolone is superior to placebo for improving pain, function, and range of motion in adhesive capsulitis. Design: Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. Setting: Community based rheumatology practice in Australia. Participants: 50 participants (24 active, 26 placebo); 46 completed the 12 week protocol. Entry criteria were age \u2a7e18 years, pain and stiffness in predominantly one shoulder for \u2a7e3 weeks, and restriction of passive motion by >30\u00b0 in two or more planes. Interventions: 30 mg oral prednisolone/day for three weeks or placebo. Main outcome measures: Overall, night, and activity related pain, SPADI, Croft shoulder disability questionnaire, DASH, HAQ, SF-36, participant rated improvement, and range of active motion measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Results: At 3 weeks, there was greater improvement in overall pain in the prednisolone group than in the placebo group (mean (SD) change from baseline, 4.1 (2.3) v 1.4 (2.3); adjusted difference in mean change between the two groups, 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.8)). There was also greater improvement in disability, range of active motion, and participant rated improvement (marked or moderate overall improvement in 22/23 v 11/23; RR\u200a=\u200a2 (1.3 to 3.1), p\u200a=\u200a0.001). At 6 weeks the analysis favoured the prednisolone group for most outcomes but none of the differences was significant. At 12 weeks, the analysis tended to favour the placebo group. Conclusions: A three week course of 30 mg prednisolone daily is of significant short term benefit in adhesive capsulitis but benefits are not maintained beyond six weeks.",

        "title": "New issues in tuberculosis.",
        "abstract": "We read with interest the recent article by Kaufmann, who reported new issues in the epidemiology and treatment of tuberculosis. Dr Kaufmann pointed out that tuberculosis remains a significant health threat in the new European Union member states, in contrast with the \u2018\u2018old\u2019\u2019 EU member states, in which the incidence of this disease is decreasing. Accordingly, he reported the incidence for Slovenia as above 20/100 000. It is important to clarify that the mentioned incidence was last reported in Slovenia in 1999. Since 1995 tuberculosis in Slovenia has been decreasing constantly, reaching an incidence of 17.5/100 000 in 2002. (Data also available on website http://www.eurotb.org, accessed 24 February 2005.) The preliminary data of the central registry for tuberculosis in Slovenia have shown a further decrease for 2003, with an incidence of 14.7/100 000 (personal report). The importance of the omitted information is not only academic. Fictitious higher incidences of tuberculosis misrepresent the risk of this disease in Slovenian patients treated with biological drugs, which could be important in multicentre clinical studies. Furthermore, we would like to mention that the incidence of tuberculosis in patients treated with biological agents in Slovenia is very low. This treatment is centrally indicated and evaluated. We have confirmed only one case of tuberculosis among 200 patients receiving biological agents (anakinra, infliximab, etanercept).",

        "title": "Leflunomide-associated tuberculosis?",
        "abstract": "SIR, Tuberculosis (TB) is still one of the world\u2019s most frequently occurring infectious diseases. The incidence of active TB in Slovenia is 14.7 patients per 10 inhabitants [1]. In Spain, the risk of TB infection in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is increased fourfold compared with the general Spanish population [2], which is not the case in theUSA, a countrywith a low incidence of TB [3]. Themajor risk factor for active disease seems to be immunosuppressive therapy. Following the introduction of TNF-blocking agents in order to control RA, a growing number of active TB cases have been reported, leading to renewed interest in this disease. One of the widely used and efficacious disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is leflunomide. We used leflunomide from early 1990 as part of early phase II studies [3] and later in phase III clinical trials [4]. Among 2000 randomly selected RA patients in Slovenia (with a population of 1.5 million adults and a prevalence of RA of 1.2%), 13% have been treated with leflunomide. Adverse effects associated with leflunomide have been closely followed and, as documented, are generally mild and only seldom life-threatening even in a 5-yr follow up study [6]. We present five cases of active pulmonary TB that developed during treatment with leflunomide. Major characteristics of our patients are presented in Table 1. Cases of active TB following RA treatment with corticosteroids, methotrexate and TNF-blocking agents have already been reported. So far, to our knowledge, active TB in association with leflunomide treatment has not been described. Nevertheless, leflunomidemight increase susceptibility to reactivationTBdisease. Two possible explanations exist: general immunosuppression and/or specific anti-TNF activity of leflunomide. Leflunomide has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Its active metabolite mediates the suppression of B and T cells, inhibiting the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Higher doses also inhibit tyrosine kinases, responsible for T and B cell signalling, with subsequent reduction in proinflammatory cytokines [7]. The suppressive effect of leflunomide on TNFsignalling might be another possible mechanism for effectiveness in RA [8, 9]. It was demonstrated that leflunomide inhibits TNF-induced NFB activation, TNF-mediated cytotoxicity and the generation of TNF-induced reactive oxygen intermediates and lipid peroxidation [10]. Optimal activity of TNFand other cytokines (IFN, IL-12, IL-15) is crucial in host defence against bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The essential role of TNFhas been shown in studies on animal models indicating that inhibition of TNFincreases the frequency and severity of reactivation TB disease. This cytokine acts in granuloma formation [11]. An analogy can be drawn with the use of biological anti-TNFagents, where increased TB risk and frequency has been reported [12]. However, in contrast to reactivation TB disease in patients treated with TNFblockers, where presentation is frequently atypical, disseminated and extrapulmonary, the pattern of TB disease in our cases was classical pulmonary. This difference also exists in the period between introduction of the immunosuppressive therapy and the occurrence of TB, which in our cases was longer (average duration 66 weeks) than in TB cases associated with infliximab, where the median duration reported was 11 weeks [13]. In four out of five patients, leflunomide was the only DMARD used at the time of TB manifestation, in three cases it was combined with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 8mg daily), and in one case with methotrexate (7.5mg weekly). In the patients treated with a combination of leflunomide and methotrexate or corticosteroids, we cannot exclude the contribution of both concomitant drugs to active TB disease. However, it is less likely since methotrexate is a standard treatment and the most commonly prescribed drug for RA patients at our department, but until now we are not aware of any TB case connected with either methotrexate or corticosteroids in the last 5 yr. In conclusion, it is unclear whether leflunomide therapy increases the risk of reactivation TB beyond the elevated rates of reactivation TB documented for RA patients. However, temporal association of reactivation TB disease and leflunomide treatment may suggest this possibility. Reported cases underline the necessity of careful monitoring for reactivation TB disease during treatment with leflunomide.",

        "abstract": "Patients presenting with infections while receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic agents (DMARD) may be predisposed to a higher degree illness due to immunosuppression. This can be particularly problematic in patients who are receiving DMARDs with prolonged pharmacokinetic profiles. Leflunomide is a DMARD that has a prolonged half-life due to enterohepatic recirculation. We report a case of a patient with severe septic shock secondary to a prosthetic joint infection in which therapeutic levels of leflunomide were discovered, despite the patient ceasing therapy several weeks prior to admission. An orogastric cholestyramine washout was given to the patient to expedite the removal of the drug. Serum levels rapidly declined over the next several days, corresponding with resolution of her sepsis. A review of the literature relevant to the incidence of DMARD-related infections was conducted as well as discussion regarding the role of leflunomide drug monitoring and cholestyramine-facilitated removal of the drug in episodes of acute infectious syndromes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Leflunomide (LFND) is an immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that was approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis. LFND-induced cardiotoxicity was not fully investigated since its approval. We investigated the cardiac injury in male mice and identified the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/nuclear factor-\u03ba B (Nrf2/NF-\u03baB) signaling. Male albino mice were assigned into five groups as control, vehicle, and LFND (2.5, 5, and 10\u2009mg/kg). We investigated cardiac enzymes, histopathology, and the mRNA expression of Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, BAX, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The bioinformatic study identified the interaction between LFND and Nrf2/NF-\u03baB signaling; this was confirmed by amelioration in mRNA expression (0.5- to 0.34-fold decrease in Nrf2 and 2.6- to 4.61-fold increases in NF-\u03baB genes) and increased (1.76- and 2.625-fold) serum creatine kinase (CK) and 1.38- and 2.33-fold increases in creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). Histopathological results confirmed the dose-dependent effects of LFND on cardiac muscle structure in the form of cytoplasmic, nuclear, and vascular changes in addition to increased collagen deposits and apoptosis which were increased compared to controls especially with LFND 10\u2009mg/kg. The current study elicits the dose-dependent cardiac injury induced by LFND administration and highlights, for the first time, dysregulation in Nrf2/NF-\u03baB signaling.",
