        "title": "Medical and Endovascular Management of Critical Limb Ischemia",
        "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the term used to designate the condition in which peripheral artery disease has resulted in resting leg or foot pain or in a breakdown of the skin of the leg or foot, causing ulcers or tissue loss. If not revascularized, CLI patients are at risk for limb loss and for potentially fatal complications from the progression of gangrene and the development of sepsis. The management of CLI requires a multidisciplinary team of experts in different areas of vascular disease, from atherosclerotic risk factor management to imaging, from intervention to wound care and physical therapy. In the past decade, the most significant change in the treatment of CLI has been the increasing tendency to shift from bypass surgery to less invasive endovascular procedures as first-choice revascularization techniques, with bypass surgery then reserved as backup if appropriate. The goals of intervention for CLI include the restoration of pulsatile, inline flow to the foot to assist wound healing, the relief of rest pain, the avoidance of major amputation, preservation of mobility, and improvement of patient function and quality of life. The evaluating physician should be fully aware of all revascularization options in order to select the most appropriate intervention or combination of interventions, while taking into consideration the goals of therapy, risk-benefit ratios, patient comorbidities, and life expectancy. We discuss the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of CLI and the clinical presentation, diagnosis, available imaging modalities, and medical management (including pain and ulcer care, pharmaceutical options, and molecular therapies targeting angiogenesis). The endovascular approaches that we review include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (with or without adjunctive stenting); subintimal angioplasty; primary femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal deployment of bare nitinol, covered, drug-eluting, or bioabsorbable stents; cryoplasty; excimer laser-assisted angioplasty; excisional atherectomy; and cutting balloon angioplasty.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Peripheral artery disease is a potentially incapacitating disease for which pharmacological options are limited. Stromal cell\u2013derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine that attracts endothelial progenitor cells and promotes angiogenesis. Therapeutic use of SDF-1 in hindlimb ischemia may be challenged by proteolytic degradation. We hypothesized that protease-resistant variants of SDF-1 can increase blood flow in an experimental model of hindlimb ischemia. Methods and Results\u2014 We screened a peptide library for mutations in SDF-1 that provide resistance to matrix metalloproteinase cleavage. Recombinant SDF-1 proteins carrying the mutations were designed, expressed, and purified, and activity of mutant proteins was tested with receptor activation assays and in vivo Matrigel plug assays. SSDF-1(S4V), which is resistant to both dipeptidylpeptidase IV/CD26 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 cleavage, was active in vitro and induced angiogenesis in vivo. We then designed and purified fusion proteins of SSDF-1 and SSDF-1(S4V) with the sequence of self-assembling peptide nanofibers for incorporation into nanofibers. In a blinded and randomized hindlimb ischemia mouse study, SSDF-1(S4V) delivery by nanofibers improved blood flow as measured by laser Doppler from 23.1\u00b11.9% (untreated control) to 55.1\u00b15.7% 6 weeks after surgery (P<0.001). Nanofibers alone or SSDF-1 delivered by nanofibers did not improve blood flow. Furthermore, SSDF-1(S4V) delivered by nanofibers increased formation of new arterioles. In vitro, SSDF-1(S4V) attracts smooth muscle cells but does not induce mitosis. Conclusions\u2014 SDF-1 engineered to be resistant to dipeptidylpeptidase IV/CD26 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 cleavage and delivered by nanofibers improves blood flow in a model of peripheral artery disease.",

        "title": "The Role of DPP4 Activity in Cardiovascular Districts: In Vivo and In Vitro Evidence",
        "abstract": "The introduction of incretin hormone-based therapies represents a novel therapeutic strategy, since these drugs not only improve glycemia with minimal risk of hypoglycemia, but also have other extraglycemic beneficial effects. These agents, which are effective in improving glucose control, could also have positive effects on the incidence of cardiovascular events. The aim of this review is to summarize the present literature about the role of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in cardiovascular districts, not only strictly correlated to its effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) circulating levels, but also to what is known about possible cardiovascular actions. Actually, DPP4 is known to be present in many cells and tissues and its effects go beyond purely metabolic aspects. Almost always the inhibition of DPP4 activity is associated with improved cardiovascular profile, but it has shown to possess antithrombotic properties and these different effects could be connected with a site and/or species specificity of DPP4. Certainly, DPP4 seems to exert many functions, both directly and indirectly, on cardiovascular districts, opening new possibilities of prevention and treatment of complications at this level, not only in patients affected by diabetes mellitus.",

        "title": "DPP4 in cardiometabolic disease: recent insights from the laboratory and clinical trials of DPP4 inhibition.",
        "abstract": "The discovery of incretin-based medications represents a major therapeutic advance in the pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as these agents avoid hypoglycemia, weight gain, and simplify the management of T2DM. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26, DPP4) inhibitors are the most widely used incretin-based therapy for the treatment of T2DM globally. DPP4 inhibitors are modestly effective in reducing HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) (\u22480.5%) and while these agents were synthesized with the understanding of the role that DPP4 plays in prolonging the half-life of incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide, it is now recognized that incretins are only one of many targets of DPP4. The widespread expression of DPP4 on blood vessels, myocardium, and myeloid cells and the nonenzymatic function of CD26 as a signaling and binding protein, across a wide range of species, suggest a teleological role in cardiovascular regulation and inflammation. Indeed, DPP4 is upregulated in proinflammatory states including obesity, T2DM, and atherosclerosis. Consistent with this maladaptive role, the effects of DPP4 inhibition seem to exert a protective role in cardiovascular disease at least in preclinical animal models. Although 2 large clinical trials suggest a neutral effect on cardiovascular end points, current limitations of performing trials in T2DM over a limited time horizon on top of maximal medical therapy must be acknowledged before rendering judgment on the cardiovascular efficacy of these agents. This review will critically review the science of DPP4 and the effects of DPP4 inhibitors on the cardiovascular system.",

        "title": "Multiple common comorbidities produce left ventricular diastolic dysfunction associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and myocardial stiffening",
        "abstract": "Abstract Aims More than 50% of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction characterized by diastolic dysfunction. The prevalance of diastolic dysfunction is higher in females and associates with multiple comorbidities such as hypertension (HT), obesity, hypercholesterolemia (HC), and diabetes mellitus (DM). Although its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, it has been proposed that these comorbidities induce systemic inflammation, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and oxidative stress, leading to myocardial fibrosis, myocyte stiffening and, ultimately, diastolic dysfunction. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a swine model chronically exposed to three common comorbidities. Methods and results DM (induced by streptozotocin), HC (produced by high fat diet), and HT (resulting from renal artery embolization), were produced in 10 female swine, which were followed for 6\u2009months. Eight female healthy swine on normal pig-chow served as controls. The DM\u2009+\u2009HC\u2009+\u2009HT group showed hyperglycemia, HC, hypertriglyceridemia, renal dysfunction and HT, which were associated with systemic inflammation. Myocardial superoxide production was markedly increased, due to increased NOX activity and eNOS uncoupling, and associated with reduced NO production, and impaired coronary small artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation. These abnormalities were accompanied by increased myocardial collagen content, reduced capillary/fiber ratio, and elevated passive cardiomyocyte stiffness, resulting in an increased left ventricular end-diastolic stiffness (measured by pressure\u2013volume catheter) and a trend towards a reduced E/A ratio (measured by cardiac MRI), while ejection fraction was maintained. Conclusions The combination of three common comorbidities leads to systemic inflammation, myocardial oxidative stress, and coronary microvascular dysfunction, which associate with myocardial stiffening and LV diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction.",

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a major public health problem that is rising in prevalence, is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is considered to be the greatest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine today because of a general lack of effective treatments. To address this challenging syndrome, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a working group made up of experts in HFpEF and novel research methodologies to discuss research gaps and to prioritize research directions over the next decade. Here, we summarize the discussion of the working group, followed by key recommendations for future research priorities. There was uniform recognition that HFpEF is a highly integrated, multiorgan, systemic disorder requiring a multipronged investigative approach in both humans and animal models to improve understanding of mechanisms and treatment of HFpEF. It was recognized that advances in the understanding of basic mechanisms and the roles of inflammation, macrovascular and microvascular dysfunction, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling are needed and ideally would be obtained from (1) improved animal models, including large animal models, which incorporate the effects of aging and associated comorbid conditions; (2) repositories of deeply phenotyped physiological data and human tissue, made accessible to researchers to enhance collaboration and research advances; and (3) novel research methods that take advantage of computational advances and multiscale modeling for the analysis of complex, high-density data across multiple domains. The working group emphasized the need for interactions among basic, translational, clinical, and epidemiological scientists and across organ systems and cell types, leveraging different areas or research focus, and between research centers. A network of collaborative centers to accelerate basic, translational, and clinical research of pathobiological mechanisms and treatment strategies in HFpEF was discussed as an example of a strategy to advance research progress. This resource would facilitate comprehensive, deep phenotyping of a multicenter HFpEF patient cohort with standardized protocols and a robust biorepository. The research priorities outlined in this document are meant to stimulate scientific advances in HFpEF by providing a road map for future collaborative investigations among a diverse group of scientists across multiple domains.",

        "title": "From Systemic Inflammation to Myocardial Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "In accordance with the comorbidity-inflammation paradigm, comorbidities and especially metabolic comorbidities are presumed to drive development and severity of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction through a cascade of events ranging from systemic inflammation to myocardial fibrosis. Recently, novel experimental and clinical evidence emerged, which strengthens the validity of the inflammatory/profibrotic paradigm. This evidence consists among others of (1) myocardial infiltration by immunocompetent cells not only because of an obesity-induced metabolic load but also because of an arterial hypertension-induced hemodynamic load. The latter is sensed by components of the extracellular matrix like basal laminin, which also interact with cardiomyocyte titin; (2) expression in cardiomyocytes of inducible nitric oxide synthase because of circulating proinflammatory cytokines. This results in myocardial accumulation of degraded proteins because of a failing unfolded protein response; (3) definition by machine learning algorithms of phenogroups of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with a distinct inflammatory/profibrotic signature; (4) direct coupling in mediation analysis between comorbidities, inflammatory biomarkers, and deranged myocardial structure/function with endothelial expression of adhesion molecules already apparent in early preclinical heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HF stage A, B). This new evidence paves the road for future heart failure with preserved ejection fraction treatments such as biologicals directed against inflammatory cytokines, stimulation of protein ubiquitylation with phosphodiesterase 1 inhibitors, correction of titin stiffness through natriuretic peptide\u2014particulate guanylyl cyclase\u2014PDE9 (phosphodiesterase 9) signaling and molecular/cellular regulatory mechanisms that control myocardial fibrosis.",

Low\u2010level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation suppresses inflammation in humans. We conducted a sham\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind, randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of chronic low\u2010level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation on cardiac function, exercise capacity, and inflammation in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Methods and Results Patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and at least 2 additional comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or age \u226565 years) were randomized to either active (tragus) or sham (earlobe) low\u2010level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (20 Hz, 1 mA below discomfort threshold), for 1 hour daily for 3 months. Echocardiography, 6\u2010minute walk test, quality of life, and serum cytokines were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Fifty\u2010two patients (mean age 70.4\u00b19.2 years; 70% female) were included (active, n=26; sham, n=26). Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 arms. Adherence to the protocol of daily stimulation was >90% in both arms (P>0.05). While the early mitral inflow Doppler velocity to the early diastolic mitral annulus velocity ratio did not differ between groups, global longitudinal strain and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 levels at 3 months were significantly improved in the active compared with the sham arm (\u221218.6%\u00b12.5% versus \u221216.0%\u00b12.4%, P=0.002; 8.9\u00b12.8 pg/mL versus 11.3\u00b12.9 pg/mL, P=0.007, respectively).

In study 2, the HR reduction was greater with left than right tragus stimulation (-0.9 \u00b1 1.5 bpm,p< 0.01 and -0.3 \u00b1 1.4 bpm, respectively). In study 3 in HS, left tVNS at 25 Hz significantly reduced HR, whereas sham stimulation did not (-1.1 \u00b1 1.2 bpm,p< 0.01 and -0.2 \u00b1 2.9 bpm, respectively). In HF patients, both active and sham stimulation produced negligible effects.Significance.Left tVNS at 25 Hz is effective in acute modulation of cardiovascular autonomic control (HR, HRV) in HS but not in HF patients (NCT05789147).",
