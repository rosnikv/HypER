        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIt has been reported that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) benefit from metformin therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of obese (body mass index >30 kg/m2), oligo-/amenorrhoeic women with PCOS. Metformin (850 mg) twice daily was compared with placebo over 6 months. All received the same advice from a dietitian. The primary outcome measures were: (i) change in menstrual cycle; (ii) change in arthropometric measurements; and (iii) changes in the endocrine parameters, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 143 subjects was randomized [metformin (MET) = 69; placebo (PL) = 74]. Both groups showed significant improvements in menstrual frequency [median increase (MET = 1, P < 0.001; PL = 1, P < 0.001)] and weight loss [mean (kg) (MET = 2.84; P < 0.001 and PL = 1.46; P = 0.011)]. However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the independent variables (metformin, percentage of weight loss, initial BMI and age) in order to predict the improvement of menses. Only the percentage weight loss correlated with an improvement in menses (regression coefficient = 0.199, P = 0.047, odds ratio = 1.126, 95% CI 1.001, 1.266). There were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or lipid profiles in either of the groups. Those who received metformin achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference and free androgen index.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin does not improve weight loss or menstrual frequency in obese patients with PCOS. Weight loss alone through lifestyle changes improves menstrual frequency.",

        "title": "Insulin sensitizing drugs for weight loss in women of reproductive age who are overweight or obese: systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWomen of reproductive age, who are overweight or obese, are prone to infertility. Weight loss in these women leads to increased fecundity, higher chances of conception after infertility treatment and improved pregnancy outcome. In spite of the advantages, most patients have difficulty in losing weight and often regain lost weight over time. This review assesses whether treatment with insulin sensitizing drugs contributes to weight loss, compared with diet or a lifestyle modification programme.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter a systematic search of the literature, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), investigating the effect of insulin sensitizing drugs on weight loss compared with placebo and diet and/or a lifestyle modification programme, were included. Subjects were restricted to women of reproductive age. The main outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 14 trials, unintentionally all but two on women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) only, were included in the analysis. Treatment with metformin showed a statistically significant decrease in BMI compared with placebo (weighted mean difference, -0.68; 95% CI -1.13 to -0.24). There was some indication of greater effect with high-dose metformin (>1500 mg/day) and longer duration of therapy (>8 weeks). Limitations were power, low use of intention-to-treat analysis and heterogeneity of the studies.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA structured lifestyle modification programme to achieve weight loss should still be the first line treatment in obese women with or without PCOS. Adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm the findings of this review and to assess whether the addition of high-dose metformin therapy to a structured lifestyle modification programme might contribute to more weight loss.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nPatients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased prevalence of insulin resistance and display subclinical evidence of early cardiovascular disease. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and circulating markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with PCOS, but it is unclear whether this translates into improvements in vascular function.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to evaluate the effects of metformin on arterial stiffness and endothelial function in women with PCOS.\n\n\nDESIGN AND INTERVENTION\nThirty women with PCOS were assigned to consecutive 12-wk treatment periods of metformin or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design separated by an 8-wk washout.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measures were assessments of arterial stiffness [augmentation index (AIx), central blood pressure, and brachial and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and endothelial function. Anthropometry, testosterone, and metabolic biochemistry (lipids, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMetformin improved AIx [-6.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference -8.5 to -3.5%; P < 0.001], aortic PWV (-0.76 m/sec; 95% CI for the difference -1.12 to -0.4 m/sec; P < 0.001), brachial PWV (-0.73 m/sec; 95% CI for the difference -1.09 to -0.38; P < 0.001), central blood pressure (P < 0.001), and endothelium-dependent (AIx after albuterol; P = 0.003) and endothelium-independent (AIx after nitroglycerin; P < 0.001) vascular responses. Metformin also reduced weight (P < 0.001), waist circumference (P < 0.001), and triglycerides (P = 0.004) and increased adiponectin (P = 0.001) but did not affect testosterone or other metabolic measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nShort-term metformin therapy improves arterial stiffness and endothelial function in young women with PCOS.",

        "title": "Recent advances in cardiovascular aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk (CVR) markers, but population studies have not clarified whether there is an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Four different PCOS phenotypes resulted from the Rotterdam criteria that may differ in their CVR potential, thus introducing further complexity. This has led to studies using surrogate CVR markers including biomarkers in blood and imaging such as flow-mediated vasodilatation. In PCOS, both peripheral and central insulin resistance (IR) have been shown. Weight loss has been shown to improve IR and visceral fat, while insulin sensitizer therapies with metformin or thiazolidinediones improve IR and endothelial dysfunction. IR is also found in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that in turn is very common in PCOS; studies have suggested that IR may be improved by treatment with metformin and omega-3 fish oils. PCOS patients have a more dyslipidemic phenotype that is worse in 'classical PCOS' associated with a higher CVR. Studies with atorvastatin and simvastatin have reported a decrease in the lipid parameters and an improvement in CVR indices including IR, but it is unclear whether this is due to their lipid-lowering action or a pleiotropic effect of the statin. In this expert opinion review, the relevant literature published during the last 2 years was considered. It focuses on some recent important data that has emerged while also exposing the gaps that remain in our knowledge that need to be addressed.",

        "title": "Cardiovascular risk and subclinical cardiovascular disease in polycystic ovary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "In addition to its effects on reproductive health, it is now well recognized that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a metabolic disorder, characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity which leads to an excess lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. PCOS patients are often obese, hypertensive, dyslipidemic and insulin resistant; they have obstructive sleep apnea and have been reported to have higher aldosterone levels in comparison to normal healthy controls. These are all components of an adverse cardiovascular risk profile. Many studies exploring subclinical atherosclerosis using different methods (flow-mediated dilatation, intima media thickness, arterial stiffness, coronary artery calcification) as well as assessing circulating cardiovascular risk markers, point toward an increased cardiovascular risk and early atherogenesis in PCOS. The risk and early features of subclinical atherosclerosis can be reversed by non-medical (normalization of weight, healthy lifestyle) and medical (metformin, thiazolidinediones, spironolactone, and statins) interventions. However, the long-term risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as the clinical significance of different interventions still need to be properly addressed in a large prospective study.",

        "abstract": "Background. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) could develop subclinical atherosclerosis during life. Purpose. To analyze cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors and their relation to clinical markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in respect to their age. Material and Methods. One hundred women with PCOS (26.32 \u00b1 5.26 years, BMI: 24.98 \u00b1 6.38\u2009kg/m2) were compared to 50 respective controls. In all subjects, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, TC/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C ratios, glucose, insulin and HOMA index, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, resp.), and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) were analyzed in respect to their age and level of androgens. Results. PCOS over 30 years had higher WHR (P = 0.008), SBP (P < 0.001), DBP (P < 0.001), TC (P = 0.028), HDL-C (P = 0.028), LDL-C (P = 0.045), triglycerides (P < 0.001), TC/HDL-C (P < 0.001), and triglycerides/HDL-C (P < 0.001) and had more prevalent hypertension and pronounced CIMT on common carotid arteries even after adjustment for BMI (P = 0.005 and 0.036, resp.). TC/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C were higher in PCOS with the highest quintile of FAI in comparison to those with lower FAI (P = 0.045 and 0.034, resp.). Conclusions. PCOS women older than 30 years irrespective of BMI have the potential for early atherosclerosis mirrored through the elevated lipids/lipid ratios and through changes in blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To compare metabolic parameters including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women with the different cardiovascular disease risks (CVD), and to study the frequency of PCOS women in each risk category who need treatment for the target LDL-C levels according to the recommendation by the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society (AE-PCOS). Material and Method: This was a retrospective comparative study. Data from the medical records and electronic forms of the 208 PCOS women, who consecutively attended the Reproductive between February 2004 and December 2010 were analyzed. According to the recommendation of the AE-PCOS society, the subjects were classi \ufb01 ed into three groups of CVD risk. Results: There were 22, 129, and 57 women being at optimal risk, at risk, and at high-risk groups, respectively. There were signi \ufb01 cant differences in all metabolic factors between the different CVD classi \ufb01 cations according to the AE-PCOS society. Furthermore, the PCOS women at high-risk had higher rates of the most signi \ufb01 cant parameters than those at risk. However, the LDL-C levels were not different between PCOS women at high-risk and at risk. Interestingly, 56%, 90.7%, and 100% of PCOS women at risk, at high-risk, and at high-risk plus other risks, respectively, had LDL-C levels above the target goals, which needed to be lower for the primary CVD prevention according to the AE- PCOS society recommendation. Conclusion: There were differences in all metabolic factors between the different CVD classi \ufb01 cations, but LDL-C levels were not different between PCOS women at high-risk and at risk. To get target goal for the primary CVD prevention, 91% and 100% of PCOS women at high-risk and at high-risk plus other risks need to lower LDL-C levels.",
