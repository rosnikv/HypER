        "abstract": "A short-term trial has been performed under double-blind conditions in 50 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare diclofenac sodium (Voltaren) with both indomethacin and placebo for efficacy and tolerability. The duration of the trial was two weeks and was a between-patient comparison of 25 mg t.i.d. diclofenac sodium, 25 mg t.i.d. indomethacin or placebo using a double-dummy technique. Forty-eight patients completed the trial. In the majority of parameters examined, diclofenac sodium was superior to placebo and indomethacin in therapeutic effect. One patient was withdrawn from the trial because of intolerance to indomethacin and one other because of severe joint pain under indomethacin therapy. Neither active compound caused clinically significant changes in blood picture or urine analysis.",

In animal experiments diclofenac sodium is characterised by a broad therapeutic range. Also, its gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of other highly effective non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents. Two of the metabolites produced during the biotransformation of diclofenac sodium in man are also biologically active.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the tissue\u2010plasma partition coefficients (Kp) needed for an initial prediction of the volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) of a drug in humans. Values of Kp were collected from the literature. Only Kp values plausibly representing true steady state distribution were accepted, and data had to be available for muscle, fat, skin and at least five other organs. The apparent volume of distribution of a drug in an organ/tissue (Vapp) was calculated as Kp multiplied by the volume of the organ/tissue, and the Vdss as the sum of all available Vapp values. The percentage contribution of each Vapp to the Vdss was estimated. In addition, linear regressions were calculated between Kp values of all drugs in a specific organ/tissue and Kp in muscle or fat. Finally, the Vdss was re\u2010calculated using (for basic drugs) the Kp in fat to calculate Vapp in fat and lungs and the Kp in muscle for the Vapp of all other organs/tissues. The two sets of estimates of Vdss were compared by linear regression. The same calculations were performed for acidic drugs, except that muscle Kp was used also for the lungs. Distribution to fat and muscle accounted for 84% (61\u201391%) (median and range) of the total estimated Vdss of the basic drugs (n = 17). The regressions between Kp in organs/tissues and muscle Kp were statistically significant except in the case of liver. For acidic drugs (n = 18), distribution to fat and muscle accounted for 65% (42\u201392%) of Vdss, and the regressions of Kp were significant for all organs/tissues except kidney and bone. For both types of drugs, correlations between organ/tissue Kp values and Kp in fat were generally worse. There were excellent linear correlations between Vdss calculated by means of only two Kp values and the originally calculated Vdss (r2 \u2265 0.99 for both basic and acidic drugs; slopes were not significantly different from unity). Thus, initial estimation of the Vdss of a new drug can normally be based on only two Kp values, those of muscle and fat. The muscle Kp can be used to represent all lean tissues, including the residual \u201ccarcass\u201d, with the exception that fat Kp can be used for distribution of basic drugs to lungs.",

The correlation between logBB and physicochemical properties has been remarkably improved by grouping the compounds according to their pK a values. For compounds with pK a > 8.5 logBB increases with the maximum atomic positive charge, polarity characterized by the sum of substructural partial charges and decreases with the maximum H-bond acceptor and the H-bond donor (n=16, r 2 = 0.864, s=0.316, Q 2 =0.783). For compounds with a pK a in the range of 6.8\u2264pK a < 8.5 logBB increases with molecular size/bulk (polarizability a) and decreases with polarity and the H-bond acceptor (n=11, r 2 = 0.892, s=0.246, Q=0.652). For compounds with pK a <6.8 and neutral compounds logBB increases with polarizability and and decreases with the H-bond acceptor (n=28, r 2 =0.869, s=0.162, Q 2 =0.820). logBB of the compounds with high pK a can be also described by logP defined as the difference between logP values measured in 1-octanol water and those measured in alkane water well, whilst logBB of the neutral compounds and the compounds with low pK a values can be also described by logP(1-octanol/water) very well, and it seems to be neither logP nor logP can describe logBB of the compounds with intermediate pK a values.

        "abstract": "The molecular structures of many endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contain groups that ionize under physiological pH conditions. It is unclear whether the neutral and ionic forms have different binding mechanisms with the macromolecular targets. We selected phenolic compounds and human transthyretin (hTTR) as a model system and employed molecular docking with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics optimizations to probe the mechanisms. The binding patterns of ionizable ligands in hTTR crystal structures were also analyzed. We found that the anionic forms of the phenolic compounds bind stronger than the corresponding neutral forms with hTTR. Electrostatic and van de Waals interactions are the dominant forces for most of the anionic and neutral forms, respectively. Because of the dominant and orientational electrostatic interactions, the -O(-) groups point toward the entry port of the binding site. The aromatic rings of the compounds also form cation-\u03c0 interactions with the -NH3(+) group of Lys 15 residues in hTTR. Molecular descriptors were selected to characterize the interactions and construct a quantitative structure-activity relationship model on the relative competing potency of chemicals with T4 binding to hTTR. It is concluded that the effects of ionization should not be neglected when constructing in silico models for screening of potential EDCs.",

        "abstract": "Endocrine disrupting chemicals influence growth and development through interactions with the hormone system, often through binding to hormone receptors such as the estrogen receptor. Computational methods can predict endocrine disrupting chemical activity of unmodified compounds, but approaches predicting activity following metabolism are lacking. The present study uses a well\u2010known environmental contaminant, PCB\u201030 (2,4,6\u2010trichlorobiphenyl), as a prototype endocrine disrupting chemical and integrates predictive (computational) and experimental methods to determine its metabolic transformation by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) into estrogenic byproducts. Computational predictions suggest that hydroxylation of PCB\u201030 occurs at the 3\u2010 or 4\u2010phenol positions and leads to metabolites that bind more strongly than the parent molecule to the human estrogen receptor alpha (hER\u2010\u03b1). Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry experiments confirmed that the primary metabolite for CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is 4\u2010hydroxy\u2010PCB\u201030, and the secondary metabolite is 3\u2010hydroxy\u2010PCB\u201030.

        "abstract": "Some hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (HO-PBDEs), that have been widely detected in the environment and tissues of humans and wildlife, bind to thyroid hormone (TH) receptor (TR) and can disrupt functioning of systems modulated by the TR. However, mechanisms of TH disrupting effects are still equivocal. Here, disruption of functions of TH modulated pathways by HO-PBDEs was evaluated by assays of competitive binding, coactivator recruitment, and proliferation of GH3 cells. In silico simulations considering effects of coregulators were carried out to investigate molecular mechanisms and to predict potencies for disrupting functions of the TH. Some HO-PBDEs were able to bind to TR with moderate affinities but were not agonists. In GH3 proliferation assays, 13 out of 16 HO-PBDEs were antagonists for the TH. In silico simulations of molecular dynamics revealed that coregulators were essential for identification of TH disruptors. Among HO-PBDEs, binding of passive antagonists induced repositioning of H12, blocking AF-2 (transactivation function 2) and preventing recruitment of the coactivator. Binding of active antagonists exposed the coregulator binding site, which tended to bind to the corepressor rather than the coactivator. By considering both passive and active antagonisms, anti-TH potencies of HO-PBDEs could be predicted from free energy of binding.",

Iodoacetic acid (IAA), an unregulated DBP, has been shown to be cytotoxic, mutagenic, genotoxic, and tumorigenic. However, its endocrine-disrupting effects remain unknown. This study evaluated the IAA-induced disruption of the thyroid endocrine system using in vitro and in vivo assays. Rat pituitary tumor GH3 cells were treated with IAA in the presence and absence of triiodothyronine (T3). IAA exposure significantly reduced T3-activated GH3 cell proliferation, indicating the antagonistic activity of IAA in vitro. Sprague-Dawley rats were also subjected to IAA treatment through oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. IAA exposure significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), and type I deiodinase and simultaneously reduced the protein expression levels of TSHR and NIS. IAA exposure decreased T3 levels but increased the weights of hypothalamus and the levels of thyrotropin releasing hormone and thyrotropin. In addition, IAA induced the formation of smaller and more depleted follicles or even vacuolization in the thyroid. These results suggested that IAA potentially disrupts the thyroid endocrine system both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Disinfection byproduct (DBP) exposure has been linked to multiple adverse health outcomes. However, the molecular initiating events by which DBPs induce their toxicities remain unclear. Herein, we combined reporter cell lines and activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) chemical proteomics to identify the protein targets of three monohaloacetic acids (mHAAs) and three monohaloacetamides (mHAMs), at the proteome-wide level. While mHAAs and mHAMs have similar potencies in reducing MTT activity, mHAMs induced greater Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress responses, demonstrating their distinct toxicity pathways. ABPP on crude cell lysates suggested that general proteome thiol reactivity correlates with cytotoxicity. Interestingly, live cell ABPP results revealed class-specific proteins attacked by mHAMs or mHAAs. Subsequent proteomic analysis identified >100 unique targets per DBP. mHAMs preferentially react with redox proteins including disulfide oxidoreductase enzymes, accounting for their stronger Nrf2 responses. To further probe alkylation mechanisms, we directly monitored protein adducts and identified 120 and 37 unique peptides with iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid adducts, respectively. Of the latter, we confirmed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a key target of IAA, specifically attacking the catalytic Cys 152.

Many species of water DBPs are harmful to the reproductive system of organisms. Nevertheless, the potential effects of IAA exposure on testosterone and spermatogenesis in vivo remain ambiguous. Spermatogenous cells are the site of spermatogenesis, Leydig cells are the site of testosterone synthesis, and Sertoli cells build the blood\u2013testis barrier (BTB), providing a stable environment for the aforementioned important physiological functions in testicular tissue. Therefore, we observed the effects of IAA on spermatogenic cells, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells in the testis. In this study, we found that oral administration of IAA (35 mg/kg body weight per day for 28 days) in male mice increased serum LH levels and reduced sperm motility, affecting average path velocity and straight line velocity of sperm. In addition, IAA promoted the expression of \u03b3H2AX, a marker for DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, IAA downregulated the protein expression of the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1), and decreased lipid droplet transport into Leydig cells, which reduced the storage of testosterone synthesis raw materials and might cause a drop in testosterone production. Furthermore, IAA did not affect the function of BTB. Thus, our results indicated that IAA exposure affected spermatogenesis and testosterone synthesis by inducing DNA damage and reducing lipid droplet transport.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it explores the effects of iodoacetic acid (IAA), a monohaloacetic acid (mHAA) studied in the source paper, on the reproductive system of male mice. The source paper identified IAA as a DBP that reacts with specific proteins, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the current paper investigates the potential effects of IAA exposure on testosterone and spermatogenesis in vivo."
