        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of the present study was to test two brief planning interventions designed to encourage cardiac patients to engage in regular physical exercise following discharge from rehabilitation. The interventions comprised action plans on (a) when, where, and how to act, and (b) coping plans on how to deal with anticipated barriers.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHOD\nAn experimental longitudinal trial was conducted to test two interventions that either focused on action planning alone, or on a combination of action planning and coping planning. A total of 211 participants completed assessments at baseline and 2 months after discharge. Participants were randomly assigned to either one of the intervention groups or a standard-care control group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in the combined planning group did significantly more physical exercise 2 months post-discharge than those in the other groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe theoretical distinction between action planning and coping planning as introduced in the present study has proven useful in explaining changes in health-related behaviour. The combined planning intervention can be applied in the context of cardiac rehabilitation programmes.",

        "abstract": "Although considerable evidence suggests that forming an implementation intention increases rates of goal attainment, less research has examined the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The present research investigated the role of deliberative processes and accessibility of plan components as explanation for the relationship between implementation intentions and goal achievement. Study 1 used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of implementation intentions on goal intentions and self-efficacy. The results of 66 tests suggested that forming implementation intentions had negligible effects on both variables. Study 2 focused on the accessibility of plan components and found that the effect of implementation intentions on goal achievement was mediated simultaneously by the accessibility of specified situational cues and by the strength of the association forged between these cues and the intended response. These findings suggest that implementation intention effects are not explained by increased deliberation, but rather accrue from heightened accessibility of specified opportunities and strong opportunity-response links.",

        "abstract": "Implementation intention formation promotes effective goal striving and goal attainment. However, little research has investigated whether implementation intentions promote behaviour change when people possess strong antagonistic habits. Experiment 1 developed relatively habitual responses that, after a task switch, had a detrimental impact on task performance. Forming an if-then plan reduced the negative impact of habit on performance. However, the effect of forming implementation intentions was smaller among participants who possessed strong habits as compared to participants who had weaker habits. Experiment 2 provided a field test of the role of habit strength in moderating the relationship between implementation intentions and behaviour in the context of smoking. Implementation intentions reduced smoking among participants with weak or moderate smoking habits, but not among participants with strong smoking habits. In summary, habit strength moderates the effectiveness of if-then plan formation in breaking unwanted habits.",

        "title": "Using theories of behaviour change to inform interventions for addictive behaviours.",
        "abstract": "AIMS\nThis paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTen theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBriefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the suitability of N-of-1 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a means of testing the effectiveness of behavior change techniques based on self-regulation theory (goal setting and self-monitoring) for promoting walking in healthy adult volunteers.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA series of N-of-1 RCTs in 10 normal and overweight adults ages 19-67 (M = 36.9 years). We randomly allocated 60 days within each individual to text message-prompted daily goal-setting and/or self-monitoring interventions in accordance with a 2 (step-count goal prompt vs. alternative goal prompt) \u00d7 2 (self-monitoring: open vs. blinded Omron-HJ-113-E pedometer) factorial design. Aggregated data were analyzed using random intercept multilevel models. Single cases were analyzed individually. The primary outcome was daily pedometer step counts over 60 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSingle-case analyses showed that 4 participants significantly increased walking: 2 on self-monitoring days and 2 on goal-setting days, compared with control days. Six participants did not benefit from the interventions. In aggregated analyses, mean step counts were higher on goal-setting days (8,499.9 vs. 7,956.3) and on self-monitoring days (8,630.3 vs. 7,825.9). Multilevel analyses showed a significant effect of the self-monitoring condition (p = .01), the goal-setting condition approached significance (p = .08), and there was a small linear increase in walking over time (p = .03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nN-of-1 randomized trials are a suitable means to test behavioral interventions in individual participants.",

        "title": "A replication and conceptual evaluation of commonly used positive psychology interventions",
        "abstract": "What makes people happy is an increasingly important question for \nclinical practice and public health. The major line of research and \nintervention in this area, positive psychology, focuses on furthering \nknowledge about the factors which improve individuals\u2019 levels of \nhappiness and nurture the growth of character strengths. However, \ndespite the growth in positive psychology research over the past decade, \nreplication studies are lacking and the cross-cultural applicability of \ninterventions has not been thoroughly investigated. Three studies are \npresented in this thesis, all of which relate to the landmark research \nconducted by Seligman, Steen, Park and Peterson (2005) on positive \npsychology exercises (PPEs). The purpose of Study 1 was to evaluate the \nefficacy of three PPEs and a control exercise in an Australian rather \nthan American population. Consistent with the original study, an \ninternet based randomised trial with four groups was used, in which each exercise was completed over a one-week period, with follow up \nmeasurements taken up to six months after completing the initial \nexercise. The findings of the original study were not fully replicated. \nSpecifically, although all groups showed an increase in happiness levels \nand a decrease in depression levels over time, there was no differential \neffect between the PPEs and the control exercise. The aim of Study 2 \nwas to examine whether the results from Study 1 might be attributable to problems in measuring happiness. In Study 1 the Authentic \nHappiness Inventory (AHI) was used to capture changes in happiness \nlevels as it was designed by Seligman et al. to be sensitive to upward \nchanges in Seligman\u2019s (2002) three domains of happiness: pleasure, \nengagement and meaning. However, supporting literature regarding the \npsychometric properties of the AHI is lacking. In Study 2 discriminant \ncontent validity techniques were used to investigate how well the AHI \nrepresents the aforementioned psychological constructs. Study 2 \nshowed that expert judges could not unambiguously allocate the AHI \nitems to the intended constructs, indicating that the AHI demonstrates \npoor discriminant content validity. The purpose of Study 3 was to \ninvestigate the efficacy of the PPEs in an n-of-1 design using a more \nwidely validated measure of subjective well-being, the Positive and \nNegative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The use of n-of-1 designs has been \nrecommended when the emphasis is on examining within-person \nchanges rather than between-group differences. Over the 9\u201310 week \nintervention period, no significant changes in happiness or depression \nwere produced and apart from a small positive interaction between one \nof the PPEs and positive affect, there was no differential effect between \nPPEs and the control exercise. These largely non-significant findings \nraise doubts about the clinical appropriateness of these PPE \ninterventions. Overall the results of this thesis demonstrated poor support for Seligman et al.\u2019s (2005) study findings, raising questions not \nonly about the interventions and measures promoted by Seligman et al., \nbut also about the underlying theoretical concepts. Although the \nusefulness of PPEs in clinical settings appears limited, it is possible that \nthere is scope for their use in a public health context. However before a \npublic health use is pursued further, investigation is required into what \nthe \u2018active\u2019 elements of PPE interventions are and whether the effects of \nthese elements might be attributed to more general psychological \ntheories of behaviour change. On this basis, it is recommended that \nfuture research efforts focus on addressing the cross-cultural and \npublic health relevance of positive psychology interventions.",
