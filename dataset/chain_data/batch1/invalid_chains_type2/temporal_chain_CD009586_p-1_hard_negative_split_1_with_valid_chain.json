        "title": "Screening versus routine practice in detection of atrial fibrillation in patients aged 65 or over: cluster randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives To assess whether screening improves the detection of atrial fibrillation (cluster randomisation) and to compare systematic and opportunistic screening. Design Multicentred cluster randomised controlled trial, with subsidiary trial embedded within the intervention arm. Setting 50 primary care centres in England, with further individual randomisation of patients in the intervention practices. Participants 14\u2009802 patients aged 65 or over in 25 intervention and 25 control practices. Interventions Patients in intervention practices were randomly allocated to systematic screening (invitation for electrocardiography) or opportunistic screening (pulse taking and invitation for electrocardiography if the pulse was irregular). Screening took place over 12 months in each practice from October 2001 to February 2003. No active screening took place in control practices. Main outcome measure Newly identified atrial fibrillation. Results The detection rate of new cases of atrial fibrillation was 1.63% a year in the intervention practices and 1.04% in control practices (difference 0.59%, 95% confidence interval 0.20% to 0.98%). Systematic and opportunistic screening detected similar numbers of new cases (1.62% v 1.64%, difference 0.02%, \u22120.5% to 0.5%). Conclusion Active screening for atrial fibrillation detects additional cases over current practice. The preferred method of screening in patients aged 65 or over in primary care is opportunistic pulse taking with follow-up electrocardiography.

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with a high risk of embolic stroke (cause in 15% of all strokes and 30% of strokes in those >75 years of age). Anticoagulation with warfarin will reduce stroke risk by about two thirds. The main risks of anticoagulation, namely bleeding, can be minimized by maintaining anticoagulation control within the international normalized range range of 2.0 to 3.0 (target: 2.5). To have a public health impact, patients with AF need efficient and correct identification, with appropriate treatment directed at those patients at most risk from the condition.",

        "abstract": "Currently, there is very limited literature on the effect of long-term anticoagulants on total knee arthroplasty. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effect of warfarin and clopidogrel on the transfusion rate, intra-operative blood loss, and postoperative blood loss for total knee arthroplasty. The secondary purpose was to determine their effect on post operative wound complications and length of stay. Data was collected retrospectively from medical charts between 2003-2008 and case matched to a control group. The patients on warfarin had a higher rate of blood transfusion, blood loss, and length of hospital stay compared to the clopidogrel and control groups.",

Although warfarin is mentioned in the source paper as an anticoagulant used to reduce stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, this paper's hypothesis is not inspired by or dependent on the source paper's findings. Instead, it explores a different application of anticoagulants."

        "title": "SSRIs Increase Risk of Blood Transfusion in Patients Admitted for Hip Surgery",
        "abstract": "Background Recent studies have shown that an increased bleeding tendency can be caused by Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) use. We aimed to investigate the occurrence and risk of blood transfusion in SSRI users compared to non-SSRI users in a cohort of patients admitted for hip-surgery. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent planned or emergency hip surgery from 1996 to 2011 in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. Primary outcome measure was risk of blood transfusion. Secondary outcome measures were pre- and postoperative hemoglobin level. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. Results One-hundred and fourteen SSRI users were compared to 1773 non-SSRI users. Risk of blood transfusion during admission was increased for SSRI users in multivariate analyses (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.1\u20132.5]). Also, pre-operative hemoglobin levels were lower in SSRI users (7.8\u00b11.0 mmol/L) compared to non-SSRI users (8.0\u00b11.0 mmol/L) (p\u200a=\u200a0.042)), as were postoperative hemoglobin levels (6.2\u00b11.0 mmol/L vs. 6.4\u00b11.0 mmol/L respectively) (p\u200a=\u200a0.017)). Conclusions SSRI users undergoing hip surgery have an increased risk for blood transfusion during admission, potentially explained by a lower hemoglobin level before surgery. SSRI use should be considered as a potential risk indicator for increased blood loss in patients admitted for hip surgery. These results need to be confirmed in a prospective study.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Tranexamic acid (TXA) combined with rivaroxaban (RA) has been widely used in total knee replacement (TKA). This meta-analysis explored the clinical effects of TXA combined with RA on reducing bleeding and preventing venous thrombosis in patients with unilateral TKA. Methods Five controlled clinical studies that met the inclusion criteria were collected from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane libraries. Fixed effect model and random effect model were used to compare the TXA\u2009+\u2009RA group with the RA group in 731 patients. Results Decrease of hemoglobin (Hb), total blood loss, transfusion rate and wound complications of the TXA\u2009+\u2009RA group is lower than the RA group, the difference was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurs in the TXA\u2009+\u2009RA group and the RA group showed no statistically significant difference (p\u2009>\u20090.05). There was no obvious difference of two ways of drug given that intra-articular (IA) and intravenous (IV) effect on Hb decrease, total blood loss, transfusion rate, wound complications, DVT (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Conclusion The application of TXA combined with RA in the TKA can effectively reduce blood loss without increasing the risk of DVT. However, it should be noted that TXA combined with RA after TKA has a potential increased risk of wound complications.",
