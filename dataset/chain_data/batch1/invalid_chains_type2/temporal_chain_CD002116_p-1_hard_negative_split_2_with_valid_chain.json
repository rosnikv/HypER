        "abstract": "Encopresis is characterized by the voluntary or involuntary passage of stool into the underwear after the age of 4 years. In most patients, encopresis is the result of constipation. However, in our practice, 20% of children experience encopresis as an isolated complaint, without any signs of constipation. These children have normal defecation frequency, no palpable abdominal or rectal fecal mass on physical examination, and normal colonic transit time. Laxatives have no or an adverse effect in these children (1). Recently, encopresis in the absence of signs of fecal retention has been classified as functional non-retentive fecal soiling by the new pediatric Rome-II criteria (2). The treatment of these children is often disappointing, with only 29% of patients cured after 2 years of intensive treatment (3). In contrast to earlier reports (4), recent data show that 24% of children with functional non-retentive fecal soiling do not outgrow their encopresis during puberty and still experience encopresis when reaching adulthood (5). This large number of patients with encopresis after the age of 18 justifies the search for treatment options for this patient group. The symptoms of children with functional nonretentive fecal soiling resembles those of adults with idiopathic fecal incontinence, incontinence without a known underlying cause. In most adult patients, however, fecal incontinence is a result of trauma (after delivery) or by the aging processes. In adulthood fecal incontinence, loperamide is a well-known and frequently used medication. A study in adults with chronic diarrhea and fecal incontinence showed that the oral administration of loperamide, an opioid agonist, resulted in significant improvement of continence (6). Here, we describe a 20-year-old male with childhoodonset, longstanding functional non-retentive fecal soiling who dramatically improved after rectal application of loperamide.",

        "title": "Pathophysiology of pediatric fecal incontinence.",
        "abstract": "This article addresses the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric fecal incontinence in 4 main categories: (1) Functional fecal retention, the withholding of feces because of fear of painful defecation, results in constipation and overflow soiling. Treatment includes dietary changes, use of laxatives, and cognitive and behavioral interventions such as toilet training, which diminishes phobia and provides positive reinforcement through a rewards system. (2) For functional nonretentive fecal soiling (encopresis), antidiarrheal agents can increase the consistency of stools and facilitate continence. Anorectal biofeedback for children has been proposed, but its efficacy remains unproven. Parents should be educated to conduct nonaccusatory toilet training and help children alleviate guilt and enhance self-esteem. Appropriately constructed trials are necessary to gauge the effect of adding prolonged use of enemas to an intensive toilet training program. (3) Surgery can correct minor congenital anorectal anomalies by identifying the external sphincter, separating the rectum from the genitourinary tract, and reconstructing the anus. However, there is great variation in postsurgical functional outcomes for anorectal malformations. Double-blinded, randomized controlled trials could help define the role of appendicostomy, cecostomy, sphincter reconstruction, colostomy, and artificial sphincters. (4) Children with spina bifida and fecal incontinence may benefit from techniques that teach them how to defecate. A continent appendicostomy (Malone procedure) is a promising treatment that completely cleanses the colon, increases the child's autonomy, and decreases the chance of soiling. A cecostomy can be performed surgically, endoscopically, or radiologically to provide some of the same benefits.",

        "title": "Constipation and toileting issues in children",
        "abstract": "In the 19th century, academics and clinicians travelled to Europe to learn the latest advances in medical science and clinical practice. German medicine was at its zenith, and its stars \u2014 Koch, Billroth, Virchow and others \u2014 were the drawcards at international medical congresses, events which regularly attracted up to 10000 delegates from over 50 countries. Those attending a congress usually spent their time visiting laboratories and clinics in European capitals, such as Berlin, Paris or London. But this was also the era of difficult travel over land and sea, so decisions to attend a conference were not taken lightly. Thankfully, the choice of conferences was limited. No more. Most international destinations can now be reached within a day, and the choice of conferences is overwhelming. One has only to enter \u201cinternational medical congress\u201d into Google and more than a quarter of a million sites spew forth. This burgeoning of meetings has practical consequences, such as depleting the numbers of academics present in faculties at any given time. Indeed, this regular absenteeism has prompted the pejorative, \u201cabsent professors\u201d, and given rise to riddles with a particular sting: \u201cWhy is the Medical Faculty like the US Strategic Air Command?\u201d \u201cBecause 30% or more of its professors are in the air at any one time.\u201d Does all this matter? The absence of professors while they attend conferences or sit on research committees reflects the reality in academic medicine \u2014 that research is valued far more than teaching. Paradoxically, the word \u201cprofessor\u201d means to profess \u2014 to teach. The absence of professors means that this task is delegated to junior staff. Surely this behaviour makes a mockery of the title \u201cProfessor\u201d. Perhaps a new academic adage \u2014 \u201ctravel rather than teach\u201d \u2014 should now be added to \u201cpublish or perish\u201d.",

        "abstract": "Lifestyle diseases (LSDs) are those conditions usually attributed to dramatic shifts in the way humans live their lives, and are an object of medical attention and thus the cause of concern. Continuous usage of conventional medici ne for these diseases may produce adverse drug reactions and hence an alternative has become the need of the hour. Rasa Shastra has flourished from medieval period, but therapeutic use of Rasa Dravyas is being explored in terms of Metallo - pharmaceutics of contemporary researches which is evident by the increasing number of researches validating it. This article focuses on the utility of Rasaushadhis and their role in the betterment of the community with special reference to LSDs.",

        "abstract": "Abhraka Bhasma is called as a wonder drug due to its curative property in various ailments. Hence there is an urgent requirement to prove its non-toxicity and therapeutic value and also to conform genuinity and safety before administration to human beings. In this study, Abhraka Bhasma is authenticated as biotite mica by observing quality assurance methods and testing it through standard ayurvedic and analytical techniques like EDXRF, FEG-SEM and EDS. For this purpose commercially available Abhraka Bhasma was procured and subjected to conventional method of analysis wherein the sample satisfied all the criterias given in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia. Bhasma proved to be brick red in colour, lusterless, fine, had floating character, was excellently prepared (Unama test), tasteless, without alloy, smooth and tangible. The modern analytical method EDXRF revealed the presence of Fe (22%) as a major element and Ca, K and Si in low concentrations, their concentration being 11%, 8% and 13% respectively. Mg (4%), Al (2%) and Ti (1%) were present as minor elements while Sodium, Chlorine, and Phosphorous were present in traces (<1%). FEG-SEM studies showed that the grains in Abhraka Bhasma were heterogenous and in aggregates of particle size between 19 nm and 88 nm. The grains were found to be irregular in shape ranging from spherical to oblong. EDS analysis show that major elements present in the sample) were O (41%), Si (16%), K (13%) and Fe (13%) and the minor elements were Al (6%), Mg (5%), Ca (4%) and Cl (1%). Sodium, Phosphorous and Titanium were found in traces (<1%). The analytical techniques used confirmed the absence of organic compounds and mercury in the sample characterized. This physico-chemical characterization study will help to take stock of Bhasma preparations as novel nano-technological applications giving a new thrust to Ayurvedic pharmaceutics.",

        "title": "Study of General Properties of Abhrak Bhasma : A Nanomedicine",
        "abstract": "There has been a constant surge in the demand for the traditional medicine like ayurvedic preparations. Abhrak bhasma is a type of ayurvedic preparation prepared from repeated incineration of mica mineral with decoction of various medicinal herbs. Traditionally, it has been used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, bleeding disorders, cough, cold, urinary disorders, diabetes, anemia, skin diseases, splenic disorders etc. It has also been considered to have anti-aging as well as anti-infertility properties and therefore used in various rejuvenating preparations. Despite their wide range of applications, these products are rarely validated at par with the modern medicines. There is also a paucity of literature that describes mode of action of these products at physiological and molecular level. In the current study, an attempt has been made to analyze the chemical modifications that abhrak bhasma possibly goes through in the GI tract. Acidic condition led to prominent changes in the absorbance pattern of the abhrak bhasma. The neutralization of acidic solution led to further modification in the acidified components and a shift in the absorbance pattern was observed. Further analysis revealed that these probable chemical modifications happen to iron related compounds. Additionally the antibacterial and antifungal properties of abhrak bhasma were also studied. No distinct antibacterial property was observed for abhrak bhasma though it inhibited the growth of yeast cells to certain extent. More intense studies, however, are needed for better understanding of the components of abhrak bhasma made available during such physiological action.",

        "abstract": "Abhrakh bhasma is an Ayurvedic medicine widely used for treating several diseases such as; pernicious, sickle cell anemia, Bell\u2019s palsy, hepatic dysfunction, leukemia, sex debility, cystic fibrosis, post encephalic dysfunction and cervical dysplasia etc. An Ayurveda bhasma is a medicine, which is used since ancient time and claimed to be very useful medicine at Nano metric scale. However there is a need of scientific evidence of such Ayurvedic products using modern scientific techniques of 21st century. The physical behavior was measured by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectrometer. Abhrakh bhasma is prepared by using mica as a base materials. X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis revealed that this bhasma is in nanocrystalline form and, can be considered as nanomedicine. Magnetic hysteresis (M~H) loop study by using the VSM reveals the super paramagnetic nature. Luminescence in bhasma was observed in visible region upon excitation of 200 nm laser source. This investigation reveals that, the Abhrakh bhasma may not only used as nanomedicine but also can be employed a materials for various other technological applications due to both magnetic as well as luminescence properties. Preliminary testing of Abhrakh bhasma nanoparticles was examined on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria.",
