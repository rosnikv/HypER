        "abstract": "Recurrence rate is high after operation for Crohn's disease. A multicenter trial was performed to study the effect of radical or nonradical operation and of sulfasalazine prophylaxis versus placebo on postoperative recurrence rate in 232 patients with Crohn's disease. Sixteen medical and surgical centers participated in the study, 7 operating radically and 9 nonradically. The follow-up period lasted 3 years, the allocation to drug treatment was randomized and double blind. Recurrence was significantly less frequent and occurred later in patients who were operated nonradically. Patients on sulfasalazine prophylaxis had a better prognosis than on placebo. This effect was statistically significant in the first 2 years of treatment. Both strategies were additive: nonradical operation and sulfasalazine had the best prognosis, radical operation and placebo was worst. It is concluded that postoperative recurrence is best prevented by resecting nonradically and prescribing 3 g of sulfasalazine daily at least over 2 years.",

        "abstract": "&NA; Mesalamine is an enteric\u2010coated 5\u2010aminosalicylic acid formulation effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and in decreasing the relapse rate in Crohn's disease. However, little data are available regarding its use in children and adolescents. To determine the modalities of use, safety, and the optimal dose in this age group, charts of 153 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with mesalamine were reviewed, representing >150 patient years of use. Among these, more than half of the children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (120 patients) had ileocolonic involvement, and pancolitis predominated in those with ulcerative colitis (33 patients). Patients with ulcerative colitis were diagnosed at a younger age than those with Crohn's disease, and thus mesalamine therapy was initiated earlier. When used as monotherapy, no difference was noted in the average dose used for the treatment of active disease versus maintenance therapy (36 mg/kg/day). However, the average dose used did increase since 1992, for both the treatment of active disease and relapse prevention (43 mg/kg/ day). Overall, 18 patients (11.8%) were withdrawn from mesalamine therapy; however only 8 (5.2%) had objective side effects. Exacerbation of diarrhea was the most common reason for withdrawal. Although reported rarely, no serious adverse reactions such as pancreatitis or hepatic or renal dysfunction were observed. This study suggests that mesalamine is a safe and well\u2010tolerated medication in the long\u2010term treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Mesalazine is a first-line drug in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and is customarily used to induce and maintain remission in mild to moderate disease. In children, pharmacokinetic data are scarce, and dosage recommendations are largely extrapolated from studies in adults. Aim of the study was to obtain the pharmacokinetic profile of a new mesalazine pellet formulation in children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis. A single oral dose of 20 mg/kg mesalazine was administered to 13 patients (age 6\u201316 years). Serial blood and urine sampling for determination of mesalazine and acetylmesalazine was performed before and during 24 hours following ingestion. Maximum plasma concentration of mesalazine (Cmax) was 1332 ng/mL (geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation [CV]: 0.57), obtained 3.7 hours (tmax; CV: 0.31) after drug administration. Systemic exposure as determined by area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0\u2013\u221e ) was 8712 ng/ml*h (CV: 0.44). Terminal half-life of elimination of mesalazine was 3.5 hours (t1/2; CV: 1.43). This study presents extensive pharmacokinetic data on mesalazine in children with mild-moderately active ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis. In comparison with previous experience in adults, pharmacokinetics of mesalazine administered as pellets appear to be similar in both populations.",

        "abstract": "A randomized, 2\u2010way, crossover study was conducted in 30 volunteers to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of a new once\u2010daily dosing regimen of mesalazine (1 \u00d7 4 g/d) with the current twice\u2010daily dosage (2 \u00d7 2 g/d) used in many European countries. The 2 dosages were administrated orally for 8 days, separated by a 2\u2010week washout. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine were determined on days 1 and 8 by a validated high\u2010performance liquid chromatography method and Cmax, tmax, and AUCs calculated. The bioequivalence was obtained for a 90% confidence interval of the AUC0\u201324h ratio (test/reference) for mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine on days 1 and 8, within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. The bioequivalence was demonstrated on day 1 for mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine and on day 8 for mesalazine. As it is desirable to offer patients a preparation with a less frequent administration to enhance compliance, this once\u2010daily regimen may be an attractive dosing option.",

        "abstract": "5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the standard first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. A variety of 5-ASA delivery systems are available and in development, including both oral and rectal formulations; all of which aim to deliver the active drug to the colon while minimizing systemic absorption. Because the efficacy of most oral 5-ASA therapies is broadly similar, the appropriate selection of a given formulation often relies on other factors. This article explores the differences between oral 5-ASA formulations in terms of their delivery system, reviews the available data on oral 5-ASA treatment efficacy and tolerability, and examines the rationale for changing from one 5-ASA formulation to another if a patient does not respond to, or worsens on, their existing agent.",

        "abstract": "While the Western-diet and dysbiosis are the most prominent environmental factors associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the corresponding host factors and cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we report that the TSC1-mTOR pathway in the gut epithelium represents a metabolic and innate immune checkpoint for intestinal dysfunction and inflammation. mTOR hyperactivation triggered by the Western-diet or Tsc1-ablation led to epithelium necroptosis, barrier disruption, and predisposition to DSS (dextran sulfate sodium)-induced colitis and inflammation-associated colon cancer. Mechanistically, our results uncovered a critical role for TSC1-mTOR in restraining the expression and activation of RIPK3 in the gut epithelium through Trim11-mediated ubiquitination and autophagy-dependent degradation. Notably, microbiota-depletion by antibiotics or gnotobiotics attenuated RIPK3 expression and activation, thereby alleviating epithelial necroptosis and colitis driven by mTOR hyperactivation. mTOR primarily impinged on RIPK3 to potentiate TNF- and microbial PAMP-induced necroptosis, and hyperactive mTOR and aberrant necroptosis were intertwined in human IBDs. Together, our data reveal a previously unsuspected link between the Western-diet, microbiota and necroptosis, and identify the mTOR-RIPK3-necroptosis axis as a driving force for intestinal inflammation and cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background: Autophagy, a process of self-digestion, is closely related to multiple biological processes of colon cancer. This study aimed to construct and evaluate prognostic signature of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) to predict overall survival (OS) in colon cancer patients. Materials and Methods: First, a total of 234 ARGs were downloaded via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the TCGA dataset, differentially expressed ARGs were identified in colon cancer. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to screen prognostic ARGs to construct the prognostic model. The feasibility of the prognostic model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier curves. A prognostic model integrating the gene signature with clinical parameters was established with a nomogram. Results: We developed an autophagy risk signature based on the 6 ARGs (ULK3, ATG101, MAP1LC3C, TSC1, DAPK1, and SERPINA1). The risk score was positively correlated with poor outcome and could independently predict prognosis. Furthermore, the autophagy-related signature could effectively reflect the levels of immune cell type fractions and indicate an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Conclusion: We innovatively identified and validated 6 autophagy-related gene signature that can independently predict prognosis and reflect overall immune response intensity in the colon cancer microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Background: The autophagy pathway within the tumour microenvironment can be regulated to inhibit or promote tumour development. In the fight against tumour growth, immunotherapy induces an anti-tumour immune response, whereas autophagy modulates this immune response. A key protein in the autophagy pathway, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3), has recently become a hotspot for tumour research. As a relatively novel member, the function of MAP1LC3C in tumours still need to be investigated. Therefore, the goal of this study was to look into the possible link between MAP1LC3C and immunotherapy for 33 kinds of human malignancies by using pan-cancer analysis. Methods: High-throughput sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia databases, combined with clinical data, were used to analyze the expression of MAP1LC3C in 33 types of cancer, as well as patient prognosis and neoplasm staging. Activity scores were calculated using ssGSEA to assess the MAP1LC3C activity in pan-cancer. Associations between MAP1LC3C and the tumour microenvironment, including immune cell infiltration and immunomodulators, were analyzed. Moreover, tumour tissue ImmuneScores and StromalScores were analyzed using the ESTIMATE algorithm. Additionally, associations between MAP1LC3C and tumour mutational burden/microsatellite instability, were investigated. Finally, based on the expression and structure of MAP1LC3C, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, were screened by virtual screening, molecular docking and NCI-60 drug sensitivity analysis. Results: Our study found that MAP1LC3C was differentially expressed in tumour and normal tissues in 23 of 33 human cancer types, among which MAP1LC3C had prognostic effects in 12 cancer types, and MAP1LC3C expression was significantly correlated with tumour stage in four cancer types. In addition, MAP1LC3C activity in 14 cancer types was consistent with changes in transcription levels. Moreover, MAP1LC3C strongly correlated with immune infiltration, immune modulators and immune markers. Finally, a number of FDA-approved drugs were identified via virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Our study investigated the prognostic and immunotherapeutic value of MAP1LC3C in 33 types of cancer, and several FDA-approved drugs were identified to be highly related to MAP1LC3C and can be potential cancer therapeutic candidates.",
