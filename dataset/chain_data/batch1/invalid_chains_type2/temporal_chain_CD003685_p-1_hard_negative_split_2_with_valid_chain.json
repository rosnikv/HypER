        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEach year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.",

The title was reported with spin in 13 articles (18.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0%-28.9%). Spin was identified in the Results and Conclusions sections of the abstracts of 27 (37.5%; 95% CI, 26.4%-49.7%) and 42 (58.3%; 95% CI, 46.1%-69.8%) reports, respectively, with the conclusions of 17 (23.6%; 95% CI, 14.4%-35.1%) focusing only on treatment effectiveness. Spin was identified in the main-text Results, Discussion, and Conclusions sections of 21 (29.2%; 95% CI, 19.0%-41.1%), 31 (43.1%; 95% CI, 31.4%-55.3%), and 36 (50.0%; 95% CI, 38.0%-62.0%) reports, respectively. More than 40% of the reports had spin in at least 2 of these sections in the main text.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this representative sample of RCTs published in 2006 with statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes, the reporting and interpretation of findings was frequently inconsistent with the results.",

        "abstract": "An extensive and growing number of reviews of the published literature demonstrate that health research publications have frequent deficiencies. Of particular concern are poor reports of randomised trials, which make it difficult or impossible for readers to assess how the research was conducted, to evaluate the reliability of the findings, or to place them in the context of existing research evidence. As a result, published reports of trials often cannot be used by clinicians to inform patient care or to inform public health policy, and the data cannot be included in systematic reviews. Reporting guidelines are designed to identify the key information that researchers should include in a report of their research. We describe the history of reporting guidelines for randomised trials culminating in the CONSORT Statement in 1996. We detail the subsequent development and extension of CONSORT and consider related initiatives aimed at improving the reliability of the medical research literature.

        "abstract": "Many health care performance measures are either not based on high-quality clinical evidence or not tightly linked to patient-centered outcomes, limiting their usefulness in quality improvement. In this report we summarize the proceedings of an American Thoracic Society workshop convened to address this problem by reviewing current approaches to performance measure development and creating a framework for developing high-quality performance measures by basing them directly on recommendations from well-constructed clinical practice guidelines. Workshop participants concluded that ideally performance measures addressing care processes should be linked to clinical practice guidelines that explicitly rate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations, such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process. Under this framework, process-based performance measures would only be developed from strong recommendations based on high- or moderate-quality evidence. This approach would help ensure that clinical processes specified in performance measures are both of clear benefit to patients and supported by strong evidence. Although this approach may result in fewer performance measures, it would substantially increase the likelihood that quality-improvement programs based on these measures actually improve patient care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPulmonary nodules are frequently detected during diagnostic chest imaging and as a result of lung cancer screening. Current guidelines for their evaluation are largely based on low-quality evidence, and patients and clinicians could benefit from more research in this area.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this research statement from the American Thoracic Society, a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates reviewed available evidence for pulmonary nodule evaluation, characterized six focus areas to direct future research efforts, and identified fundamental gaps in knowledge and strategies to address them. We did not use formal mechanisms to prioritize one research area over another or to achieve consensus.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was widespread agreement that novel tests (including novel imaging tests and biopsy techniques, biomarkers, and prognostic models) may improve diagnostic accuracy for identifying cancerous nodules. Before they are used in clinical practice, however, better evidence is needed to show that they improve more distal outcomes of importance to patients. In addition, the pace of research and the quality of clinical care would be improved by the development of registries that link demographic and nodule characteristics with patient-level outcomes. Methods to share data from registries are also necessary.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis statement may help researchers to develop impactful and innovative research projects and enable funders to better judge research proposals. We hope that it will accelerate the pace and increase the efficiency of discovery to improve the quality of care for patients with pulmonary nodules.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nMany patients are diagnosed with small pulmonary nodules for which professional societies recommend subsequent imaging surveillance. Adherence to these guidelines involves many steps from both clinicians and patients but has not been well studied.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nIn a health care setting with a nodule tracking system, we evaluated the association of communication processes and distress with patient and clinician adherence to recommended follow up and Fleischner Society guidelines, respectively.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a prospective, longitudinally assessed, cohort study of patients with incidentally detected nodules who received care at one Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We measured patient-centered communication with the Consultation Care Measure and distress with the Impact of Event Scale. We abstracted data regarding participant adherence to clinician recommendations (defined as receiving the follow-up scan within 30 d of the recommended date) and clinician adherence to Fleischner guidelines (defined as planning the follow-up scan within 30 d of the recommended interval) from the electronic medical record. We measured associations of communication and distress with adherence using multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equations.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAmong 138 veterans, 39% were nonadherent at least once during follow up. Clinicians were nonadherent to Fleischner guidelines for 27% of follow-up scans. High-quality communication (adjusted odds ratio, 3.65; P\u2009=\u20090.02) and distress (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; P\u2009=\u20090.02) were associated with increased and decreased participant adherence, respectively. Neither was associated with clinician adherence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients and clinicians often do not adhere to nodule follow-up recommendations. Interventions designed to improve communication quality and decrease distress may also improve patient adherence to nodule follow-up recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Guidelines for pulmonary nodule evaluation suggest a variety of strategies, reflecting the lack of high\u2010quality evidence demonstrating the superiority of any one approach. It is unclear whether clinicians agree that multiple management options are appropriate at different levels of risk and whether this impacts their decision\u2010making approaches with patients. Objectives: To assess clinicians' perceptions of the appropriateness of various diagnostic strategies, approach to decision\u2010making, and perceived clinical equipoise in pulmonary nodule evaluation. Methods: We developed and administered a web\u2010based survey in March and April, 2014 to clinician members of the American Thoracic Society. The primary outcome was perceived appropriateness of pulmonary nodule evaluation strategies in three clinical vignettes with different malignancy risk. We compared responses to guideline recommendations and analyzed clinician characteristics associated with a reported shared decision\u2010making approach. We also assessed clinicians' likelihood to enroll patients in hypothetical randomized trials comparing nodule evaluation strategies. Results: Of 5,872 American Thoracic Society members e\u2010mailed, 1,444 opened the e\u2010mail and 428 eligible clinicians participated in the survey (response rate, 30.0% among those who opened the invitation; 7% overall). The mean number of options considered appropriate increased with pretest probability of cancer, ranging from 1.8 (SD, 1.2) for the low\u2010risk case to 3.5 (1.1) for the high\u2010risk case (P < 0.0001). As recommended by guidelines, the proportion that deemed surgical resection as an appropriate option also increased with cancer risk (P < 0.0001). One\u2010half of clinicians (50.4%) reported engaging in shared decision\u2010making with patients for pulmonary nodule management; this was more commonly reported by clinicians with more years of experience (P = 0.01) and those who reported greater comfort in managing pulmonary nodules (P = 0.005). Although one\u2010half (49.9%) deemed the evidence for pulmonary nodule evaluation to be strong, most clinicians were willing to enroll patients in randomized trials to compare nodule management strategies in all risk categories (low risk, 87.6%; moderate risk, 89.7%; high risk, 63.0%). Conclusions: Consistent with guideline recommendations, clinicians embrace multiple options for pulmonary nodule evaluation and many are open to shared decision\u2010making. Clinicians support the need for randomized clinical trials to strengthen the evidence for nodule evaluation, which will further improve decision\u2010making.",

        "abstract": "Background\nSeveral classification models based on Western population have been developed to help clinicians to classify the malignancy probability of pulmonary nodules. However, the diagnostic performance of these Western models in Chinese population is unknown. This paper aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of radiologist evaluation of malignancy probability and three classification models (Mayo Clinic, Veterans Affairs, and Brock University) in Chinese clinical pulmonology patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis single-center retrospective study included clinical patients from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital with new, CT-detected pulmonary nodules in 2013. Patients with a nodule with diameter of 4-25 mm, and histological diagnosis or 2-year follow-up were included. Analysis of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and threshold of decision analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiologist diagnosis and the three classification models, with histological diagnosis or 2-year follow-up as the reference.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 277 patients (286 nodules) were included. Two hundred and seven of 286 nodules (72.4%) in 203 patients were malignant. AUC of the Mayo model (0.77; 95% CI: 0.72-0.82) and Brock model (0.77; 95% CI: 0.72-0.82) were similar to radiologist diagnosis (0.78; 95% CI: 0.73-0.83; P=0.68, P=0.71, respectively). The diagnostic performance of the VA model (AUC: 0.66) was significantly lower than that of radiologist diagnosis (P=0.003). A three-class classifying threshold analysis and DCA showed that the radiologist evaluation had higher discriminatory power for malignancy than the three classification models.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a cohort of Chinese clinical pulmonology patients, radiologist evaluation of lung nodule malignancy probability demonstrated higher diagnostic performance than Mayo, Brock, and VA classification models. To optimize nodule diagnosis and management, a new model with more radiological characteristics could be valuable.",

        "title": "Risk assessment of malignancy in solitary pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography: a multivariable predictive model study",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Computed tomography images are easy to misjudge because of their complexity, especially images of solitary pulmonary nodules, of which diagnosis as benign or malignant is extremely important in lung cancer treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more effective strategy in lung cancer diagnosis. In our study, we aimed to externally validate and revise the Mayo model, and a new model was established. Methods: A total of 1450 patients from three centers with solitary pulmonary nodules who underwent surgery were included in the study and were divided into training, internal validation, and external validation sets (n\u200a=\u200a849, 365, and 236, respectively). External verification and recalibration of the Mayo model and establishment of new logistic regression model were performed on the training set. Overall performance of each model was evaluated using area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Finally, the model validation was completed on the validation data set. Results: The AUC of the Mayo model on the training set was 0.653 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.613\u20130.694). After re-estimation of the coefficients of all covariates included in the original Mayo model, the revised Mayo model achieved an AUC of 0.671 (95% CI: 0.635\u20130.706). We then developed a new model that achieved a higher AUC of 0.891 (95% CI: 0.865\u20130.917). It had an AUC of 0.888 (95% CI: 0.842\u20130.934) on the internal validation set, which was significantly higher than that of the revised Mayo model (AUC: 0.577, 95% CI: 0.509\u20130.646) and the Mayo model (AUC: 0.609, 95% CI, 0.544\u20130.675) (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). The AUC of the new model was 0.876 (95% CI: 0.831\u20130.920) on the external verification set, which was higher than the corresponding value of the Mayo model (AUC: 0.705, 95% CI: 0.639\u20130.772) and revised Mayo model (AUC: 0.706, 95% CI: 0.640\u20130.772) (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Then the prediction model was presented as a nomogram, which is easier to generalize. Conclusions: After external verification and recalibration of the Mayo model, the results show that they are not suitable for the prediction of malignant pulmonary nodules in the Chinese population. Therefore, a new model was established by a backward stepwise process. The new model was constructed to rapidly discriminate benign from malignant pulmonary nodules, which could achieve accurate diagnosis of potential patients with lung cancer.",
