        "title": "Fibromyalgia: a complex syndrome requiring a multidisciplinary approach",
        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a pain syndrome which is not due to tissue damage or inflammation and is thus fundamentally different from rheumatic disorders and many other pain conditions. In addition to widespread pain it is associated with a range of other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognitive disturbance, stiffness and depressive symptoms. A number of multidisciplinary therapeutic programmes involving education, exercise and cognitive therapy have been shown to be effective in bringing relief. The various medications that are currently being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia are based on different mechanistic approaches. In particular, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) such as duloxetine and milnacipran and \u03b12\u2010\u03b4 receptor ligands such as pregabalin have been shown, in a variety of placebo\u2010controlled studies, to bring significant relief from pain and other symptoms. The complex symptomatology of fibromyalgia will, however, continue to require a multidisciplinary approach including education and exercise in addition to drug therapy to achieve the most efficient management of fibromyalgia.

        "title": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia improves attentional function in fibromyalgia syndrome: A pilot, randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "This pilot, randomized controlled trial analyzed the effects of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 20) for insomnia vs a sleep hygiene (SH, n = 20) program on the three attentional networks (alertness, orienting, and executive function) and other additional outcome measures (sleep, pain, depression, anxiety, and daily functioning) of fibromyalgia patients. The CBT group showed significant improvement in alertness (F(1, 28) = 11.84, p = .0018), executive functioning (F(1, 28) = 15.76, p = .00059), sleep quality ( F(1, 38) = 6.33, p = .016), and a trend to improvement in daily functioning (p > .06), as compared with the SH group. The improvement in executive functioning was significantly related to the changes in sleep (r = 0.40, p = .026). A CBT for insomnia represents a useful intervention in fibromyalgia patients not only regarding sleep disturbance but also attentional dysfunction and probably daily functioning.",

        "title": "The Impact of Pain on Anxiety and Depression is Mediated by Objective and Subjective Sleep Characteristics in Fibromyalgia Patients",
        "abstract": "Objectives:Pain is the cardinal feature in fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) and increases the risk of anxiety and depression. Patients with FM frequently report sleep disturbances as well. Sleep may mediate the association between pain and emotional symptoms, an idea which has been scarcely studied. The objective of this study was to uncover the role of subjective and objective sleep characteristics as mediators of the relationship between pain and anxiety and depression in FM. Materials and Methods:Fifty-five female with FM (mean age, 47.62\u00b17.64 y) were assessed to obtain self-reported measures of pain, sleep quality, anxiety and depression levels, and self-efficacy to cope with pain. An ambulatory polysomnographic recording was performed to assess sleep architecture. Results:Subjective poor sleep quality was found in all participtants. Pain correlated with subjective and objective sleep parameters, self-efficacy, anxiety, and, marginally, with depression. The mediated regression analysis suggested that the best models to explain the impact of pain on anxiety and depression included, as mediators, subjective sleep quality, objective sleep efficiency, and self-efficacy (these models explained 34% of the variance), with objective sleep efficiency being the mediator with the highest influence (P<0.05). Discussion:These findings show a high prevalence of sleep problems in individuals with FM and suggest that they play a role in the relationship between pain and anxiety and depression. In fact, the impact of chronic pain on the later emotional variables was mediated not only by self-efficacy but also by subjective sleep quality and, especially, by objective sleep efficiency.",

        "title": "Sleep quality and facial pain in fibromyalgia syndrome",
        "abstract": "Abstract Aims: This study aims to evaluate the sleep conditions in fibromyalgia syndrome and the influence of the temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and fibromyalgia association in self-reported sleep quality. Methodology: Forty female patients with fibromyalgia (FMS) were compared with 40 healthy women [control group (CG)]. Three questionnaires were used (i.e. RDC/TMD to diagnose TMD and to determine pain intensity and disability and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess sleep conditions). Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test to ordinal variables, Student\u2019s t-test to obtain the quantitative total scores of PSQI and chronic pain classification, Spearman\u2019s rho to determine the correlation between facial pain and quality sleep, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for other variables. Results: A moderate correlation between facial pain intensity and low sleep quality was found (rho\u200a=\u200a0\u00b756; P<0\u00b70001); however, TMD and FMS association did not show worse sleep quality (P>0\u00b705). Excessive daytime sleepiness was more prevalent in FMS (37\u00b75%; P<0\u00b70001) besides having the worst sleep quality (PSQI\u200a=\u200a12\u00b772) compared with CG (PSQI\u200a=\u200a4\u00b762). Conclusion: Fibromyalgia patients experience intense facial pain in addition to poor sleep and high disabilities. TMD and FMS association do not appear to worsen this condition; however, facial pain intensity was correlated with low sleep quality.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate sleep quality in the patients with fibromyalgia (FM), to determine the association of sleep disorders with disease severity, tender point count, severity of pain, fatigue and depression and as well as to assess the impact of poor sleep quality on quality of life. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 FM patients and 70 age and sex-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used for determining disease severity. Quality of life was evaluated by using Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and severity of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results: FM patients scored significantly higher in all subgroups of PSQI when compared with the controls (p< 0.01). PSQI was correlated with FIQ, tender point count, VAS, and pain and sleep subgroups of NHP (p< 0.05). Emotional reaction subgroup of NHP was correlated with all PSQI subgroups except sleep latency and use of sleep medicine (p< 0.01). No statistically significant correlation was foundbetween PSQI and social isolation, energy and physical mobility subgroups of NHP (p> 0.05). FSS was correlated with sleep disturbance subgroup of PSQI (p< 0.05). BDS scores were correlated with sleep disturbance and global scores of PSQI (p< 0.05). Conclusion: FM patients have poor sleep quality when compared to healthy controls. Sleep quality is associated with disease severity, pain, depression and fatigue and it has a negative impact on quality of life in FM patients.",

Both groups filled out Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte count, MPV, and PDW values were recorded from full blood count. \nResults: Although NLR was higher in the patient group, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05).
