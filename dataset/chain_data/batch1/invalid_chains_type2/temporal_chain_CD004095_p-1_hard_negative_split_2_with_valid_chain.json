        "abstract": "1. A prospective randomized study of two dietary regimens has been started in newly-diagnosed diabetics to determine their effect on circulating metabolites and on diabetic complications. 2. During the first year of treatment the fasting plasma glucose concentrations on both the low-carbohydrate diet and the high-carbohydrate, modified-fat (MF) diet showed a similar decrease. 3. Plasma cholesterol showed a sustained decrease only in patients recommended a MF diet. Transient changes in plasma triglyceride concentrations occurred in patients on both dietary regimens. 4. Increased plasma cholesterol levels are associated with atheromatous disease which is common in diabetics in Europe and North America. A MF diet may therefore have an advantage in that it lowers the plasma cholesterol as well as being effective in lowering the plasma glucose.",

The source paper also investigates the effect of dietary advice on diabetes treatment, but the connection between the two papers is not direct.

        "title": "Dietary Patterns and Dietary Recommendations Achievement From Latin American College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the diet quality of different dietary patterns among college students from Latin American countries, including vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study was conducted including a non- probabilistic sample of university students from 10 countries. University students were invited to participate in the study through social network platforms. Participants were self-reported to have followed a specific dietary pattern; either the Prudent diet, Western diet, Ovo-dairy-vegetarian diet, Fish-vegetarian diet, Strict vegetarian diet (vegan) or other. The last three patterns (vegetarians and vegans) were grouped as following a plant-based diet. A self-assessment survey was used to evaluate healthy eating habits using a questionnaire with values between 1 (do not consume) and 5 (consume) for a total of 9\u201345 points (higher values represent better eating habits). Unhealthy habits were assessed with nine questions. A total of 4,809 students filled out the questionnaire, and the majority of them were females (73.7%). A high percentage have been in lockdown for more than 5 months and were in lockdown when the survey was released. 74.3% were self-reported to follow a prudent diet, while 11.4% reported following a western dietary pattern and 8.8% a plant-based diet. When compliance with healthy and unhealthy dietary habits was analyzed, although all groups had low compliance, the plant-based diet group (56.09 \u00b1 6.11) performed better than the Western diet group (48.03 \u00b1 5.99). The total diet quality score was significantly higher for plant-based diet followers, who also tended to better achieve the recommendations than omnivorous students, especially the ones following a western diet. These results present evidence that young adults such as college-aged students have unhealthy dietary habits. However, the ones who follow a plant-based diet such as vegetarians and vegans exhibit better scores and healthier dietary conducts.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the source paper's findings regarding the 'Prudent diet', as it investigates the adherence to this diet among college students. The source paper provides the foundation for the 'Prudent diet' concept, which is then applied and evaluated in this study."

        "title": "Comparison of Consumption of Pulses in Two Seasons of the Year in Chile",
        "abstract": "Background: In Chile, the consumption of legumes at least two times per week is promoted. However, there is a low consumption of legumes. Therefore, our objective is to describe legume consumption in two different seasonal periods. Methods: Serial cross-sectional study: surveys were distributed during summer and winter using different digital platforms. Frequency of consumption, purchase access, and preparation type were investigated. Results: In total, 3280 adults were surveyed in summer and 3339 in winter. The mean age was 33 years. Totals of 97.7% and 97.5% of the population reported consuming legumes in both periods; consumption increased to 3 times per week during winter. In both periods, the main reason for their preference is that they are delicious and nutritious, followed by their use as a meat substitute; the main barriers to their consumption in both periods are that they are expensive (29% in summer and 27.8% in winter) and difficult to prepare. Conclusion: A good consumption of legumes was observed, but with a higher frequency of consumption during winter, with an intake of \u22651 per day; additionally, differences were found in purchases according to season, although no differences were found in the method of preparation.",

        "title": "The importance of enjoyment, sensory properties and perceived cooking abilities in legume and pulse consumption: a questionnaire study",
        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Legume and pulse consumption is currently recommended for health and sustainability purposes, but barriers to consumption can include low enjoyment and poor sensory properties. This work aimed to investigate the relative importance of a number of barriers and facilitators towards legume, including pulse, consumption with a specific focus on enjoyment, sensory properties and a possible role for perceived cooking abilities in these relationships. Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire study assessed legume and pulse consumption, agreement and disagreement with statements relating to enjoyment, sensory properties, cooking abilities, practical aspects, healthiness, upbringing, social influences and quality issues, and four demographic characteristics. Complete responses were gained from 633 respondents with a mix of genders, ages, usual cooking responsibilities and usual eating habits. Setting: UK, March 2021 \u2013 September 2022. Participants: General UK adult population. Results: Using multiple regression analyses, enjoyment and cooking abilities were found to be important for both legume and pulse consumption (smallest beta = 0\u00b7165, P < 0\u00b701), and the sensory properties of these foods were also important for the consumption of pulses (beta = 0\u00b7099, P = 0\u00b704). Perceived cooking abilities also reduced the importance of enjoyment and sensory properties for consumption, mitigated effects due to upbringing and practical aspects and increased the value of perceived health benefits (smallest beta = 0\u00b7094, P = 0\u00b704). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate a clear role for enjoyment, sensory properties and perceived cooking abilities in legume and pulse consumption and suggest benefits for increasing cooking abilities for improved legume and pulse consumption, as result of both direct and indirect effects.",
