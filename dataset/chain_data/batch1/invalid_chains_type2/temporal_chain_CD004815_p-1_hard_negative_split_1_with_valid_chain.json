        "title": "Comparison of early invasive and conservative strategies in patients with unstable coronary syndromes treated with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is continued debate as to whether a routine, early invasive strategy is superior to a conservative strategy for the management of unstable angina and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 2220 patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation who had electrocardiographic evidence of changes in the ST segment or T wave, elevated levels of cardiac markers, a history of coronary artery disease, or all three findings. All patients were treated with aspirin, heparin, and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban. They were randomly assigned to an early invasive strategy, which included routine catheterization within 4 to 48 hours and revascularization as appropriate, or to a more conservative (selectively invasive) strategy, in which catheterization was performed only if the patient had objective evidence of recurrent ischemia or an abnormal stress test. The primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome at six months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt six months, the rate of the primary end point was 15.9 percent with use of the early invasive strategy and 19.4 percent with use of the conservative strategy (odds ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.97; P=0.025). The rate of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at six months was similarly reduced (7.3 percent vs. 9.5 percent; odds ratio, 0.74; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 1.00; P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation who were treated with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban, the use of an early invasive strategy significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiac events. These data support a policy involving broader use of the early inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in combination with an early invasive strategy in such patients.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Current pharmacotherapeutic options for high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients include aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. A key issue of uncertainty is the safety and efficacy of combination glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. Methods and Results\u2014We randomized 746 patients with rest ischemic discomfort within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms and ST-segment deviation and/or elevation of serum cardiac markers to receive open-label enoxaparin (1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily) or unfractionated heparin (70-U/kg bolus; 15 U \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 h\u22121 infusion, titrated to an activated partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 2 times control) for 48 hours. All patients received aspirin and eptifibatide (180-&mgr;g/kg bolus; 2 &mgr;g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 infusion). Major non-coronary artery bypass surgery-related bleeding at 96 hours (primary safety outcome) was significantly lower among enoxaparin-treated patients than among heparin-treated patients (1.8% versus 4.6%, P =0.03). Minor bleeding was more frequent in the enoxaparin group (30.3% versus 20.8%, P =0.003). Patients in the enoxaparin group were less likely to experience ischemia as detected by continuous ECG evaluation (primary efficacy outcome) during the initial (14.3% versus 25.4%, P =0.0002) and subsequent (12.7% versus 25.9%, P <0.0001) 48-hour monitoring periods. Death or myocardial infarction at 30 days was significantly lower in the enoxaparin group (5% versus 9%, P =0.031). Conclusions\u2014When aspirin and eptifibatide are used in high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients, enoxaparin improves outcomes (determined on the basis of better safety and efficacy) compared with currently recommended unfractionated heparin therapy and provides a useful novel alternative therapeutic strategy.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nEnoxaparin has demonstrated advantages over unfractionated heparin in low- to moderate-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) treated with a conservative strategy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo compare the outcomes of patients treated with enoxaparin vs unfractionated heparin and to define the role of enoxaparin in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS at high risk for ischemic cardiac complications managed with an early invasive approach.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors (SYNERGY) trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international trial conducted between August 2001 and December 2003. A total of 10 027 high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS to be treated with an intended early invasive strategy were recruited.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nSubcutaneous enoxaparin (n = 4993) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (n = 4985) was to be administered immediately after enrollment and continued until the patient required no further anticoagulation, as judged by the treating physician.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy outcome was the composite clinical end point of all-cause death or nonfatal myocardial infarction during the first 30 days after randomization. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding or stroke.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point occurred in 14.0% (696/4993) of patients assigned to enoxaparin and 14.5% (722/4985) of patients assigned to unfractionated heparin (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.06). No differences in ischemic events during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were observed between enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin groups, respectively, including similar rates of abrupt closure (31/2321 [1.3%] vs 40/2364 [1.7%]), threatened abrupt closure (25/2321 [1.1%] vs 24/2363 [1.0%]), unsuccessful PCI (81/2281 [3.6%] vs 79/2328 [3.4%]), or emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery (6/2323 [0.3%] vs 8/2363 [0.3%]). More bleeding was observed with enoxaparin, with a statistically significant increase in TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding (9.1% vs 7.6%, P =.008) but nonsignificant excess in GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Arteries) severe bleeding (2.7% vs 2.2%, P =.08) and transfusions (17.0% vs 16.0%, P =.16).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnoxaparin was not superior to unfractionated heparin but was noninferior for the treatment of high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Enoxaparin is a safe and effective alternative to unfractionated heparin and the advantages of convenience should be balanced with the modest excess of major bleeding.",

        "abstract": "This is the second part of a 2-part article that presents a critical and comprehensive update of the current evidence for a cardiovascular disease (CVD) continuum based on the results of pathophysiological studies and the outcome of a broad range of clinical trials that have been performed in the past 15 years. In part I, we reviewed the current understanding of CVD pathophysiology and discussed data from clinical trials on subjects ranging from risk factors for disease through stable coronary artery disease (CAD). The present article continues the review of clinical trials, beginning with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and continuing through extension of the concept of the CVD continuum to include stroke and renal disease. The article concludes with a discussion of areas in which future research might further clarify our understanding of the CVD continuum.\n\nACS represent a spectrum of events ranging from unstable angina (UA) and non\u2013ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). ACS events are frequently the consequence of thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Intervention at this point in the CVD continuum clearly interrupts disease progression by preventing cardiac muscle death, decreasing the risk of a recurrent ischemic event, slowing progression to heart failure, and reducing mortality. Patients presenting with an ACS must receive prompt treatment to prevent ischemic complications; optimal management includes anti-ischemic therapy (eg, supplemental oxygen, nitroglycerin, and \u03b2-blocker), antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, or platelet glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitor), antithrombotic therapy (unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]), and the use of invasive reperfusion procedures (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]). For STEMI patients, optimal therapy also includes fibrinolytic agents to restore blood flow in the occluded coronary artery.\n\n### Treatment of UA/NSTEMI\n\nUA and NSTEMI are considered closely related conditions and may be indistinguishable in their early stages in \u2026",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is understood as a continuum; risk factors induce a pathophysiologic cascade that culminates in end-organ failure. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) influences multiple aspects of the pathophysiology via hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic effects. Many long-term clinical trials provide overwhelming evidence of benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) across the cardiovascular continuum, including benefits regarding hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal disease, and heart failure. Trials also indicate additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy in renal disease and heart failure, a possibility supported by the basic biochemistry of the agents. Discussion of these trials is included in part 1 of this 2-part review. Part 2 of the review will discuss the extensive interaction of the RAS with the cellular and molecular pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and the cross-continuum effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors, which raise the possibility that RAS inhibition can offer protection in high-risk patients who do not have symptoms. The benefits of combined ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy in high-risk patients await confirmation; ongoing clinical research in this area will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "The intraorgan renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases and has been implicated in fibrogenesis. The role of RAS in the development of chronic pancreatitis is not well established. The blockade of RAS in rat models with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) blockers (ARBs) mostly have reduced pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis with a few exceptions. At the same time, the use of ACEi and ARBs in humans is associated with a modest risk of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of the AT1 signaling pathway in the development of pancreatitis using AT1a- and AT1b-deficient mice as well as the ARB losartan. Chronic pancreatitis was induced by repetitive cerulein administration in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and AT1a- and AT1b-deficient mice (AT1a-/- and AT1b-/-), and pancreatic injury was assessed at day 10. Pancreatic weight of cerulein treated groups was significantly reduced. There was severe parenchymal atrophy and fibrosis assessed by histological examination. Fibrosis was accompanied by activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) evaluated by Western blot analysis for alpha-smooth muscle actin. No differences were seen between cerulein-treated WT, AT1a-/- , AT1b-/- mice, or losartan treated-WT mice with regards to morphological or molecular alterations induced by cerulein. Our results demonstrate that AT1a and AT1b receptor pathways do not seem to be essential for the development of pancreatitis in the mouse model of pancreatitis induced by repetitive cerulein injury.",

        "title": "Involvement of Angiotensin II and Reactive Oxygen Species in Pancreatic Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancers often develop in the context of pancreatic fibrosis caused by chronic pancreas inflammation, which also results in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pancreatic parenchymal cell death, and stellate cell activation. Angiotensin II, which is converted from angiotensin I by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), stimulates ROS production via NADPH oxidase. In stellate cells, angiotensin II activates the stress-activated protein kinase p38. However, the molecular mechanism by which angiotensin II regulates pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis remains to be determined. Methods: Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) rats spontaneously develop chronic pancreatic inflammation. To examine whether blockade of the renin-angiotensin system affects the development of pancreatic fibrosis, WBN/Kob rats were given angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker or ACE inhibitor (ACEI). Next, we assessed the role of angiotensin II and its possible downstream target p38\u03b1 in stellate cell activation using primary stellate cells. Results: Treatment with AT1R blocker and ACEI prevented the development of chronic pancreatitis and fibrosis. In stellate cells, angiotensin II upregulated the expression of angiotensin II receptors, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. In addition, p38\u03b1 was found to be essential to collagen type I production and \u03b1-SMA expression. ROS accumulation is enhanced in chronic pancreatic inflammation, which increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. Conclusions: Inhibition of the angiotensin II signaling pathway might be a promising strategy to prevent pancreatic fibrogenesis and subsequent carcinogenesis.",

Increasing evidence indicate that the interaction between activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and PDAC cells plays an important role in the development of PDAC. By producing high levels of cytokines, chemotactic factors, growth factors and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM), PSCs create desmoplasia and a hypoxic microenvironment that promote the initiation, development, evasion of immune surveillance, invasion, metastasis and resistance to chemoradiation of PDAC. Therefore, targeting the interaction between PSCs and PDAC cells may represent a novel therapeutic approach to advanced PDAC, especially therapies that target PSCs of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Pancreatic cancer is characterized by stromal desmoplasia and perineural invasion (PNI). We sought to explore the contribution of pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) activated by paracrine Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in pancreatic cancer PNI and progression. Experimental Design: In this study, the expression dynamics of SHH were examined via immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis in a cohort of carcinomatous and nonneoplastic pancreatic tissues and cells. A series of in vivo and in vitro assays was performed to elucidate the contribution of PSCs activated by paracrine SHH signaling in pancreatic cancer PNI and progression. Results: We show that SHH overexpression in tumor cells is involved in PNI in pancreatic cancer and is an important marker of biologic activity of pancreatic cancer. Moreover, the overexpression of SHH in tumor cells activates the hedgehog pathway in PSCs in the stroma instead of activating tumor cells. These activated PSCs are essential for the promotion of pancreatic cancer cell migration along nerve axons and nerve outgrowth to pancreatic cancer cell colonies in an in vitro three-dimensional model of nerve invasion in cancer. Furthermore, the coimplantation of PSCs activated by paracrine SHH induced tumor cell invasion of the trunk and nerve dysfunction along sciatic nerves and also promoted orthotropic xenograft tumor growth, metastasis, and PNI in in vivo models. Conclusions: These results establish that stromal PSCs activated by SHH paracrine signaling in pancreatic cancer cells secrete high levels of PNI-associated molecules to promote PNI in pancreatic cancer.

        "abstract": "The poor clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer (PC) is largely attributed to its aggressive nature and refractoriness to currently available therapeutic modalities. We previously reported antitumor efficacy of honokiol (HNK), a phytochemical isolated from various parts of Magnolia plant, against PC cells in short-term in vitro growth assays. Here, we report that HNK reduces plating efficiency and anchorage-independent growth of PC cells and suppresses their migration and invasiveness. Furthermore, significant inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth by HNK is observed in orthotopic mouse model along with complete-blockage of distant metastases. Histological examination suggests reduced desmoplasia in tumors from HNK-treated mice, later confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses of myofibroblast and extracellular matrix marker proteins (\u03b1-SMA and collagen I, respectively). At the molecular level, HNK treatment leads to decreased expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and CXCR4, two established mediators of bidirectional tumor-stromal cross-talk, both in vitro and in vivo . We also show that the conditioned media (CM) from HNK-treated PC cells have little growth-inducing effect on pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) that could be regained by the addition of exogenous recombinant SHH. Moreover, pretreatment of CM of vehicle-treated PC cells with SHH-neutralizing antibody abolishes their growth-inducing potential on PSCs. Likewise, HNK-treated PC cells respond poorly to CM from PSCs due to decreased CXCR4 expression. Lastly, we show that the transfection of PC cells with constitutively active IKK\u03b2 mutant reverses the suppressive effect of HNK on nuclear factor-kappaB activation and partially restores CXCR4 and SHH expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that HNK interferes with tumor-stromal cross-talk via downregulation of CXCR4 and SHH and decreases pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Doxorubicin is the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for a wide variety of cancers, and cardiotoxicity is one of the major side effects of doxorubicin treatment. One of the main cellular targets of doxorubicin in the heart is mitochondria. Mitochondrial sirtuin, SIRT3 has been shown to protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. We have recently identified honokiol (HKL) as an activator of SIRT3, which protects the heart from developing pressure overload hypertrophy. Here, we show that HKL-mediated activation of SIRT3 also protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage without compromising the tumor killing potential of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with increased ROS production and consequent fragmentation of mitochondria and cell death. HKL-mediated activation of SIRT3 prevented Doxorubicin induced ROS production, mitochondrial damage and cell death in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. HKL also promoted mitochondrial fusion. We also show that treatment with HKL blocked doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in mice. This was associated with reduced mitochondrial DNA damage and improved mitochondrial function. Furthermore, treatments of mice, bearing prostrate tumor-xenografts, with HKL and doxorubicin showed inhibition of tumor growth with significantly reduced cardiac toxicity. Our results suggest that HKL-mediated activation of SIRT3 protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and represents a potentially novel adjunct for chemotherapy treatments.",

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Rationale: Hypertension represents a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure and affects 30% of the adult population. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to hypertension, but specific mechanisms are unclear. The mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 (Sirtuin 3) is critical in the regulation of metabolic and antioxidant functions which are associated with hypertension, and cardiovascular disease risk factors diminish Sirt3 level. Objective: We hypothesized that reduced Sirt3 expression contributes to vascular dysfunction in hypertension, but increased Sirt3 protects vascular function and decreases hypertension. Methods and Results: To test the therapeutic potential of targeting Sirt3 expression, we developed new transgenic mice with global Sirt3OX (Sirt3 overexpression), which protects from endothelial dysfunction, vascular oxidative stress, and hypertrophy and attenuates Ang II (angiotensin II) and deoxycorticosterone acetate\u2013salt induced hypertension. Global Sirt3 depletion in Sirt3\u2212/\u2212 mice results in oxidative stress due to hyperacetylation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), increases HIF1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1), reduces endothelial cadherin, stimulates vascular hypertrophy, increases vascular permeability and vascular inflammation (p65, caspase 1, VCAM [vascular cell adhesion molecule-1], ICAM [intercellular adhesion molecule-1], and MCP1 [monocyte chemoattractant protein 1]), increases inflammatory cell infiltration in the kidney, reduces telomerase expression, and accelerates vascular senescence and age-dependent hypertension; conversely, increased Sirt3 expression in Sirt3OX mice prevents these deleterious effects. The clinical relevance of Sirt3 depletion was confirmed in arterioles from human mediastinal fat in patients with essential hypertension showing a 40% decrease in vascular Sirt3, coupled with Sirt3-dependent 3-fold increases in SOD2 acetylation, NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity, VCAM, ICAM, and MCP1 levels in hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive subjects. Conclusions: We suggest that Sirt3 depletion in hypertension promotes endothelial dysfunction, vascular hypertrophy, vascular inflammation, and end-organ damage.

Overexpression of SirT3 activated the AMPK pathway and improved mitochondrial biogenesis, which is required to sustain mitochondrial redox balance, maintain mitochondrial respiration, and suppress mitochondrial apoptosis. Inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis abolished SirT3/AMPK-induced cardioprotection by causing mitochondrial damage. These findings indicate that SirT3 reduces sepsis-induced myocardial injury by activating AMPK-related mitochondrial biogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein deacylases involved in metabolic regulation and aging-related diseases. Specific activators for seven human Sirtuin isoforms would be important chemical tools and potential therapeutic drugs. Activators have been described for Sirt1 and act via a unique N-terminal domain of this isoform. For most other Sirtuin isoforms, including mitochondrial Sirt3-5, no potent and specific activators have yet been identified. We here describe the identification and characterization of 1,4-dihydropyridine-based compounds that either act as pan Sirtuin activators or specifically stimulate Sirt3 or Sirt5. The activators bind to the Sirtuin catalytic cores independent of NAD+ and acylated peptides and stimulate turnover of peptide and protein substrates. The compounds also activate Sirt3 or Sirt5 in cellular systems regulating, e.g., apoptosis and electron transport chain. Our results provide a scaffold for potent Sirtuin activation and derivatives specific for Sirt3 and Sirt5 as an excellent basis for further drug development.",

        "title": "SIRT3 Activation a Promise in Drug Development? New Insights into SIRT3 Biology and Its Implications on the Drug Discovery Process",
        "abstract": "Sirtuins catalyze deacetylation of lysine residues with a NAD+-dependent mechanism. In mammals, the sirtuin family is composed of seven members, divided into four subclasses that differ in substrate specificity, subcellular localization, regulation, as well as interactions with other proteins, both within and outside the epigenetic field. Recently, much interest has been growing in SIRT3, which is mainly involved in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, SIRT3 seems to be protective in diseases such as age-related, neurodegenerative, liver, kidney, heart, and metabolic ones, as well as in cancer. In most cases, activating SIRT3 could be a promising strategy to tackle these health problems. Here, we summarize the main biological functions, substrates, and interactors of SIRT3, as well as several molecules reported in the literature that are able to modulate SIRT3 activity. Among the activators, some derive from natural products, others from library screening, and others from the classical medicinal chemistry approach.",
