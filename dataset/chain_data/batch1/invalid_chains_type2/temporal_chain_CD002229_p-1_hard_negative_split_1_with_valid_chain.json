        "title": "Randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) Research Group.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nObservational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nEither 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the long term effect of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in recently postmenopausal women. Design Open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Denmark, 1990-93. Participants 1006 healthy women aged 45-58 who were recently postmenopausal or had perimenopausal symptoms in combination with recorded postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone values. 502 women were randomly allocated to receive hormone replacement therapy and 504 to receive no treatment (control). Women who had undergone hysterectomy were included if they were aged 45-52 and had recorded values for postmenopausal serum follicle stimulating hormone. Interventions In the treatment group, women with an intact uterus were treated with triphasic estradiol and norethisterone acetate and women who had undergone hysterectomy received 2 mg estradiol a day. Intervention was stopped after about 11 years owing to adverse reports from other trials, but participants were followed for death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer for up to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses were carried out on women who took more than 80% of the prescribed treatment for five years. Main outcome measure The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to hospital for heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Results At inclusion the women on average were aged 50 and had been postmenopausal for seven months. After 10 years of intervention, 16 women in the treatment group experienced the primary composite endpoint compared with 33 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.87; P=0.015) and 15 died compared with 26 (0.57, 0.30 to 1.08; P=0.084). The reduction in cardiovascular events was not associated with an increase in any cancer (36 in treated group v 39 in control group, 0.92, 0.58 to 1.45; P=0.71) or in breast cancer (10 in treated group v 17 in control group, 0.58, 0.27 to 1.27; P=0.17). The hazard ratio for deep vein thrombosis (2 in treated group v 1 in control group) was 2.01 (0.18 to 22.16) and for stroke (11 in treated group v 14 in control group) was 0.77 (0.35 to 1.70). After 16 years the reduction in the primary composite outcome was still present and not associated with an increase in any cancer. Conclusions After 10 years of randomised treatment, women receiving hormone replacement therapy early after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of mortality, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke.

        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe usefulness of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in preventing oxidative stress associated with menopause is controversial. We aimed to study if there is a critical time window for effective treatment of the effects of ovariectomy with estrogens at the molecular, metabolic, and cellular level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur main finding is that early, but not late onset of ERT prevents an ovariectomy-associated increase in mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide levels, oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and a decrease in glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity in rats. This may be due to a change in the estrogen receptor (ER) expression profile: ovariectomy increases the ER \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio and immediate estrogen replacement prevents it. Positron emission tomography analysis shows that ovariectomy decreases the brain glucose uptake in vivo and that estrogen administration is beneficial, but only if administered immediately after deprivation. Ovariectomy decreases GLUT-1 and 3 glucose transporters in the brain, and only early onset estrogen administration prevents it. Plasma from rats treated with estrogens immediately after ovariectomy show similar metabolomics profiles as controls.\n\n\nINNOVATION\nWe provide molecular basis for the recommendation of early onset ERT and explain its lack of effectiveness if a significant time period elapses after ovariectomy and probably after the onset of menopause.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOnly early, but not late onset administration of estrogens after ovariectomy has beneficial effects at molecular levels on oxidative stress, brain glucose uptake, and metabolomic profiles.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nInefficient fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and increased oxidative damage are features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In rodent models and patients with NAFLD, hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPARG) coactivator 1\u03b1\u00a0(PPARGC1A or PGC1A) is inversely correlated with liver fat and disease severity. A common polymorphism in this gene (rs8192678, encoding Gly482Ser) has been associated with NAFLD. We investigated whether reduced expression of PGC1A contributes to development of NAFLD using mouse models, primary hepatocytes, and human cell lines.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHepG2 cells were transfected with variants of PPARGC1A and protein and messenger RNA levels were measured. Mice with liver-specific hemizygous or homozygous disruption of Ppargc1a (Ppargc1af/+Alb-cre+/0 and Ppargc1af/f Alb-cre+/0 mice, respectively) were fed regular chow (control) or a high-fat diet supplemented with 30% d-fructose in drinking water (obesogenic diet) for 25-33 weeks. Liver tissues were analyzed by histology and by immunoblotting. Primary hepatocytes were analyzed for insulin signaling, reactive oxygen species, and estrogen response. Luciferase reporter expression was measured in transfected H2.35 cells expressing an estrogen receptor reporter gene, estrogen receptor 1, and/or PGC1A/B.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe serine 482 variant of the human PGC1A protein had a shorter half-life than the glycine 482 variant when expressed in HepG2 cells. Liver tissues from mice with liver-specific hemizygous disruption of Ppargc1a placed on an obesogenic diet expressed increased markers of inflammation and fibrosis and decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes compared with the Ppargc1a+/+ on the same diet. Oxidative damage was observed in livers from Ppargc1af/+Alb-cre+/0 mice of each sex, in a cell-autonomous manner, but was greater in\u00a0livers from the female mice. Expression of PGC1A in H2.35 cells coactivated estrogen receptor 1 and was required for estrogen-dependent expression of genes that encode antioxidant proteins. These findings could account for the increased liver damage observed in female Ppargc1af/+Alb-cre+/0 mice; while, compensatory increases in PPARG coactivator 1\u03b2 could prevent oxidative damage associated with complete loss of PGC1A expression in Ppargc1af/fAlb-cre+/0 female mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn mice, loss of estrogen signaling contributes to oxidative damage caused by low levels of PGC1A in liver, exacerbating steatohepatitis associated with diets high in fructose and fat.",

        "title": "PGC1A regulates the IRS1:IRS2 ratio during fasting to influence hepatic metabolism downstream of insulin",
        "abstract": "Significance The liver plays crucial roles in the control of glucose homeostasis during the fast-feeding cycle. It responds to insulin and glucagon to either store or provide glucose to other organs. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Associations have been made between low hepatic levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) and hepatic insulin resistance, but underlying mechanisms are elusive. We show that PGC1A controls the hepatic ratio of Insulin Receptor Substrates 1 (IRS1) and IRS2 expression, crucial for defining the precise insulin signal in hepatocytes to respond to fasting and feeding. Importantly, PGC1A is key for insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Precise modulation of hepatic glucose metabolism is crucial during the fasting and feeding cycle and is controlled by the actions of circulating insulin and glucagon. The insulin-signaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, which are found to be dysregulated in diabetes and obesity. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) is a fasting-induced transcriptional coactivator. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes, low hepatic PGC1A levels are associated with insulin resistance. However, how PGC1A activity impacts the hepatic insulin-signaling pathway is still unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function models in mouse primary hepatocytes and measured hepatocyte insulin response by gene and protein expression and ex vivo glucose production. We found that the PGC1A level determines the relative ratio of IRS1 and IRS2 in hepatocytes, impacting insulin receptor signaling via protein kinase B/AKT (AKT). PGC1A drove the expression of IRS2 downstream of glucagon signaling while simultaneously reducing IRS1 expression. We illustrate that glucagon- or PGC1A-induced IRS2 expression was dependent on cAMP Response Element Binding Protein activity and that this was essential for suppression of hepatocyte gluconeogenesis in response to insulin in vitro. We also show that increased hepatic PGC1A improves glucose homeostasis in vivo, revealing a counterregulatory role for PGC1A in repressing uncontrolled glucose production in response to insulin signaling. These data highlight a mechanism by which PGC1A plays dual roles in the control of gluconeogenesis during the fasting-to-fed transition through regulated balance between IRS1 and IRS2 expression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Context Berberine is an alkaloid that possesses various pharmacologic effects. Objective To explore the mechanism of berberine to improve insulin sensitivity in fructose-fed mice. Materials and methods Sixty male ICR mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (10 mice in each group): control, fructose, pioglitazone (10\u2009mg/kg) and berberine (50, 100, and 200\u2009mg/kg). Except for the control group, the mice received 20% fructose drinking for 10\u2009weeks. Pioglitazone and berberine were orally administered once daily during the last 4\u2009weeks. The insulin sensitivity was evaluated using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The serum levels of fasting glucose and insulin, blood lipids, and hormones were determined. The hepatic AMP and ATP contents were detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, and the protein expression was examined by immunoblotting. Results Berberine significantly reversed the insulin resistance induced by fructose, including lowering fasting insulin levels (from 113.9 to 67.4) and area under the curve (AUC) during OGTT (from 1310 to 1073), decreasing serum leptin (from 0.28 to 0.13) and increasing serum adiponectin levels (from 1.50 to 2.80). Moreover, berberine enhanced the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT; 2.27-fold) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2; 2.56-fold), and increased hepatic glycogen content (from 0.19 to 1.65). Furthermore, berberine upregulated the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1; 2.61-fold), phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK; 1.35-fold) and phospho-liver kinase B1 (p-LKB1; 1.41-fold), whereas it decreased the AMP/ATP ratio (from 4.25 to 1.82). Conclusion The present study demonstrated the protective effects of berberine against insulin resistance induced by fructose. Our findings may provide an experimental basis for the application of berberine in the treatment of insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and their derivatives are bioactive molecules with pleiotropic functions in the human body. Elevated fasting blood BCAA concentrations are considered as a metabolic hallmark of obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, since increased BCAA amount is observed both in metabolically healthy and obese subjects, a question whether BCAA are mechanistic drivers of insulin resistance and its morbidities or only markers of metabolic dysregulation, still remains open. The beneficial effects of BCAA on body weight and composition, aerobic capacity, insulin secretion and sensitivity demand high catabolic potential toward amino acids and/or adequate BCAA intake. On the opposite, BCAA-related inhibition of lipogenesis and lipolysis enhancement may preclude impairment in insulin sensitivity. Thereby, the following review addresses various strategies pertaining to the modulation of BCAA catabolism and the possible roles of BCAA in energy homeostasis. We also aim to elucidate mechanisms behind the heterogeneity of ramifications associated with BCAA modulation.",

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is closely associated with the dysregulation of gut microbiota. There is growing evidence that natural products may improve ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut microbiota. In this research, we demonstrated that bergenin, a naturally occurring isocoumarin, significantly ameliorates colitis symptoms in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice. Transcriptomic analysis and Caco-2 cell assays revealed that bergenin could ameliorate ulcerative colitis by inhibiting TLR4 and regulating NF-\u03baB and mTOR phosphorylation. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses revealed that bergenin could improve gut microbiota dysbiosis by decreasing branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels. BCAA intervention mediated the mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway to exacerbate the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in mice. Notably, bergenin greatly decreased the symbiotic bacteria Bacteroides vulgatus (B. vulgatus), and the gavage of B. vulgatus increased BCAA concentrations and aggravated the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in mice. Our findings suggest that gut microbiota-mediated BCAA metabolism plays a vital role in the protective effect of bergenin on ulcerative colitis, providing novel insights for ulcerative colitis prevention through manipulation of the gut microbiota.",
