        "abstract": "Periodontal disease is a common infection-induced inflammatory disease among individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of treatment of periodontal disease on the level of metabolic control of diabetes. A total of 113 Native Americans (81 females and 32 males) suffering from periodontal disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were randomized into 5 treatment groups. Periodontal treatment included ultrasonic scaling and curettage combined with one of the following antimicrobial regimens: 1) topical water and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 2) topical 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 3) topical povidone-iodine and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 4) topical 0.12% CHX and placebo; and 5) topical water and placebo (control group). Assessments were performed prior to and at 3 and 6 months after treatment and included probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque and determination of serum glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). After treatment all study groups showed clinical and microbial improvement. The doxycycline-treated groups showed the greatest reduction in probing depth and subgingival Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to the control group. In addition, all 3 groups receiving systemic doxycycline showed, at 3 months, significant reductions (P < or = 0.04) in mean HbA1c reaching nearly 10% from the pretreatment value. Effective treatment of periodontal infection and reduction of periodontal inflammation is associated with a reduction in level of glycated hemoglobin. Control of periodontal infections should thus be an important part of the overall management of diabetes mellitus patients.",

        "abstract": "Severe periodontal disease often coexists with severe diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a risk factor for severe periodontal disease. A model is presented whereby severe periodontal disease increases the severity of diabetes mellitus and complicates metabolic control. We propose that an infection-mediated upregulation cycle of cytokine synthesis and secretion by chronic stimulus from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and products of periodontopathic organisms may amplify the magnitude of the advanced glycation end product (AGE)-mediated cytokine response operative in diabetes mellitus. In this model, the combination of these 2 pathways, infection and AGE-mediated cytokine upregulation, helps explain the increase in tissue destruction seen in diabetic periodontitis, and how periodontal infection may complicate the severity of diabetes and the degree of metabolic control, resulting in a 2-way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease/infection. This proposed dual pathway of tissue destruction suggests that control of chronic periodontal infection is essential for achieving long-term control of diabetes mellitus. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that elimination of periodontal infection by using systemic antibiotics improves metabolic control of diabetes, defined by reduction in glycated hemoglobin or reduction in insulin requirements.",

        "title": "Pathophysiological relationships between periodontitis and systemic disease: recent concepts involving serum lipids.",
        "abstract": "Periodontitis has been traditionally regarded as a chronic inflammatory oral infection. However, recent studies indicate that this oral disease may have profound effects on systemic health. The search for cellular/molecular mechanisms linking periodontitis to changes in systemic health and systemic physiology has resulted in the evolution of a new area of lipid research establishing linkages between existing multidisciplinary biomedical literature, recent observations concerning the effects of serum lipids on immune cell phenotype/function, and a heightened interest in systemic responses to chronic localized infections. There appears to be more than a casual relationship between serum lipid levels and systemic health (particularly cardiovascular disease, diabetes, tissue repair capacity, and immune cell function), susceptibility to periodontitis, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In terms of the potential relationship between periodontitis and systemic disease, it is possible that periodontitis-induced changes in immune cell function cause metabolic dysregulation of lipid metabolism through mechanisms involving proinflammatory cytokines. Sustained elevations of serum lipids and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines may have a serious negative impact on systemic health. The purpose of this paper is to present the background, supporting data, and hypotheses related to this concept. As active participants in this emerging and exciting area of investigation, we hope to stimulate interest and awareness among biomedical scientists and practitioners.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis has been linked to clinical cardiovascular disease but not to subclinical atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether periodontitis is associated with carotid artery intima-media wall thickness (IMT). Cross-sectional data on 6017 persons aged 52 to 75 years were obtained from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study 1996 to 1998 examination. The dependent variable was carotid IMT \u22651 mm. Periodontitis was defined by extent of attachment loss \u22653 mm: none/mild (<10%), moderate (10% to <30%), or severe (\u226530%). Covariates included age, sex, diabetes, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, smoking, waist-hip ratio, education, and race/study center. Odds of IMT \u22651 mm were higher for severe periodontitis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.53) and moderate periodontitis (OR 1.40, CI 1.17 to 1.67) compared with no periodontitis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, severe periodontitis (OR 1.31, CI 1.03 to 1.66) was associated with IMT \u22651 mm, while adjusting for the other factors in the model.

The present study investigates the relationship of periodontal disease and tooth loss with subclinical atherosclerosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 711 subjects with a mean age of 66+/-9 years and no history of stroke or myocardial infarction in the Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study. Subjects received a comprehensive periodontal examination, extensive in-person cardiovascular disease risk factor measurements, and a carotid scan using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound.

Methods and Results\u2014The population comprised 1023 men (aged 46 to 64 years) in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study. The subjects with CHD at baseline (n=113) were more often seropositive for Porphyromonas gingivalis IgA (38.9% versus 28.5%, P=0.021) and IgG (60.2% versus 46.7%, P=0.007) than those without CHD. During the 10-year follow-up, 109 men free from CHD at baseline experienced an acute myocardial infarction or CHD death. The men with an end point were more often seropositive for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans IgA (15.5% versus 10.2%, P=0.019) than those who remained healthy. In the highest tertile of A. actinomycetemcomitans IgA-antibodies compared with the lowest one, the relative risk (RR) for an end point adjusted for CHD risk factors was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.3).

        "abstract": "Introduction: Periodontitis patients are known to suffer from endotoxemia, which may be among the major risk factors for atherosclerosis. In health, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mainly carried with high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Shift of LPS toward lipoproteins with lower densities may result in less effective endotoxin scavenging. Our aim was to determine plasma LPS activity and lipoprotein-distribution before and after treatment in periodontitis patients. Patients and Methods: Very low and intermediate density (VLDL-IDL), low density (LDL), HDL 2, HDL3, and lipoprotein-deficient plasma (LPDP) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Patients included 34 subjects aged 53.5 \u00b1 8.3 years, before and 6 months after periodontal treatment. Results: The mean LPS distribution decreased among lipoprotein classes as follows: VLDL-IDL 41.3 \u00b1 12.1%, LPDP 25.0 \u00b1 7.0%, HDL3 13.1 \u00b1 5.2%, LDL 11.5 \u00b1 3.7%, and HDL2 9.2 \u00b1 2.8%. Plasma and VLDL-IDL-associated LPS correlated positively, and LDL- and HDL-associated LPS negatively with clinical periodontal parameters and plasma cytokine concentrations. Mean plasma LPS activity increased after periodontal treatment from 44.0 \u00b1 17.0 to 55.7 \u00b1 24.2 EU/ml (P = 0.006). No significant changes were found in LPS lipoprotein distribution and lipoprotein compositions after the treatment. Conclusions: Endotoxemia increases with severity of periodontitis. In periodontitis, LPS associates preferentially with the pro-atherogenic VLDL-IDL fraction. Periodontal treatment has only minor effects on plasma LPS activity or distribution, which reflects persistence of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is an important determinant of inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions. It has also been documented that certain chronic infectious diseases, such as periodontitis and chlamydial infection, exacerbate clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. In addition, low-level but persistent metabolic endotoxemia is often found in diabetic and obese subjects and is induced in mice fed a high-fat diet. Objective: In this study, we examined cooperative macrophage activation by low levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by minimally oxidized LDL (mmLDL), as a model for subclinical endotoxemia-complicated atherosclerosis. Methods and Results: We found that both in vitro and in vivo, mmLDL and LPS (Kdo2-LipidA) cooperatively activated macrophages to express proinflammatory cytokines Cxcl2 (MIP-2), Ccl3 (MIP-1&agr;), and Ccl4 (MIP-1&bgr;). Importantly, the mmLDL and LPS cooperative effects were evident at a threshold LPS concentration (1 ng/mL) at which LPS alone induced only a limited macrophage response. Analyzing microarray data with a de novo motif discovery algorithm, we found that genes transcribed by promoters containing an activator protein (AP)-1 binding site were significantly upregulated by costimulation with mmLDL and LPS. In a nuclear factor\u2013DNA binding assay, the cooperative effect of mmLDL and LPS costimulation on c-Jun and c-Fos DNA binding, but not on p65 or p50, was dependent on mmLDL-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In addition, mmLDL induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent derepression of AP-1 by removing nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) from the chemokine promoters. Conclusions: The cooperative engagement of AP-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-&kgr;B by mmLDL and LPS may constitute a mechanism of increased transcription of inflammatory cytokines within atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "title": "The SYK side of TLR4: signalling mechanisms in response to LPS and minimally oxidized LDL",
        "abstract": "Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is the best known for its involvement in immune receptor signalling, mediated by binding of SYK tandem Src\u2010homology 2 domains to tandem phosphotyrosine in immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based activation motifs (ITAMs). ITAM adaptors or ITAM\u2010containing receptor tails mediate signalling from B\u2010 and T\u2010cell receptors, Fc receptors and many C\u2010type lectins, including dectin\u20101. Recent data point to constitutive binding of SYK to the cytoplasmic domain of toll\u2010like receptor\u20104 (TLR4). This SYK\u2010TLR4 binding increases upon TLR4 dimerization and phosphorylation, and SYK plays a prominent role in TLR4 signalling in response to LPS in neutrophils and monocytes. SYK also plays an important role in TLR4\u2010mediated macrophage responses to minimally oxidized low\u2010density lipoprotein (mmLDL), which is a form of oxidized LDL relevant to development of human atherosclerosis. Interestingly, mmLDL\u2010induced effects in macrophages, which occur via TLR4, are predominantly MyD88 independent. This unmasks the role of the SYK branch of TLR4 signalling, which mediates modest cytokine release via activation of AP\u20101 transcription and robust reactive oxygen species generation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The latter results in extensive membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis, leading to lipoprotein uptake and foam cell formation, a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. Because inhibitors of SYK activity, such as fostamatinib, are in advanced clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, understanding the role of SYK in signalling via TLR4 is of immediate importance. This signalling pathway seems to be particularly important in TLR4 activation by host\u2010derived, damage\u2010associated molecular pattern ligands, such as mmLDL, relevant to development of atherosclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

        "title": "The Tyrosine Kinase Syk Differentially Regulates Toll-like Receptor Signaling Downstream of the Adaptor Molecules TRAF6 and TRAF3",
        "abstract": "The kinase Syk maintains a balanced immune response to pathogens detected by the receptor TLR4. Syk Tunes TRAF Signaling Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern recognition receptor that binds to the microbial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activates two signaling pathways involving protein ubiquitination that have opposing outcomes for the immune response. When at the plasma membrane, LPS-stimulated TLR4 associates with the adaptor MyD88 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 to stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines. When internalized and localized in endosomes, TLR4 associates with the adaptor TRIF and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 to stimulate production of immunomodulatory type I interferons. Lin et al. found that, although the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk was recruited to both TRAF6- and TRAF3-containing signaling complexes, it led to differential regulation of TRAF ubiquitination such that TRAF6-dependent proinflammatory signaling was inhibited and TRAF3-dependent IFN production was enhanced. Experiments in Syk-deficient mouse macrophages showed that Syk had similar effects on TRAF6 and TRAF3 signaling downstream of other TLRs. Together, these data suggest that Syk can fine-tune innate immune responses to dampen inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major family of pattern recognition receptors, and they play a crucial role in innate immune responses. Activation of TLR4 signaling at the plasma membrane by its ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates a proinflammatory pathway dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated factor 6) and the kinase TAK1 (transforming growth factor \u03b2\u2013activated kinase 1), whereas TLR4 signaling at endosomes stimulates the production of type I interferons (IFNs) through a pathway that depends on TRAF3 and the kinase TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase-1). We found that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk partially mediated the endocytosis of TLR4, but it also played a dual role in TLR4-mediated signaling. LPS-dependent stimulation of TLR4 in Syk-deficient macrophages led to enhanced activation of TAK1 and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines compared to that in wild-type macrophages. In contrast, Syk-deficient macrophages exhibited decreased TLR4-dependent activation of TBK1 signaling and production of type I IFNs. We found that Syk was present in both TRAF6- and TRAF3-containing signaling complexes; however, the LPS-dependent, lysine 63\u2013linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 and TRAF3 was oppositely regulated by Syk. We identified the domains of Syk that interacted with TRAF3, TRAF6, TAK1, and TBK1, factors activated by multiple TLRs, which suggests that Syk may act as a common regulator of various TLR responses. Together, our results demonstrate the opposing regulatory roles of Syk in TLR-mediated TRAF6 and TRAF3 signaling pathways, which suggests that Syk may fine-tune the innate immune response to lessen inflammation.",

        "abstract": "NLRP3 is the most crucial member of the NLR family, as it detects the existence of pathogen invasion and self\u2010derived molecules associated with cellular damage. Several studies have reported that excessive NLRP3 inflammasome\u2010mediated caspase\u20101 activation is a key factor in the development of diseases. Recent studies have reported that Syk is involved in pathogen\u2010induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation; however, the detailed mechanism linking Syk to NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Syk mediates NLRP3 stimuli\u2010induced processing of procaspase\u20101 and the consequent activation of caspase\u20101. Moreover, the kinase activity of Syk is required to potentiate caspase\u20101 activation in a reconstituted NLRP3 inflammasome system in HEK293T cells. The adaptor protein ASC bridges NLRP3 with the effector protein caspase\u20101. Herein, we find that Syk can associate directly with ASC and NLRP3 by its kinase domain but interact indirectly with procaspase\u20101. Syk can phosphorylate ASC at Y146 and Y187 residues, and the phosphorylation of both residues is critical to enhance ASC oligomerization and the recruitment of procaspase\u20101. Together, our results reveal a new molecular pathway through which Syk promotes NLRP3 inflammasome formation, resulting from the phosphorylation of ASC. Thus, the control of Syk activity might be effective to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and treat NLRP3\u2010related immune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of Leishmaniasis, a disease that can be lethal and affects 12 million people worldwide. Leishmania replicates intracellularly in macrophages, a process that is essential for disease progression. Although the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accounts for restriction of parasite replication, Leishmania is known to induce ROS upon macrophage infection. We have recently demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in infected macrophages, a process that is important for the outcome of infection. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for inflammasome activation are unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that ROS induced via NADPH oxidase during the early stages of L. amazonensis infection is critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. We identified that ROS production during L. amazonensis infection occurs upon engagement of Dectin-1, a C-type lectin receptor that signals via spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) to induce ROS. Accordingly, inflammasome activation in response to L. amazonensis is impaired by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, Syk, focal adhesion kinase, and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, and in the absence of Dectin-1. Experiments performed with Clec7a\u2212/\u2212 mice support the critical role of Dectin-1 for inflammasome activation, restriction of parasite replication in macrophages, and mouse resistance to L. amazonensis infection in vivo. Thus, we reported that activation of the Dectin-1/Syk/ROS/NLRP3 pathway during L. amazonensis phagocytosis is important for macrophage restriction of the parasite replication and effectively accounts for host resistance to Leishmania infection.",

        "title": "Metabolic regulation of NLRP3",
        "abstract": "A shift in our understanding of macrophage biology has come about as a result of recent discoveries in the area of metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. The NLRP3 inflammasome drives the activation of caspase\u20101, leading to the production of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u201018, and a type of cell death termed pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to sense metabolites such as palmitate, uric acid, and cholesterol crystals and is inhibited by ketone bodies produced during metabolic flux. The NLRP3 inflammasome has also been shown to be regulated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and components of glycolysis, such as Hexokinase. Here, we review these findings and discuss their importance for inflammation and furthermore discuss potential therapeutic benefits of targeting NLRP3.",

        "title": "Punicalagin Protects Diabetic Nephropathy by Inhibiting Pyroptosis Based on TXNIP/NLRP3 Pathway",
        "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy is a diabetic complication caused by chronic inflammation. As the primary polyphenol in pomegranate, punicalagin is believed to have significant anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we established a mice model for diabetes induced by high-fat diet (HFD)/ streptozotocin (STZ) to verify the protective effect of punicalagin in vivo. The results show that the blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (CREA), and the urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) were significantly decreased in diabetic mice after punicalagin intervention, and the symptoms of glomerular interstitial hyperplasia and glomerular hypertrophy were alleviated. Pyroptosis is an essential manner of programmed cell death in the inflammatory response; the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins such as interleukin-1 (IL-1\u03b2), cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-1 (caspase-1), gasdermin D (GSDMD), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) was decreased in our study, which proved that the administration of punicalagin for eight weeks can significantly inhibit pyroptosis in mice. In addition, punicalagin reduced high glucose-mediated protein expressions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (NOX4) and alleviated mitochondria damage. Low expression of NOX4 inhibits the dissociation of thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. To summarize, our study provided evidence that punicalagin can alleviate diabetic nephropathy, and the effect is associated with downregulating the expression of NOX4, inhibiting TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway-mediated pyroptosis, suggesting its therapeutic implications for complications of diabetes.",

        "title": "Mini-Review: GSDME-Mediated Pyroptosis in Diabetic Nephropathy",
        "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a recently identified type of lytic programmed cell death, in which pores form in the plasma membrane, and cells swell, rupture, and then release their contents, including inflammatory cytokines. Molecular studies indicated that pyroptosis may occur via a gasdermin D (GSDMD) and caspase-1 (Casp1) -dependent classical pathway, a GSDMD and Casp11/4/5-dependent non-classical pathway, or a gasdermin E (GSDME) and Casp3-dependent pathway. Studies of animal models and humans indicated that pyroptosis can exacerbate several complications of diabetes, including diabetic nephropathy (DN), a serious microvascular complication of diabetes. Many studies investigated the mechanism mediating the renoprotective effect of GSDMD regulation in the kidneys of patients and animal models with diabetes. As a newly discovered regulatory mechanism, GSDME and Casp3-dependent pyroptotic pathway in the progression of DN has also attracted people\u2019s attention. Z-DEVD-FMK, an inhibitor of Casp3, ameliorates albuminuria, improves renal function, and reduces tubulointerstitial fibrosis in diabetic mice, and these effects are associated with the inhibition of GSDME. Studies of HK-2 cells indicated that the molecular and histological features of secondary necrosis were present following glucose stimulation due to GSDME cleavage, such as cell swelling, and release of cellular contents. Therefore, therapies targeting Casp3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis have potential for treatment of DN. A novel nephroprotective strategy that employs GSDME-derived peptides which are directed against Casp3-induced cell death may be a key breakthrough. This mini-review describes the discovery and history of research in this pyroptosis pathway and reviews the function of proteins in the gasdermin family, with a focus on the role of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in DN. Many studies have investigated the impact of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in kidney diseases, and these studies used multiple interventions, in vitro models, and in vivo models. We expect that further research on the function of GDSME in DN may provide valuable insights that may help to improve treatments for this disease.",

        "title": "Total extract of Abelmoschus manihot L. alleviates uric acid-induced renal tubular epithelial injury via inhibition of caspase-8/caspase-3/NLRP3/GSDME signaling",
        "abstract": "Purpose: The incidence of uric acid (UA)-induced kidney injury is increasing owing to the high incidence of hyperuricemia in recent years. The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linneus) Medik is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb widely used in the treatment of some kidney diseases. In our previous study, we reported that the total extract of A. manihot L. flower (TEA) attenuated adriamycin-induced renal tubular cell injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of TEA in UA-induced tubular cell injury. Methods: Normal rat proximal epithelial NRK-52E cells were incubated with UA to mimic hyperuricemia conditions. The role of TEA in the renal tubular cells was also assessed. The cellular morphology was observed using phase-contrast microscopy, and cell viability was analyzed using the Cell Counting kit-8. Living and dead cells were stained using a Calcein-AM/PI double stain kit. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was analyzed by LDH cytotoxicity Assay Kit. The expression of target proteins was analyzed using western blot analysis. Results: UA triggered NRK-52E cell injury, as evidenced by morphological changes, detachment of cells from the bottom, cell swelling, large bubbles blowing from cell membrane and loss of cell viability. UA increased release of LDH. UA induced the expression of p-ERK1/2 and the subsequent activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Pyroptosis was elicited by UA after gasdermin E N-terminal (GSDME-NT) was cleaved from gasdermin E (GSDME). Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, suppressed the expression of both NLRP3 and GSDME-NT, but not that of caspase-8. INF39, an NLRP3 inhibitor, altered the expression of GSDME-NT expression, but not that caspase-3 and caspase-8. TEA alleviated UA-induced cell injury by suppressing ERK1/2/caspase-8/caspase-3/NLRP3/GSDME signaling. Conclusion: GSDME-mediated pyroptosis was involved in UA-induced renal tubular cell injury. This is the first study to report that TEA protects renal tubular epithelial cells against UA by inhibiting the ERK/1/2/caspase-8/caspase-3/NLRP3/GSDME pathway.",
