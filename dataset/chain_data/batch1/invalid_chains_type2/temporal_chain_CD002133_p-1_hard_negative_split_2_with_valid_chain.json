        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe clinical benefit of coronary-artery stenting performed in conjunction with coronary angioplasty is limited by the risk of thrombotic occlusion of the stent as well as hemorrhagic and vascular complications of intensive anticoagulation. We compared antiplatelet therapy with conventional anticoagulant therapy with respect to clinical outcomes 30 days after coronary-artery stenting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter successful placement of Palmaz-Schatz coronary-artery stents, 257 patients were randomly assigned to receive antiplatelet therapy (ticlopidine plus aspirin) and 260 to receive anticoagulant therapy (intravenous heparin, phenprocoumon, and aspirin). The primary cardiac end point was a composite measure reflecting death from cardiac causes or the occurrence of myocardial infarction, aortocoronary bypass surgery, or repeat angioplasty. The primary noncardiac end point comprised death from noncardiac causes, cerebrovascular accident, severe hemorrhage, and peripheral vascular events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy, 1.6 percent reached a primary cardiac end point, as did 6.2 percent of those assigned to anticoagulant therapy (relative risk, 0.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.06 to 0.77). With antiplatelet therapy, there was an 82 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction than in the anticoagulant-therapy group, and a 78 percent lower need for repeat interventions. Occlusion of the stented vessel occurred in 0.8 percent of the antiplatelet-therapy group and in 5.4 percent of the anticoagulant-therapy group (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.62). A primary noncardiac end point was reached by 1.2 percent of the antiplatelet-therapy group and 12.3 percent of the anticoagulant-therapy group (relative risk, 0.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.31). Hemorrhagic complications occurred only in the anticoagulant-therapy group (in 6.5 percent). An 87 percent reduction in the risk of peripheral vascular events was observed with antiplatelet therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with conventional anticoagulant therapy, combined antiplatelet therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents reduces the incidence of both cardiac events and hemorrhagic and vascular complications.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Although clopidogrel is used to prevent subacute stent thrombosis, its safety and efficacy have not been compared with ticlopidine in a randomized manner in the United States. Methods and Results\u2014Patients with successful intracoronary stent implantation were randomly assigned to therapy with ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Loading doses were administered immediately after the procedure, and the drugs were prescribed for 2 weeks. One thousand sixteen patients were enrolled: 522 patients were randomly assigned to ticlopidine therapy and 494 to clopidogrel. High-risk characteristics included recent myocardial infarction in 41.4% of the cases, angiographically evident thrombus in 20.9%, and abrupt or threatened closure in 3.64%. An intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was used in 48.2% of the cases, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 1.43% of these patients. Failure to complete 2 weeks of therapy occurred in 3.64% of the patients treated with ticlopidine and in 1.62% of the patients treated with clopidogrel (P =0.043). Within 30 days, thrombosis of the stent occurred in 1.92% of the patients in the ticlopidine group and in 2.02% of the clopidogrel group (P =0.901). A major adverse cardiac event occurred in 4.60% of patients receiving ticlopidine and in 3.85% of patients receiving clopidogrel (P =0.551). Conclusions\u2014Clopidogrel is better tolerated than ticlopidine during a 2-week regimen after intracoronary stent implantation. Combining either thienopyridine with an intravenous platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitor appears to be safe. When applied to a broad spectrum of patients receiving stent implantation, clopidogrel confers similar protection as ticlopidine against subacute stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac events.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Antiplatelet therapy is often discontinued in patients with drug-eluting stents who are undergoing surgical procedures. However, discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy is an important risk factor for late stent thrombosis. Our objective was to examine the safety of short-term discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. Methods and Results\u2014 We systematically searched Medline for reported cases of late stent thrombosis and very late stent thrombosis published between January 2001 and July 2008. We restricted our search to Academic Research Consortium\u2013defined definite cases. We identified 161 cases of late stent thrombosis or very late stent thrombosis from 84 articles (79 from case reports, 61 from registries, and 21 from randomized clinical trials). Patients had a mean age of 58.4\u00b113.4 years, and 88% were male. A total of 19 cases occurred in patients who were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of the event. If patients stopped both antiplatelet agents simultaneously, the median time to event was 7 days. If patients had previously stopped a thienopyridine with no ill effect and subsequently stopped acetylsalicylic acid, the median time to event was also 7 days from the time of acetylsalicylic acid cessation. If the thienopyridine was stopped but acetylsalicylic acid was maintained, the median time to event was 122 days. Among the 48 patients who stopped both agents, 36 cases (75%) occurred within 10 days. Among the 94 patients who discontinued a thienopyridine but continued acetylsalicylic acid, only 6 cases (6%) occurred within 10 days. Conclusion\u2014 If acetylsalicylic acid therapy is maintained, short-term discontinuation of a thienopyridine may be relatively safe in patients with drug-eluting stents.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Aspirin (ASA) has been shown to reduce postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) mortality and ischemic events; however, the timing of chronic ASA discontinuation before surgery is controversial because of concern about postoperative bleeding. We evaluated the effect of the timing of ASA discontinuation before CABG on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes and postoperative bleeding using the Cleveland Clinic Cardiovascular Information Registry database. Methods and Results\u2014 At the Cleveland Clinic between January 1, 2002, and January 31, 2008, 4143 patients undergoing CABG were taking preoperative chronic ASA. Of these, 2298 discontinued ASA 6 or more days before surgery (early discontinuation), and 1845 took ASA within 5 days of the surgery (late use). Because of substantial differences between these 2 groups, propensity score analysis, and matching based on 31 variables were used for fair comparison of outcomes. This resulted in 1519 well-matched pairs of patients (73%). There was no significant difference between those with early discontinuation and late ASA use with regard to the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke (1.7% versus 1.8%, P=0.80). Late use was associated with more intraoperative transfusions (23% versus 20%, P=0.03) and postoperative transfusions (30% versus 26%, P=0.009) but a similar number of reoperations for bleeding (3.4% versus 2.4% P=0.10). Conclusions\u2014 Among patients undergoing isolated CABG, late discontinuation of ASA resulted in no difference in postoperative cardiovascular outcomes; however, there was an increased transfusion requirement. Thus, we recommend weighing the risks and benefits of late ASA use in these patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this multicentre cohort study was to examine the relationship between antiplatelet therapy (APT) at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and postoperative bleeding complications, transfusion requirements and adverse cardiovascular events.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA matched-pair analysis was carried out on 6350 consecutive patients undergoing CABG at the three university hospitals in Western Denmark. Patients exposed to aspirin or clopidogrel within 5 days before surgery were compared with those not exposed to these drugs. The data used in the study were retrieved from the Western Denmark Heart Registry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 6350 patients enrolled, 1846 (29%) had been exposed to aspirin or clopidogrel within 5 days prior to CABG (the APT group). Matching with the remaining 4504 (71%) patients of the control group resulted in 1132 pairs of patients. Patients in the APT group had greater mean chest tube drainage volumes (946 vs 775 ml; P < 0001) and greater transfusion requirements (ranging from 37.4-57.5 vs 29.8%; P < 0.0001) than control group patients. Preoperative aspirin therapy was not associated with greater reoperation rates (4.0 vs 3.9%; P = 0.005); nor was it an independent risk factor for severe postoperative bleeding >1000 ml (odds ratio [OR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-1.34). Preoperative clopidogrel use, on the other hand, was associated with greater reoperation rates (10.2 vs 3.9% in the control group; P = 0.005) and was an independent predictor of severe postoperative bleeding (OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.55-2.80). Overall, preoperative APT had no significant effect on postoperative 30-day mortality, incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke or need for dialysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPreoperative APT is associated with increased bleeding and greater transfusion requirements after CABG. Clopidogrel exposure is associated with greater reoperation rates and is an independent risk factor for severe postoperative bleeding.",

We sought to investigate whether lower von Willebrand factor (VWF) and higher ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) are associated with a high postoperative drainage after CABG.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the prospective cohort study, VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCO), VWF collagen-binding (VWF:CB), ADAMTS13 antigen (ADAMTS13:Ag) and ADAMTS13 activity were measured on the day of elective on-pump CABG in 232 consecutive patients without a prior history of haemorrhagic diathesis, including von Willebrand disease (95% discontinued aspirin preoperatively). Postoperative drainage and blood product use were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA comparison of extreme drainage quartiles (n=56) showed that individuals with the highest drainage volumes have mean VWF:RCO lower by 19% (P<0.0001), median VWF:Ag lower by 19% (P<0.0001), ADAMTS13:Ag higher by 8% (P=0.0002), ADAMTS13 activity higher by 9% (P=0.01) and fibrinogen lower by 14% (P=0.03) than those with the lowest drainage. Linear regression analysis showed that preoperative VWF:RCO (b=-4.83, P=0.002) and fibrinogen (b=-61.52, P=0.04) are the only independent predictors of postoperative drainage. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that preoperative VWF:RCO in the lowest quartile and ADAMTS13:Ag levels in the highest quartile increased the risk of high (\u22651000 ml) drainage (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]=4.88 [1.83-13.02], P=0.001 and 3.77 [1.49-9.52], P=0.005; respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients undergoing elective CABG with lower preoperative VWF:RCO are at risk of having larger postoperative drainage, which suggests a novel contributor to increased perioperative bleeding in cardiac surgery.",

METHODS Consecutive patients with IBD aged 18 years or older were enrolled in the study. Forty-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 38 with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), and 50 healthy controls were included. The white blood cell count, haematocrit, platelet count, fibrinogen, partial activated thromboplastin time, C-reactive protein, albumin, VWF antigen level (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo), VWF collagen-binding activity (VWF:CB), and ADAMTS13 antigen level (ADAMTS13:Ag) and activity (ADAMTS13act) were measured. The following ratios were assessed: VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag, VWF:CB/VWF:Ag, VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13act, and ADAMTS13act/ADAMTS13:Ag. RESULTS Compared to controls, the odds ratio (OR) of an elevated VWF: Ag > 150% was 8.7 (95%CI: 2.7-28.1) in the UC group and 16.2 (95%CI: 4.8-54.0) in the CD group. VWF:CB was lower in UC patients, and active CD was associated with a higher VWF: RCo (+38%). The ORs of VWF:CB/VWF:Ag < 0.7 (a marker of acquired von Willebrand syndrome) in the UC and CD groups were 11.9 (95%CI: 4.4-32.4) and 13.3 (95%CI: 4.6-38.1), respectively. Active UC was associated with lower ADAMTS13:Ag (-23%) and ADAMTS13act (-20%) compared to UC in remission. Patients with active CD had a 15% lower ADAMTS13act than controls. The activity of UC, but not that of CD, was inversely correlated with ADAMTS13:Ag (r = -0.76) and ADAMTS13act (r = -0.81). CONCLUSION Complex VWF-ADAMTS13-mediated mechanisms disturb haemostasis in IBD. A reduced WVF:CB is a risk factor for bleeding, while a lower ADAMTS13 level combined with an elevated VWF:Ag could predispose one to thrombosis.",

Inflammation stimulates the expression of tissue factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) by endothelial cells. OBJECTIVES This study assessed the relationship between TFPI levels and disease activity in patients with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 50 consecutive adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 50 patients with Crohn disease (CD), and 50 healthy controls were enrolled to the study. Plasma levels of total TFPI, free TFPI, and von Willebrand factor were measured. Associations among these levels, disease activity, and inflammatory marker levels were assessed. RESULTS Total TFPI levels were higher in patients with IBD (median, 68.5 [IQR, 60.2-80.1] ng/ml) than in controls (median, 61.1 ng/ml [IQR, 54.3-74.2]; P = 0.01). Free TFPI levels were higher in patients with active UC (median, 12.8 ng/ml [IQR, 11.1-15.4]), inactive UC (median, 9.9 ng/ml [IQR, 7.3-11.5]), active CD (median, 11.7 [IQR, 9.7-14.4] ng/ml), and inactive CD (median, 9.7 ng/ml [IQR, 8.6-11.6]) than in controls (median, 5.5 ng/ml [IQR, 4.3-7.2]; P <0.001). In the CD and UC groups, free TFPI levels correlated with the levels of inflammatory markers and disease activity. The von Willebrand factor level was higher in patients with UC (median, 143.4 IU/dl [IQR, 115.5-170.4]) and those with CD (median, 151.8 IU/dl [IQR, 112.8-189.4]) than in controls (85.1 IU/dl [IQR, 77.1-101.5]; P <0.001 for both comparisons).

There were no significant differences in the median levels of E \u2011selectin, P \u2011selectin, MCP \u20111, sCD40L, and microparticles between patients with active IBD, those with inactive IBD, and healthy controls. The clinical disease activity assessed with the Mayo scale in the ulcerative \u2011colitis group was weakly, positively correlated with sCD40L ( R = 0.32, P = 0.02), P \u2011selectin ( R = 0.32, P = 0.02), and inflammatory marker levels. The clinical disease activity index in the Crohn disease group was positively correlated with the markers of inflammation yet not with the markers of endothelial activity. To assess endothelial cell activity, biochemical methods such as the release of substances from a normal or damaged endothelium can be used. We investigated serum levels of selected endothelial activation markers in patients with a varying activity of IBD. Our study did not show any significant differences in levels of E \u2011selectin, P \u2011selectin, monocyte chemoat\u2011 tractant protein 1, soluble CD40 ligand, and microparticles in patients with active IBD, those with inactive IBD, and healthy controls. However, further studies including large samples are needed to confirm these observations.",

        "title": "Serum levels of NLRC4 and MCP-2/CCL8 in patients with active Crohn\u2019s disease",
        "abstract": "Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is characterized by malfunction of immune-regulatory mechanisms with disturbed intestinal mucosal homeostasis and increased activation of mucosal immune cells, leading to abnormal secretion of numerous pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. MCP2/CCL8 is produced by intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages, and is a critical regulator of mucosal inflammation. NLRC4 is expressed in phagocytes and intestinal epithelial cells and is involved in intestinal homeostasis and host defense. However, no study to date has assessed the circulating levels of NLRC4 and MCP2/CCL8 in patients with CD. The study was aimed to investigate the serum levels of MCP2/CCL8 and NLRC4 in patients with active CD. Sixty-nine patients with active CD and 60 healthy participants were included in the study. Serum levels of NLRC4 and MCP2/CCL8 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median serum NLRC4 levels were lower in the patient group than in the controls (71.02 (range, 46.59\u201385.51) pg/mL vs. 99.43 (range 83.52\u2013137.79) pg/mL) (P < 0.001). The median serum levels of MCP2/CCL8 were decreased in patients with CD (28.68 (range, 20.16\u201346.0) pg/mL) compared with the controls (59.96 (range, 40.22\u2013105.59) pg/mL) (P < 0.001). Cut-off points of NLRC4 (<81 pg/mL) and MCP2/CCL8 (<40 pg/mL) showed high sensitivity and specificity for identifying active CD. In conclusion, this is the first study to examine circulating levels of MCP2/CCL8 and NLRC4 in patients with active CD. Our results suggest that serum NLRC4 and MCP2/CCL8 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of CD and may have a protective effect on intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Serum levels of MCP2/CCL8 and NLRC4 could be used as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for CD.",

        "abstract": "Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is an irreversible complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) that leads to loss of peritoneal membrane function. We investigated PD effluent and serum levels and the tissue expression of chemokine (C\u2010C motif) ligand 8 (CCL8) in patients with PD. Additionally, we investigated their association with PF in a mouse model. Eighty\u2010two end\u2010stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with PD were examined. CCL8 levels were measured via enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays in PD effluents and serum and analyzed with peritoneal transport parameters. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (hPMCs) were obtained from the PD effluents of 20 patients. Primary cultured hPMCs were treated with recombinant (r) transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2010\u03b2, and CCL8 expression was assessed via western blotting. As the duration of PD increased, the concentration of CCL8 in PD effluents significantly increased. Correlations between peritoneal transport parameters and dialysate CCL8 levels were observed. Western blotting analysis showed that CCL8 was upregulated via rTGF\u2010\u03b2 treatment, accompanied by increases in markers of inflammation, fibrosis, senescence, and apoptosis in hPMCs after induction of fibrosis with rTGF\u2010\u03b2. Anti\u2010CCL8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment suppressed the rTGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced increase in all analyzed markers. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CCL8 along with fibrosis\u2010 and inflammation\u2010related markers were significantly increased in the PF mouse model. Functional blockade of CCL8 using a CCR8 inhibitor (R243) abrogated peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis in vivo. In conclusion, high CCL8 levels in PD effluents may be associated with an increased risk of PD failure, and the CCL8 pathway is associated with PF. CCL8 blockade can ameliorate peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence is growing worldwide, with a significant percentage of CKD patients reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRT). Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a convenient KRT presenting benefices as home therapy. In PD patients, the peritoneum is chronically exposed to PD fluids containing supraphysiologic concentrations of glucose or other osmotic agents, leading to the activation of cellular and molecular processes of damage, including inflammation and fibrosis. Importantly, peritonitis episodes enhance peritoneum inflammation status and accelerate peritoneal injury. Here, we review the role of immune cells in the damage of the peritoneal membrane (PM) by repeated exposure to PD fluids during KRT as well as by bacterial or viral infections. We also discuss the anti-inflammatory properties of current clinical treatments of CKD patients in KRT and their potential effect on preserving PM integrity. Finally, given the current importance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, we also analyze here the implications of this disease in CKD and KRT.",

        "title": "Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Peritoneal Fibrosis and Peritoneal Membrane Dysfunction in Peritoneal Dialysis",
        "abstract": "The characteristic feature of chronic peritoneal damage in peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a decline in ultrafiltration capacity associated with pathological fibrosis and angiogenesis. The pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis is attributed to bioincompatible factors of PD fluid and peritonitis. Uremia is associated with peritoneal membrane inflammation that affects fibrosis, neoangiogenesis, and baseline peritoneal membrane function. Net ultrafiltration volume is affected by capillary surface area, vasculopathy, peritoneal fibrosis, and lymphangiogenesis. Many inflammatory cytokines induce fibrogenic growth factors, with crosstalk between macrophages and fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A are the key mediators of fibrosis and angiogenesis, respectively. Bioincompatible factors of PD fluid upregulate TGF-\u03b2 expression by mesothelial cells that contributes to the development of fibrosis. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis can progress during fibrosis via TGF-\u03b2\u2013VEGF-A/C pathways. Complement activation occurs in fungal peritonitis and progresses insidiously during PD. Analyses of the human peritoneal membrane have clarified the mechanisms by which encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis develops. Different effects of dialysates on the peritoneal membrane were also recognized, particularly in terms of vascular damage. Understanding the pathophysiologies of the peritoneal membrane will lead to preservation of peritoneal membrane function and improvements in technical survival, mortality, and quality of life for PD patients.",
