The current study evaluated the efficacy and safety of unfractionated heparin in the treatment of ulcerative colitis in comparison with methylprednisolone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multicenter randomized trial with blinded endpoint evaluation was conducted in patients hospitalized for moderate or severe ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized to receive heparin as a continuous infusion or methylprednisolone (0.75-1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-five patients entered the study: 13 received methylprednisolone and 12 received heparin. By day 10, 69% of patients in the methylprednisolone group, but none in the heparin group, achieved significant improvement or remission. C-reactive protein levels significantly decreased in the methylprednisolone group but not in the heparin group. Three patients in the heparin group were withdrawn before day 10 because of an adverse event: rectal bleeding needing transfusion (2 cases) or surgery (1 case). The proportion of patients with persistent rectal bleeding at day 10 was 31% in the methylprednisolone group and 90% in the heparin group (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnfractionated heparin as monotherapy is not effective in the treatment of moderate or severe ulcerative colitis and is associated with significant bleeding complications.",

        "abstract": "TIR8, also known as single Ig IL-1-related receptor, is a member of the IL-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily, which acts as an intracellular decoy for components of the signaling pathway. Here we report that Tir8 has a unique pattern of expression, which includes mucosal tissues and dendritic cells (DC). Tir8-deficient DC showed increased cytokine production in response to TLR agonists (lipopolysaccharide, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides). Tir8-deficient mice had normal susceptibility to systemic lipopolysaccharide toxicity and to i.p. or s.c. inflammation. However, Tir8-deficient mice were more susceptible to intestinal inflammation. Thus, TIR8 represents a negative pathway of regulation of the IL-1 receptor/TLR system, expressed in epithelial cells and DC, crucial for tuning inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.",

However, NOD2 contributions to human intestinal inflammation are complex and incompletely understood. Improved understanding of NOD2\u2010mediated pathways may lead to identification of other molecules that can also contribute to the development of Crohn's disease in humans.",

        "title": "NOD2/CARD15 Gene Variants Are Linked to Failure of Antibiotic Treatment in Perianal Fistulating Crohn's Disease",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:The Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility gene, nucleotide-binding oligomerizetion domain 2 (NOD2)/caspase recruitment domain 15 (CARD15), is linked to the innate immune response associated with altered epithelial bacterial defense. Its relevance in antibiotic therapy of perianal fistulating CD remains elusive. The aim of the study was to explore systematically the association between NOD2/CARD15 variants and clinical response of perianal fistulas in patients using antibiotic therapy.METHODS:Fifty-two patients (median age 36 yr) with draining perianal fistulas were treated with ciprofloxacin (N = 49) or metronidazole (N = 3) for a median duration of 7 wk. Complete response was defined as the absence of any draining fistula despite gentle finger compression. Genotyping for NOD2/CARD15 variants and human beta (\u03b2)-defensin 2 (HBD-2) copies was performed by 5\u2032 nuclease assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The examiners and laboratory investigators were blinded. The Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS:Ciprofloxacin was discontinued in one patient due to diarrhea after 2 wk. Complete fistula response was observed in 13 of 39 patients with NOD2/CARD15 wild-type (33.3%) compared with none in patients carrying NOD2/CARD15 variants (0%, P = 0.02). The median number of HBD-2 gene copies between responders and partial/nonresponders was similar.CONCLUSIONS:The study result suggests a substantial contribution of NOD2/CARD15 to the antibiotic treatment outcome of perianal fistulating CD. NOD2/CARD15 variants may predispose to an altered intestinal microflora in perianal fistulas that is less responsive to antibiotic treatment.",

        "abstract": "Considering epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, we can conclude that the inflammatory bowel diseases are heterogeneous disorders of multifactorial etiology in which hereditability and environment interact to produce the disease. It is probable that patients have a genetic predisposition for the development of the disease coupled with disturbances in immunoregulation. Several genes have been so far related to the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Those genes are related to innate pattern recognition receptors, to epithelial barrier homeostasis and maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, to autophagy and to lymphocyte differentiation. So far, the most strong and replicated associations with Crohn's disease have been done with NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genes. Many genes have so far been implicated in prognosis of Crohn's disease and many attempts have been made to classify genetic profiles in Crohn's disease. CARD15 seems not only a susceptibility gene, but also a disease-modifier gene for Crohn's disease. Enriching our understanding on Crohn's disease genetics is important but when combining genetic data with functional data the outcome could be of major importance to clinicians.",

        "abstract": "The -173 G/C polymorphism in the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene has been implicated in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are inconclusive. The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the overall association between the -173 G/C polymorphism and IBD risk. We searched in Pubmed, and Embase for studies evaluating the association between the -173G/C gene polymorphism and IBD risk. Data were extracted and statistical analysis was performed using Revman 5.1 and STATA 12.0 software. A total of seven publications involving 4729 subjects (2282 IBD cases and 2447 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Combined analysis revealed a clear association between this polymorphism and IBD susceptibility (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.00, p = 0.009 for CC vs. CG + GG). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that the IBD risk associated with the -173G/C gene polymorphism was significantly elevated among Asians (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.08\u20132.96, p = 0.02), but not among Caucasians. Subgroup analysis by disease suggested that the -173G/C gene polymorphism is a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.37, p = 0.01), but that it was not associated with Crohn\u2019s disease. This meta-analysis suggests that the -173 G/C polymorphism in the macrophage MIF gene contributes to IBD susceptibility, specifically in Asian populations. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.",

Several studies have shown the relationship between the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-794 CATT (MIF-794 CATT) microsatellite polymorphism and susceptibility to TB. However, the results remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aim to find out the impact of MIF-794 CATT microsatellite polymorphism on risk of TB by a comprehensive meta-analysis. We conducted a systematic study search in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to October 2017.

We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the association between the MIF-794 CATT microsatellite polymorphism and risk of TB. The reliability of the results were evaluated with trial sequential analysis (TSA). The results suggested that the MIF-794 CATT microsatellite polymorphism was significantly associated with the susceptibility of TB in all comparisons for allele (7 + 8 compared with 5 + 6, OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.31\u20131.87, P<0.00001) and genotype (7/X + 8/X compared with 5/X + 6/X, OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.39\u20132.36, P<0.0001).

        "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible association between migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-173G/C gene polymorphisms and transcript and plasma levels of MIF in spinal tuberculosis (TB) patients. Clinical data were collected from 254 spinal TB patients and 262 healthy controls participating in the study. The genotype of the MIF-173G/C gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by DNA sequencing technology. The level of mRNA expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and MIF plasma levels were measured by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of the C allele and GC+CC genotype in MIF-173G/C was over-represented in spinal TB patients. The mean MIF mRNA level in spinal TB patients and patients with the GG and GC+CC genotype were significantly lower than controls; however, our study also indicated that the MIF concentration in spinal TB patients and patients with the GG and GC+CC genotypes were significantly higher than controls. Spinal TB patients with the GG genotype had higher MIF plasma levels than patients with the GC+CC genotype. The C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was correlated with the MIF plasma level. In summary, the association between the MIF-173G/C genetic polymorphism, reduced transcript and increased plasma levels of MIF in spinal TB patients, and MIF may play an important role in the occurrence, development, and damage of spinal TB in the northern Province population of China.",

        "abstract": "Spinal tuberculosis is a common extrapulmonary type that is often secondary to pulmonary or systemic infections. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection often leads to the balance of immune control and bacterial persistence. In this study, 64 patients were enrolled and the clinicopathological and immunological characteristics of different age groups were analyzed. Anatomically, spinal tuberculosis in each group mostly occurred in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Imaging before preoperative anti-tuberculosis therapy showed that the proportion of abscesses in the older group was significantly lower than that in the younger and middle-aged groups. However, pathological examination of surgical specimens showed that the proportion of abscesses in the older group was significantly higher than that in the other groups, and there was no difference in the granulomatous inflammation, caseous necrosis, inflammatory necrosis, acute inflammation, exudation, granulation tissue formation, and fibrous tissue hyperplasia. B cell number was significantly lower in the middle-aged and older groups compared to the younger group, while the number of T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and NK cells did not differ. Meaningfully, we found that the proportion of IL-10 high expression and TGF-\u03b21 positive in the older group was significantly higher than that in the younger group. TNF-\u03b1, CD66b, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6 expressions were not different among the three groups. In conclusion, there are some differences in imaging, pathological, and immune features of spinal tuberculosis in different age groups. The high expression of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 in older patients may weaken their anti-tuberculosis immunity and treatment effectiveness.",
