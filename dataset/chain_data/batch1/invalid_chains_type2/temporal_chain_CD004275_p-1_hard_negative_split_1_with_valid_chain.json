        "abstract": "Objectives To assess both acid gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) suppression in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) and the predictive value of symptoms. Design A prospective study of patients with Barrett's epithelium (> 3 cm, containing specialized intestinal metaplasia). Patients and methods Forty-five patients with Barrett's epithelium were recruited. Therapy was adjusted to omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Oesophageal manometry and 24 h pH studies were performed on treatment. Heartburn score was calculated before and after PPI dose adjustment. In patients with persisting acid reflux, omeprazole dose was increased to 20 mg three times daily and pH studies repeated. Adequacy of GOR suppression, assessed by pH monitoring, was related to heartburn score (0\u20133). Results Twenty of the 45 patients were symptomatic (mean score 1.9) on pre-study treatment (mainly omeprazole < 20 mg once daily); on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, only six patients remained symptomatic (mean score 1.6). Ten patients (22%) had persisting GOR on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (median % total time with pH < 4 was 8%). Abnormal nocturnal reflux was found in nine and abnormal daytime reflux in only four patients. Heartburn persisted in three of these 10 patients (30%). Those remaining symptomatic had more daytime acid reflux than the asymptomatic patients with persistent reflux (median percentage daytime at pH < 4 was 13.6% vs 0.6%, respectively; P < 0.01). By increasing the omeprazole dose to 20 mg three times daily, only three of the 10 had persistent acid reflux. Conclusions Persistent acid reflux on PPI therapy is common in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. Although nocturnal acid reflux is the most common finding, symptoms tended to occur in those with abnormal daytime reflux. Symptom resolution does not guarantee acid reflux control.",

        "title": "Acid Suppression and Chemoprevention in Barrett\u2019s Oesophagus",
        "abstract": "Barrett\u2019s oesophagus is a pre-malignant condition affecting 1% of the population in the West. Even though most patients with Barrett\u2019s will not develop oesophageal cancer, the incidence of adenocarcinoma is 0.45\u20131%, conferring a 40-fold increased risk compared with the general population. The risk rises to 40\u201350% within 5 years for those with high grade dysplasia. Currently, the only strategies available to diminish adenocarcinoma rates are surveillance endoscopy, endoscopic thermal or photodynamic ablation or tissue resection. The latter options are reserved for those who already have dysplasia. 10\u201350% of patients undergoing oesophagectomy for high grade dysplasia have been shown to have adenocarcinoma. Therefore approaches are needed to be that either remove or prevent stimuli propelling patients down the dysplasia-adenocarcinoma pathway. Both gastric acid and bile acids have been reported as potential insults involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett\u2019s oesophagus. This is thought to be mediated by a range of molecules including cyclo-oxygenase-2, c-myc and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Proton pump inhibitors not only suppress acid but also bile reflux, although symptom control is a poor guide as to adequacy of acid suppression. There is some evidence that proton pump inhibitors cause partial regression in Barrett\u2019s oesophagus length, although the data is contradictory. Proton pump inhibitors have also been shown to increase cell differentiation and apoptosis, reduce proliferation and COX-2 levels, with the supposition that this may diminish cancer risk. However this role in decreasing cancer risk has not yet been evaluated. The use of NSAIDS and aspirin, most likely via inhibition of COX-2 and other inflammatory pathways, is associated with a reduction of adenocarcinoma rates. Both PPIs and NSAIDs/Aspirin may therefore be potential chemopreventative agents but further studies are required to appraise their use.",

        "title": "Lactoferrin Deficiency Promotes Colitis-Associated Colorectal Dysplasia in Mice",
        "abstract": "Nonresolving inflammatory processes affect all stages of carcinogenesis. Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family, is involved in the innate immune response and anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor activities. We previously found that lactoferrin is significantly down-regulated in specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and negatively associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and prognosis of patients with NPC. Additionally, lactoferrin expression levels are decreased in colorectal cancer as compared with normal tissue. Lactoferrin levels are also increased in the various phases of inflammation and dysplasia in an azoxymethane\u2013dextran sulfate sodium (AOM-DSS) model of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). We thus hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of lactoferrin may contribute to its anti-tumor activity. Here we generated a new Lactoferrin knockout mouse model in which the mice are fertile, develop normally, and display no gross morphological abnormalities. We then challenged these mice with chemically induced intestinal inflammation to investigate the role of lactoferrin in inflammation and cancer development. Lactoferrin knockout mice demonstrated a great susceptibility to inflammation-induced colorectal dysplasia, and this characteristic may be related to inhibition of NF-\u03baB and AKT/mTOR signaling as well as regulation of cell apoptosis and proliferation. Our results suggest that the protective roles of lactoferrin in colorectal mucosal immunity and inflammation-related malignant transformation, along with a deficiency in certain components of the innate immune system, may lead to serious consequences under conditions of inflammatory insult.",

        "abstract": "Lactotransferrin (LTF), a member of the transferrin family, serves a role in the innate immune response and is involved in anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-tumor activity. Alterations in the LTF gene are associated with an increased incidence of cancer. The LTF gene is polymorphic, and several common alleles may be observed in the general population. Our previous study identified a lower rate of occurrence of the 'A-G-G-T' haplotype (constructed with rs1126477, rs1126478, rs2073495 and rs9110) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients compared with controls. In the present study, in order to elucidate a possible mechanism of LTF-mediated anti-tumor activity in NPC, the protein profiles of NPC and non-tumorous nasopharyngeal epithelium tissues with/without the 'A-G-G-T' haplotype were constructed using LTQ Orbitrap technology. The results revealed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) was highly expressed in NPC tissues and non-tumor nasopharyngeal epithelium tissues without the 'A-G-G-T' haplotype. These results were confirmed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis was conducted to investigate the differential miRNA profiles of NPC and non-tumor nasopharyngeal epithelium tissues with/without the 'A-G-G-T' haplotype. It was observed that hsa-miR-1256 and hsa-miR-659, which are potentially targeted to the JNK2 gene, were downregulated in NPC tissues without the 'A-G-G-T' haplotype. Hsa-miR-298, another miRNA potentially targeted to the JNK2 gene, was downregulated in non-tumor nasopharyngeal epithelium tissues without the 'A-G-G-T' haplotype. In summary, these results suggested that the expression levels of JNK2 may be associated with polymorphic LTF haplotypes in human NPC.",

We investigate whether miR-1256 could be considered as powerful biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe expression of miR-1256 in CRC was compared with matched normal tissue and using qRT-PCR. The correlation of miR-1256 expression with clinicopathological factors was statistically analyzed. Survival rate was determined with Kaplan-Meier and statistically analyzed with the log-rank method between groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for CRC.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that miR-1256 level in CRC tissues is notably reduced compared to matched non-cancerous specimens (p < 0.01), and the expression of miR-1256 was significantly correlated with TNM stage (p = 0.000) and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.07).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMany studies suggest that microRNAs can promote the malignant development of tumors. MiRNA-372-3p (miR-372-3p) has been proved to be associated with a variety of cancers. However, the role of miR-372-3p in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe analyzed the expression of miR-372-3p in CRC tissues and several CRC cell lines by quantitative Real Time-PCR. The relationship between miR-372-3p and clinical pathology was also analyzed in CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of miR-372-3p in CRC. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-372-3p, including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and analyzed its potential molecular mechanism in vivo and in vitro.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur data showed that the expression of miR-372-3p was dramatically increased in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues. Moreover, the high expression of miR-372-3p was significantly correlated with tumor size and differentiation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high miR-372-3p expression group patients had a significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) than those with the low miR-372-3p group. The analysis of the prognostic factors revealed that miR-372-3p was an independent prognostic factor for RFS and DSS in CRC patients. The knockdown of miR-372-3p inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCT116 and SW480 cells. Interestingly, the overexpression of LATS2 partially reversed the miR-372-3p -mediated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC. Besides, the Hippo signaling pathway was demonstrated to be activated by decreasing of miR-372-3p in CRC. Thus, our study revealed that miR-372-3p is involved in CRC progression by inhibiting the Hippo signaling pathway through its target LATS2. MiR-372-3p and its target genes with signaling pathways are new hope for precise treatment of CRC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe upregulation of miR-372-3p was involved in the process of CRC progression by inhibiting the Hippo signaling pathway through inhibition of LATS2. We showed that miR-372-3p and its target genes with signaling pathways are a novel hope for precise treatment of CRC.",

This study aimed at investigating the possible role of LncRNA TPTEP1 (TPTEP1) in NSCLC progression.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCell proliferation was determined by MTT and colony formation assays. Transwell and scratch assays were adopted to assess cellular metastasis. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect TPTEP1 expression transcriptionally and translationally, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were used to identify the specific target relationships.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the normal adjacent tissues, the expressions of TPTEP1 and LATS2 were significantly down-regulated in the NSCLC tissues, while the expression of miR-761 was significantly increased. Overexpression of TPTEP1 exhibited substantial antitumor effects on NSCLC, including inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis, which was achieved by targeting miR-761 and subsequently attenuated the expression of LATS2. LATS2 was identified as a direct target of miR-761. Overexpression of miR-761 could significantly block the inhibitory effects of TPTEP1 on NSCLC, which clearly indicated that miR-761 played an oncogenic role in promoting proliferation and metastasis, while its downstream factor, LATS2, exerted opposite effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe study showed that TPTEP1 played an inhibitory role in cancer progression of NSCLC cells by regulating miR-761/LATS2 cascade, thereby highlighting the potential therapeutic significance of TPTEP1/miR-761/LATS2 axis.",
