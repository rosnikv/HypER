The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (attained an ACR20 response) at week 12.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 419 patients were randomized in the study. Patient demographics and disease status were similar in the 6 treatment groups. The ACR20 responses at week 12 in the 5 active treatment plus MTX groups demonstrated a statistically significant (P = 0.001) dose-response relationship compared with the ACR20 response in the placebo plus MTX group. The ACR20 response rate in the anakinra 1.0-mg/kg (46%; P = 0.001) and 2.0-mg/kg (38%; P = 0.007) dose groups was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (19%). The ACR20 responses at 24 weeks were consistent with those at 12 weeks. Similar improvements in anakinra-treated subjects were noted in individual ACR components, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, onset of ACR20 response, sustainability of ACR20 response, and magnitude of ACR response. Anakinra was safe and well tolerated. Injection site reaction was the most frequently noted adverse event, and this led to premature study withdrawal in 7% (1.0-mg/kg group) to 10% (2.0-mg/kg group) of patients receiving higher doses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with persistently active RA, the combination of anakinra and MTX was safe and well tolerated and provided significantly greater clinical benefit than MTX alone.",

Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

        "title": "Risk of serious infections during rituximab, abatacept and anakinra treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: meta-analyses of randomised placebo-controlled trials",
        "abstract": "Background: Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 blockers in rheumatoid arthritis are known to increase the risk of serious infections defined as life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics. Recently, new biological agents have become available. Their safety is an important issue. Purpose: To assess if biological agents, ie rituximab, abatacept and anakinra increase the risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in published randomised controlled trials. Data source: A systematic review of the literature using PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane library and abstracts databases (American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings) was performed up to October 2007. This search was completed with data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and manufacturers. Data extraction: Three fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed to compare serious infection rates between each biological agent and placebo. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method with a continuity correction. Data synthesis: Twelve randomised controlled trials with data concerning serious infections were analysed (three for rituximab, five for abatacept and four for anakinra). They included 745 patients, 1960 patients, 2062 patients and 2112 patients treated by rituximab, abatacept, anakinra and placebo respectively. The overall pooled ORs did not reveal a statistically significant increased risk of serious infection for abatacept and rituximab; this risk was increased for high doses of anakinra (\u2a7e100 mg daily) versus low dose and placebo (ORs\u200a=\u200a9.63 (95% CI, 1.31 to 70.91) and 3.40 (95% CI, 1.11 to 10.46) respectively). Conclusions: These meta-analyses did not reveal a significant increase in the risk of serious infections during rituximab or abatacept treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, high doses of anakinra may increase this risk, especially when patients have comorbidity factors. Large studies must be performed to confirm this safety profile in daily practice.",

        "abstract": "Significant advances in our understanding of RA and its management have been made in the past decade, resulting in earlier intervention with biologic DMARDs, particularly in patients with evidence of aggressive, erosive disease. Here, one such biologic therapy, the T-cell co-stimulation modulator abatacept, is discussed, exploring clinical evidence published to date on its use in patients with very early arthritis/early RA who are MTX na\u00efve, and in patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists. Data from relevant clinical trials are overviewed, discussing the clinical efficacy of abatacept in early disease, the clinical outcomes over long-term treatment in different patient populations and the effects of abatacept on structural damage. Findings from integrated safety analyses of abatacept clinical trial data, representing 10\u2009366 patient-years of exposure are described, and clinically important safety events, including serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events, are highlighted. It is concluded that abatacept represents an effective treatment option with an established safety profile across different patient populations, including patients with both early and erosive RA and those with established disease. Furthermore, efficacy data from studies in patients with early disease suggest that the risk\u2013benefit profile of abatacept may be more favourable when introduced earlier in the treatment paradigm.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) persistence is facilitated by exhaustion of CD8+ T cells that express the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). Blockade of PD-1 signaling improves in vitro proliferation of HCV-specific T lymphocytes, but whether antiviral function can be restored in infected individuals is unknown. To address this question, chimpanzees with persistent HCV infection were treated with anti\u2013PD-1 antibodies. A significant reduction in HCV viremia was observed in one of three treated animals without apparent hepatocellular injury. Viremia rebounded in the responder animal when antibody treatment was discontinued. Control of HCV replication was associated with restoration of intrahepatic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immunity against multiple HCV proteins. The responder animal had a history of broader T-cell immunity to multiple HCV proteins than the two chimpanzees that did not respond to PD-1 therapy. The results suggest that successful PD-1 blockade likely requires a critical threshold of preexisting virus-specific T cells in liver and warrants consideration of therapeutic vaccination strategies in combination with PD-1 blockade to broaden narrow responses. Anti\u2013PD-1 immunotherapy may also facilitate control of other persistent viruses, notably the hepatitis B virus where options for long-term control of virus replication are limited.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of JAK1 or JAK2 in human tumor cells was previously shown to increase susceptibility of these cells to NK cell lysis. In the present study, we examined the cellular mechanisms that mediate this effect in hematopoietic tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells. Incubation of tumor cells with supernatant from activated NK cells or interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3)-induced activation of pSTAT1 and increased expression of PD-L1 without altering expression of other activating or inhibitory NK cell ligands. These functional effects were blocked by chemical JAK inhibition or shRNAs targeting JAK1, JAK2 or STAT1. Inhibition of IFN\u03b3 signaling also prevented the upregulation of PD-L1 and blocking PD-L1 resulted in increased tumor lysis by NK cells. These results show that NK cell activation and secretion of IFN\u03b3 results in activation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 in tumor cells, resulting in rapid up-regulation of PD-L1 expression. Increased expression of PD-L1 results in increased resistance to NK cell lysis. Blockade of JAK pathway activation prevents increased PD-L1 expression resulting in increased susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell activity. These observations suggest that JAK pathway inhibitors as well as PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies may work synergistically with other immune therapies by preventing IFN-induced inhibition of NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is characterized by durable responses and improved survival in a subset of patients. Clinically available tools to optimize use of ICIs and understand the molecular determinants of response are needed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly routine, but its role in identifying predictors of response to ICIs is not known. Methods Detailed clinical annotation and response data were collected for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with anti-programmed death-1 or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1] therapy and profiled by targeted NGS (MSK-IMPACT; n = 240). Efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and durable clinical benefit (DCB) was defined as partial response/stable disease that lasted > 6 months. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), fraction of copy number-altered genome, and gene alterations were compared among patients with DCB and no durable benefit (NDB). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 49 patients to compare quantification of TMB by targeted NGS versus WES. Results Estimates of TMB by targeted NGS correlated well with WES (\u03c1 = 0.86; P < .001). TMB was greater in patients with DCB than with NDB ( P = .006). DCB was more common, and progression-free survival was longer in patients at increasing thresholds above versus below the 50th percentile of TMB (38.6% v 25.1%; P < .001; hazard ratio, 1.38; P = .024). The fraction of copy number-altered genome was highest in those with NDB. Variants in EGFR and STK11 associated with a lack of benefit. TMB and PD-L1 expression were independent variables, and a composite of TMB plus PD-L1 further enriched for benefit to ICIs. Conclusion Targeted NGS accurately estimates TMB and elevated TMB further improved likelihood of benefit to ICIs. TMB did not correlate with PD-L1 expression; both variables had similar predictive capacity. The incorporation of both TMB and PD-L1 expression into multivariable predictive models should result in greater predictive power.",

We assessed the association of efficacy with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB). PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred eighty-eight patients with previously untreated, recurrent stage IIIB/IV NSCLC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) in patients with 1% or more and less than 1% tumor PD-L1 expression. Efficacy on the basis of TMB (FoundationOne CDx assay) was a secondary end point. RESULTS Of treated patients with tumor available for testing, 252 patients (88%) of 288 were evaluable for PD-L1 expression and 98 patients (82%) of 120 for TMB. ORR was 30% overall and 41% and 15% in patients with 1% or greater and less than 1% tumor PD-L1 expression, respectively. ORR increased with higher TMB, plateauing at 10 or more mutations/megabase (mut/Mb). Regardless of PD-L1 expression, ORRs were higher in patients with TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb (n = 48: PD-L1, \u2265 1%, 48%; PD-L1, < 1%, 47%) versus TMB of fewer than 10 mut/Mb (n = 50: PD-L1, \u2265 1%, 18%; PD-L1, < 1%, 5%), and progression-free survival was longer in patients with TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb versus TMB of fewer than 10 mut/Mb (median, 7.1 v 2.6 months). Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 29% of patients. CONCLUSION Nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab was effective and tolerable as a first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC. TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb was associated with improved response and prolonged progression-free survival in both tumor PD-L1 expression 1% or greater and less than 1% subgroups and was thus identified as a potentially relevant cutoff in the assessment of TMB as a biomarker for first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab.",

        "abstract": "Visual Abstract Better biomarkers are needed to predict treatment outcome in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anti\u2013programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry has limited predictive value, possibly because of tumor heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression. Noninvasive PD-L1 imaging using 89Zr-durvalumab might better reflect tumor PD-L1 expression. Methods: NSCLC patients eligible for second-line immunotherapy were enrolled. Patients received 2 injections of 89Zr-durvalumab: one without a preceding dose of unlabeled durvalumab (tracer dose only) and one with a preceding dose of 750 mg of durvalumab, directly before tracer injection. Up to 4 PET/CT scans were obtained after tracer injection. After imaging acquisition, patients were treated with 750 mg of durvalumab every 2 wk. Tracer biodistribution and tumor uptake were visually assessed and quantified as SUV, and both imaging acquisitions were compared. Tumor tracer uptake was correlated with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcome, defined as response to durvalumab treatment. Results: Thirteen patients were included, and 10 completed all scheduled PET scans. No tracer-related adverse events were observed, and all patients started durvalumab treatment. Biodistribution analysis showed 89Zr-durvalumab accumulation in the blood pool, liver, and spleen. Serial imaging showed that image acquisition 120 h after injection delivered the best tumor\u2013to\u2013blood pool ratio. Most tumor lesions were visualized with the tracer dose only versus the coinjection imaging acquisition (25% vs. 13.5% of all lesions). Uptake heterogeneity was observed within (SUVpeak range, 0.2\u201315.1) and between patients. Tumor uptake was higher in patients with treatment response or stable disease than in patients with disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. However, this difference was not statistically significant (median SUVpeak, 4.9 vs. 2.4; P = 0.06). SUVpeak correlated better with the combined tumor and immune cell PD-L1 score than with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, although neither was statistically significant (P = 0.06 and P = 0.93, respectively). Conclusion: 89Zr-durvalumab was safe, without any tracer-related adverse events, and more tumor lesions were visualized using the tracer dose\u2013only imaging acquisition. 89Zr-durvalumab tumor uptake was higher in patients with a response to durvalumab treatment but did not correlate with tumor PD-L1 immunohistochemistry.",

        "abstract": "Visual Abstract In this PD-L1 ImagiNg to prediCt durvalumab treatment response in SCCHN (PINCH) study, we performed 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab (anti\u2013PD-L1 [programmed death ligand 1]) PET/CT in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) before monotherapy durvalumab treatment. The primary aims were to assess safety and feasibility of 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab PET imaging and predict disease control rate during durvalumab treatment. Secondary aims were to correlate 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab uptake to tumor PD-L1 expression, 18F-FDG uptake, and treatment response of individual lesions. Methods: In this prospective multicenter phase I\u2013II study (NCT03829007), patients with incurable R/M SCCHN underwent baseline 18F-FDG PET and CT or MRI. Subsequently, PD-L1 PET imaging was performed 5 d after administration of 37 MBq of 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab. To optimize imaging conditions, dose finding was performed in the first 14 patients. For all patients (n = 33), durvalumab treatment (1,500 mg/4 wk, intravenously) was started within 1 wk after PD-L1 PET imaging and continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (maximum, 24 mo). CT evaluation was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 every 8 wk. PD-L1 expression was determined by combined positive score on (archival) tumor tissue. 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab uptake was measured in 18F-FDG\u2013positive lesions, primary and secondary lymphoid organs, and blood pool. Results: In total, 33 patients with locoregional recurrent (n = 12) or metastatic SCCHN (n = 21) were enrolled. 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab injection was safe. A dose of 10 mg of durvalumab resulted in highest tumor-to-blood ratios. After a median follow-up of 12.6 mo, overall response rate was 26%. The disease control rate at 16 wk was 48%, with a mean duration of 7.8 mo (range, 1.7\u201321.1). On a patient level, 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab SUVpeak or tumor-to-blood ratio could not predict treatment response (hazard ratio, 1.5 [95% CI, 0.5\u20133.9; P = 0.45] and 1.3 [95% CI, 0.5\u20133.3; P = 0.60], respectively). Also, on a lesion level, 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab SUVpeak showed no substantial correlation to treatment response (Spearman \u03c1, 0.45; P = 0.051). Lesional 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab uptake did not correlate to PD-L1 combined positive score but did correlate to 18F-FDG SUVpeak (Spearman \u03c1, 0.391; P = 0.005). Conclusion: PINCH is the first, to our knowledge, PD-L1 PET/CT study in patients with R/M SCCHN and has shown the feasibility and safety of 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab PET/CT in a multicenter trial. 89Zr-DFO-durvalumab uptake did not correlate to durvalumab treatment response.",

        "title": "89Zr-Immuno-PET with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Measuring Target Engagement in Healthy Organs",
        "abstract": "Simple Summary The uptake on a 89Zr-immuno-PET scan is not just the result of the binding of a radiolabeled antibody with its target (i.e., target engagement) but also includes background factors such as non-specific binding (for example, catabolism of antibodies inside endothelial cells). In this study, we wanted to isolate target engagement. We used data from five previously performed 89Zr-immuno-PET studies with immune-targeting 89Zr-radiolabeled antibodies. First, via Patlak analysis, we separated reversible from irreversible uptake, and by using a baseline of target-negative organs, we further defined target-specific irreversible uptake. Second, we compared different mass doses (ratios of labeled and unlabeled antibody) and looked for saturation effects. Evidence for target engagement was based on the following two things: (1) when the target-specific irreversible uptake exceeded the baseline, and (2) when the signal showed saturation. We found target engagement for the different antibodies in several lymphoid organs, for example, in the spleen, while the brain had close to zero target engagement. We propose a new baseline for bone marrow and brain. In conclusion, we promote the use of Patlak analysis for 89Zr-immuno-PET studies, or similar simplified outcomes such as a tissue-to-blood ratio. Abstract Introduction: 89Zr-immuno-PET (positron emission tomography with zirconium-89-labeled monoclonal antibodies ([89Zr]Zr-mAbs)) can be used to study the biodistribution of mAbs targeting the immune system. The measured uptake consists of target-specific and non-specific components, and it can be influenced by plasma availability of the tracer. To find evidence for target-specific uptake, i.e., target engagement, we studied five immune-checkpoint-targeting [89Zr]Zr-mAbs to (1) compare the uptake with previously reported baseline values for non-specific organ uptake (ns-baseline) and (2) look for saturation effects of increasing mass doses. Method: 89Zr-immuno-PET data from five [89Zr]Zr-mAbs, i.e., nivolumab and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), durvalumab (anti-PD-L1), BI 754,111 (anti-LAG-3), and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), were analysed. For each mAb, 2\u20133 different mass doses were evaluated. PET scans and blood samples from at least two time points 24 h post injection were available. In 35 patients, brain, kidneys, liver, spleen, lungs, and bone marrow were delineated. Patlak analysis was used to account for differences in plasma activity concentration and to quantify irreversible uptake (Ki). To identify target engagement, Ki values were compared to ns-baseline Ki values previously reported, and the effect of increasing mass doses on Ki was investigated. Results: All mAbs, except ipilimumab, showed Ki values in spleen above the ns-baseline for the lowest administered mass dose, in addition to decreasing Ki values with higher mass doses, both indicative of target engagement. For bone marrow, no ns-baseline was established previously, but a similar pattern was observed. For kidneys, most mAbs showed Ki values within the ns-baseline for both low and high mass doses. However, with high mass doses, some saturation effects were seen, suggestive of a lower ns-baseline value. Ki values were near zero in brain tissue for all mass doses of all mAbs. Conclusion: Using Patlak analysis and the established ns-baseline values, evidence for target engagement in (lymphoid) organs for several immune checkpoint inhibitors could be demonstrated. A decrease in the Ki values with increasing mass doses supports the applicability of Patlak analysis for the assessment of target engagement for PET ligands with irreversible uptake behavior.",
