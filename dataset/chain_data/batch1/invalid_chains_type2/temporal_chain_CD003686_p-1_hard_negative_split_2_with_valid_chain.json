        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To compare the clinical effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection, standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and simple analgesics for the early treatment of lateral epicondylitis in primary care. Design: Multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Setting: 23 general practices in North Staffordshire and South Cheshire. Participants: 164 patients aged 18-70 years presenting with a new episode of lateral epicondylitis. Interventions: Local injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone plus lignocaine, naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two weeks, or placebo tablets. All participants received a standard advice sheet and co-codamol as required. Main outcome measures: Participants' global assessment of improvement (five point scale) at four weeks. Pain, function, and \u201cmain complaint\u201d measured on 10 point Likert scales at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Results: Over 2 years, 53 subjects were randomised to injection, 53 to naproxen, and 58 to placebo. Prognostic variables were similar between groups at baseline. At 4 weeks, 48 patients (92%) in the injection group were completely better or improved compared with 30 (57%) in the naproxen group (P<0.001) and 28 (50%) in the placebo group (P<0.001). At 12 months, 43 patients (84%) in the injection group had pain scores \u22643 compared with 45 (85%) in the naproxen group and 44 (82%) in the placebo group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Early local corticosteroid injection is effective for lateral epicondylitis. Outcome at one year was good in all groups, and effective early treatment does not seem to influence this. Key messages Most lateral epicondylitis is managed by general practitioners, but optimum treatment is unclear This large pragmatic randomised trial showed that corticosteroid injection was significantly better than non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or placebo tablets at four weeks A two week course of a standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory was no better than placebo A few patients who respond well initially to injection relapse by six months. Long term outcome was good, irrespective of initial treatment allocation",

        "abstract": "Lateral epicondylitis is the most common affliction of the elbow. It occurs in middle-aged individuals and is self-limiting in the majority of cases. The etiology of the condition is not completely understood. Based on clinical, histologic, and imaging data, the tendinous origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis is the most likely site of pathology. A variety of procedures have been described to treat epicondylitis. Most commonly, the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon origin is debrided with either open or arthroscopic methods. Both techniques require a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the extensor tendon origin at the humeral epicondyle. Improvement is reported in the majority of cases treated surgically, although residual symptoms persist in a substantial number of patients.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe treatment of tendinosis of elbow can be challenging, yet rewarding. Nevertheless, for the patients who failed conservative management and develop persistent recalcitrant symptoms, surgical intervention should be considered. The hypothesis of this study is iliac bone marrow plasma injection after arthroscopic debridement of degenerative tissue will bring along biological cure. Thus, it will not only reduce pain but also improve function in patients with resistant elbow tendonitis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTwenty-four patients (26 elbows) with significant persistent pain for a mean of 15 months, despite of standard rehabilitation protocol and a variety of other nonsurgical modalities were treated arthroscopically. We applied autologous iliac bone marrow plasma injection following arthroscopic debridement. This material is produced by centrifugation of iliac bone marrow blood at 1,800 rpm for 20 to 30 minutes. Patients were allowed full range of motion (ROM) exercise after 2 to 3 days. Cytokine analyses for this injective material were done. Outcome was rated by postoperative sonography, visual analog pain scores (VAS) and Mayo elbow performance scores (MEPS) at 8 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Informed consent had been obtained from the subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Chosun University Hospital, Korea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll patients in this study noted improvement both in their VAS and MEPS. No complication occurred in any patient. Evidence of tendon healing was observed in postoperative sonographic examination. Predominant cytokines of this study were interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and RANTES.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBiologic treatments in orthopaedics are just beginning to evolve. In the present investigation, the injection of iliac bone marrow plasma after arthroscopic debridement in severe elbow tendinosis demonstrated early recovery of daily activities and clear improvement.",

        "title": "A Hypothesis for the Anti-Inflammatory and Mechanotransduction Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Acupuncture Tendon Healing",
        "abstract": "A previous study demonstrated that acupuncture increases the synthesis and reorganisation of collagen molecules in rat tendons after injury. Clinical studies have shown that acupuncture improves pain and functional activity in patients with tendinopathy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Recent studies have shown that acupuncture can modulate both anti-inflammatory (AI) and mechanotransduction (MT) molecular pathways. Moreover, the modulation of these pathways can increase type I collagen synthesis, which is the main factor that influences tendon biomechanical properties. Our hypothesis is that acupuncture increases synthesis and subsequent reorganisation of type I collagen during tendon healing by concomitant modulation of the Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor-\u03baB AI pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway and the Rho/Rac-F-actin MT pathway. Increased collagen synthesis and reorganisation requires that at least one acupoint is anatomically connected with the site of the injury because of the local tenoblast MT mechanism. Confirmation of this hypothesis will increase the knowledge of acupuncture modulation of the previously mentioned molecular pathways, and such confirmation may also help to establish the relationships between the different types of acupuncture needle stimulation and the influence of acupuncture stimuli on pathway activity levels. In addition, the downstream therapeutic effects of acupuncture therapy may be established. This hypothesis can be verified in a rat tendon healing model, and subsequent clinical protocols for tendon healing can be developed and evaluated as standalone therapies or as a component of a combination therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective To examine the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on early post-rupture tendon repair in a rat model of Achilles tendon rupture using histological and mechanical evaluation. Methods An Achilles tendon rupture model was prepared in 90 Wistar rats, which were randomly assigned to EA, manual acupuncture or control groups. Rats in the EA group received EA (pulse width 5\u2005ms; stimulation frequency 50\u2005Hz; stimulation strength 20\u2005\u03bcA; stimulation time 20\u2005min) daily from 1\u2005day following model preparation until the day of assessment (either 7 or 10\u2005days after model preparation), when the region of interest was sampled to assess tendon repair using in vitro methods. Total cell count and the number of cells staining positive for transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) were measured. Tension tests were performed 10\u2005days after model preparation to measure the maximum breaking strength of the repaired tendon. Results Both the total cell count and the number of cells positive for b-FGF were significantly higher in the EA group (p<0.05). In the EA group only, immunostaining showed strong expression of TGF-\u03b21 7\u2005days after model preparation (p<0.05). Maximum breaking strength of the repaired tendon 10\u2005days after model preparation was significantly higher in the EA group (p<0.01). Conclusions The marked increase in cell count and growth factor expression as well as increased tendon strength in the EA group suggest that EA may be a useful method for promoting tendon repair.",

In human subjects, the source of the MSC was found to be primarily adipose tissue, whereas in rodents the tissue sources were considered more heterogeneous. Pharmacological disinhibition of rat hypothalamus enhanced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation and similarly resulted in a release of MSC into the circulation. EA\u2010mediated SNS activation was further supported by browning of white adipose tissue in rats. EA treatment of rats undergoing partial rupture of the Achilles tendon resulted in reduced mechanical hyperalgesia, increased serum interleukin\u201010 levels and tendon remodeling, effects blocked in propranolol\u2010treated rodents.

        "abstract": "Previously, we showed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be mobilized into peripheral blood using electroacupuncture (EA) at acupoints, LI-4, LI-11, GV-14, and GV-20. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EA-mobilized MSC could be harvested and expanded in vitro to be used as an autologous cell therapy in horses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from young and aged lame horses (n = 29) showed a marked enrichment for MSCs. MSC were expanded in vitro (n = 25) and administered intravenously at a dose of 50 x 106 (n = 24). Treatment resulted in significant improvement in lameness as assessed by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) lameness scale (n = 23). MSCs exhibited immunomodulatory function by inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and induction of IL-10. Intradermal testing showed no immediate or delayed immune reactions to MSC (1 x 106 to 1 x 104). In this study, we demonstrated an efficient, safe and reproducible method to mobilize and expand, in vitro, MSCs in sufficiently high concentrations for therapeutic administration. We confirm the immunomodulatory function of these cells in vitro. This non-pharmacological and non-surgical strategy for stem cell harvest has a broad range of biomedical applications and represents an improved clinically translatable and economical cell source for humans.",

        "abstract": "Joint injury often leads to cartilage damage and posttraumatic inflammation, which drives continued extracellular matrix degradation culminating in osteoarthritis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as a biotherapeutic to modulate inflammation within the joint. However, concerns have been raised regarding the immunogenicity of MSCs cultured in traditional fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing media, and the potential of xenogenic antigens to activate the immune system causing rejection and destruction of the MSCs. Xenogen-free alternatives to FBS have been proposed to decrease MSC immunogenicity, including platelet lysate (PL) and equine serum. The objective of this study was to compare the immunomodulatory properties of BM-MSCs culture-expanded in media supplemented with autologous PL (APL), pooled PL (PPL), equine serum (ES) or FBS. We hypothesized that BM-MSCs culture expanded in media with xenogen-free supplements would exhibit superior immunomodulatory properties to those cultured in FBS containing media. Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were isolated from six horses and culture expanded in each media type. Blood was collected from each horse to isolate platelet lysate. The immunomodulatory function of the BM-MSCs was assessed via a T cell proliferation assay and through multiplex immunoassay quantification of cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF\u03b1, following preconditioning of BM-MSCs with IL-1\u03b2. The concentration of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), IL-10, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in each media was measured via immunoassay. BM-MSCs cultured in ES resulted in significant suppression of T cell proliferation (p = 0.02). Cell culture supernatant from preconditioned BM-MSCs cultured in ES had significantly higher levels of IL-6. PDGF-BB was significantly higher in APL media compared to FBS media (p = 0.016), while IL-10 was significantly higher in PPL media than ES and FBS (p = 0.04). TGF-\u03b2 was highest in APL media, with a significant difference in comparison to ES media (p = 0.03). In conclusion, expansion of equine BM-MSCs in ES may enhance their immunomodulatory abilities, while PL containing media may have some inherent therapeutic potential associated with higher concentrations of growth factors. Further studies are needed to elucidate which xenogen-free supplement optimizes BM-MSC performance.",

        "abstract": "Context: Osteoarthritis (OA) is an invalidating articular disease characterized by cartilage degradation and inflammatory events. In horses, OA is associated with up to 60% of lameness and leads to reduced animal welfare along with extensive economic losses; currently, there are no curative therapies to treat OA. The mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) secretome exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, making it an attractive candidate for improving the management of OA. In this study, we determined the best storage conditions for conditioned media (CMs) and tested whether priming MSCs with cytokines can enhance the properties of the MSC secretome. Methods: First, properties of CMs collected from bone-marrow MSC cultures and stored at \u221280\u00b0C, \u221220\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C were assessed on 3D cultures of equine articular chondrocytes (eACs). Second, we primed MSCs with IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, and evaluated the MSC transcript levels of immunomodulatory effectors and growth factors. The primed CMs were also harvested for subsequent treatment of eACs, either cultured in monolayers or as 3D cell cultures. Finally, we evaluated the effect of CMs on the proliferation and the phenotype of eACs and the quality of the extracellular matrix of the neosynthesized cartilage. Results: CM storage at \u221280\u00b0C, \u221220\u00b0C, and 4\u00b0C improved collagen protein accumulation, cell proliferation and the downregulation of inflammation. The three cytokines chosen for the MSC priming influenced MSC immunomodulator gene expression, although each cytokine led to a different pattern of MSC immunomodulation. The cytokine-primed CM had no major effect on eAC proliferation, with IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 slightly increasing collagen (types IIB and I) accumulation in eAC 3D cultures (particularly with the CM derived from MSCs primed with IL-1\u03b2), and IFN-\u03b3 leading to a marked decrease. IL-1\u03b2-primed CMs resulted in increased eAC transcript levels of MMP1, MMP13 and HTRA1, whereas IFN\u03b3-primed CMs decreased the levels of HTRA1 and MMP13. Conclusion: Although the three cytokines differentially affected the expression of immunomodulatory molecules, primed CMs induced a distinct effect on eACs according to the cytokine used for MSC priming. Different mechanisms seemed to be triggered by each priming cytokine, highlighting the need for further investigation. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the potential of MSC-CMs for improving equine OA management.",

        "abstract": "Platelet lysate (PL) is investigated as a potential replacement for fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell culture. However, there is limited research on its impact on the immune profile of equine mesenchymal stromal cells (eMSCs). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different PL formulations on the proliferative capacity, multipotentiality, and immune profile of equine adipose tissue-derived MSCs (eAD-MSCs). In vitro growth kinetics and trilineage differentiation of eAD-MSCs (n\u2009=\u20097) were assessed under three culture conditions: medium-concentration PL (MPL), high-concentration PL (HPL), and FBS as a control. The immune profile was evaluated by studying the expression of immunogenic receptors such as MHC I, MHC II, and immunomodulatory molecules IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1, determined by gene expression, surface marker expression, and cytokine quantification. Both PL formulations, pooled from 5 donors, exhibited 3.3 and 6.5-fold higher platelet counts than baseline plasma for MPL and HPL, respectively. Higher concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF were found in both PL formulations compared to baseline. Furthermore, MPL and HPL subcultures demonstrated proliferative, clonogenic, and multipotent capacities similar to FBS. The immune profile of PL-cultured cells exhibited gene expression levels related to immunogenicity and immunomodulation similar to the reference condition, and the surface antigen presence of MHC II was also similar. However, HPL media exhibited higher IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in the culture supernatant. In conclusion, both PL media contained higher concentrations of growth factors compared to FBS, supporting the in vitro culture of eAD-MSCs with proliferative, clonogenic, and multipotent capacity similar to the reference medium. Nonetheless, PL usage led to a variation in the immunomodulatory cytokine microenvironment, with higher concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 in HPL media compared to MPL and FBS.",
