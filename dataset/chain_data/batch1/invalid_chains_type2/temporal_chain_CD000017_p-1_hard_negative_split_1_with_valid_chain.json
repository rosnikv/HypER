        "abstract": "Summary Controversy exists as to whether exercise in patients with intermittent claudication causes a harmful biochemical effect associated with an ischaemia-reperfusion injury of skeletal muscle. We report on exercise-induced changes in neutrophil activation, soluble P-selectin and von Willebrand factor in 34 patients with intermittent claudication and 12 matched controls. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) showed a cyclical pattern of response to exercise in control subjects (rising from 103 \u00b1 8 to 119 \u00b1 7 U/dl); claudicants did not show this pattern but had higher levels of vWF throughout (p <0.03). There was no consistent pattern of response in neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production to exercise in either claudicants or control subjects. Soluble P-selectin levels increased after exercise, but this only reached statistical significance after repeated exercise in claudicants (rising from 320 \u00b1 28 to 357 \u00b1 28 ng/ml). This rise in soluble P-selectin after exercise may indicate progressive platelet activation which may contribute to the excess cardiovascular mortality that claudicants are prone to.",

        "abstract": "Platelets play a key role in early phases of hemostasis. Fundamental mechanisms involved include: adhesion, aggregation, internal contraction and secretion. Furthermore, phospholipids present in the platelet membranes are important for blood coagulation. Interest in platelet function goes beyond their physiologic role in the arrest of bleeding. It is widely accepted that thrombotic events occur because of a dysregulation in mechanisms involved in primary hemostasis. Cardiovascular disease accounts for about 35% of total mortality in developed countries. Coronary artery disease and its complications are the main contributors to this pathological condition, and platelets are known to be involved at different stages during its development.",

        "title": "Sevoflurane Inhibits Unstimulated and Agonist-induced Platelet Antigen Expression and Platelet Function in Whole Blood In Vitro",
        "abstract": "Background Previous studies have reported conflicting results about the effect of sevoflurane on platelet aggregation. To clarify this point, we investigated the effects of sevoflurane on platelet antigen expression and function in vitro. Methods Human whole blood was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 and 1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane, 21% O2, and 5% CO2. A control sample was kept at the same conditions without sevoflurane. After stimulation with adenosine diphosphate or thrombin receptor agonist peptide 6, samples were stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies, and the expression of platelet glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb, and P-selectin, as well as activated GPIIb/IIIa, were measured with two-color flow cytometry. In addition, platelet function was assessed by means of thromboelastography and using the platelet function analyzer 100. Results Already in subanesthetic concentrations, sevoflurane inhibits unstimulated and agonist-induced GPIIb/IIIa surface expression and activated GPIIb/IIIa expression on platelets in whole blood. The agonist-induced redistribution of GPIb into the open canalicular system was also impaired by sevoflurane, whereas no effect on P-selectin expression in activated platelets could be found. Sevoflurane significantly reduced the maximum thromboelastographic amplitude. Furthermore, platelet function analyzer 100 closure times were significantly prolonged. Conclusion The results show that sevoflurane significantly impairs platelet antigen expression in vitro. It is especially the inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa expression and activation that impairs bleeding time as reflected in thromboelastographic measurements and platelet function analyzer 100 closure times. The exact inhibitory mechanism remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "The expression of P-selectin on the surface of platelets and platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation are considered to be an indicator of platelet activation and are important in thrombotic and inflammatory disease. Previous studies have reported the inhibitory effects of sevoflurane on platelet aggregation. We investigated whether sevoflurane alters the expression of P-selectin on platelets and the formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates. Twenty-five patients undergoing minor extremity surgery received sevoflurane-based general anesthesia, with mask induction and laryngeal mask airway anesthesia maintenance. Whole blood was obtained before and 40 min after sevoflurane anesthesia. Unstimulated and adenosine diphosphate-stimulated samples of whole blood and platelet rich plasma were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. The expression of P-selectin on platelets and the formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates were measured using flow cytometry. Sevoflurane inhibited platelet P-selectin expression. It also reduced the formation of platelet-leukocyte conjugates, both in unstimulated and adenosine diphosphate-stimulated blood samples at 3%\u20134% end-expiratory sevoflurane concentrations used to maintain anesthesia.",

        "title": "Delayed Inhibition of Agonist-Induced Granulocyte-Platelet Aggregation After Low-Dose Sevoflurane Inhalation in Humans",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Sevoflurane can be used as sedative-analgesic drug with endothelial protective properties. We tested whether low-dose sevoflurane inhalation provides sustained inhibition of detrimental granulocyte-platelet aggregation in humans. METHODS:Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled in this crossover study. Each subject inhaled sevoflurane for 1 h at 0.5\u20131 vol % end-tidal concentration in oxygen (50 vol %). Inhaling oxygen (50 vol %) alone served as control. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline before inhalation, immediately after inhalation, and 24 h thereafter, and were used for flow cytometry to determine platelet surface marker (CD41, CD42b, CD62P/P-selectin, and PAC-1) on platelets and granulocytes and for kaolin-induced clot formation, as assessed by thromboelastography. In flow cytometry experiments, platelets were stimulated with arachidonic acid (AA, 30 &mgr;M), adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 1 &mgr;M), and thrombin receptor agonist peptide-6 (TRAP-6, 6 &mgr;M). RESULTS:AA, ADP, and TRAP-6 markedly increased the expression of CD62P on platelets, whereas CD42b (shedding) and PAC-1 (heterotypic conjugates) expression decreased. The amount of granulocyte-platelet aggregates increased upon agonist stimulation. Low-dose sevoflurane inhalation reduced ADP-induced CD62P expression on platelets 24 h after inhalation, and inhibited the formation of granulocyte-platelet aggregates under stimulation with AA and ADP after 1 and 24 h, and with TRAP-6 after 24 h compared with control. Inhibition of granulocyte-platelet aggregates was accompanied by reduced clot firmness 24 h after sevoflurane inhalation compared with control. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrated for the first time that inhaling low-dose sevoflurane (<1 vol % end-tidal) inhibits agonist-induced granulocyte-platelet interactions 24 h after administration and thus counteracts thromboinflammatory processes.",

        "title": "Protective mechanisms of sevoflurane against one-lung ventilation-induced acute lung injury: role of cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase pathways.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo explore the protective mechanisms of sevoflurane against acute lung injury (ALI) induced by one-lung ventilation (OLV) in view of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways.\n\n\nMETHOD\nEighteen healthy Japanese white rabbits were randomized into sham-operated group (S group), OLV group (O group) and OLV + sevoflurane group (OS group). COX2 and 5-LOX protein and mRNA expressions in the lungs were detected by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and leukotrienes B2 (LTB2) in the lung tissues were quantified with ELISA. Histological scores and lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratios were determined for lung injury assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCOX2 and 5-LOX protein and mRNA expressions and the contents of LTB2, TXA2 and PGI2 in the lungs, lung W/D ratio and histological scores were significantly higher while PGI2/TXA2 ratio was significantly lower in O group and OS group than in S group (P<0.05). Compared with those in O group, COX2 and 5-LOX expressions, pulmonary contents of LTB2, TXA2 and PGI2, and lung W/D ratio all decreased significantly but PGI2/TXA2 ratio was significantly elevated in OS group (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOLV may activate COX2 and 5-LOX pathways to result in increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites. Sevoflurane protects against OLV-induced ALI probably by reducing AA metabolites and regulating PGI2/TXA2 ratio through inhibitions of COX2 and 5-LOX pathways.",

        "abstract": "Acute traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) results in a lifetime of paralysis associated with a host of medical complications. The developing secondary complications of tSCI may result in further chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Sevoflurane preconditioning (SF-PreCon) has shown guaranteed protective effects in myocardial or cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. However, the role of SF-PreCon in tSCI still remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that SF-PreCon ameliorated the developing secondary complications through reducing the apoptosis rate and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in injured spinal cord tissues, and therefore enhancing the recovery after tSCI. Notably, we demonstrated that SF-PreCon ameliorates tSCI through inhibiting Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). Importantly, we verified that SF-PreCon inhibits the expression of COX-2 and reduces the apoptosis rate after tSCI via the induction of Caveolin-3 (Cav-3). Taken together, our results suggest that SF-PreCon ameliorates tSCI via Cav-3-dependent COX-2 inhibition and provide an economical and practical method against the secondary injury after tSCI.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurological damage from spinal cord injury (SCI) is a result of primary mechanical injury and secondary damage from oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Although genistein has been shown to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in studies of brain injury, its effect on secondary damage in SCI has remained unknown. Objective To determine effects of genistein in a model of SCI in rats. Methods We divided 21 rats evenly into 3 groups, a control group, in which only a laminectomy was performed; a trauma group in which SCI was induced; and a genistein group in which genistein was administered subcutaneously after SCI. The rats were assessed using a Basso\u2013Beattie and Bresnahan functional score at the 12th hour and on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th days. Biochemical analyses were conducted at the same time points to determine the serum levels of catalase, ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), disulfide (SS), total thiol (TT), native thiol (NT), disulfide/total thiol (SS/TT), and native thiol/total thiol (NT/TT). Total oxidant and antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress index were determined in spinal cord tissue obtained on the 7th day together with immunohistochemistry for cyclooxygenase-2 levels. Result Catalase activity on the 7th day was significantly (P = 0.001) higher in the genistein-treated rats than in other groups, and IMA levels became stable earlier (3rd day) in the genistein group. SS values were significantly (P = 0.004) lower in the genistein group. NT/TT ratio were significantly (P = 0.049) higher in the genistein-treated rats on the 7th day. Conclusion Genistein has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and protective effects in a model of SCI in rats and warrants further study.",
