        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite improvements in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pain control is often inadequate even when inflammation is well controlled.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of opioid analgesics for treating pain in patients with RA.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to May 2010. We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of the reference lists of articles.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nStudies were included if they were randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs or CCTs) which compared opioid therapy to another therapy (active or placebo) for pain in patients with RA. Outcomes of interest were pain, adverse effects, function and quality of life.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, and performed a risk of bias assessment.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nEleven studies (672 participants) were included in the review. Four studies assessed the efficacy of single doses of various opioid and non-opioid analgesics; a pooled analysis of these studies was not performed but in each study opioids reduced pain more than placebo. There were no differences between analgesic drugs in these studies.Seven studies were between one and six weeks in duration and assessed six different oral opioids (dextropropoxyphene, codeine, tramadol, tilidine, pentazocine, morphine), either alone or combined with non-opioid analgesics. The only strong opioid investigated was controlled-release morphine sulphate, in a single study with 20 participants. Six studies compared an opioid to placebo. Opioids were superior to placebo in patient-reported global impression of change (3 studies, 324 participants: relative risk (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.03) but not for the number of withdrawals due to inadequate analgesia (4 studies, 345 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.0). Adverse events (most commonly nausea, vomiting, dizziness and constipation) were more frequent in patients receiving opioids compared to placebo (4 studies, 371 participants: odds ratio 3.90, 95% CI 2.31 to 6.56); the pooled risk ratio for withdrawal due to adverse events was 2.67 (3 studies, 331 participants: 95% CI 0.52 to 13.75). One study compared an opioid (codeine with paracetamol) to an NSAID (diclofenac) and found no difference in efficacy or safety between interventions.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is limited evidence that weak oral opioids may be effective analgesics for some patients with RA, but adverse effects are common and may offset the benefits of this class of medications. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the use of weak opioids for longer than six weeks, or the role of strong opioids.",

        "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of S1RA (E-52862), a selective sigma-1 receptor (&sgr;1R) antagonist, has been explored in experimental neuropathic pain, but not in inflammatory pain models. The present study investigated the effect of the intraperitoneal administration of S1RA on the hind paw withdrawal response to thermal and mechanical stimulation following an intraplantar injection of carrageenan (CARR) and complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA), which are two well-characterized models of acute and chronic inflammatory pain, respectively. S1RA fully reversed both mechanical [dose of drug that produced half of its maximal response (ED50)=35.9 and 42.1 mg/kg for CARR-induced and CFA-induced pain, respectively] and thermal (ED50=27.9 mg/kg, CARR) hypersensitivity, whereas ibuprofen (CARR, mechanical allodynia) and celecoxib (CARR, thermal hyperalgesia; CFA, mechanical allodynia) failed to reach maximum efficacy. Morphine also showed maximum efficacy in all tests. Unlike celecoxib and ibuprofen, which decreased paw volume significantly, CARR-induced paw oedema was not reduced by S1RA and morphine, thus suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of S1RA does not involve a major anti-inflammatory (antioedema) action. S1RA was devoid of efficacy when administered to &sgr;1R knockout mice, thus suggesting the involvement of &sgr;1R in the antinociceptive effects exerted by S1RA. We conclude that S1RA represents a promising novel analgesic therapy for inflammatory pain.",

        "title": "Investigational sigma-1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of pain",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The sigma-1 receptor (\u03c31R) is a ligand-regulated molecular chaperone that interacts with other proteins, including NMDA and opioid receptors, to modulate their activity. Convergent evidence indicates that \u03c31R antagonists exert inhibitory effects (and agonists stimulatory effects) on pain by stepping down the intracellular signaling cascades involved in transduction of noxious stimuli and plastic changes (i.e., sensitization phenomena) associated with chronic pain states. Areas covered: This review addresses three primary domains. The first focuses on mechanisms underlying the antinociceptive effects of \u03c31R antagonists. The second addresses evidence gained using pharmacological tools and experimental drugs in the discovery phase and clinical development. Finally, the article outlines the potential benefits of \u03c31R antagonists, alone or in combination, in the context of available pain therapeutics. Expert opinion: There is a critical need for new analgesics based on new mechanisms of action. Target identification requires convincing evidence relating targets to function. In turn, target validation requires confirmation of therapeutic benefits, ideally in humans. Current preclinical evidence provides strong rationale for \u03c31R antagonists in pain. The outcome of clinical studies with the most advanced investigational \u03c31R antagonist, S1RA (E-52862), will be of great interest to ascertain the potential of this new therapeutic approach to pain management.",

        "title": "Sigma-1 receptors control immune-driven peripheral opioid analgesia during inflammation in mice",
        "abstract": "Significance New pain medications with novel mechanisms of action are needed. Here we show that sigma-1 antagonism decreases inflammatory pain hypersensitivity by enhancing the actions of endogenous opioid peptides produced by leukocytes in mice. Sigma-1 antagonism results in opioid analgesia only at the inflamed site, where immune cells naturally accumulate. This mechanism, which maximizes the analgesic potential of immune cells in painful inflamed sites, differs from that of conventional analgesics. Sigma-1 antagonism potentiates the antinociceptive effects of opioid drugs, so sigma-1 receptors constitute a biological brake to opioid drug-induced analgesia. The pathophysiological role of this process is unknown. We aimed to investigate whether sigma-1 antagonism reduces inflammatory pain through the disinhibition of the endogenous opioidergic system in mice. The selective sigma-1 antagonists BD-1063 and S1RA abolished mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice with carrageenan-induced acute (3 h) inflammation. Sigma-1\u2013mediated antihyperalgesia was reversed by the opioid antagonists naloxone and naloxone methiodide (a peripherally restricted naloxone analog) and by local administration at the inflamed site of monoclonal antibody 3-E7, which recognizes the pan-opioid sequence Tyr\u2013Gly\u2013Gly\u2013Phe at the N terminus of most endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs). Neutrophils expressed pro-opiomelanocortin, the precursor of \u03b2-endorphin (a known EOP), and constituted the majority of the acute immune infiltrate. \u03b2-endorphin levels increased in the inflamed paw, and this increase and the antihyperalgesic effects of sigma-1 antagonism were abolished by reducing the neutrophil load with in vivo administration of an anti-Ly6G antibody. The opioid-dependent sigma-1 antihyperalgesic effects were preserved 5 d after carrageenan administration, where macrophages/monocytes were found to express pro-opiomelanocortin and to now constitute the majority of the immune infiltrate. These results suggest that immune cells harboring EOPs are needed for the antihyperalgesic effects of sigma-1 antagonism during inflammation. In conclusion, sigma-1 receptors curtail immune-driven peripheral opioid analgesia, and sigma-1 antagonism produces local opioid analgesia by enhancing the action of EOPs of immune origin, maximizing the analgesic potential of immune cells that naturally accumulate in painful inflamed areas.",

        "abstract": "Sigma-1 receptor antagonism increases the effects of morphine on nociceptive pain, even in morphine-tolerant animals. However, it is unknown whether these receptors are able to modulate morphine antinociception and tolerance during inflammatory pain. Here we used a mouse model to test the modulation of morphine effects by the selective sigma-1 antagonist S1RA (MR309), by determining its effect on inflammatory tactile allodynia (von Frey filaments) and on grip strength deficits induced by joint inflammation (a measure of pain-induced functional disability), and compared the results with those for nociceptive heat pain recorded with the unilateral hot plate (55\u00b0C) test. The subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of morphine induced antinociceptive effects to heat stimuli, and restored mechanical threshold and grip strength in mice with periarticular inflammation induced by Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant. S1RA (80 mg/kg, s.c.) administered alone did not induce any effect on nociceptive heat pain or inflammatory allodynia, but was able to partially reverse grip strength deficits. The association of S1RA with morphine, at doses inducing little or no analgesic-like effects when administered alone, resulted in a marked antinociceptive effect to heat stimuli and complete reversion of inflammatory tactile allodynia. However, S1RA administration did not increase the effect of morphine on grip strength deficits induced by joint inflammation. When S1RA (80 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to morphine-tolerant animals, it rescued the analgesic-like effects of this opioid in all three pain measures. However, when S1RA was repeatedly given during the induction of morphine tolerance (and not on the day of behavioral evaluation) it failed to affect tolerance to the effects of morphine on nociceptive heat pain or inflammatory allodynia, but completely preserved the effects of this opioid on grip strength deficits. These effects of S1RA on morphine tolerance cannot be explained by pharmacokinetic interactions, given that the administration of S1RA did not modify concentrations of morphine or morphine-3-glucuronide (a major morphine metabolite) in morphine-tolerant animals in plasma or brain tissue. We conclude that sigma-1 receptors play a pivotal role in the control of morphine analgesia and tolerance in nociceptive and inflammatory pain, although in a manner dependent on the type of painful stimulus explored.",

        "abstract": "Abstract EST64401 and EST64514 are two selective sigma-1 receptor ligands that showed a good profile in a lead optimization process for oral pain treatment. Their potential for pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interactions was assessed to anticipate clinical interactions. Both compounds showed a low potential for CYP inhibition with percentages of inhibition <50% at 1\u2009\u00b5M in recombinant human CYPs (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) and IC50 \u226575\u2009\u00b5M for CYP3A4 and 2D6 in human liver microsomes. No CYP induction was observed for CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 at concentrations \u226425\u2009\u00b5M (EST64401) or \u226450\u2009\u00b5M (EST64514) in human hepatocytes using as endpoints CYP activities and mRNA levels. More than one enzyme participated in compound metabolism. The main enzymes involved were CYP3A4 for EST64401 and CYP2D6 besides CYP3A4 for EST64514. Neither EST64401 nor EST64514 seemed to be substrates of P-gp or BCRP in Caco-2 cells (efflux ratio \u22642). Transporter inhibition was observed at concentrations \u226520\u2009\u00b5M; EST64401 only inhibiting P-gp at higher concentrations (\u2265125\u2009\u00b5M). Preliminary in vitro interaction studies suggest a similar profile for EST64401 and EST64514. Therefore, other properties will have to be considered for compound differentiation and selection for further development.",

        "abstract": "Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) include sporadic and hereditary neurological disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) is a protein enriched in MNs, and mutations on its gene lead to various types of MND. Previous studies have suggested that Sig-1R is a target to prevent MN degeneration. In this study, two novel synthesized Sig-1R ligands, coded EST79232 and EST79376, from the same chemical series, with the same scaffold and similar physicochemical properties but opposite functionality on Sig-1R, were evaluated as neuroprotective compounds to prevent MN degeneration. We used an in vitro model of spinal cord organotypic cultures under chronic excitotoxicity and two in vivo models, the spinal nerve injury and the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)G93A mice, to characterize the effects of these Sig-1R ligands on MN survival and modulation of glial reactivity. The antagonist EST79376 preserved MNs in vitro and after spinal nerve injury but was not able to improve MN death in SOD1G93A mice. In contrast, the agonist EST79232 significantly increased MN survival in the three models of MN degeneration evaluated and had a mild beneficial effect on motor function in SOD1G93A mice. In vivo, Sig-1R ligand EST79232 had a more potent effect on preventing MN degeneration than EST79376. These data further support the interest in Sig-1R as a therapeutic target for neurodegeneration.",
