        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that mediates inflammatory synovitis and articular matrix degradation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the ability of adalimumab, a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, to inhibit the progression of structural joint damage, reduce the signs and symptoms, and improve physical function in patients with active RA receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 619 patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week (n = 207), adalimumab 20 mg subcutaneously every week (n = 212), or placebo (n = 200) plus concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy end points were radiographic progression at week 52 (total Sharp score by a modified method [TSS]), clinical response at week 24 (improvements of at least 20% in the American College of Rheumatology core criteria [ACR20]), and physical function at week 52 (disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 52, there was statistically significantly less radiographic progression, as measured by the change in TSS, in the patients receiving adalimumab either 40 mg every other week (mean +/- SD change 0.1 +/- 4.8) or 20 mg weekly (0.8 +/- 4.9) as compared with that in the placebo group (2.7 +/- 6.8) (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). In addition, there were statistically significant changes in the components of the TSS. At week 24, ACR20 responses were achieved by 63% and 61% of patients in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly groups, respectively, versus 30% of patients in the placebo group (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, ACR20 responses were achieved by 59% and 55% of patients taking adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly, respectively, versus 24% of patients taking placebo (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, physical function as measured by the HAQ demonstrated statistically significant improvement with adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly compared with placebo (mean change in HAQ score -0.59 and -0.61, respectively, versus -0.25; P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). A total of 467 patients (75.4%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated. Discontinuations occurred in 22.0% of adalimumab-treated patients and in 30.0% of placebo-treated patients. The rate of adverse events (both serious and nonserious) was comparable in the adalimumab and placebo groups, although the proportion of patients reporting serious infections was higher in patients receiving adalimumab (3.8%) than in those receiving placebo (0.5%) (P < or = 0.02), and was highest in the patients receiving 40 mg every other week.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this 52-week trial, adalimumab was more effective than placebo at inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage, reducing the signs and symptoms, and improving physical function in patients with active RA who had demonstrated an incomplete response to MTX.",

        "title": "Measuring function in rheumatoid arthritis: Identifying reversible and irreversible components.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMeasurement of physical function at one point in time cannot distinguish impairment caused by the active disease process from chronic irreversible impairment. We aimed to dissect these two components of functional limitation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by using the disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) as the measure of function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a secondary analysis of data from 6 contemporary clinical trials of RA (2,763 patients). Patients in whom remission was achieved in the trials, based on a simplified disease activity index, were identified. In an individual patient, HAQ scores at trial entry represented both reversible and irreversible impairments, while HAQ scores at the time of RA remission represented the mostly irreversible component, and the difference between these corresponded to the component related to disease activity. We tested the concept that the HAQ has a reversible and an irreversible component by associating the HAQ score during remission with 2 measures associated with the degree of accrued damage: duration of RA and radiographic severity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong patients in whom clinical remission was achieved (n = 295), average HAQ scores despite clinical remission increased progressively with the duration of RA, from 0.19 (<2 years of RA) to 0.36 (2-<5 years) to 0.38 (5-<10 years) to 0.55 (>/=10 years) (P < 0.001). The reversibility of HAQ scores decreased with the duration of RA (median 100%, 83.3%, 81.9%, and 66.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). Findings were similar in patients subgrouped by quartile of radiographic scores.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDifferences in the sources of functional limitations should be considered in the interpretation of functional measures, and in their use for prediction and in cost analyses.",

        "abstract": "Background: Many studies have examined the relationship between long-term radiographic damage and physical function. However, it is not known if short-term radiographic progression is also associated with physical function. Aim: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between physical function and both the level of radiographic damage and the radiographic progression rate in patients with early or advanced active rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: The database for the 2-year Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate with Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO) was used for this study. Physical function was measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score at baseline, 6 months and 1 and 2 years. Radiographs of the hands and feet, taken at the same time points, were scored by the van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (TSS). The HAQ score was modelled using generalised mixed linear modelling by TSS or progression in TSS (interval 0\u20131 year and 1\u20132 years) adjusted for age, sex, treatment and disease activity. Results: After adjustment for age, sex and disease activity, both TSS and the change in TSS (progression rate) were significant determinants of the HAQ score. When radiographic progression was divided into four categories (negative, zero, minor and greater progression), results showed that HAQ scores tended to be higher with a higher rate of progression. Patients with negative progression scores had lower HAQ scores than patients with positive progression scores. Conclusions: Patients with greater radiographic damage, and those with recent radiographic progression, have a higher degree of disability.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nIdentifying patients with RA at high risk of rapid radiographic progression (RRP) is critical for making appropriate treatment decisions. We developed an exploratory prediction model for the risk of RRP using an RA study population undergoing either conservative or aggressive disease management.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing data from the active-controlled study of patients receiving infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis of early onset (ASPIRE) early RA study, RRP was defined as a threshold change in modified Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) of > or =5 U/year. Spearman's rank analysis was used to identify baseline risk factors for RRP. Logistic regression was used to calculate the probability of RRP in 1 year. The results were combined into a matrix model that consisted of risk factors and initiated treatment arranged in increasing risk of RRP. Data from the anti-TNF trial in rheumatoid arthritis with concomitant therapy (ATTRACT) established RA study were applied to the model to test its generalizability in another population.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 28 swollen joint count, RF, CRP and ESR are included as trichotomous variables and initiated treatment (monotherapy or combination therapy) as a dichotomous variable. Two models, one incorporating all risk factors except CRP and another incorporating all risk factors except ESR, were developed to adjust for collinearity. These models identify subpopulations of RA patients at higher predicted risk for RRP.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese preliminary matrix models predict the risk of RRP using initiated treatment and easily accessible clinical and laboratory variables. Further testing in other populations and with other therapies is needed to obtain a definitive risk model that will guide rheumatologists in making treatment decisions for individual RA patients.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To develop a matrix model for the prediction of rapid radiographic progression (RRP) in subpopulations of patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving different dynamic treatment strategies. Methods Data from 465 patients with recent-onset RA randomised to receive initial monotherapy or combination therapy were used. Predictors for RRP (increase in Sharp-van der Heijde score \u22655 after 1 year) were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. For subpopulations, the estimated risk of RRP per treatment group and the number needed to treat (NNT) were visualised in a matrix. Results The presence of autoantibodies, baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) level, erosion score and treatment group were significant independent predictors of RRP in the matrix. Combination therapy was associated with a markedly reduced risk of RRP. The positive and negative predictive values of the matrix were 62% and 91%, respectively. The NNT with initial combination therapy to prevent one patient from RRP with monotherapy was in the range 2\u20133, 3\u20137 and 7\u201325 for patients with a high, intermediate and low predicted risk, respectively. Conclusion The matrix model visualises the risk of RRP for subpopulations of patients with recent-onset RA if treated dynamically with initial monotherapy or combination therapy. Rheumatologists might use the matrix for weighing their initial treatment choice.",

The authors compared the clinical and radiological responses to Disease Activity Score (DAS)-steered treatment in patients with RA positive or RA negative for ACPA. Methods In the BehandelStrategie\u00ebn (BeSt) study, 508 patients with recent-onset RA were randomised to four treatment strategies aimed at a DAS \u22642.4. Risks of damage progression and (drug-free) remission in 8 years were compared for ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients using logistic regression analysis. Functional ability and DAS components over time were compared using linear mixed models. Results DAS reduction was achieved similarly in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients in all treatment strategy groups, with a similar need to adjust treatment because of inadequate response. Functional ability and remission rates were not different for ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients. ACPA-positive patients had more radiological damage progression, especially after initial monotherapy. They had a lower chance of achieving (persistent) drug-free remission. Conclusion Clinical response to treatment was similar in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients. However, more ACPA-positive patients, especially those treated with initial monotherapy, had significant radiological damage progression, indicating that methotrexate monotherapy and DAS- (\u22642.4) steered treatment might be insufficient to adequately suppress joint damage progression in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To assess whether early swelling and tenderness in large joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is predictive of later local damage and whether this leads to functional disability. Methods. Two-year clinical and 8-year radiological followup data from the BeSt study (trial numbers NTR262 and NTR265), a randomized controlled treat-to-target trial, were used. The association between early local joint swelling and/or tenderness (at least once, or for \u2265 2 consecutive visits) and later large-joint damage (Larsen score \u2265 1) was assessed using generalized estimating equations. The association between large-joint damage and functional ability [by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)] was assessed using logistic and linear regression analysis. Results. Clinical and 8-year radiological data were available for 290 patients. Concomitant local joint swelling and tenderness at least once in the first 2 years was independently associated with damage of the large joints (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7\u20133.6), as was swelling without tenderness (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.6). Stronger effects were seen for persistent swelling and/or tenderness. Other independent predictors for joint damage were baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.02) and the presence of rheumatoid factor and/or anticitrullinated protein antibodies (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5\u20134.1; and OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3\u20133.8, respectively). Patients with large-joint damage had a higher HAQ score after 8 years than patients without (difference 0.15). Conclusion. Early local swelling and tenderness are independent predictors of later joint damage in these joints after 8 years of Disease Activity Score-guided treatment in patients with RA. This suggests that suppression of local inflammation could help prevent local damage and functional disability.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To determine combined evaluation of musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSUS) and power Doppler (PD) signals, anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), and other clinical findings improve the prediction of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. We performed a retrospective study of 331 RA patients (female n = 280 and male n = 51, mean age: 57.9 \u00b1 13.2 years) who underwent MSUS from 2002 to 2012. Correlations with progression of joint destructions in 1,308 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and various factors including PD signals of the same joints, clinical findings, age, disease duration at the study entry, gender, observation period, radiographic bone scores according to modified Sharp\u2013van der Heijde methods, ACPA, and rheumatoid factor (RF) were analyzed in patient- and joint-based fashions, using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and generalized linear mixed model. Results. Patients\u2019 characteristics were as follows: mean disease duration: 5.7 \u00b1 7.5 years, observation period: 4.6 \u00b1 2.6 years, RF positivity: 79.9%, and ACPA positivity: 77.5%. PD-positive 2nd and 3rd joints showed higher rate of joint destruction, especially in ACPA-positive patients. Moreover, PD-positive joints in ACPA-positive patients showed joint destruction even in joints without swelling. Multivariate analysis determined PD, swollen joint (SJ), observation period, basal radiographic bone scores, and ACPA as independent risks for joint destruction. Conclusion. PD, SJ, basal radiographic bone scores, and ACPA are independent predictors for the joint destruction of 2nd and 3rd MCPs in RA; thus, considering these factors would be useful in daily practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To investigate whether on-demand ultrasonography (US) assessment alongside a routine examination is useful in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: US was performed in eight (bilateral MCP 2, 3, wrist and knee) joints as the routine in a cumulative total of 406 RA patients. The most symptomatic joint other than the routine joints was additionally scanned. Power Doppler (PD) and gray-scale images were scored semiquantitatively. Eight-joint scores were calculated as the sum of individual scores for the routine joints. Results: The most symptomatic joint was found among the routine joints in 209 patients (Group A) and in other joints in 148 (Group B). The PD scores of the most symptomatic joint correlated well with the 8-joint scores in Group A (rs\u2009=\u20090.66), but not in Group B (rs\u2009=\u20090.33). The sensitivity and specificity of assessment of the most symptomatic joint for routine assessment positivity were high (84.0% and 100%, respectively) in Group A, but low (50.0% and 61.8%, respectively) in Group B. Additional examination detected synovitis in 38% of Group B with negative results in the routine.

Material and methods 123 patients (87 women, 36 men) with arthritis lasting less than 12 months, naive to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and glucocorticosteroids. Necessary differential diagnostics was performed for each patient. After the preliminary analysis, 72 patients met the classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to ACR/EULAR of 2010, and undifferentiated arthritis (UA) was diagnosed in 51 patients. UA patients were followed up after 6 and 12 months, and verification of the initial diagnosis yielded the following groups of patients: patients meeting classification criteria for RA, patients with maintained diagnosis of UA, patients in remission, and patients with other diagnoses. Ultrasound examination was performed considering the volume of joint effusion (JE), synovial membrane hypertrophy (GS), and synovial membrane hyperaemia assessed by power Doppler (PD). Results were assessed using the semi-qualitative scale. Coefficients being the sum of US scores for the assessment of JE, GS and PD for 52 and 12 joints in hands and feet, and 8 joints in hands were determined for the purpose of the study. Results In patients meeting classification criteria for RA during the initial assessment the US examination yielded significantly higher PD-52I, PD-12I and PD-8I coefficients. In UA patients who were diagnosed with RA after 12 months, the GS-8I coefficient was significantly higher. Conclusions Ultrasonography is a valuable tool in diagnostics of early arthritis. The GS assessment has prognostic value for UA patients. The assessment of 8 or 12 selected joints is often sufficient for the diagnostics of patients with early arthritis.",
