Videla, J. Bernstein, and Y. Israel: Biochem. J, 134: 507\u2013514, 1973). Whole animal minimal oxygen consumption, a sensitive indicator of the effects of thyroid hormone (W. D. Denckla: J. Clin. Invest, 53:572\u2013581, 1974) was unchanged in rats maintained 3 wk on a liquid diet containing 34% of the calories as ethanol (2.49 \u00b1 0.06 ml of O2/min/1O0 g of fat-free body weight) when compared to animals fed an equicaloric sucrose containing liquid diet (2.61 \u00b1 0.20 ml of 02/min/100 g of fat-free body weight) or Purina chow (2.50 \u00b1 0.12 ml of O2/min/100 g of fat-free body weight). Ethanol treatment lowered serum thyroxine (5.09 \u00b1 0.20 pg/100 ml) compared to sucrose-fed control rats (7.66 \u00b1 0.40 pg/100 ml), while serum triiodothyronine was unaffected (59.3 \u00b1 4.0 compared to 66.9 \u00b1 3.1 ng/100 ml for controls). Measurement of O2 consumption in the isolated perfused rat liver showed no significant difference after chronic treatment with the ethanol diet compared to either the sucrose or chow control diets. Infusion of 10-7 M norepinephrine into the perfusion medium resulted in an approximately 22% increase in O2 consumption in ethanol-fed animal and sucrose controls, while a 31 % increase was observed for sucrose-treated animals given 10 \u03bcg of T3/kg of body weight/day for 3 wk. These data indicate that T3 potentiates the ability of norepinephrine to increase O2 consumption. The data presented give no support to the concept that chronic ethanol ingestion results in hyperthyroidism or liver hypermetabolism and, consequently, the rationale for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with the antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil, is incorrect (H. Orrego, H. Ka-lant, Y. Israel, et al.: Gastroenterology, 76:105\u2013115, 1979).",

        "abstract": "Chronic alcohol administration to baboons results in perivenular lesions in the liver. To study possible mechanisms, the effect of ethanol on splanchnic oxygen consumption was measured. Acute ethanol administration increased splanchnic oxygen consumption in the control baboons, but the consequences of this effect on oxygenation of the perivenular zones were offset by a concomitant rise in blood flow, resulting in unchanged hepatic venous oxygen tensions. In alcohol-fed baboons, splanchnic oxygen consumption was not increased, either in the withdrawal state or after ethanol infusion. To study the magnitude of the shift in redox state induced by ethanol in the perivenular zones, we compared the effects of ethanol on the lactate/pyruvate ratio in hepatic venous blood (an approximation of that in perivenular hepatocytes) with the ratio in total liver. Prior to ethanol infusion, the lactate and pyruvate were the same in liver and in hepatic venous blood. By contrast, in all baboons, ethanol produced a much greater rise in the lactate/pyruvate ratio and decreased pyruvate more in hepatic venous blood than in total liver. Moreover, in isolated rat hepatocytes, the ethanol-induced redox shift was markedly exaggerated by oxygen tensions similar to those found in centrolobular zones. This suggests that the normally low oxygen tensions existing in perivenular zones exaggerate the ethanol-induced redox shift, a change which may contribute to the exacerbation of the damage in the perivenular area of the hepatic lobule.",

Chronic ethanol consumption for 12 weeks (mean daily ethanol intake 11.4 gm per body weight corresponding to 29% of total energy intake) did not cause histological changes but decreased GPT activity, increased glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase activities and did not alter their pp/pv distribution. Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities were evenly distributed in pp\u2010 and pv\u2010hepatocytes. Chronic ethanol treatment slightly decreased alcohol dehydrogenase activity (p < 0.05) and increased the activity of low Km aldehyde dehydrogenase (p < 0.001, p < 0.05).

        "abstract": "Intact periportal (pp) or perivenous (pv) hepatocytes were prepared by digitonin-collagenase liver perfusion. The degree of separation was indicated by significant differences between the pp and pv cells in their activity of the pp markers, alanine aminotransferase (pp/pv = 2.1), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (3.4) and lactate dehydrogenase (1.3), and of the pv markers, glutamate dehydrogenase (0.73) and pyruvate kinase (0.81). This pattern was not altered by a 3-day pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB). The hepatocytes isolated from the pv area contained higher activities of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, and of cytosolic glutathione transferase. Cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were slightly higher in pv cells. Treatment with PB induced NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, glutathione transferase, cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase but the degree of induction was found to be at least as strong in pp cells as in pv cells. The induction of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase was clearly more prominent in pp cells. On the other hand, PB reduced the activities of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in both cell types. These results demonstrate by direct enzyme assay of separated cells the dominance of the pv-region for metabolizing drugs in the normal liver. Contrary to several other studies, however, our data indicate that induction by PB occurs panacinarily, i.e., relatively more in the pp region, thus diminishing rather than exaggerating the original pv dominance.",

No marked difference in alcohol dehydrogenase activity between the cell types was observed. The cells also oxidised AlOH at about equal rates. AlOH depleted cellular glutathione by about 95% within 10 minutes in both cell types, but was partially restored during subsequent incubation. The pp cells suffering from AlOH toxicity in vivo tended to resist AlOH in vitro better than pv hepatocytes, as judged from the measurement of cellular ATP and K+ ion content, and LDH leakage. It is suggested that the oxidation of AlOH may be restricted to the pp region in intact liver simply because of the high rate of uptake and oxidation of AlOH by the liver tissue.",

        "abstract": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes are known to display various functional differences. In this study we present a new method to separate periportal and perivenous cells: after selectively loading zone 1 or zone 3 with the fluorescent label acridine orange in an antegrade or retrograde perfusion, respectively, we separated the isolated hepatocytes on a fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorter. The common way to check on proper separation is to estimate activities of enzymes known to exhibit a heterogeneous acinar distribution. Using enzyme histochemistry, however, we found that already on short collagenase perfusion, some enzymes displayed a more shallow gradient than in vivo, making enzyme activities less suitable as zonal markers. We therefore used colloidal gold granules (17 nm) injected intravenously (2.5 mg) into the rat 2 to 3 hr before cell isolation. The gold is taken up predominantly by perivenous hepatocytes, probably because of the efficient removal of gold granules in zone 1 by competing Kupffer cells. We compared acridine orange fluorescence, presence of gold particles and activities of six marker enzymes, three biochemically and three histochemically determined. Acridine orange and gold both pointed to a high enrichment of the fractions, whereas most enzyme activities were more randomly distributed among the cells as a result of the isolation procedure. Our separation procedure yielded fractions highly enriched in either viable periportal or perivenous cells, both from one liver. The use of colloidal gold as a marker to monitor separation is a valuable alternative to the more risky estimation of enzyme activities. (HEPATOLOGY 1991;13:73\u201382).",

        "abstract": "Anterograde or retrograde perfusion of rat liver with digitonin selectively permeabilizes the periportal or the perivenous zone of the hepatic lobule. Digitonin perfusion is used to analyze the effluents released by permeabilized hepatocytes or, combined with collagenase perfusion, to obtain cell suspensions enriched in either periportal or perivenous hepatocytes. Despite the wide use of digitonin to study lobular heterogeneity, its affects on rat hepatocytes are not well documented. We therefore analyzed the effects of digitonin perfusion on the intracellular content of rat hepatocytes by combining electron microscopy, histoenzymology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. At the concentration currently used for the study of lobular heterogeneity, digitonin perfusion induced a marked cytosolic clarification of permeabilized hepatocytes, while most organelles except mitochondria were well preserved. In the digitonin-altered zones, there was no histochemical detection of non-membrane-bound enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas membrane-bound enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, NADPH dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase) were still detected. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed significant amounts of several plasma proteins (albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-inhibitor 3, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein) and their respective mRNAs in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes. The demonstration that digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes retain many intracellular constituents shows that biochemical analysis of cellular effluents released from digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes must be interpreted with caution and that the apparent characteristics of cell suspensions obtained by the digitonin-collagenase technique might be significantly altered by contamination with permeabilized hepatocytes from the opposite zone.",

        "abstract": "Morphological and functional heterogeneity of hepatocytes according to their position in the liver lobule has been known for many years. The digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique is widely used to study hepatocyte heterogeneity and has yielded reliable data. However, with this procedure, periportal (PP) or perivenous (PV) hepatocytes are isolated from different livers, allowing only comparison between cell populations issued from two separate animals. To overcome this drawback, we have modified this technique by perfusing the two main rat liver lobes of a single animal in succession. The procedure involved alternate clamping of the median and the left lateral lobes, restricting digitonin infusion to one lobe via the portal vein, and to the other via the caudal vena cava. Lobe exclusion during digitonin perfusion, and zonal restriction of digitonin\u2010induced damage, were monitored using macroscopic and histological controls. We compared our results with previous data on PP and PV hepatocytes issued from two different livers using the conventional digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. First, we found that the cellular sensitivity to angiotensin II, a calcium\u2010mobilizing agonist, was 60% to 80% higher in PV than in PP hepatocytes, whereas, previously, no difference had been recorded. Second, we found that albumin messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were 35% more abundant in PP than in PV hepatocytes, whereas, previously, larger differences had been reported. Our results show that PP and PV hepatocytes may be isolated from a single liver using an improved digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. Furthermore, we suggest that zonal differences can be artificially masked or amplified when comparing PP and PV cell populations from two different livers, indicating that it is preferable to use a single liver for accurate zonal comparisons between hepatocytes.",

We investigated these mechanisms directly on fura2\u2010loaded multicellular systems of rat hepatocytes and on cell populations issued from peripheral (periportal) and central (perivenous) parts of the hepatic lobule. There was a gradient in vasopressin sensitivity along connected cells as demonstrated by low vasopressin concentration challenge. Interestingly, the intercellular sensitivity gradient was abolished either when D\u2010myo\u2010inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor was directly stimulated after flash photolysis of caged InsP3 or when G proteins were directly stimulated with AlF4\u2212. The gradient in vasopressin sensitivity in multiplets was correlated with a heterogeneity of vasopressin sensitivity in the hepatic lobule. There were more vasopressin\u2010binding sites, vasopressin\u2010induced InsP3 production and V1a vasopressin receptor mRNAs in perivenous than in periportal cells. Therefore, we propose that hormone receptor density determines the cellular sensitivity gradient from the peripheral to the central zones of the liver cell plate, thus the starting cell and the direction of intercellular Ca2+ waves, leading to directional activation of Ca2+\u2010dependent processes.",

        "abstract": "Intercellular calcium signals are propagated in multicellular hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The stimulation of connected hepatocytes by glycogenolytic agonists induces reproducible sequences of intracellular calcium concentration increases, resulting in unidirectional intercellular calcium waves. Hepatocytes are characterized by a gradient of vasopressin binding sites from the periportal to perivenous areas of the cell plate in hepatic lobules. Also, coordination of calcium signals between neighboring cells requires the presence of the agonist at each cell surface as well as gap junction permeability. We present a model based on the junctional coupling of several hepatocytes differing in sensitivity to the agonist and thus in the intrinsic period of calcium oscillations. In this model, each hepatocyte displays repetitive calcium spikes with a slight phase shift with respect to neighboring cells, giving rise to a phase wave. The orientation of the apparent calcium wave is imposed by the direction of the gradient of hormonal sensitivity. Calcium spikes are coordinated by the diffusion across junctions of small amounts of inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphos phate (InsP3). Theoretical predictions from this model are confirmed experimentally.

        "abstract": "Glycogenolytic agonists induce coordinated Ca(2+) oscillations in multicellular rat hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The coordination of intercellular Ca(2+) signals requires functional gap-junction coupling. The mechanisms ensuring this coordination are not precisely known. We investigated possible roles of Ca(2+) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) as a coordinating messengers for Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes. Application of ionomycin or of supra-maximal concentrations of agonists show that Ca(2+) does not significantly diffuse between connected hepatocytes, although gap junctions ensure the passage of small signaling molecules, as demonstrated by FRAP experiments. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes can be favored by a rise in the level of InsP(3), via the increase of agonist concentrations, or by a shift in the affinity of InsP(3) receptor for InsP(3). In the same line, coordination cannot be achieved if the InsP(3) is rapidly metabolized by InsP(3)-phosphatase in one cell of the multiplet. These results demonstrate that even if small amounts of Ca(2+) diffuse across gap junctions, they most probably do not play a significant role in inducing a coordinated Ca(2+) signal among connected hepatocytes. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) oscillations is fully dependent on the diffusion of InsP(3) between neighboring cells.",

        "abstract": "Intercellular signaling is highly coordinated in excitable tissues such as heart, but the organization of intercellular signaling in epithelia is less clear. We examined Ca2+ signaling in hepatoma cells expressing the hepatocyte gap junction protein connexin32 (cx32) or the cardiac gap junction protein cx43, plus a fluorescently tagged V1avasopressin receptor (V1aR). Release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in wild type cells increased Ca2+ in the injected cell but not in neighboring cells, while the Ca2+ signal spread to neighbors when gap junctions were expressed. Photorelease of caged Ca2+ rather than InsP3 resulted in a small increase in Ca2+that did not spread to neighbors with or without gap junctions. However, photorelease of Ca2+ in cells stimulated with low concentrations of vasopressin resulted in a much larger increase in Ca2+, which spread to neighbors via gap junctions. Cells expressing tagged V1aR similarly had increased sensitivity to vasopressin, and could signal to neighbors via gap junctions. Higher concentrations of vasopressin elicited Ca2+ signals in all cells. In cx32 or cx43 but not in wild type cells, this signaling was synchronized and began in cells expressing the tagged V1aR. Thus, intercellular Ca2+ signals in epithelia are organized by three factors: 1) InsP3 must be generated in each cell to support a Ca2+ signal in that cell; 2) gap junctions are necessary to synchronize Ca2+ signals among cells; and 3) cells with relatively increased expression of hormone receptor will initiate Ca2+ signals and thus serve as pacemakers for their neighbors. Together, these factors may allow epithelia to act in an integrated, organ-level fashion rather than as a collection of isolated cells.",

        "abstract": "Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is a plastic process during which the mechanisms that coordinate liver mass restoration compensate one another through a complex regulatory network of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. Vasopressin, an agonist that triggers highly organized Ca2+ signals in the liver, may be one of these factors, although little in vivo evidence is available in support of this hypothesis. We provide evidence that hypothalamic vasopressin secretion is stimulated early after partial hepatectomy. Although hepatocytes were fully responsive to vasopressin during the first hours of regeneration, they became desensitized and exhibited slow oscillating Ca2+ responses to vasopressin on the following days. On the first day, hepatocyte V1a receptor density decreased and its lobular gradient increased in hepatectomized rats. By antagonizing the V1a receptor in vivo, we demonstrated that vasopressin contributes to NF\u2010\u03baB and cyclin (D1 and A) activation, to hepatocyte progression in the cell cycle, and to liver mass restoration. Finally, vasopressin exerted a choleretic effect shortly after hepatectomy, both in the isolated perfused liver and in the intact rat. In conclusion, we provide compelling in vivo evidence that vasopressin contributes significantly to growth initiation and bile flow stimulation in the early stages of liver regeneration.",

        "title": "Vasopressin Increases Locomotion through a V1a Receptor in Orexin/Hypocretin Neurons: Implications for Water Homeostasis",
        "abstract": "Water homeostasis is a critical challenge to survival for land mammals. Mice display increased locomotor activity when dehydrated, a behavior that improves the likelihood of locating new sources of water and simultaneously places additional demands on compromised hydration levels. The neurophysiology underlying this well known behavior has not been previously elucidated. We report that the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this response. AVP and oxytocin directly induced depolarization and an inward current in orexin/hypocretin neurons. AVP-induced activation of orexin neurons was inhibited by a V1a receptor (V1aR)-selective antagonist and was not observed in V1aR knock-out mice, suggesting an involvement of V1aR. Subsequently activation of phospholipase C\u03b2 triggers an increase in intracellular calcium by both calcium influx through nonselective cation channels and calcium release from calcium stores in orexin neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of AVP or water deprivation increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice, but not in transgenic mice lacking orexin neurons. V1aR knock-out mice were less active than wild-type mice. These results suggest that the activation of orexin neurons by AVP or oxytocin has an important role in the regulation of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. This system appears to play a key role in water deprivation-induced hyperlocomotor activity, a response to dehydration that increases the chance of locating water in nature.",

        "title": "Ghrelin Potentiates Miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents in Supraoptic Magnocellular Neurones",
        "abstract": "Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide discovered in the stomach as a ligand of the orphan G\u2010protein coupled receptor, and participates in the regulation of growth hormone (GH) release. Previous studies have demonstrated that ghrelin suppressed water intake and stimulated the secretion of arginine vasopressin in rats. We examined the effect of ghrelin on the excitatory synaptic inputs to the magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) using whole\u2010cell patch\u2010clamp recordings in in vitro rat and mouse brain slice preparations. The application of ghrelin (10\u22127\u223c10\u22126\u2003m) caused a significant increase in the frequency of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in a dose\u2010related manner without affecting the amplitude. The increased frequency of the spontaneous EPSCs persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 \u03bcM). Des\u2010n\u2010octanoyl ghrelin (10\u22126\u2003m) did not have a significant effect on the mEPSCs. The ghrelin\u2010induced potentiation of the mEPSCs was significantly suppressed by previous exposure to the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) blocker, ruthenium red (10 \u03bcM) and GH secretagougue type 1a receptor selective antagonist, BIM28163 (10 \u03bcm). The effects of ghrelin on the supraoptic MNCs in trpv1 knockout mice were significantly attenuated compared to those in wild\u2010type mice counterparts. These results suggest that ghrelin participates in the regulation of synaptic inputs to the MNCs in the SON via interaction with the GH secretagogue type 1a receptor, and that the TRPV1 channel may be involved in ghrelin\u2010induced potentiation of mEPSCs to the MNCs in the SON.",

        "title": "Local infusion of ghrelin enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory through activation of phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase in the dentate gyrus of adult rats",
        "abstract": "Ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone, is mainly produced by the stomach and released into the circulation. Ghrelin receptors (growth hormone secretagogue receptors) are expressed throughout the brain, including the hippocampus. The activation of ghrelin receptors facilitates high\u2010frequency stimulation (HFS)\u2010induced long\u2010term potentiation (LTP) in vitro, and also improves learning and memory. Herein, we report that a single infusion of ghrelin into the hippocampus led to long\u2010lasting potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and population spikes (PSs) in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats. This potentiation was accompanied by a reduction in paired\u2010pulse depression of the EPSP slope, an increase in paired\u2010pulse facilitation of the PS amplitude, and an enhancement of EPSP\u2013spike coupling, suggesting the involvement of both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Meanwhile, ghrelin infusion time\u2010dependently increased the phosphorylation of Akt\u2010Ser473, a downstream molecule of phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase (PI3K). Interestingly, PI3K inhibitors, but not NMDA receptor antagonist, inhibited ghrelin\u2010induced potentiation. Although ghrelin had no effect on the induction of HFS\u2010induced LTP, it prolonged the expression of HFS\u2010induced LTP through extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. The Morris water maze test showed that ghrelin enhanced spatial memory, and that this was prevented by pretreatment with PI3K inhibitor. Taken together, the findings show that: (i) a single infusion of ghrelin induced a new form of synaptic plasticity by activating the PI3K signaling pathway, without HFS and NMDA receptor activation; (ii) a single infusion of ghrelin also enhanced the maintenance of HFS\u2010induced LTP through ERK activation; and (iii) repetitive infusion of ghrelin enhanced spatial memory by activating the PI3K signaling pathway. Thus, we propose that the ghrelin signaling pathway could have therapeutic value in cognitive deficits.",

        "abstract": "Ghrelin is an orexigenic brain-gut hormone promoting feeding and regulating energy metabolism in human and rodents. An increasing number of studies have reported that ghrelin and its identified receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), produces remarkably wide and complex functions and biological effects on specific populations of neurons in central nervous system. In this study, we sought to explore the in vivo effects of acute ghrelin exposure on lateral amygdala (LA) neurons at the physiological and behavioral levels. In vivo extracellular single-unit recordings showed that ghrelin with the concentration of several nanomolars (nM) stimulated spontaneous firing of the LA neurons, an effect that was dose-dependent and could be blocked by co-application of a GHS-R1a antagonist D-Lys3-GHRP-6. We also found that D-Lys3-GHRP-6 inhibited spontaneous firing of the LA neurons in a dose-dependent manner, revealing that tonic GHS-R1a activity contributes to orchestrate the basal activity of the LA neurons. Behaviorally, we found that microinfusion of ghrelin (12 ng) into LA before training interfered with the acquisition of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) as tested at 24 h after conditioning. Pre-treatment with either purified IgG against GHS-R1a or GHS-R1a antagonist blocked ghrelin\u2019s effect on CTA memory acquisition. Ghrelin (12 ng) had no effect on CTA memory consolidation or the expression of acquired CTA memory; neither did it affect the total liquid consumption of tested rats. Altogether, our data indicated that ghrelin locally infused into LA blocks acquisition of CTA and its modulation effects on neuronal firing may be involved in this process.",

        "abstract": "Finding food sources is a prerequisite for an acute food intake. This process is initiated by ghrelin released from X/A-like cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Because food finding often depends on olfaction, the question arises whether ghrelin may affect the responsiveness of the olfactory system. Monitoring odor-induced activation of the mouse olfactory epithelium via Egr1 expression revealed that after a nasal application of ghrelin, more sensory neurons responded upon odor exposure indicating an increased responsiveness. The higher reactivity of olfactory neurons was accompanied with an increased activity of receptor-specific glomeruli. In search for mechanisms underlying the ghrelin-mediated sensitization of olfactory neurons, it was shown that Ghsr1a, the ghrelin receptor gene, but not the hormone itself was expressed in the olfactory epithelium. Further analysis of isolated cells revealed that the receptor was in fact expressed in mature olfactory sensory neurons. Treatment with a ghrelin receptor antagonist abolished the ghrelin effect, strengthening the notion that ghrelin and its receptor are responsible for the enhanced neuronal responsiveness. In contrast to the effects of the \"hunger\" hormone ghrelin, the short-term \"satiety\" hormone PYY3-36 did not affect olfactory responsiveness. The results demonstrate that ghrelin, which signals acute hunger, renders the olfactory system more responsive to odors.",

Acyl ghrelin treatment in vivo and in vitro also shows protective capacity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we used ghrelin knockout (KO) and their wild\u2010type littermates to test whether or not endogenous ghrelin is protective in a mouse model of AD, in which human amyloid \u03b2 peptide 1\u201040 (A\u03b21\u201040) was injected into the lateral ventricles i.c.v. Recognition memory, using the novel object recognition task, was significantly impaired in ghrelin KO mice and after i.c.v. A\u03b21\u201040 treatment. These deficits could be prevented by acyl ghrelin injections for 7 days. Spatial orientation, as assessed by the Y\u2010maze task, was also significantly impaired in ghrelin KO mice and after i.c.v. A\u03b21\u201040 treatment. These deficits could be prevented by acyl ghrelin injections for 7 days. Ghrelin KO mice had deficits in olfactory discrimination; however, neither i.c.v. A\u03b21\u201040 treatment, nor acyl ghrelin injections affected olfactory discrimination. We used stereology to show that ghrelin KO and A\u03b21\u201040 increased the total number of glial fibrillary acidic protein expressing astrocytes and ionised calcium\u2010binding adapter expressing microglial in the rostral hippocampus. Finally, A\u03b21\u201040 blocked long\u2010term potentiation induced by high\u2010frequency stimulation and this effect could be acutely blocked with co\u2010administration of acyl ghrelin. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that ghrelin deletion affects memory performance and also that acyl ghrelin treatment may delay the onset of early events of AD. This supports the idea that acyl ghrelin treatment may be therapeutically beneficial with respect to restricting disease progression in AD.",

An appetite for memory The hippocampus serves a critical role in memory formation and cognition. Hippocampal lesions are among the earliest changes in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD); however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these alterations remain unclear. By using autoptic brain samples from patients with AD and a mouse model of AD, Tian et al. show that in the hippocampus, pathologic \u03b2-amyloid directly binds and inhibits the receptor for the \u201chunger hormone\u201d ghrelin (GHSR1\u03b1). In the animal model, the binding blocked the GHSR1\u03b1-mediated dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) activation, leading to synaptic plasticity impairments and memory loss. Simultaneous pharmacological activation of GHSR1\u03b1 and DRD1 rescued synaptic plasticity and spatial memory loss in AD mice. Hippocampal lesions are a defining pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie hippocampal synaptic injury in AD have not been fully elucidated. Current therapeutic efforts for AD treatment are not effective in correcting hippocampal synaptic deficits. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1\u03b1 (GHSR1\u03b1) is critical for hippocampal synaptic physiology. Here, we report that GHSR1\u03b1 interaction with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) suppresses GHSR1\u03b1 activation, leading to compromised GHSR1\u03b1 regulation of dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) in the hippocampus from patients with AD. The simultaneous application of the selective GHSR1\u03b1 agonist MK0677 with the selective DRD1 agonist SKF81297 rescued Ghsr1\u03b1 function from A\u03b2 inhibition, mitigating hippocampal synaptic injury and improving spatial memory in an AD mouse model.

Recent researches have shown that the co-activation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1\u03b1 (GHSR1\u03b1) and dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) could recover the function of hippocampal synaptic and cognition.

R-square was chosen to evaluate the accuracy of these artificial intelligent models. For the GHSR1\u03b1 agonist dataset, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Linear Ridge Regression (LRR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and boost GRNN achieved good results; the R-square of the test set of these models reached 0.900, 0.813, 0.708, and 0.802, respectively.

According to these values of R-square, it is obvious that boost GRNN and SVM have better adaptability for different data sets and boost GRNN is more accurate than SVM. To evaluate the reliability of screening results, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments were performed to make sure that candidates were docked well in the protein binding site.
