        "title": "Effect of intraarticular glycosaminoglycan polysulfate treatment on patellofemoral pain syndrome. A prospective, randomized double-blind trial comparing glycosaminoglycan polysulfate with placebo and quadriceps muscle exercises.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the effects of intraarticular (IA) injections of glycosaminoglycan polysulfate (GAGPS) plus basic conservative treatment with the effects of placebo injections plus conservative treatment and with the effects of conservative treatment alone in patients with chronic patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe treated 53 patients who presented with chronic PFPS in 1 knee, according to 1 of the 3 protocols, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Basic conservative treatment consisted of a 6-week program of quadriceps muscle exercise, elimination of symptom-producing activities, and oral doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Physiologic saline served as placebo for injection. During the 6-week treatment period, 5 injections were given 1 week apart. Along with measurements of quadriceps strength, standardized subjective, functional, and clinical assessments were performed at presentation, after 6 weeks of treatment, and after 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults at 6 months indicated that IA injections of GAGPS or saline did not result in significant improvement beyond the good results achieved by the basic conservative treatment alone. More than two-thirds of the patients in each group experienced complete recovery.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNeither the GAGPS injections nor the physiologic saline injections are more effective than conservative therapy in the treatment of chronic PFPS. Restoration of normal quadriceps muscle function to the affected knee seems to be crucial in treating PFPS.",

        "title": "Open Versus Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises for Patellofemoral Pain",
        "abstract": "The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of open versus closed kinetic chain exercises in the nonoperative management of patellofemoral pain. Sixty patients were randomized into a 5-week program that consisted of only closed kinetic chain exercises or only open kinetic chain exercises. Muscle characteristics, subjective symptoms, and functional performance were evaluated in this study at the time of the initial physical examination, at the end of the treatment period, and 3 months later. Both groups experienced a statistically significant decrease in pain and an increase in functional performance. This study shows that both open and closed kinetic chain exercise programs lead to an improved subjective and clinical outcome in patients with anterior knee pain. The few significantly better functional results for some of the tested parameters in the closed kinetic chain group suggest that this type of treatment is a little more effective than the open kinetic chain program in the treatment of these patients.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper. The source paper concludes that restoration of normal quadriceps muscle function is crucial in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome, and this paper evaluates the efficacy of different types of exercises (open versus closed kinetic chain exercises) in the nonoperative management of patellofemoral pain, building on the idea of muscle function restoration."

        "title": "Which factors predict outcome in the treatment program of anterior knee pain?",
        "abstract": "The goal of this prospective study was to determine the outcome\u2010predictive role of various parameters in the nonoperative treatment of chronic anterior knee pain patients. Thirty patients followed a five\u2010week treatment program, which consisted out of only closed kinetic chain exercises. Prior to this treatment all subjects were evaluated on muscular characteristics, subjective symptoms, weight, sex, duration of symptoms and functional performance. A multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that the reflex response time of m. vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) (P=0.041; 0.026), and the duration of symptoms (P=0.019; 0.045) were the only two parameters which were significantly associated with the outcome (evaluated by the Kujala score) at five weeks, and at three months. The shorter the duration of symptoms, or the faster the reflex response time of VMO prior to the treatment, the better the outcome after a closed kinetic chain exercise program. The statistical significance of these parameters in this study may be seen as an indication of the importance of these variables as predictors of the outcome of a closed kinetic chain strengthening program. Using this information, it seems clinically important to begin the treatment program before the anterior knee pain becomes more chronic and treatment results become less good.",

        "title": "Quadriceps angle and risk of injury among high school cross-country runners.",
        "abstract": "DESIGN\nProspective cohort study.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the relationship between quadriceps angle (Q-angle) and risk of lower extremity injury among adolescent cross-country runners.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nNo consensus exists on the role of the Q-angle as a risk factor for lower-extremity overuse injury, especially the effect of large Q-angle or right-left Q-angle difference.\n\n\nMETHODS AND MEASURES\nThe Q-angles of 393 high school cross-country runners, 13 to 19 years of age, were goniometrically measured in a static, standing position with quadriceps relaxed. The runners were followed during a cross-country season to assess lower extremity injuries resulting from running in practices or competitions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRunners with a Q-angle >20 degrees were at 1.7 times greater risk of injury (relative risk [RR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.4) compared with runners whose Q-angle was 10 degrees to <15 degrees . The RR estimates were similar among girls and boys. Runners with >4 degrees absolute right-left Q-angle difference were at 1.8 times greater risk (RR, 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.5) compared to runners with a smaller difference. Runners with a Q-angle >20 degrees were more likely to injure their knee, while runners with >4 degrees Q-angle difference were more likely to injure their shin. Runners with a Q-angle >20 degrees had greater time lost due to injury.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh school cross-country runners with large or asymmetric Q-angles may be at greater risk for running injury. Our study suggests that Q-angle measurement be included in preseason screening exams.",

        "abstract": "Background: Running is one the most common sports activity that is practiced throughout the world. This increase in popularity in running could gradually increase the incidence rate of injury thus contributing to overuse injuries. Research in the field of running injuries is vast and has been conducted over more than 40 years. It is however difficult to distinguish the exact cause of running injuries as the aetiologies are multifactoral and diverse.",
