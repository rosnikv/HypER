        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation is significantly reduced by prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulins (HBIG) or antiviral drugs in nonreplicating patients and by the combination of both drugs in replicating patients. However, the load of HBV DNA, which defines replicating status in patients undergoing liver transplantation, remains unclear. This study analyzes the correlation between the viral load, tested with a single amplified assay, at the time of liver transplantation, and the risk of hepatitis B recurrence in 177 HBV carriers who underwent transplantation in a single center from 1990 to 2002. Overall, HBV relapsed after surgery in 15 patients (8.5%) with a 5\u2010 and 8\u2010year actuarial rate of recurrence of 8% and 21%, respectively. After liver transplantation hepatitis B recurred in 9% of 98 selected subjects treated only with immune globulins and in 8% of 79 viremic patients who received immune globulins and lamivudine (P = NS). A linear correlation was observed between recurrence and viral load at the time of surgery. In transplant patients with HBV DNA higher than 100,000 copies/mL, 200\u201399,999 copies/mL, and DNA undetectable by amplified assay, hepatitis B recurred in 50%, 7.5%, and 0% of patients, respectively. Overall, a viral load higher than 100,000 copies/mL at the time of liver transplantation was significantly associated with hepatitis B recurrence (P = .0003). In conclusion, spontaneous or antiviral\u2010induced HBV DNA viral load at the time of surgery classifies the risk of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation and indicates the best prophylaxis strategy.

        "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the outcomes of liver transplant recipients receiving either lamivudine (LAM) monotherapy or LAM combined with low\u2010dose intramuscular (IM) hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) therapy. We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of patients that had had liver transplantation in a single center for HBV\u2010related liver diseases from December 1999 to June 2004. A total of 165 patients received LAM monotherapy (51 patients) or combined prophylaxis (114 patients) post\u2010liver transplantation (LT) with a mean follow\u2010up of 20.13 months. Hepatitis B relapsed in 21 patients of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers who received LAM monotherapy, with a 1\u2010 and 2\u2010yr actuarial risk of 27.4% and 39.7%. Recurrence occurred in 16 patients of 114 patients receiving the combined prophylaxis, with a 1\u2010 and 2\u2010yr recurrence rate of 13.5% and 15.2% (P= 0.024). A total of 25 cases (67.6%) with YMDD mutants were detected in all the 37 patients, 14 cases (66.7%) in the monotherapy group and 11 cases (68.8%) in the combination group. In conclusion, LAM and low\u2010dose intramuscular HBIG treatment demonstrates a better result than LAM monotherapy, as prophylaxis against post\u2010LT reinfection of the graft, but the safety and efficacy as a substitution for high\u2010dose intravenous HBIG with LAM needs to be investigated further.

        "abstract": "The prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence is essential after liver transplantation in patients infected with HBV. We evaluated the efficacy of primary high\u2010dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy in 639 HBV\u2010infected adult patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) between February 1997 and December 2004. The overall 5\u2010year survival rate was 80.7%, and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was the most common cause of late mortality. Pretransplant HBV replication was observed in 392 (61.3%) patients. The interval of 10,000\u2010IU HBIG administration to maintain antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen > 500 IU/L was 30 days in 11.4% patients, 40 to 50 days in 72.1%, and 60 days in 16.5%.

Overall 1\u2010year, 3\u2010year, 5\u2010year, and 10\u2010year HBV recurrence rates were 1.4%, 5.5%, 7.3%, and 8.5%, respectively. HBV recurrence occurred after a mean of 25.7 \u00b1 16.4 months after LDLT. After HBV recurrence, 5 of 9 patients died from rapidly progressive liver failure before treatment with adefovir, and only 1 of 29 patients died after treatment with adefovir. Need for frequent HBIG infusions (\u226430 days), active pretransplant HBV replication, and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence were significant risk factors for HBV recurrence and indications for combination therapy. Our posttransplant HBV prophylaxis regimen resulted in a 5\u2010year HBV recurrence rate of 7.3% and a mortality rate of 13.2% after HBV recurrence, showing the effectiveness of high\u2010dose HBIG monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy.

        "abstract": "Background. The aim of this study was to analyze the combination with long-term, low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogs as prophylaxis for hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and to assess the risk factors of HBV recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Methods. One hundred sixty patients undergoing OLT with HBV-related liver disease make up the cohort studied. Long-term, low dosage of HBIG in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs were used as prophylaxis for HBV recurrence after OLT. Patient preoperative data were collected by a retrospective method, and the rate and risk factors of HBV recurrence post-OLT after a long-term follow-up were analyzed. Results. Nineteen patients developed hepatitis B recurrence for a rate of recurrence of 11.88% (19/160). There was no significant correlation between HBV recurrence after OLT and the level of HBV DNA, HBeAg state pre-OLT, or the use of nucleoside analog drug therapy pre-OLT (P>0.05). Of 19 patients with HBV recurrence, 17 patients used Lamivudine, and HBV YMDD mutants were detected in nine cases. The HBV-YMDD mutation was the major reason for recurrence of HBV in our study (P<0.001). Conclusions. Long-term use of combination prophylaxis with nucleoside analogs and low-dose HBIG can effectively prevent hepatitis B recurrence after OLT, and that a positive preoperative serum HBV DNA status did not affect the recurrence rate of HBV post-OLT. Preoperative nucleoside analogs therapy is unlikely to be obligatory if the patients received effective combination prophylaxis postoperatively. HBV YMDD mutation is the primary reason for HBV recurrence in patients treated with Lamivudine after OLT.",

        "abstract": "Background. Tenofovir therapy has been found to be efficient in treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) in nontransplant patients. However, in the setting of solid-organ transplantation, the efficacy of tenofovir has not been tested. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the clinical and biologic response and tolerance to tenofovir therapy in HBV-positive organ transplant recipients. Methods. Seven patients, three kidney, three liver, and one cardiac transplant recipients, with chronic HBV infection were partial responders to adefovir (n=7), lamivudine (n=7), or entecavir (n=5) therapy. Consequently, they were placed on tenofovir therapy (245 mg daily, which was adapted to renal function) alone (n=4) or in combination with lamivudine (n=3). Tenofovir therapy was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinitiation or at the last follow-up. Results. HBV DNA viral load (4.16 [2.03\u20135.56] log10 copies/mL at baseline) became significantly decreased to 3.15 (1.08\u20135.17), 2.88 (1.3\u20134.3), 3.53 (1.3\u20135.75), 3.33 (1.3\u20137.57), and 2.31 (1.3\u20134.81) log copies/mL at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttenofovir initiation and at last follow-up, respectively (P=0.02). Three patients were HBV DNA negative at the last follow-up. Liver enzyme levels did not change significantly throughout the follow-up period. Clinical and biologic tolerance was excellent. Conclusions. Even though HBV DNA clearance was not achieved in all patients, the results of this pilot study are encouraging and demonstrate that tenofovir therapy is safe and efficacious in treating HBV-positive organ transplant patients. However, a larger trial is needed to confirm these preliminary results.",

Aim The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NUCs prophylaxis (\u00b1HBIG) against HBV recurrence after LTx. Patients and methods This was a retrospective cohort-longitudinal study on 44 HBV-related post-LTx patients on anti-HBV prophylactic therapy. They included the entecavir (ETV)-based (n=34, 30 males) and the other NUC-based (n=10, 7 males) groups\u00b1HBIG. Results The median age was 63.5 (60\u201370) years in ETV and 62.5 (55\u201365) years in other NUCs groups. The mean follow-up duration was 6.09\u00b11.83 years in ETV-based group and 6.3\u00b11.89 years in other NUCs-based group. The mean ETV duration was 3.47\u00b13.04 years. In ETV+HBIG patients, none of them developed HBV recurrence throughout the \u00b18 years. In the 14 patients on ETV+other NUC+HBIG, four developed HBsAg positive and then transformed to HbsAb positive at the end of \u00b18 years without hepatitis or detectable HBV-DNA. Liver graft function showed nonsignificant difference for ETV-based patients, in comparison with other NUC groups (P=0.09). With subdivision, the graft function was maintained significantly better in ETV+HBIG or other NUCs+HBIG (P=0.04) groups. None of our patients reported NUCs-related complications or adverse effects. Conclusion ETV and other NUCs were effective and safe as a long-term prophylaxis of HBV recurrence after LTx, leading to a good graft function.

Treatment with entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) and the later released tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is highly effective at controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and, in the vast majority of patients, is well tolerated. No significant differences in viral suppression have been described among the different regimens, although an earlier achievement in biochemical response has been suggested first under TDF and recently under TAF. High barrier to resistance NAs rarely achieve hepatitis B surface antigen sero-clearance, and therefore should be maintained life-long in most cases. This has increased concerns about treatment-related toxicity, especially in patients under TDF with additional risk factors for kidney and bone impairment. TAF has shown a better bone and kidney safety profile than TDF, although it is not yet available worldwide due to its higher cost. Emergence of adverse events should be monitored since treatment-switch to ETV/TAF seems to be effective and safe in HBV mono-infected subjects. Finally, although an effective antiviral treatment leads to a clear improvement in clinical outcome of CHB patients; the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely avoided with viral suppression. Whether tenofovir-based regimens provide any additional benefit over ETV in HCC prevention remains unclear and requires further investigation.",

Our aim was to assess the usefulness of noninvasive markers for the identification of HBV inactive carriers (ICs) in a single-point evaluation and to design a predictive model for their identification. Methods This retrospective-prospective study included 343 consecutive HBeAg-negative individuals. Clinical, analytical, and virological data were collected, and a liver biopsy was performed if needed. Subjects were classified at the end of follow-up as ICs, chronic hepatitis B and gray zone.A predictive model was constructed, and validated by 1000-bootstrap samples. Results After 39 months of follow-up, 298 subjects were ICs, 36 were chronic hepatitis B CHB, and nine were gray zone. Eighty-nine (25.9%) individuals required a liver biopsy. Baseline HBV DNA hazard ratio (HR) 6.0, p<0.001), HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) (HR 6.5, p<0.001), and elastography (HR 4.6, p<0.001) were independently associated with the IC stage. The ACE score (HBV DNA, HBcrAg, elastography), obtained by bootstrapping, yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.925 (95% CI: 0.880\u20130.970, p<0.001) for identification of ICs. The AUROC for genotype D was 0.95, 0.96 for A, 0.90 for E, and 0.88 for H/F. An ACE score of <1 had a positive predictive value of 99.5%, and a score \u226412 points had a diagnostic accuracy of 93.8%. Conclusions Low baseline HBV DNA, HBcrAg, and liver stiffness were independently associated with the IC phase.

Aims To assess whether HBsAg level could discriminate different HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection subtypes with dissimilar quality of HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell response. Methods We recruited 63 HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection patients in which indirect markers of liver inflammation/fibrosis, portal pressure, viral load (VL), and HBV-specific CD8+ cell effector function were correlated with HBsAg level. Results A positive linear trend between HBsAg level and APRI, liver stiffness (LS), liver transaminases, and HBV VL, and a negative correlation with platelet count were observed. Frequency of cases with HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation against at least two HBV epitopes was higher in HBsAg < 1,000 IU/ml group. CD8+ T-cell expansion after HBVpolymerase456-63-specific stimulation was impaired in HBsAg > 1,000 IU/ml group, while the response against HBVcore18-27 was preserved and response against envelope183-91 was nearly abolished, regardless of HBsAg level.
