        "title": "Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe administration of growth hormone can attenuate the catabolic response to injury, surgery, and sepsis. However, the effect of high doses of growth hormone on the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the outcome in critically ill adults who are hospitalized for long periods is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out two prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in parallel involving 247 Finnish patients and 285 patients in other European countries who had been in an intensive care unit for 5 to 7 days and who were expected to require intensive care for at least 10 days. The patients had had cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple trauma, or acute respiratory failure. The patients received either growth hormone (mean [+/-SD] daily dose, 0.10 +/- 0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo until discharge from intensive care or for a maximum of 21 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe in-hospital mortality rate was higher in the patients who received growth hormone than in those who did not (P<0.001 for both studies). In the Finnish study, the mortality rate was 39 percent in the growth hormone group, as compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. The respective rates in the multinational study were 44 percent and 18 percent. The relative risk of death for patients receiving growth hormone was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.9) in the Finnish study and 2.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.5) in the multinational study. Among the survivors, the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital and the duration of mechanical ventilation were prolonged in the growth hormone group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with prolonged critical illness, high doses of growth hormone are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the effect of growth hormone (GH) treatment on skeletal muscle protein catabolism in patients with multiple organ failure in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n\nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA\nSkeletal muscle depletion affects the incidence of complications and the length of hospital stay. A protein-sparing effect of GH treatment in skeletal muscle of long-term ICU patients was hypothesized.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty critically ill ICU patients were randomized to treatment with GH (0.3 U/kg/day) or as controls. Percutaneous muscle biopsy samples were taken before and after a 5-day treatment period starting on day 3 to 42 of the patient's ICU stay. Protein content, protein synthesis, water, nucleic acids, and free amino acids in muscle were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe protein content decreased by 8% +/- 11% in the control patients, with no significant change in the GH group. The fractional synthesis rate of muscle proteins increased in the GH group by 33% +/- 48%, and muscle free glutamine increased by 207% +/- 327% in the GH group. Total intramuscular water increased by 12% +/- 14% in the control group as a result of an increase in extracellular water of 67% +/- 86%; these increases were not seen in the GH group. In contrast, the intracellular water increased by 6% +/- 8% in the GH group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with GH for 5 days in patients with multiple organ failure stimulated muscle protein synthesis, increased muscle free glutamine, and increased intracellular muscle water.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveAdministration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to critically ill adults in an attempt to attenuate catabolism was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Possible explanations included inhibition of glutamine release from skeletal muscle and consequent restriction of splanchnic glutamine supply. In this study, we examined the effects of rhGH on plasma glutamine levels and on muscle and liver glutamine concentrations and protein synthesis rates in sepsis. We investigated the possibility that administration of supplemental glutamine might ameliorate any adverse effects of rhGH. DesignProspective study in rats rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture. SettingUniversity hospital laboratory. SubjectsA total of 78 male Wistar rats in six groups. InterventionsAnimals received 6-hr tail vein infusions, commencing 18 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, of either (a) 0.9% sodium chloride, (b) a standard parenteral nutrition (PN) solution without glutamine, or (c) an isocaloric, isonitrogenous PN solution with glutamine. PN groups received 400 &mgr;g rhGH or equivolume 0.9% sodium chloride vehicle in a divided subcutaneous and intravenous dose at PN commencement. Sacrifice was at the end of the infusion period. A further group was unoperated and uninfused and killed at 24 hrs as baseline controls. Measurements and Main ResultsGlutamine concentrations were measured by fluorometry. Protein synthesis in muscle and liver was measured by a \u201cflooding-dose\u201d technique employing l-[4-H]phenylalanine. Plasma glutamine was increased after cecal ligation and puncture except in the saline and glutamine with rhGH animals. Muscle glutamine was reduced after cecal ligation and puncture and was significantly lower in animals receiving standard PN with rhGH vs. saline alone. Liver glutamine was increased in animals receiving saline and those receiving standard PN with rhGH. PN, with or without glutamine, increased muscle protein synthesis, and the administration of rhGH tended to further increase this effect. Neither PN, glutamine, nor rhGH had an effect on the increased liver protein synthesis characteristic of sepsis. ConclusionsIn sepsis, increased muscle protein synthesis with PN and rhGH administration is not associated with increased muscle glutamine levels. Administration of rhGH does not result in reduced liver glutamine levels or rates of hepatic protein synthesis. PN containing glutamine was no more efficacious than standard PN at increasing muscle protein synthesis.",

        "title": "Liver albumin synthesis in sepsis in the rat: influence of parenteral nutrition, glutamine and growth hormone.",
        "abstract": "The effect of sepsis on liver synthesis of albumin remains controversial, with studies in man suggesting that synthesis increases, whereas in animals increased, decreased and unaltered synthesis have been reported. To reconcile these conflicting data, total and relative albumin synthesis was measured in rats 24 h after caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) by immunoprecipitation of albumin following a flooding dose of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine. Following CLP, animals were starved for 18 h and then received intravenous infusions of saline or parenteral nutrition (PN) with or without glutamine for 6 h. In animals receiving PN, parenteral injections of growth hormone (GH) or saline vehicle were also administered. Fractional rate of liver total protein synthesis was elevated and total albumin synthesis rate was reduced in all CLP groups when compared with non-operated animals. Total albumin synthesis was also lower in all animals receiving PN than those receiving saline alone, although these differences did not attain statistical significance, except for the group receiving PN+GH. Relative albumin synthesis was also reduced after CLP, and was significantly lower in animals receiving PN than in those receiving saline alone. These findings suggest that in sepsis hepatic protein synthesis is reprioritized away from the production of albumin towards the production of acute-phase proteins and that this change is not influenced by the provision of nutritional support, glutamine or the administration of GH.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background & Aim: to analyze the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of parenteral immunonutrition (PN). Methods: prospective clinical trial of a group of 105 patients operated on for gastric carcinoma between 2001-2003. During the postoperative period, patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups: standard PN (A), PN + glu-tamine (B) and PN + omega-3-FA (C). The rate and type of complications, hepatic and renal function, cost and treatment tolerance in all groups were analyzed. Results: postoperative complications were observed in 11 patients (36,6%) in group A, in 7 (23,3%) in B and in 8 (26,6%) in C. The most common complication was pneumonia. Prealbumin concentration and TLC increased faster in groups B and C. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the immunonutrition groups. The cost of PN was highest in C group, while cost of hospital stay was longer in A. Conclusions: immunostimulating parenteral nutrition helps to reduce the number of infectious complications, improves the function of the immune system, and has no influence on surgical complications, hepatic and renal function and protein synthesis. The cost of immunostimulating treatment based on omega-3-unsaturated fatty acids is higher than standard.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess the safety and efficacy of an early enteral pharmaconutrition supplement containing glutamine dipeptides, antioxidative vitamins and trace elements, and butyrate in critically ill, septic patients. Design:A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Setting:Adult intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients:Fifty-five critically ill, septic patients requiring enteral feeding. Interventions:Patients received either an enteral supplement (500 mL of Intestamin, Fresenius Kabi) containing conditionally essential nutrients or a control solution via the nasogastric route for up to 10 days. Inclusion occurred within 24 hrs of intensive care unit admission. Additionally, patients received enteral feeding with an immunonutrition formula (experimental group) or standard formula (control group) initiated within 48 hrs after enrollment. Measurements and Main Results:Organ dysfunction was assessed by daily total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score over the 10-day study period in both patient groups. Patients receiving the experimental supplement showed a significantly faster decline in the regression slopes of delta daily total SOFA score over time compared with control. The difference between the regression coefficients of the two slopes was significant irrespective of the level of analysis: intent to treat \u22120.32 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; per protocol \u22120.34 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; and completers (patients receiving \u226580% of the calculated caloric target over a period of 6 days), \u22120.26 vs. \u22120.16, p = .0005.

        "title": "Selenium and glutamine supplements: where are we heading? A critical care perspective",
        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThere is considerable interest in glutamine and selenium in critical care as both offer the potential to enhance host defences, through different but complimentary mechanisms and may reduce subsequent infections and mortality. The SIGNET trial (randomized controlled factorial trial) is the largest, critical care study of both supplements. The data have been presented publicly, but the data are not published or available for review and will therefore not be discussed fully in this update. In the present review I will explore the recently available (past 1\u20132 years) published literature. Recent findingsThe current literature demonstrates that there are currently insufficient data to enable confident recommendations on the optimal route, timing, duration and dosage of each of these nutritional supplements. The pending results of SIGNET, the largest critical care trial of parenteral nutrition supplemented by glutamine and or selenium promises to clarify some of the current ambiguities and inform future practice. SummaryTo be able to confidently establish or refute the hypothesis that either glutamine or selenium alone or in combination improves outcome in critical care requires a well designed prospective randomized controlled trial. To design such a trial we require the optimal dose and duration of the nutritional supplement (balancing efficacy and toxicity, ease of administration and cost) and then conduct an adequately powered trial. Such a trial is still lacking for these two agents. There are some supportive data for selenium but the case is less strong for parenteral glutamine and weakest for enteral glutamine.",

        "title": "Selenium for preventing cancer.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis review is an update of the first Cochrane publication on selenium for preventing cancer (Dennert 2011).Selenium is a metalloid with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancers.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTwo research questions were addressed in this review: What is the evidence for:1. an aetiological relation between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans? and2. the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans?\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to February 2013 week 1), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 6), CancerLit (February 2004) and CCMed (February 2011). As MEDLINE now includes the journals indexed in CancerLit, no further searches were conducted in this database after 2004.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included prospective observational studies (cohort studies including sub-cohort controlled studies and nested case-control studies) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with healthy adult participants (18 years of age and older).\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nFor observational studies, we conducted random effects meta-analyses when five or more studies were retrieved for a specific outcome. For RCTs, we performed random effects meta-analyses when two or more studies were available. The risk of bias in observational studies was assessed using forms adapted from the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort and case-control studies; the criteria specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were used to evaluate the risk of bias in RCTs.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 55 prospective observational studies (including more than 1,100,000 participants) and eight RCTs (with a total of 44,743 participants). For the observational studies, we found lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.91, N = 8) and cancer mortality (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93, N = 6) associated with higher selenium exposure. Gender-specific subgroup analysis provided no clear evidence of different effects in men and women (P value 0.47), although cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05, N = 6) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, N = 2). The most pronounced decreases in risk of site-specific cancers were seen for stomach, bladder and prostate cancers. However, these findings have limitations due to study design, quality and heterogeneity that complicate interpretation of the summary statistics. Some studies suggested that genetic factors may modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk-a hypothesis that deserves further investigation.In RCTs, we found no clear evidence that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.17, two studies, N = 4765) or cancer-related mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32, two studies, N = 18,698), and this finding was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to studies with low risk of bias. The effect on prostate cancer was imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.14, four studies, N = 19,110), and when the analysis was limited to trials with low risk of bias, the interventions showed no effect (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14, three studies, N = 18,183). The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was increased (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17, three studies, N = 1900). Results of two trials-the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPCT) and the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial (SELECT)-also raised concerns about possible increased risk of type 2 diabetes, alopecia and dermatitis due to selenium supplements. An early hypothesis generated by NPCT that individuals with the lowest blood selenium levels at baseline could reduce their risk of cancer, particularly of prostate cancer, by increasing selenium intake has not been confirmed by subsequent trials. As the RCT participants were overwhelmingly male (94%), gender differences could not be systematically assessed.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nAlthough an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution. These studies have many limitations, including issues with assessment of exposure to selenium and to its various chemical forms, heterogeneity, confounding and other biases. Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types.RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results, although the most recent studies, characterised by a low risk of bias, found no beneficial effect on cancer risk, more specifically on risk of prostate cancer, as well as little evidence of any influence of baseline selenium status. Rather, some trials suggest harmful effects of selenium exposure. To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans.",

        "abstract": "Mechanistic data have revealed a key role for selenium (Se) and selenoproteins in biological pathways known to be altered in multifactorial diseases, such as cellular maintenance, response to oxidative stress and correct protein folding. Although epidemiological studies indicate that low Se intake is linked to increased risk for various chronic diseases, supplementation trials have given confusing outcomes, suggesting that additional genetic factors could affect the relationship between Se and health. Genetic data support this hypothesis, as risk for several chronic diseases, in particular cancer, was linked to a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) altering Se metabolism, selenoprotein synthesis or activity. Interactions between SNPs in selenoprotein genes, SNPs in related molecular pathways and biomarkers of Se status were found to further modulate the genetic risk carried by the SNPs. Taken together, nutritional genomics approaches uncovered the potential implication of some selenoproteins as well as the influence of complex interactions between genetic variants and Se status in the aetiology of several chronic diseases. This review discusses the results from these genetic associations in the context of selenoprotein functions and epidemiological investigations and emphasises the need to assess in future studies the combined contribution of Se status, environmental stress, and multiple or individual SNPs to disease risk.",

        "abstract": "Inflammation is the driving force in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its link to oxidative stress and carcinogenesis has long been accepted. The antioxidant system of the intestinal mucosa in IBD is compromised resulting in increased oxidative injury. This defective antioxidant system may be the result of genetic variants in antioxidant genes, which can represent susceptibility factors for IBD, namely Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the antioxidant genes SOD2 (rs4880) and GPX1 (rs1050450) were genotyped in a Portuguese population comprising 436 Crohn\u2019s disease and 367 ulcerative colitis patients, and 434 healthy controls. We found that the AA genotype in GPX1 is associated with ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.93, adjusted P-value = 0.037). Moreover, we found nominal significant associations between SOD2 and Crohn\u2019s disease susceptibility and disease subphenotypes but these did not withstand the correction for multiple testing. These findings indicate a possible link between disease phenotypes and antioxidant genes. These results suggest a potential role for antioxidant genes in IBD pathogenesis and should be considered in future association studies.",

        "title": "Nonenzymatic Serum Antioxidant Capacity in IBD and Its Association with the Severity of Bowel Inflammation and Corticosteroids Treatment",
        "abstract": "Background and objectives: Oxidative stress signalling plays a monumental role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Reduction of oxidative stress might control inflammation, block tissue damage, and reverse natural history of IBD. We assessed the serum concentrations of free thiols (FT) and uric acid (SUA), together constituting a large part of nonenzymatic serum antioxidant capacity, as well as total antioxidant status (TAS) with reference to IBD phenotype, activity, co-occurrence of anemia, and treatment with azathioprine (AZA) and corticosteroids (CS). Additionally, we appraised the potential of uric acid, thiol stress, and TAS as mucosal healing (MH) markers in ulcerative colitis. Materials and methods: SUA, FT, and TAS were measured colorimetrically using, respectively, uricase, Ellman\u2019s and 2,2\u2032-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) methods. Results: The study group consisted of 175 individuals: 57 controls, 71 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 47 Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) patients. When compared to controls, SUA levels were significantly lower in patients with CD, and FT and TAS levels were significantly lower in patients with CD and UC. In UC patients, SUA, FT, and TAS inversely correlated with the severity of bowel inflammation. As MH markers, SUA displayed better overall accuracy and higher specificity than FT. In active CD, FT, and SUA were significantly lower in patients with anemia. FT was significantly lower in patients treated with corticosteroids. Conclusions: IBD patients, regardless the disease phenotype, have systemic thiol stress, depleted total antioxidant capacity, and reduced concentrations of uric acid, reflecting, to various degrees, clinical and local disease activity as well as presence of anaemia, the most common extraintestinal manifestation of IBD. Evaluation of systemic total antioxidant status may be useful in noninvasive assessment of mucosal healing. Our findings on thiol stress provide an additional aspect on adverse effects of corticosteroids therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Selenium-containing amino acids reportedly have anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, but it remains unknown if selenium-containing amino acids can be used to treat IBD. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two selenium-containing amino acids \u2013 selenocysteine and selenocystine \u2013 on oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD. Methodology C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the following six groups: control, DSS, DSS+selenocysteine, DSS+selenocystine, DSS+sodium selenite, and DSS+N-acetylcysteine (NAC). IBD was induced by 3% DSS. Pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)] and markers for oxidative and anti-oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] were measured using immunohistochemical analysis. Results Selenocysteine and selenocystine significantly attenuated IBD-related symptoms, including preventing weight loss, decreasing disease activity index (DAI) scores, and increasing colon length. Selenocysteine and selenocystine significantly ameliorated the DSS-induced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by a reduction in ROS and MDA activity and an increase in SOD and GPx activity. IL-1, MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly increased in the IBD mice, while treatment with the selenium-containing amino acids significantly reduced the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo safety analysis showed minimal side effects of the selenium-containing amino acids. Conclusion We found that selenocysteine and selenocystine ameliorated DSS-induced IBD via reducing oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation, indicating that selenium-containing amino acids could be a novel therapeutic option for patients with IBD.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the effects of selenium-containing amino acids on oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced IBD. While it does not directly reference the source paper, it explores the role of oxidative stress in IBD, which is related to the source paper's findings on nonenzymatic serum antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, the source paper's findings on the relationship between antioxidant capacity and IBD severity could be seen as a sub-hypothesis for this paper's investigation of selenium-containing amino acids as a therapeutic option."

        "title": "Comparison of Selenium-Enriched Lactobacillus paracasei, Selenium-Enriched Yeast, and Selenite for the Alleviation of DSS-Induced Colitis in Mice",
        "abstract": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been found to have decreased immune function. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element that is beneficial for human health, which has a significant stimulating effect on immune function. We compared the effects of different Se forms on the alleviation of colitis in DSS-induced mice. Moreover, we also aimed to determine whether Se-enriched Lactobacillus paracasei CCFM 1089 could be used as a new organic Se supplement. Different Se supplements (Se-enriched L. paracasei CCFM 1089, Se-enriched yeast and sodium selenite) were given to Se-deficient mice suffering from colitis. Se-enriched L. paracasei CCFM 1089, which is based on selenocysteine (SeCys), had similar effects in terms of reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors to Se-enriched yeast; however, selenase activity in the Se-enriched L. paracasei CCFM 1089-treated mice was higher than that in other treatment groups. In addition, Se-enriched L. paracasei CCFM 1089 could better protect the intestinal mucosa, which increased the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) in mice. Thus Se-enriched L. paracasei CCFM 1089 was shown to alleviate IBD, suggesting that it has potential as a good organic Se supplement.",

        "title": "Novel selenium-enriched Pichia kudriavzevii as a dietary supplement to alleviate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice by modulating the gut microbiota and host metabolism.",
        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses persistent challenges due to its chronic and recurrent nature, exacerbated by the unsatisfactory outcomes of the traditional treatment approaches. In this study, we developed a dietary supplement, selenium-enriched Pichia kudriavzevii (SeY), to alleviate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. The newly developed functional food shows dual-functional activity, acting both as a probiotic and a reliable source of organic selenium. This study aimed to investigate the preventive effects of SeY against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that SeY, especially at high doses (HSeY), significantly ameliorated colitis symptoms, reduced colonic damage, attenuated inflammatory responses, and mitigated oxidative stress. Furthermore, HSeY strengthened intestinal barrier function by increasing goblet cell numbers, upregulating MUC2 expression, and enhancing tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin). Additionally, HSeY alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis by promoting the colonization of beneficial bacteria such as norank-f-Muribaculaceae and Bacteroides, while suppressing harmful microorganisms such as norank-f-norank-o-Clostridia-UCG-014. The altered gut microbiota also affected gut metabolism, with differential metabolites primarily associated with amino acids, such as tryptophan metabolism, contributing to the mitigation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Further studies involving antibiotic-mediated depletion of gut flora and fecal microbiota transfer trials corroborated that the preventive effect of HSeY against IBD relied on the gut microbiota. This study provides vital insights into colitis prevention and advances selenium-enriched fortified food-targeted nutritional interventions.",
