        "abstract": "1. The aims of this study were two-fold. First, to define ranges of blood esterase activities in three groups, namely young subjects, fit community dwelling elderly and frail, chronically hospitalised elderly subjects, and second, to determine whether low blood esterase activities in the frail patients could be altered by increasing their nutritional intake. 2. Plasma cholinesterase, aspirin esterase, paraoxonase and phenylacetate esterase activities were all significantly lower in the frail elderly compared with the young and fit elderly volunteers. The activity of red blood cell esterase was not different in the frail elderly. 3. Fourteen frail elderly patients were randomly assigned to receive either hospital meal provision plus supplemental feeding with Build-up (Nestle) and Maxijul (SHS Ltd) or hospital provision alone for 8 weeks. Dietary intake was measured for all patients at the start of the study and at week 8. Measurements of blood esterase (cholinesterase, phenylacetate esterase, paraoxonase, aspirin esterase and red blood cell esterase), albumin and anthropometric indices (weight, triceps skinfold thickness and mid arm circumference) were made before the study and repeated at week 4 and 8. 4. There was a significant increase in plasma cholinesterase at week 4 (P < 0.05) but this was not statistically significant at week 8. There were no significant changes in any of the other esterase activities or anthropometric measurements. 5. We conclude that the lower esterase activities of the frail chronically hospitalised elderly do not respond to dietary supplementation for a period of 8 weeks with routinely available products. The hypothesis that lower esterase activities are the direct result of undernutrition which would be corrected by dietary supplementation has not been supported by this study.",

Geriatric patients have impaired homeostasis and wide inter\u2010individual variability. Comprehensive geriatric assessment captures the complexity of the problems that characterize frail older patients and can be used to guide management, including prescribing. Prescribing for geriatric patients requires an understanding of the efficacy of the medication in frail older people, assessment of the risk of adverse drug events, discussion of the harm:benefit ratio with the patient, a decision about the dose regime and careful monitoring of the patient's response. This requires evaluation of evidence from clinical trials, application of the evidence to frail older people through an understanding of changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and attention to medication management issues. Given that most disease occurs in older people, and that older people are the major recipients of drug therapy in the Western world, increased research and a better evidence base is essential to guide clinicians who manage geriatric patients.",

        "title": "Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in the elderly",
        "abstract": "Aging involves progressive impairments in the functional reserve of multiple organs, which might also affect drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. In addition, the elderly population will develop multiple diseases and, consequently, often has to take several drugs. As the hepatic first-pass effect of highly cleared drugs could be reduced (due to decreases in liver mass and perfusion), the bioavailability of some drugs can be increased in the elderly. Significant changes in body composition occur with advancing age. Lipophilic drugs may have an increased volume of distribution (Vd) with a prolonged half-life, and water-soluble drugs tend to have a smaller Vd. In the elderly, hepatic drug clearance of some drugs can be reduced by up to 30% and CYP-mediated phase I reactions are more likely to be impaired than phase II metabolism, which is relatively preserved in the elderly. Concerning the most important CYP3A4 studies with human liver microsomes and clinical studies with the validated probe, midazolam, it is indicated that there are no significant differences in CYP3A4 activity between young and old populations. Finally, renal excretion is decreased (up to 50%) in about two thirds of elderly subjects, but confounding factors such as hypertension and coronary heart disease account also for a decline in kidney function. In conclusion, age-related physiological and pharmacokinetic changes as well as the presence of comorbidity and polypharmacy will complicate drug therapy in the elderly.",

        "title": "Analyzing Systolic-Diastolic Interval Interaction Characteristics in Diabetic Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy Progression",
        "abstract": "Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), one of the major complications in diabetes, if detected at the subclinical stage allows for effective treatment and avoiding further complication including cardiovascular pathology. Surface ECG (Electrocardiogram)-based diagnosis of CAN is useful to overcome the limitation of existing cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests traditionally used for CAN identification in clinical settings. The aim of this paper is to analyze the changes in the mechanical function of the ventricles in terms of systolic-diastolic interval interaction (SDI) from a surface ECG to assess the severity of CAN progression [no CAN, early CAN (ECAN) or subclinical CAN, and definite CAN (DCAN) or clinical CAN]. ECG signals recorded in supine resting condition from 72 diabetic subjects without CAN (CAN-) and 70 diabetic subjects with CAN were analyzed in this paper. The severity of CAN was determined by Ewing's Cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests. Fifty-five subjects of the CAN group had ECAN and 15 subjects had DCAN. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the SDI parameter (i.e., TQ/RR interval ratio) measured from the electrical diastolic interval (i.e., TQ interval) and the heart rate interval (i.e., RR interval). The performance of the proposed SDI measure was compared with the performance of the existing SDI measure (i.e., QT/TQ interval ratio). The proposed SDI parameter showed significant differences among three groups (no CAN, ECAN, and DCAN). In addition, the proposed SDI parameter was found to be more sensitive in detecting CAN progression than other ECG interval-based features traditionally used for CAN diagnosis. The modified SDI parameter might be used as an alternative measure for the Ewing autonomic reflex tests to identify CAN progression for those subjects who are unable to perform the traditional tests. These findings could also complement the echocardiographic findings of the left ventricular diastolic dysfunction by providing additional information about alteration in systolic and diastolic intervals in heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Aim This study aimed to evaluate the association between cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in type 2 diabetes patients. Methods 315 type 2 diabetes patients from inpatients of Drum Tower Hospital were included and classified into no CAN (NCAN), possible CAN (PCAN), and definite CAN (DCAN) based on cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests. The left ventricular diastolic function was assessed by tissue Doppler imaging echocardiography. Results The distribution of NCAN, PCAN, and DCAN was 11.4%, 51.1%, and 37.5%, respectively. The proportion of LVDD increased among the groups of NCAN, PCAN, and DCAN (39.4%, 45.3%, and 68.0%, P = 0.001). Patients with DCAN had higher filling pressure (E/e\u2032 ratio) (10.9 \u00b1 2.7 versus 9.4 \u00b1 2.8, P = 0.013) and impaired diastolic performance (e\u2032) (6.8 \u00b1 1.7 versus 8.6 \u00b1 2.4, P = 0.004) compared with NCAN. CAN was found to be an independent risk factor for LVDD from the multivariate regression analysis (OR = 1.628, P = 0.009, 95% CI 1.131\u20132.344). Conclusions Our results indicated that CAN was an independent risk marker for the presence of LVDD in patients with diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment of CAN are advocated for preventing LVDD in type 2 diabetes.",

        "title": "Electrical Features of the Diabetic Myocardium. Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Safety Considerations in Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia in the absence of treatment. Among the diabetes-associated complications, cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. Diabetes causes a complex myocardial dysfunction, referred as diabetic cardiomyopathy, which even in the absence of other cardiac risk factors results in abnormal diastolic and systolic function. Besides mechanical abnormalities, altered electrical function is another major feature of the diabetic myocardium. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients often show cardiac electrical remodeling, mainly a prolonged ventricular repolarization visible in the electrocardiogram as a lengthening of the QT interval duration. The underlying mechanisms at the cellular level involve alterations on the expression and activity of several cardiac ion channels and their associated regulatory proteins. Consequent changes in sodium, calcium and potassium currents collectively lead to a delay in repolarization that can increase the risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. QT duration correlates strongly with the risk of developing torsade de pointes, a form of ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, QT prolongation is a qualitative marker of proarrhythmic risk, and analysis of ventricular repolarization is therefore required for the approval of new drugs. To that end, the Thorough QT/QTc analysis evaluates QT interval prolongation to assess potential proarrhythmic effects. In addition, since diabetic patients have a higher risk to die from cardiovascular causes than individuals without diabetes, cardiovascular safety of the new antidiabetic drugs must be carefully evaluated in type 2 diabetic patients. These cardiovascular outcome trials reveal that some glucose-lowering drugs actually reduce cardiovascular risk. The mechanism of cardioprotection might involve a reduction of the risk of developing arrhythmia.",

        "title": "Structural and Electrical Remodeling of the Sinoatrial Node in Diabetes: New Dimensions and Perspectives",
        "abstract": "The sinoatrial node (SAN) is composed of highly specialized cells that mandate the spontaneous beating of the heart through self-generation of an action potential (AP). Despite this automaticity, the SAN is under the modulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In diabetes mellitus (DM), heart rate variability (HRV) manifests as a hallmark of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This is paralleled by an impaired regulation of the ANS, and by a pathological remodeling of the pacemaker structure and function. The direct effect of diabetes on the molecular signatures underscoring this pathology remains ill-defined. The recent focus on the electrical currents of the SAN in diabetes revealed a repressed firing rate of the AP and an elongation of its tracing, along with conduction abnormalities and contractile failure. These changes are blamed on the decreased expression of ion transporters and cell-cell communication ports at the SAN (i.e., HCN4, calcium and potassium channels, connexins 40, 45, and 46) which further promotes arrhythmias. Molecular analysis crystallized the RGS4 (regulator of potassium currents), mitochondrial thioredoxin-2 (reactive oxygen species; ROS scavenger), and the calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) as metabolic culprits of relaying the pathological remodeling of the SAN cells (SANCs) structure and function. A special attention is given to the oxidation of CaMKII and the generation of ROS that induce cell damage and apoptosis of diabetic SANCs. Consequently, the diabetic SAN contains a reduced number of cells with significant infiltration of fibrotic tissues that further delay the conduction of the AP between the SANCs. Failure of a genuine generation of AP and conduction of their derivative waves to the neighboring atrial myocardium may also occur as a result of the anti-diabetic regiment (both acute and/or chronic treatments). All together, these changes pose a challenge in the field of cardiology and call for further investigations to understand the etiology of the structural/functional remodeling of the SANCs in diabetes. Such an understanding may lead to more adequate therapies that can optimize glycemic control and improve health-related outcomes in patients with diabetes.",

        "title": "Human Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity: Role of the Slow Component of the Delayed Rectifier K+ Current, IKs",
        "abstract": "The pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial node (SAN) has been studied extensively in animal species but is virtually unexplored in humans. Here we assess the role of the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) in human SAN pacemaker activity and its dependence on heart rate and \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type KCNQ1 and KCNE1 cDNA, encoding the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits of the IKs channel, respectively. KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents were recorded both during a traditional voltage clamp and during an action potential (AP) clamp with human SAN-like APs. Forskolin (10 \u00b5mol/L) was used to increase the intracellular cAMP level, thus mimicking \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. The experimentally observed effects were evaluated in the Fabbri\u2013Severi computer model of an isolated human SAN cell. Transfected HEK-293 cells displayed large IKs-like outward currents in response to depolarizing voltage clamp steps. Forskolin significantly increased the current density and significantly shifted the half-maximal activation voltage towards more negative potentials. Furthermore, forskolin significantly accelerated activation without affecting the rate of deactivation. During an AP clamp, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 current was substantial during the AP phase, but relatively small during diastolic depolarization. In the presence of forskolin, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 current during both the AP phase and diastolic depolarization increased, resulting in a clearly active KCNQ1/KCNE1 current during diastolic depolarization, particularly at shorter cycle lengths. Computer simulations demonstrated that IKs reduces the intrinsic beating rate through its slowing effect on diastolic depolarization at all levels of autonomic tone and that gain-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 may exert a marked bradycardic effect during vagal tone. In conclusion, IKs is active during human SAN pacemaker activity and has a strong dependence on heart rate and cAMP level, with a prominent role at all levels of autonomic tone.",

        "title": "The Autonomic Nervous System Can Compensate for Hypocalcemia-Induced Bradycardia in Human and Rabbit Sinoatrial Node Cell Models",
        "abstract": "Every regular heartbeat is initiated by cyclic sponta-neous depolarisations of sinoatrial node cells (SANCs). Altered electrolyte levels, typically occurring in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) highly influence pacemaking of the heart. Thus, the effects of sympathetic stimulation and hypocalcemia on the beating rate (BR) were assessed. Therefore, we integrated the \u03b2 -adrenergic ( \u03b2 -AR) signalling cascade of Behar et al., into the Severi et al. (rabbit) and Fab-bri et al. (human) SANC models. To mimic conditions in patients suffering from CKD, extracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] o ) (0.6 to 1.8 mM) and isoprenaline concentrations ([ISO]) (0.0 to 1000.0 nM) were varied. The extended models predicted that for decreased [Ca 2+ ] o , an exponential-like increase of [ISO] restored the basal BR. In particular, for 1.2 mM [Ca 2+ ] o , 15.5 and 7.3 nM [ISO] for the Severi and Fabbri model restored the initial conditions. With [Ca 2+ ] o further reduced to 0.6 mM, 60.0 and 41.7 nM [ISO] were required. A sudden loss of sympathetic tone resulted in extreme bradycardia or stopped automaticity. The results suggest that hypocalcemic bradycardia can be compensated by an increased sympathetic tone. The integration of the \u03b2 -AR pathways led to an exponential-like increase of the BR. This combined model may help understanding the pathomechanisms of sudden cardiac death in CKD.",
