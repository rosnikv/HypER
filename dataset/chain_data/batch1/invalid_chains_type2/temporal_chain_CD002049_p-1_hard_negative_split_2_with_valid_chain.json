        "title": "Soft-laser therapy of rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "The effect of soft-laser therapy on rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated in 17 patients with symmetrical involvement of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index. Nine treatments with a He-Ne laser, 6 J/cm2, were given on the one hand with a sham irradiation of the other. The study was double-blind. The laser therapy gave some pain relief, but no difference in morning stiffness or joint performance was obtained. It is concluded that the laser therapy is of limited value in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "30 patients with supraspinatus or bicipital tendonitis were randomly allocated to active infrared laser therapy at 904 nm three times weekly for 2 weeks, dummy laser or drug treatment for 2 weeks. Objectively maximum active extension, flexion and abduction of the shoulder, and subjectively pain stiffness movement and function were measured at 0 and 2 weeks. Significant improvement of active over dummy laser was noted for all seven assessments. Active laser therapy produced significant improvement over drug therapy for all three objective measures and pain. Naproxen sodium significantly improved only movement and function compared to dummy laser. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of laser therapy in tendonitis of the shoulder.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage-like U-937 cells were exposed in vitro to noncoherent 660 nm wavelength light produced by a superluminous diode at a power density of 120 mW/cm2 over a range of energy densities from 2.4 - 9.6 J/cm2. Twelve hours after irradiation, the medium in which the macrophages had been growing and which contained growth factors secreted by them was added to 3T3 fibroblasts, also growing in vitro, and its effect on fibroblast proliferation assessed. It was found that by 96 h after addition of the macrophage-conditioned medium there was a statistically significant increase in fibroblast proliferation in the cells exposed to supernatants from the experimental compared with the sham-irradiated macrophages. The most effective energy density was found to be 7.2 J/cm2 and the least effective 9.6 J/cm2.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe current placebo-controlled study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of combined phototherapy and low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) in the management of chronic venous ulceration when used in conjunction with standardized nursing intervention.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nApproval was granted by Research Ethical Committees at the University of Ulster and Altnagelvin Hospitals Health and Social Services Trust. Patients (n = 15; 10 female/5 male; age +/- SD = 69.9 +/- 13.8 years) were recruited from an outpatient \"leg ulcer clinic,\" where they attended once per week for irradiation/sham treatments for 4 weeks. Treatment was withheld for a total of 8 weeks, and patients were reviewed during this time (weeks 8 and 12) for ulcer and pain assessment only. A multisource diode array (660-950 nm) was used for irradiation; parameters were kept constant for the duration of the study (532 mW; 5 kHz; 12 J/cm(2)). Wound and pain assessment were carried out by an independent investigator. Digitizing was used to quantify surface areas from wound tracings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough there was no statistically significant difference between Treatment and Placebo groups, an apparent clinical difference in wound healing rate was noted; at postirradiation, a continued reduction in wound size was evident for the treatment group. These effects were believed to be due to an apparent delayed effect. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for pain.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings provide only limited evidence for the use of this modality as an adjunctive therapy with current nursing intervention. Further group studies are indicated to investigate the apparent delayed effect reported here for various etiologies of ulceration.",

        "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that low\u2010level laser therapy (LLLT) is effective in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In a double\u2010blind randomized controlled trial of LLLT, 15 CTS patients, 34 to 67 years of age, were randomly assigned to either the control group (n = 8) or treatment group (n =7). Both groups were treated three times per week for 5 weeks. Those in the treatment group received 860 nm galium/aluminum/arsenide laser at a dosage of 6 J/cm2 over the carpal tunnel, whereas those in the control group were treated with sham laser. The primary outcome measure was the Levine Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire, and the secondary outcome measures were electrophysiological data and the Purdue pegboard test. All patients completed the study without adverse effects. There was a significant symptomatic improvement in both the control (P = 0.034) and treatment (P =0.043) groups. However, there was no significant difference in any of the outcome measures between the two groups. Thus, LLLT is no more effective in the reduction of symptoms of CTS than is sham treatment.

        "abstract": "As an alternative of conservative treatment options for CTS, Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has been developed. Several studies in peripheral nerve activities after LLLT in CTS, showed conflicting evidence on nerve conduction velocities. The objective of this study was to analyze the difference of median nerve sensory distal latency between pre and post LLLT in CTS patients. This study was a pre experimental study with pre test \u2013 post test design of the CTS patients who received LLLT in Rehabilitation Medicine outpatient clinic, Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, from July to November 2006. The median nerve sensory distal latency pre and post LLLT was measured. Twenty subjects underwent 6 treatment sessions of LLLT (3 times a week for 2 weeks) with a GaAlAs laser. There was a reduction of the percentage of patients in clinical manifestation (symptoms, sensory deficit, and positive provocation tests) post LLLT. The mean of median nerve sensory distal latency became faster post LLLT, from 5.265 msec to 3.305 msec with sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) from 34.72 to 45.4 m/sec. There was also reduction of VAS from 5.55 to 3. While the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude increased from 14.53 uV to 22.325 uV. There was significant difference in sensory distal latency and sensory NCV of the median nerve, and VAS between pre and post LLLT (p 0.05). There was no significant correlation (p > 0.05) between median nerve sensory distal latency and VAS pre and post LLLT, and also between the difference of sensory distal latency pre-post LLLT and the difference of VAS pre-post LLLT. In conclusion, the study result showed that after LLLT in CTS patients, there was statistically significant difference of median nerve sensory distal latency between pre and post LLLT, with reduction of median nerve sensory distal latency.",
