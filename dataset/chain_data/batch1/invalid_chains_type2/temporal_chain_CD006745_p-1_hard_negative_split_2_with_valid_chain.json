        "abstract": "Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients and methods: A total of 187 patients with HCCs of 3 cm or less were randomly assigned to RFTA (n\u200a=\u200a62), PEI (n\u200a=\u200a62), or PAI (n\u200a=\u200a63). Tumour recurrence and survival rates were assessed. Results: One, two, and three year local recurrence rates were 10%, 14%, and 14% in the RFTA group, 16%, 34%, and 34% in the PEI group, and 14%, 31%, and 31% in the PAI group (RFTA v PEI, p\u200a=\u200a0.012; RFTA v PAI, p\u200a=\u200a0.017). One, two, and three year survival rates were 93%, 81%, and 74% in the RFTA group, 88%, 66%, and 51% in the PEI group, and 90%, 67%, and 53% in the PAI group (RFTA v PEI, p\u200a=\u200a0.031; RFTA v PAI, p\u200a=\u200a0.038). One, two, and three year cancer free survival rates were 74%, 60%, and 43% in the RFTA group, 70%, 41%, and 21% in the PEI group, and 71%, 43%, and 23% in the PAI group (RFTA v PEI, p\u200a=\u200a0.038; RFTA v PAI, p\u200a=\u200a0.041). Tumour size, tumour differentiation, and treatment methods (RFTA v PEI and PAI) were significant factors for local recurrence, overall survival, and cancer free survival. Major complications occurred in 4.8% of patients (two with haemothorax, one gastric perforation) in the RFTA group and in none in two other groups (RFTA v PEI and PAI, p\u200a=\u200a0.035). Conclusions: RFTA was superior to PEI and PAI with respect to local recurrence, overall survival, and cancer free survival rates, but RFTA also caused more major complications.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Neoplastic seeding reportedly occurs in up to 12.5% of patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to assess the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of neoplastic seeding after RFA among a large number of patients with a long-term follow-up.METHOD:From February 1999 to December 2004, 1,031 patients underwent a total of 1,845 treatments with RFA for a total of 3,837 HCC nodules. The following variables were assessed to elucidate the risk factors of neoplastic seeding: age, sex, positivity for viral markers, tumor size, number of tumor nodules, number of RFA sessions, tumor location, percutaneous biopsy prior to RFA, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) and lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3) levels, and the degree of tumor differentiation.RESULTS:Neoplastic seeding was detected in 33 patients (3.2% per patient) at intervals of 4.8\u201363.8 (median, 15.2) months after RFA. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the poor differentiation degree was associated with the risk of neoplastic seeding (P = 0.012). Of tumor factors, tumor size, and AFP, DCP, and AFP-L3 levels were significantly associated with the poor differentiation degree. The cumulative survival rates 1 and 2 yr after the detection of neoplastic seeding were 86% and 47%, respectively.CONCLUSION:Poor differentiation degree was the risk factor of neoplastic seeding after RFA for HCC. The surrogate markers for poor differentiation degree were larger tumor size and elevated tumor marker levels. Indication for RFA should be carefully considered for HCC patients under these conditions.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo investigate the treatment strategies and long-term outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in difficult locations and to compare the results with non-difficult HCC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom 2004 to 2012, a total of 470 HCC patients underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA. Among these HCC patients, 382 with tumors located \u2264 5 mm from a major vessel/bile duct (n = 87), from peripheral important structures (n = 232) or from the liver capsule (n = 63) were regarded as difficult cases. There were 331 male patients and 51 female patients, with an average age of 55.3 \u00b1 10.1 years old. A total of 235 and 147 patients had Child-Pugh class A and class B liver function, respectively. The average tumor size was 3.4 \u00b1 1.2 cm. Individual treatment strategies were developed to treat these difficult cases. During the same period, 88 HCC patients with tumors that were not in difficult locations served as the control group. In the control group, 74 patients were male, and 14 patients were female, with an average age of 57.4 \u00b1 11.8 years old. Of these, 62 patients and 26 patients had Child-Pugh class A and class B liver function, respectively. Regular follow-up after RFA was performed to assess treatment efficacy. Survival results were generated from Kaplan-Meier estimates, and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarly tumor necrosis rate in the difficult group was similar to that in the control group (97.6% vs 94.3%, P = 0.080). The complication rate in the difficult group was significantly higher than that in the control group (4.9% vs 0.8%, P = 0.041). The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 116 mo, with an average of 28 \u00b1 22.4 mo. Local progression rate in the difficult group was significantly higher than that in the control group (12.7% vs 7.1%, P = 0.046). However, the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates in the difficult group were not significantly different from those in the control group (84.3%, 54.4%, 41.2%, and 29.9% vs 92.5%, 60.3%, 43.2%, and 32.8%, respectively, P = 0.371). Additionally, a multivariate analysis revealed that tumor location was not a significant risk factor for survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere was no significant difference in long-term overall survival between the two groups even though the local progression rate was higher in the difficult group.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: The purpose of the study was to prospectively evaluate the safety and the efficacy of percutaneous radio-frequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract. Materials and methods: From April 2012 to November 2015, 141 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules that underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous radio-frequency ablation were included. A total of 52 lesions were located less than 5\u2009mm from the gastrointestinal tract in the study group, and 89 lesions were located more than 5\u2009mm from hepatic surface in the control group. Ethanol (2.5\u20139.6\u2009mL) was injected into marginal tissue of tumour in five lesions of the study group. During the ablation, the temperature of marginal ablation tissue proximal to the gastrointestinal tract was monitored and controlled at 45\u201356\u2009\u00b0C for more than 10\u2009min in the study group. We compared the results of ablation between the two groups. Results: In total 48 of 52 tumours (92.3%) in the study group and 84 of 89 tumours (94.4%) in the control group achieved complete ablation (P\u2009=\u20090.63). Local tumour progression was found in eight tumours (15.4%) in the study group and 11 tumours (12.4%) in the control group during follow-up (P\u2009=\u20090.61). There were neither immediate nor peri-procedural major complications in both groups, grade I (Clavien\u2013Dindo classification). One case developed biloma at 5-month follow-up in the study group, Clavien\u2013Dindo gradeIII. Conclusions: Percutaneous radio-frequency ablation is safe and achieves a high complete ablation rate for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.",

The primary endpoints were treatment response as per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria and complications.\n Statistical Analysis\u2003Fischer's exact test was performed for categorical variables, and Student's t-tests for nominal variables.\n Results\u2003Twenty-three lesions in 20 patients (13 male, 67\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8 years) and 30 lesions in 30 patients (18 male, 62.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6 years) were treated with Y90-RS and MWA (19 with prior TACE), respectively. There were no differences in demographics (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Mean tumor diameter was 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 in those treated with Y90-RS and 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 for MWA (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Lesions were located adjacent to the following structures: dome (n\u2009=\u200922), capsule (n\u2009=\u200916), hilum (n\u2009=\u20099), and gallbladder (n\u2009=\u20096). All patients were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1. Of the MWA cohort, 19 were Child-Pugh class A, 5 were B, and 6 were C and the mean pretreatment laboratory values were as follows: Model for End-stage Liver Disease sodium (MELD-Na) 12.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 848\u2009\u00b1\u20093168.0, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 71.9\u2009\u00b1\u200949.1, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 48.0\u2009\u00b1\u200932.4, and total bilirubin 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7. Of the Y90-RS cohort, 15 were Child-Pugh class A, 4 were B, and 1 was C and pretreatment laboratory values were as follows: MELD-Na 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 (Y90-RS), AFP 762.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091793.8 (Y90), AST 50.3\u2009\u00b1\u200930.5 (Y90), ALT 30.1\u2009\u00b1\u200916.9 (Y90), and total bilirubin 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 (Y90). Complete response rate following Y90 was 96 versus 76% for MWA, with no disease progression after Y90-RS within the follow-up period. Three (13%) lesions demonstrated progression of disease (time to progression 6.3 months) after MWA. No grade\u2009>\u20092 toxicities or procedure-related complications were noted following Y90-RS. There were 7 major (arterioportal fistula with hemoperitoneum, pneumothorax, liver infarction, and capsular burn) and 3 minor complications following MWA.\n Conclusion\u2003Y90-RS is a valuable alternative to percutaneous MWA as a first-line therapy for early-stage HCC for tumors in suboptimal locations for ablation, offering a favorable treatment response and safety profile.",
