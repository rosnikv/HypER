        "title": "Does breathing other people's tobacco smoke cause lung cancer?",
        "abstract": "The available epidemiological studies of lung cancer and exposure to other people's tobacco smoke, in which exposure was assessed by whether or not a person classified as a non-smoker lived with a smoker, were identified and the results combined. There were 10 case-control studies and three prospective studies. Overall, there was a highly significant 35% increase in the risk of lung cancer among non-smokers living with smokers compared with non-smokers living with non-smokers (relative risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.54). Part of this increase was almost certainly caused by the misclassification of some smokers as non-smokers. As smokers, who are more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers, tend to live with smokers this misclassification probably exaggerated the estimated increase in risk. Adjustment for this error reduced the estimate to 30% (relative risk 1.30), but as people who live with non-smokers may still be exposed to other people's smoke this estimate was revised again to allow for the fact that a truly unexposed reference group was not used. The increase in risk among non-smokers living with smokers compared with a completely unexposed group was thus estimated as 53% (relative risk of 1.53). This analysis, and the fact that non-smokers breathe environmental tobacco smoke, which contains carcinogens, into their lungs and that the generally accepted view is that there is no safe threshold for the effect of carcinogens, leads to the conclusion that breathing other people's tobacco smoke is a cause of lung cancer. About a third of the cases of lung cancer in non-smokers who live with smokers, and about a quarter of the cases in non-smokers in general, may be attributed to such exposure.",

        "abstract": "To assess the likelihood of publication bias in a recent review of the effect of passive smoking on lung cancer the evidence from the reviewed papers was visualised on a \u201cfunnel\u201d plot. In such a plot if the relative risks from various studies are plotted according to sample size they should scatter round some underlying true value, the scatter being greatest where the studies have the lowest statistical power\u2014thus showing a \u201cfunnel\u201d pattern. If there is publication bias and studies with non-significant results are not being published there should be a \u201cgap\u201d in the plot. The logarithm of the relative risks was plotted against the standard error of the logarithm of the relative risk (which was used instead of sample size as a measure of statistical uncertainty). The resulting plot was compatible with a publication bias but only in studies on men. Further studies of passive smoking and lung cancer in men seem to be warranted.",

        "abstract": "Acute physiological and chronic pathological responses of the respiratory tract to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are reviewed briefly. This study excludes discussion of the possible risk of lung cancer and the known impact of carbon monoxide on the fetus and adult. In some environments, the dose of particulate matter and the concentrations of irritant vapors absorbed on the ETS particles reach a level for which a physiological response may be expected, not only in the nose but also the bronchi. However, direct measurements indicate only small increases of nasal and bronchial resistance if normal subjects are exposed to maximal, likely concentrations of ETS. ETS is readily detected by the nonsmoker, but there is no strong evidence that pulmonary reactions have a psychogenic basis. The condition of approximately 20% of asthmatic patients is exacerbated by ETS exposure. Further study is needed to clarify the likelihood that adults will progress from a minor physiological response to pathological reactions, e.g., chronic obstructive lung disease. In young children (who are less able to escape from ETS), the association between exposure and an increase in respiratory disease is stronger than in adults. Exacerbation of asthma and an increase of respiratory disease are further arguments for legislation to guarantee smoke-free air to the nonsmoking public.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is widespread in European countries, the most serious exposures occurring at home and in the workplace. Epidemiological studies have, essentially, addressed the association between ETS exposure and respiratory health in children, and increased risk of lung cancer among adult nonsmokers. Relatively few studies have been reported on ETS and adult non-neoplastic respiratory diseases. On the basis of the available data, no definite conclusion (excluding the acute irritating effect of ETS on respiratory mucous membranes) can be drawn. Although biologically plausible, it remains controversial whether ETS exposure is associated with chronic respiratory symptoms and occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including asthma. Most of the studies that have used the most sensitive indicators of pulmonary function have suggested a negative impact of ETS exposure. However, if really present, the physiological significance of such small changes is unclear, and the relationship to long-term changes in lung function is not established. Moreover, the possibility of bias and confounding factors must be taken into account. Thus, there is a need for further epidemiological studies on ETS exposure and adult non-neoplastic respiratory disorders.",

        "title": "Passive smoking in childhood and adulthood and risk of rheumatoid arthritis in women: results from the French E3N cohort study",
        "abstract": "Objective The association between passive smoking exposure in childhood or in adulthood, and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been incompletely investigated. We aimed to assess the relationship between exposure to passive smoking and the risk of incident RA in a French prospective cohort of healthy women. Methods The E3N Study (Etude Epid\u00e9miologique aupr\u00e8s des femmes de la Mutuelle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Education Nationale) is a French prospective cohort of women included in 1990. Exposures to passive smoking were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. RA cases were self-reported and subsequently validated. Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and for potential confounders were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for incident RA. Results Among 79\u2009806\u2009women, 698 incident cases of RA were identified; 10\u2009810 (13.5%) women were exposed to passive smoking in childhood, and 42\u2009807 (53.6%) in adulthood. Median age at inclusion was 47.8 years. Passive smoking in childhood and in adulthood was associated with RA risk in all models (HRs (95% CIs) 1.24 (1.01 to 1.51) and 1.19 (1.02 to 1.40), respectively). The absolute risk of RA among never smokers with exposure to passive smoking in childhood and/or adulthood (47.6/100 000 person-years) was close to the risk of ever smokers with no passive smoking exposure (47.2/100 000 person-years), while it was highest in ever smokers also exposed to passive smoking (53.7/100 000 person-years). Conclusion Exposure to passive smoking in childhood and/or adulthood increases the risk of RA by the same order than active smoking. Such exposure should be suppressed, especially in individuals at risk of RA.",

        "title": "The Causal Association between Alcohol, Smoking, Coffee Consumption, and the Risk of Arthritis: A Meta-Analysis of Mendelian Randomization Studies",
        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the genetic causality between alcohol intake, smoking, coffee consumption, and arthritis. Methods: Mendelian randomization (MR) studies with alcohol, smoking, and coffee consumption behaviors as exposures, and osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as outcomes were retrieved from up to July 2023. Two researchers with relevant professional backgrounds independently assessed the quality and extracted data from the included studies. Meanwhile, we applied MR analyses of four lifestyle exposures and five arthritis outcomes (two for OA and three for RA) with gene-wide association study (GWAS) data that were different from the included studies, and the results were also included in the meta-analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16.0 and R software version 4.3.1. Results: A total of 84 studies were assessed. Of these, 11 were selected for meta-analysis. As a whole, the included studies were considered to be at a low risk of bias and were of high quality. Results of the meta-analysis showed no significant genetic causality between alcohol intake and arthritis (odds ratio (OR): 1.02 (0.94\u20131.11)). Smoking and arthritis had a positive genetic causal association (OR: 1.44 (1.27\u20131.64)) with both OA (1.44 (1.22\u20131.71)) and RA (1.37 (1.26\u20131.50)). Coffee consumption and arthritis also had a positive genetic causal association (OR: 1.02 (1.01\u20131.03)). Results from the subgroup analysis showed a positive genetic causality between coffee consumption and both OA (OR: 1.02 (1.00\u20131.03)) and RA (OR: 1.56 (1.19\u20132.05)). Conclusion: There is positive genetic causality between smoking and coffee consumption and arthritis (OA and RA), while there is insufficient evidence for genetic causality between alcohol intake and arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Objective Our study was conducted to explore the link between oxidative balance score (OBS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods A total of 21,415 participants were included in our research from five cycles (2011\u20132012, 2013\u20132014, 2015\u20132016, 2017\u20132018, and 2017\u20132020) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Moreover, 20 elements related to diet as well as lifestyle were combined to calculate OBS. The relationship between OBS and RA was assessed by employing multivariable regression analysis, and further exploration was carried out through subgroup analysis, restricted cubic spline analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Multiple covariates were selected to adjust the model for more robust results. Results In our cross-sectional study, a higher OBS has a protective effect on the development of RA (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97 to 0.99). In contrast to individuals aged \u226560, the result is more prominent in the population aged 20\u201360 (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.98). Marital status appears to introduce interference in the relationship between OBS and RA, and unmarried individuals exhibited different outcomes (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.04) compared to others. The positive influence of OBS was more evident in patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, while it was stronger in individuals without diabetes and liver disease. Conclusion A higher OBS correlates with a reduced odd of RA. Further studies are needed to shoot more sights on improving dietary habits and lifestyles to gain proper OBS and explore whether OBS can be one of the measurements utilized to measure the risk of RA.",
