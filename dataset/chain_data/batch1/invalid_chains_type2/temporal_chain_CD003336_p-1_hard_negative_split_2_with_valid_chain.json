        "title": "Warfarin plus Aspirin after Myocardial Infarction or the Acute Coronary Syndrome: Meta-Analysis with Estimates of Risk and Benefit",
        "abstract": "Context Continued thrombin generation persists for several months after acute cardiac events. Contribution Data from 10 randomized trials involving 5938 patients with the acute coronary syndrome who were not stented showed that, compared with aspirin alone, warfarin plus aspirin decreased annual rates of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and revascularization and increased major bleeding rates. In patients with low or average bleeding risks, numbers of cardiovascular events prevented by warfarin plus aspirin exceeded numbers of major bleeding episodes caused by it. Implications Benefits of warfarin plus aspirin may exceed harms in patients with the acute coronary syndrome who are not stented and do not have high bleeding risks. The Editors Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of illness and death in the United States (1). Patients with a history of myocardial infarction are at increased risk for recurrent infarction, stroke, and death (2, 3). Several interventions have proven beneficial in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, including -blockers (4), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (5), lipid-lowering therapy (6), and aspirin (7). In addition, after acute cardiac events, a marked thrombin generation persists for months after clinical stabilization (8), suggesting a role for anticoagulation beyond the initial use of low-molecular-weight heparin (9). Although some studies have shown that addition of warfarin to aspirin decreases subsequent risk for cardiovascular events (10-14), other studies have not (15, 16). In a meta-analysis, Anand and Yusuf (17) suggested that only moderate- to high-intensity anticoagulation, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) more than 2.0, decreased cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone. A large randomized trial conducted in a primary care setting showed that adding warfarin to aspirin decreased combined cardiovascular end points of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death by 29% (12). Despite these findings, warfarin use has not been widely adopted, perhaps because of concern that the increased bleeding risk may counter the cardiovascular benefit (18) or that the benefits are too small to justify the inconvenience (19). The risks and benefits that are probably associated with warfarin therapy are not equally distributed. Patients at the highest risk for recurrent cardiovascular events should derive the most benefit, which may be offset in those with increased bleeding risk. To better quantify the risks and benefits of warfarin therapy for individuals, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials and then calculated the expected benefit for groups at varying risk for cardiovascular disease and bleeding. Methods Study Selection We searched MEDLINE using the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and text words: anticoagulant or anticoagulation or warfarin and aspirin, combined with myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary arteriosclerosis, or coronary artery disease. We limited our search to original, English-language articles published between 1 January 1990 and 1 October 2004; earlier trials were not likely to reflect current standards of care for secondary prevention, including lipid therapy and -blockers. Two reviewers scanned the titles independently for relevant randomized trials. We checked abstracts and then manuscripts of all potentially appropriate references. We included studies if they were randomized, controlled trials of warfarin and aspirin in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. We excluded studies of percutaneous coronary stenting (for which warfarin is generally not considered appropriate therapy) (20) and low-intensity warfarin therapy (target INR < 2.0). We assessed studies for proper randomization, blinding of patients and investigators to treatment allocation, and completeness of follow-up. Data Extraction The 2 reviewers extracted the following data independently: study size and duration; aspirin dose; target INR; and demographic characteristics of trial participants, including age, sex, number of patients with diabetes, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and whether the patient had a Q-wave infarction or received thrombolysis. We evaluated 7 end points: myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, death, minor bleeding, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Each study's authors defined major and minor bleeding, and most studies reported all 7 end points. When results were presented only as combined end points or were ambiguous, we contacted the study authors to obtain primary data. In the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS) study (13), a multicenter, international trial, investigators noted 35 days into the trial that compliance as measured by achievement of target INR was better in some countries than in other countries and designated a subset analysis of countries with good compliance before data collection was complete. We included only the compliant countries in our analysis. We contacted the OASIS authors for select data on compliant countries from OASIS (13) and individual end points from the OASIS pilot study (21), which were published only as combined end points. We contacted the authors of Huynh and colleagues' study (22), because the published results for all end points were incorrect. Statistical Analysis We used Stata, version 8.2 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas), for all analyses. We calculated the rate ratios and 95% CIs for recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding (major or minor) for each study. We used a half-integer correction if no events occurred in 1 group of the study. We pooled rate ratios by using random-effects models that used weighting based on the inverse-variance model according to DerSimonian and Laird (23). We used the MantelHaenszel test to evaluate heterogeneity among trial outcomes. We considered statistical significance at a P value less than 0.05. We performed an influence analysis in which we computed the summary rate ratio, omitting the largest trial (Warfarin, Aspirin, Reinfarction Study [WARIS II] [12]), to assess for any single study dominance in the analysis. We used the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test (24) and the Egger regression asymmetry test (25) to evaluate publication bias. Weighing Risks and Benefits To demonstrate the relative benefits of warfarin plus aspirin for individual patients at different degrees of risk, we calculated the number of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and major bleeding episodes expected to result from aspirin therapy, with or without warfarin, for 9 combinations of cardiovascular and bleeding risk. We calculated events in each risk group taking warfarin plus aspirin by multiplying the rate for the corresponding group of patients taking aspirin by the rate ratio derived from the meta-analysis. The absolute differences between these rates represent the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes prevented by adding warfarin to aspirin. Because the timing of events may be important in treatment decisions, we calculated outcomes at 3 months and 1 year. On the basis of 5059 patients in the Combination Hemotherapy and Mortality Prevention (CHAMP) study (16), we estimated that 51% of myocardial infarctions, 54% of strokes, and 50% of bleeding episodes in the first year after acute myocardial infarction would occur in the first 3 months. Event rates for all 3 outcomes continue to decrease over time. Thus, considering events in the first 2 years after an acute coronary syndrome, approximately 70% of all outcomes occur in the first year. To directly compare event rates across studies of differing duration, we converted all results into first-year rates by using the proportions just described. Cardiovascular Risk Many published instruments are available for determining short- and long-term risk for reinfarction, stroke, and mortality. To demonstrate the clinical usefulness of estimating both cardiovascular and bleeding risk before prescribing warfarin, we chose clinical examples of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. We derived our estimates of the rates for recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke for patients receiving aspirin by using the computed hazard ratios from a large population-based study of 2700 patients surviving hospitalization after a first myocardial infarction and followed for an average of 3.4 years (26). We chose this study for its large size, long follow-up period, emphasis on easily measured clinical predictors, and inclusion of stroke as an outcome. The following variables were associated with increased risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke: age, treated diabetes, chronic congestive heart failure, angina, and serum creatinine level greater than 123.76 mol/L (>1.4 mg/dL). We created examples of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients by applying the hazard ratios for specific risk variables to a baseline risk of 49 per 1000 patient-years of observation. Infarction rates per 1000 patient-years were 40 for a low-risk patient (no risk factors), 82 for a medium-risk patient (for example, diabetes and serum creatinine level >123.76 mol/L [>1.4 mg/dL]), and 188 for a high-risk patient (for example, diabetes and congestive heart failure). Stroke rates for the same patients were 13, 32, and 79, respectively. Other risk stratification tools, based on the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI II) (27), Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico (GISSI) (28), Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT) (29), or Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) (30) studies, produce similar ranges of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. A detailed calculator based on the GRACE model is available at www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace. Bleeding Risk Several instruments are also available for predicting bleeding risk for patients taking warfarin (31-",

        "title": "Infarct Size Reduction in Patients With STEMI: Why We Can Do It!",
        "abstract": "Major progress has been made over the last three decades for the treatment of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The major objective of this treatment is to reduce infarct size, which is the major prognostic factor in this population. Most of the efforts have been focused on improving reperfusion therapy in order to open as quickly as possible, and to prevent reocclusion, of the culprit coronary artery. During the past years, preclinical research has allowed researchers to well-characterize animal models of acute MI and precisely describe the major determinants of infarct size, that is area at risk, collateral flow, duration of ischemia, and timing of the protective intervention with respect to reflow. Recent reports have clearly demonstrated that lethal reperfusion injury exists, that it is of significant importance, and that it can be prevented by protective interventions applied immediately before reflow. Time has come to, on top of reperfusion therapy, better protect the muscle against lethal reperfusion injury. Although many past infarct size reduction studies have been negative, recent proof-of-concept studies have shown that infarct size reduction is possible in patients with STEMI, at least in part because the major determinants of infarct size have been taken into account. Accumulated knowledge from animal models together with encouraging results obtained in phase II infarct size reduction clinical trials should help us improve the design of future studies aimed at reducing infarct size in patients with STEMI.",

        "abstract": "The endothelium is a dynamic component of the cardiovascular system that plays an important role in health and disease. This study tested the hypothesis that targeted delivery of endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing neutrophil membrane IL-8 receptors IL8RA and IL8RB reduces acute myocardial infarction (MI)-induced left ventricular (LV) remodeling and dysfunction and increases neovascularization in the area at risk surrounding the infarcted tissue. MI was created by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery in 12-wk-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Four groups of rats were studied: group 1: sham-operated rats without MI or EC transfusion; group 2: MI rats with intravenous vehicle; group 3: MI rats with transfused ECs transduced with empty adenoviral vector (Null-EC); and group 4: MI rats with transfused ECs overexpressing IL8RA/RB (1.5 \u00d7 10\u2076 cells post-MI). Two weeks after MI, LV function was assessed by echocardiography; infarct size was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (live tissue) and picrosirus red (collagen) staining, and capillary density and neutrophil infiltration in the area at risk were measured by CD31 and MPO immunohistochemical staining, respectively. When compared with the MI + vehicle and MI-Null-EC groups, transfusion of IL8RA/RB-ECs decreased neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and increased capillary density in the area at risk, decreased infarct size, and reduced MI-induced LV dysfunction. These findings provide proof of principle that targeted delivery of ECs is effective in repairing injured cardiac tissue. Targeted delivery of ECs to infarcted hearts provides a potential novel strategy for the treatment of acute MI in humans.",

This study tested the hypothesis that administration of rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing IL8RA/B can accelerate the adhesion of ECs to the injured lung and inhibit monocrotaline-induced pulmonary inflammation, arterial thickening and hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Approach and Results\u2014The treatment groups included 10-week-old ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats that received subcutaneous injection of PBS (vehicle), a single injection of monocrotaline (monocrotaline alone, 60 mg/kg, SC), monocrotaline followed by intravenous transfusion of ECs transduced with the empty adenoviral vector (null-EC), and monocrotaline followed by intravenous transfusion of ECs overexpressing IL8RA/B (1.5\u00d7106 cells/rat). Two days or 4 weeks after monocrotaline treatment, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2&bgr; (IL-8 equivalent in rat), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into pulmonary arterioles, and arteriolar and alveolar morphology were measured by histological and immunohistochemical techniques. Proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine protein levels were measured by Multiplex rat-specific magnetic bead\u2013based sandwich immunoassay in total lung homogenates. Transfusion of ECs overexpressing IL8RA/B significantly reduced monocrotaline-induced neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory mediator (IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2) expression in lungs and pulmonary arterioles and alveoli, pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary arterial and right ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling.

        "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL8) is highly expressed by injured arteries in a variety of diseases and is a chemoattractant for neutrophils which express IL8 receptors IL8RA and RB (IL8RA/B) on their membranes. Neutrophils interact with the damaged endothelium and initiate an inflammatory cascade at the site of injury. We have generated a novel translational targeted cell therapy for acute vascular injury using adenoviral vectors to overexpress IL8RA/B and green fluorescent protein (GFP) on the surface of endothelial cells (ECs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs). We hypothesize that HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs transfused intravenously into rats with balloon injury of the carotid artery will target to the injured site and compete with neutrophils, thus inhibiting inflammation and neointima formation. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent balloon injury of the right carotid artery and received intravenous transfusion of saline vehicle, 1.5 \u00d7 10(6) HiPS-ECs, 1.5 \u00d7 10(6) HiPS-Null-ECs, or 1.5 \u00d7 10(6) HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs immediately after endoluminal injury. Tissue distribution of HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs was analyzed by a novel GFP DNA qPCR method. Cytokine and chemokine expression and leukocyte infiltration were measured in injured and uninjured arteries at 24 h postinjury by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Neointimal, medial areas, and reendothelialization were measured 14 days postinjury. HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs homed to injured arteries, inhibited inflammatory mediator expression and inflammatory cell infiltration, accelerated reendothelialization, and attenuated neointima formation after endoluminal injury while control HiPS-ECs and HiPS-Null-ECs did not.
