The trial was unmasked after a mean of 12 (SD 2) months for the cyclosporin A group (n = 12) and a mean of 10 (SD 3) months for the cyclophosphamide group (n = 11). During the initial 6 months the visual acuity significantly improved (p < 0.001) in the cyclosporin A group whereas this was not observed in the cyclophosphamide group. The subsequent follow-up of patients up to 24 months suggested that the initial improvement in visual acuity with cyclosporin A was not sustained. More extensive and especially long-term studies of cyclosporin A in the uveitis of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder. The patients have repeated exacerbations and remissions of the symptoms. This disease may produce a wide variety of symptoms. In mild cases, mucocutaneous lesions are only the symptoms during the whole clinical course, whereas ocular lesions, which occur in about 70% of the patients, can cause blindness. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, CNS and large vessels is less frequent, but sometimes life-threatening. Colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are employed for the treatment of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease with therapies tailored to individual patients depending on clinical manifestations. Cyclosporin A is the most effective drug for ocular lesions at the present, but its neurotoxicity, which occurs in 20 - 30% of patients receiving cyclosporin A, restricts usage of the agent. Many patients are still suffering from a severe form of uveitis and serious neurological symptoms, which are resistant to any conventional therapies. New drugs have been investigated for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. IFN-\u03b1 therapy has shown significant efficacy for common symptoms including ocular lesions without any serious adverse effects. Thalidomide and its analogues also appear to be applicable to this disease. Monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 is now in clinical trials. These novel therapeutic approaches may provide much needed treatment options for patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.",

        "title": "Mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses of thalidomide.",
        "abstract": "Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of Contergan in 1956, as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, advocated to ensure a good nights sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from the market since 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies exposed to thalidomide in utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history, thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. Subsequently, thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.",

        "abstract": "Thalidomide (Thd), a potent teratogen, was shown to have therapeutic potential in cancer, primarily in multiple myeloma (MM), yet its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. It was recently suggested that its teratogenicity is derived from interference in expression of genes regulated by GC-rich promoters by blocking the binding of SP1 transcription factor to its motif. We explored the validation of the proposed model by focusing on potential molecular targets associated with MM pathogenesis. Cell lines RPMI 8226, U266, and ARH-77 were exposed for 24 h to racemic Thd and analyzed for apoptosis, membranal expression of CD29 and CD63, transcript level of hTERT, CD63, and IGFI-R (characterized by GC-rich motifs) and telomerase activity. Analysis of an hTERT core promoter reporter gene expression [enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)] in transiently transfected RPMI 8226 incubated with racemic and steric (+/-)-enantiomers of Thd was performed. A consistent reduction ( approximately 10-40%) in transcript levels of all three assayed genes in all three cell lines was demonstrated in the presence of racemic Thd. Significant reduction of EGFP was demonstrated in cells transfected with hTERT reporter gene and treated with racemic and (S)-Thd. Our results show that Thd's antimyeloma activity can be ascribed to the same mechanism responsible for its teratogenic effect and that the inhibition of GC-rich promoter genes is mostly attributed to the S-racemate. Indeed, this selectivity delineates GC-rich promoter genes as a unique group eligible for specific drug targeting.",

        "abstract": "Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to investigate the binding of 13 alkaloids to two GC-rich DNA duplexes which are critical sequences in human survivin promoter. Negative ion ESI-MS was first applied to screen the binding of the alkaloids to the duplexes. Six alkaloids (including berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine) show complexation with the target DNA sequences. Relative binding affinities were estimated from the negative ion ESI data, and the alkaloids show a binding preference to the duplex with higher GC content. Positive ion ESI mass spectra of the complexes were also recorded and compared with those obtained in negative ion mode. Only the 1 : 1 complex with berbamine was observed with lower abundance in the positive ion mass spectrum while complexes with the other alkaloids were absolutely absent. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments indicate that the complexes with the protoberberine alkaloids (berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine) dissociate via base loss and covalent cleavage. In contrast, product ion spectra of the complexes with the alkaloids reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine show the predominant loss of a neutral alkaloid molecule, accompanied by base loss and covalent cleavage to a lesser extent. A comparison of the gas-phase behaviors of complexes with the alkaloids to those with the traditional DNA binders has suggested an intercalative binding mode of these alkaloids to the target DNA duplexes.",

        "abstract": "In this study, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to investigate the binding interaction of six alkaloids with parallel intermolecular G-quadruplex [d(TGGGGT)](4), and five alkaloids including berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, tetrandrine, and fangchinoline showed complexation with the target DNA. Relative binding affinities were estimated on the basis of mass spectrometric data. The slight differences in chemical structures of berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine had little influence on their binding affinities to [d(TGGGGT)](4). Tetrandrine and fangchinoline selectively bound to [d(TGGGGT)](4) versus duplex DNA. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments showed that the complexes with berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine dissociated via strand separation and ligand retaining in the strand while the complexes with tetrandrine and fangchinoline were dissociated via ligand elimination. A comparison of dissociation patterns in CID experiments of complexes with the alkaloids to those with the traditional G-quadruplex DNA binders suggested an end-stacking binding mode for tetrandrine and fangchinoline and an intercalation binding mode for berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine to the target DNA.

In a recent study, it was reported that it has the potential to treat COVID-19. In order to control the quality of commercial cobratide drugs, a protocol was established for the separation, identification and quantification of cobratide and its associated impurities, in which sheathless capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was used for identification and a rapid capillary electrophoresis-ultraviolet-visible detector (CE-UV) method was developed for accurate quantification. Separation conditions that affect the resolution and MS intensities of cobratide and its associated impurities were investigated, including pH value, concentration of background electrolyte (BGE), ratio of organic additive and sample solution. The optimized CE conditions (BGE: 50 mM NH4Ac, pH 4.0; sample solution: deionized water) were used for both sheathless CE-MS and CE-UV methods. Three associated impurities were separated and identified for the first time by sheathless CE-MS. Then, a rapid CE-UV method was validated and used for accurate quantification of cobratide and its associated impurities. The CE-UV method showed good linearity between concentration and corrected peak area of cobratide in the concentration range of 5.36-536.30 \u03bcg mL-1. The limit of quantification of the CE-UV method was 4.16 \u03bcg mL-1. The relative standard deviations of migration time were less than 1% for both intra-day and inter-day experiments, and those of corrected peak area were less than 5%. Finally, different cobratide drugs were analyzed to evaluate the batch-to-batch consistency. This established protocol combining sheathless CE-MS and CE-UV methods would provide useful information for both quality control and process analysis of peptide drugs.",

        "abstract": "Protein deamidation can severely alter the physicochemical characteristics and biological functions of protein therapeutics. Cobratide is a non-addictive analgesic with wide clinical acceptance. However, the Asn residue at position 48 from the N-terminus of the cobratide amino acid sequence (N48) tends to degrade during purification, storage, and transport. This characteristic could severely affect the drug safety and clinical efficacy of cobratide. Traditional methods for quantitating deamidation reported in previous research are characterised by low efficiency and accuracy; the quality control of cobratide via this method is limited. Herein, we developed an improved 18O-labelling method based on the detection of a unique peptide (i.e., the protein fragment of cobratide containing the N48 deamidation hotspot after enzymolysis) using an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer to quantify deamidated cobratide. The limits of detection and quantification of this method reached 0.02 and 0.025 \u03bcM, respectively, and inter- and intra-day precision values of the method were <3%. The accuracy of the 18O-labelling strategy was validated by using samples containing synthesised peptides with a known ratio of deamidation impurities and also by comparing the final total deamidation results with our previously developed capillary electrophoresis method. The recoveries for deamidation (Asp), deamidation isomerisation (iso-Asp), and total deamidation were 101.52 \u00b1 1.17, 102.42 \u00b1 1.82, and 103.55 \u00b1 1.07, respectively. The robustness of the method was confirmed by verifying the chromatographic parameters. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the 18O-labelling strategy for detecting protein deamidation and lay a robust foundation for protein therapeutics studies and drug quality consistency evaluations.",
