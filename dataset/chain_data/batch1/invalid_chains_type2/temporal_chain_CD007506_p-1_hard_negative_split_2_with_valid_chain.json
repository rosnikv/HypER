        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIt has been reported that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) benefit from metformin therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of obese (body mass index >30 kg/m2), oligo-/amenorrhoeic women with PCOS. Metformin (850 mg) twice daily was compared with placebo over 6 months. All received the same advice from a dietitian. The primary outcome measures were: (i) change in menstrual cycle; (ii) change in arthropometric measurements; and (iii) changes in the endocrine parameters, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 143 subjects was randomized [metformin (MET) = 69; placebo (PL) = 74]. Both groups showed significant improvements in menstrual frequency [median increase (MET = 1, P < 0.001; PL = 1, P < 0.001)] and weight loss [mean (kg) (MET = 2.84; P < 0.001 and PL = 1.46; P = 0.011)]. However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the independent variables (metformin, percentage of weight loss, initial BMI and age) in order to predict the improvement of menses. Only the percentage weight loss correlated with an improvement in menses (regression coefficient = 0.199, P = 0.047, odds ratio = 1.126, 95% CI 1.001, 1.266). There were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or lipid profiles in either of the groups. Those who received metformin achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference and free androgen index.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin does not improve weight loss or menstrual frequency in obese patients with PCOS. Weight loss alone through lifestyle changes improves menstrual frequency.",

        "title": "Insulin sensitizing drugs for weight loss in women of reproductive age who are overweight or obese: systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWomen of reproductive age, who are overweight or obese, are prone to infertility. Weight loss in these women leads to increased fecundity, higher chances of conception after infertility treatment and improved pregnancy outcome. In spite of the advantages, most patients have difficulty in losing weight and often regain lost weight over time. This review assesses whether treatment with insulin sensitizing drugs contributes to weight loss, compared with diet or a lifestyle modification programme.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter a systematic search of the literature, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), investigating the effect of insulin sensitizing drugs on weight loss compared with placebo and diet and/or a lifestyle modification programme, were included. Subjects were restricted to women of reproductive age. The main outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 14 trials, unintentionally all but two on women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) only, were included in the analysis. Treatment with metformin showed a statistically significant decrease in BMI compared with placebo (weighted mean difference, -0.68; 95% CI -1.13 to -0.24). There was some indication of greater effect with high-dose metformin (>1500 mg/day) and longer duration of therapy (>8 weeks). Limitations were power, low use of intention-to-treat analysis and heterogeneity of the studies.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA structured lifestyle modification programme to achieve weight loss should still be the first line treatment in obese women with or without PCOS. Adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm the findings of this review and to assess whether the addition of high-dose metformin therapy to a structured lifestyle modification programme might contribute to more weight loss.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To investigate the association between serum lipoprotein ratios and insulin resistance in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Methods. 105 PCOS patients and 109 controls were randomly enrolled in the study. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), total testosterone (T), fasting glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels were checked, and then TG/HDL-C ratio, TC/HDL-C, ratio and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were calculated. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to calculate the insulin resistance. Results. All lipoprotein ratios were significantly higher in PCOS patients as compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). TG/HDL-C ratio, TC/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were significantly correlated with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05). The ROC curve demonstrated that TC/HDL-C ratio had higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PCOS with insulin resistance. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that serum lipoprotein ratio significantly correlates with insulin resistance and can be used as the marker of insulin resistance in PCOS patients.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIt is believed that a dysfunction in adipose tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Natriuretic peptides are hormones that regulate cardiovascular and body fluid homeostasis and adipose tissue metabolism. Natriuretic peptide levels are reduced in individuals with obesity and diabetes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to investigate whether natriuretic peptide levels are altered in women with PCOS and whether they correlate with adiponectin levels or insulin sensitivity markers.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nThis was a cross-sectional study at a referral center in a teaching hospital.\n\n\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS\nWe evaluated 40 patients diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria and 36 control women matched for age and body mass index.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe measured serum adiponectin, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and plasma brain natriuretic peptide using enzyme immunoassays in both groups. We evaluated metabolic markers, such as fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. In addition, we calculated the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and the lipid accumulation product (LAP) index and tested the linear correlations between these metabolic indices and the plasma ANP and serum adiponectin concentrations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nANP and adiponectin were reduced in the PCOS group compared with the control group (P = 0.010 and P = 0.014, respectively). The brain natriuretic peptide concentration did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.883). There was no correlation between ANP and any of the metabolic markers. In the control group, the serum adiponectin level was inversely correlated with BMI (P = 0.011), waist circumference (P = 0.021), insulin (P = 0.013), fasting glucose (P = 0.010), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (P = 0.007), and lipid accumulation product (P = 0.022). Remarkably, none of these correlations were observed in the women with PCOS.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWomen with PCOS had lower ANP and adiponectin compared with controls matched for age and BMI. Thus, the mechanisms that affect ANP and adiponectin production and clearance may be altered in PCOS, regardless of adiposity. These hormones may be involved in the metabolic features of PCOS.",

        "title": "The LIPT-Study: On Risk Markers of Vascular Thrombosis in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Effect of Liraglutide",
        "abstract": "Overweight and insulin resistance (IR) are central pathogenic features of the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and weight loss is the main treatment option. PCOS is also associated with signs of a chronic inflammation, activation of the coagulation system, defect endothelial function and increased arterial stiffness, all regarded as risk factors or markers for the development of cardiovascular disease. These factors are not taken into account in the definition of the syndrome, which is based on the 3 Rotterdam criteria. An uncertainty of the clinical risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in these relatively young women has led to many studies on surrogate markers of CVD in PCOS, including the search for new markers with additional information of the arteriosclerotic burden in PCOS. GLP-1 analogues, originally developed for the treatment of diabetes, induce weight loss also in non-diabetic people. We therefore questioned whether treatment with the GLP-1 analogue Liraglutide to women with PCOS in doses used for diabetes could induce weight loss and improve IR and through this action, or independently, improve markers of vascular thrombosis in women with PCOS. Thus, 70 overweight and/or insulin resistant PCOS women were planned treated for 26 weeks in a placebo controlled randomized trial with the following effect parameters to be evaluated: Changes in Thrombin generation time, Adrenomedullin, Atrial natriuretic peptide, body fat composition (DEXA), liver fat content (MRI), BMI, IR, sex hormones and ovarian morphology.

Purpose To quantify the differences in estimates of ovarian volume and antral follicle count (AFC) from two-dimensional (2D) and 3D transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods A cross-sectional study on 66 overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to Rotterdam criteria. Ovarian volume and AFC were estimated from MRI, 2D TVUS, and 3D TVUS, and serum AMH levels were assessed. Bland\u2013Altman statistics were used for comparison. Results Participants had a median age of 29 years (age range, 19\u201344 years) with a mean BMI of 32.7\u2009kg/m2 (SD 4.5). Ovarian volume from 2D TVUS was 1.48\u2009mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94\u20132.03; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 1.25\u2009mL (95% CI, 0.62\u20131.87; P\u2009<\u20090.001) smaller than from 3D TVUS and MRI, respectively. AFC from 2D TVUS was 18% (95% CI, 13\u201323; P\u2009<\u20090.005) and 16% (95% CI, 6\u201325; P\u2009<\u20090.005) smaller than estimates from 3D TVUS and MRI, respectively. Correlations between AMH and AFC from 2D TVUS, 3D TVUS, and MRI were 0.67, 0.78, and 0.70, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for all). Conclusion In an overweight PCOS population, 2D TVUS underestimated ovarian volume and AFC as compared with 3D TVUS and MRI. Serum AMH correlated best with AFC from 3D TVUS, followed by MRI and 2D TVUS. The advantage of 3D TVUS might be of minor clinical importance when diagnosing PCOS, but useful when the actual AFC are of interest, e.g. in fertility counseling and research.",
