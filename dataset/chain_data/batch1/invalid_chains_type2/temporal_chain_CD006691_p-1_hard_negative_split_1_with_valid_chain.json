        "title": "Metformin as an adjunct therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate whether, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, the addition of metformin to insulin and standard diabetes management results in 1) higher insulin sensitivity and 2) lower HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin dosage (units per kilogram per day) and BMI.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis was a randomized, placebo-controlled 3-month trial of metformin therapy in 27 adolescents with type 1 diabetes, high insulin dosage (>1 unit. kg(-1). day(-1)), and HbA1c >8%, with measurements of insulin sensitivity (by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test [FSIGT]), HbA1c, insulin dosage, and BMI at the onset and end of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt t = 0, HbA1c was 9.2 +/- 0.9%, insulin dosage was 1.2 +/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1), fasting glucose was 10.6 +/- 2.4 mmol/l, and BMI was 24.2 +/- 3.9 kg/m2 (means +/- SD), with no difference between the metformin and placebo groups. At the end of the study, HbA1c was 0.6% lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). This was achieved at lower daily insulin dosages (metformin group -0.14 +/- 0.1 vs. placebo group 0.02 +/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1); P < 0.05), with no significant change in BMI. Fasting glucose levels improved significantly in the metformin group (P < 0.05). Change in insulin sensitivity, measured by FSIGT, was not significantly different between the two groups at study end. Mild hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in the metformin-treated than in the placebo subjects (1.75 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.4 events. patient(-1). week(-1); P = 0.03). There were no differences in frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes or gastrointestinal complaints between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin treatment lowered HbA1c and decreased insulin dosage with no weight gain in teens with type 1 diabetes in poor metabolic control. Changes in insulin sensitivity were not documented in this study using the FSIGT. Long-term studies will determine whether these improvements are sustained and whether certain subgroups accrue greater benefit from this therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: A high prevalence of hyperandrogenism has been reported in women with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Metformin has been used as a therapeutic agent in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and in T1D patients without hyperandrogenism. This study sought to determine the effect of metformin on hyperandrogenism and ovarian function in adolescents with T1D. Methods: We recruited 24 girls with T1D. The participants had hyperandrogenism and displayed suboptimal metabolic control. The patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One group received metformin (850 mg bid) and the other group received a placebo. Treatment was administered for 9 months. Ovulation, steroids and gonadotropin levels were evaluated. Results: Metformin treatment was associated with decreases in testosterone, free androgen index, androstenedione, 17-OH progesterone and estradiol levels. The girls who were treated with placebo showed stable steroid, gonadotropin and sex hormone-binding globulin levels during the analysis. No differences were observed in the Ferriman-Gallwey scores, ovulation rates, HbA1c levels or daily insulin doses of the girls treated with metformin compared with the placebo group. Conclusion: Treating hyperandrogenic T1D adolescents with metformin significantly decreased the serum androgens compared to the placebo, but metformin therapy did not significantly affect clinical parameters, such as hirsutism, ovulation and metabolic control.",

        "title": "The treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus with agents approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The management of type 1 diabetes remains a challenge for clinicians. Current practice is to administer insulin analogues to best mimic normal physiological insulin profiles. However, despite our best efforts the majority of individuals with type 1 diabetes continue to suffer from suboptimal glucose control, significant hypoglycemia and microvascular tissue complications of the disease. There is thus a significant unmet need in the treatment of T1DM to obtain better glycemic control. Areas covered: We discuss the use of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl-peptidase inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, biguanides, thiazolidinediones and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in individuals with T1DM. Expert opinion: Non-insulin therapies present a unique and exciting adjunctive treatment for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Although data are scarce, the classes of medications discussed help to lower glucose, decrease glycemic excursions and in some cases improve body weight, along with allowing dose reductions in total daily insulin. Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, in particular, have been demonstrated to provide clinical improvements in individuals with T1DM and we feel their use can be explored in obese, insulin-resistant patients with T1DM, those with frequent and significant glycemic excursions or individuals with persistently elevated hemoglobin A1c.",

        "title": "Insulin sensitizer prevents and ameliorates experimental type 1 diabetes.",
        "abstract": "Insulin-dependent type-1 diabetes (T1D) is driven by autoimmune \u03b2-cell failure, whereas systemic resistance to insulin is considered the hallmark of insulin-independent type-2 diabetes (T2D). In contrast to this canonical dichotomy, insulin resistance appears to precede the overt diabetic stage of T1D and predict its progression, implying that insulin sensitizers may change the course of T1D. However, previous attempts to ameliorate T1D in animal models or patients by insulin sensitizers have largely failed. Sensitization to insulin by MEthyl-substituted long-chain DICArboxylic acid (MEDICA) analogs in T2D animal models surpasses that of current insulin sensitizers, thus prompting our interest in probing MEDICA in the T1D context. MEDICA efficacy in modulating the course of T1D was verified in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats and autoimmune nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. MEDICA treatment normalizes overt diabetes in STZ diabetic rats when added on to subtherapeutic insulin, and prevents/delays autoimmune T1D in NOD mice. MEDICA treatment does not improve \u03b2-cell insulin content or insulitis score, but its efficacy is accounted for by pronounced total body sensitization to insulin. In conclusion, potent insulin sensitizers may counteract genetic predisposition to autoimmune T1D and amplify subtherapeutic insulin into an effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of overt T1D.",
