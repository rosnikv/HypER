        "abstract": "A cross sectional analysis of the correlation between clinical, laboratory, and radiological markers of disease activity in 98 patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reported. The median age was 38 years, the median age at onset of disease 29 years, and the median duration of disease seven years. The Keitel function test (KFT) showed good correlation with the Ritchie articular index (RAI) (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.5) and the disability questionnaire (DQ) (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.6). The RAI and DQ correlated weakly with laboratory variables, while the KFT showed significant correlation with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and plasma viscosity (PV) (p less than 0.001; r = 0.4; 0.3; 0.4). Only the KFT showed significant correlations with bone mass measurements (p less than 0.01; r = -0.3; -0.4), and the Larsen index at the right wrist (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.4). Consensus analysis suggested that the KFT is a useful single clinical test of disease activity in RA. The hand functional index (HFI), a component of the KFT, showed significant correlation with the total KFT (r = 0.9). Prospective drug trials are needed to establish the value of the HFI in the monitoring of patients with RA.",

The results were compared with joint tenderness counts, which were made according to the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe intra-observer variability using the electronic method was significantly decreased compared with the conventional ARA joint tenderness counts.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe electronic method is more efficient for use in clinical trials than is the conventional ARA joint tenderness count.",

The source paper evaluated the correlation between clinical, laboratory, and radiological markers of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and the current paper aims to improve the measurement of joint tenderness, a crucial clinical marker. The electronic method for measuring joint tenderness can be seen as an extension of the Keitel function test (KFT) used in the source paper."

        "abstract": "AN articular index is a formalized method of expressing the severity and extent of joint involvement in inflammatory arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatologists agree that articular indices are important in clinical investigations [1], use them in some form in routine clinical practice [2], and when aware of each other's assessments on similar patients converge on an articular index as the main determinant of their clinical evaluations [3]. It is difficult to conceive of a clinical study of rheumatoid arthritis which would not now include an articular index. A variety of articular indices have been devised and adopted. If these were simply different but comparable scales by which to measure patients their multiplicity would not cause any difficulty, but this is not the case. Until recently there has been little agreement about which joints should be selected for inclusion in an articular index and how they should be examined [4]. For example, the Ritchie index [5] grades the tenderness of groups of joints, the index described by the Cooperating Clinics of the American Rheumatism Association (the ARA index) [6] counts joints that are tender and/or swollen and the Lansbury index [7] scores the severity of inflammation, weighted for joint surface area. All have been shown to be sensitive to changes in a patient's condition, but which is the best measure of joint inflammation?",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo explore the use of willingness-to-pay (WTP) methods with respect to an antagonist of tumour necrosis factor as an antirheumatic drug.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and fifteen rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients at a tertiary care centre in Odense, Denmark were interviewed using two WTP approaches, the contingent ranking and double-bounded (closed-ended) methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe average closed-ended WTP value was DKr581 and the average contingent ranking WTP was DKr643. There were no statistically significant differences in the WTP estimates between the two methods.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is feasible to use these methods with arthritis patients. If, as suggested in a number of recent reviews, a major effort is to be put into undertaking economic appraisals of arthritis programmes, then this should include more cost-benefit studies using WTP approaches of the kind illustrated in this paper.",

        "title": "Willingness to pay for colorectal cancer screening: a comparison of elicitation formats",
        "abstract": "Willingness to pay is increasingly being used in health technology assessment, although a number of methodological issues remain unresolved. Using data collected from four studies, this thesis presents the findings from a direct comparison between alternative format designs to elicit willingness to pay for two alternative colorectal cancer screening tests; faecal occult blood (FOB) testing and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) testing. Along with the willingness to pay values estimated using the open-ended, payment scale, closed-ended and iterative bidding formats, information is collected on household income, attitudes toward health promotion and personal risk perceptions to determine the nature and value of responses. In comparison with the alternative formats, the closed-ended question design produced significantly higher WTP valuations and different justifications for those valuations. It is hypothesised that the yea-saying effect may explain this difference. The payment scale format achieved a higher completion rate compared to the open-ended design and both formats produced broadly similar valuations. Although a subsequent study suggested evidence of range bias within the payment scale design. The iterative bidding format produced higher valuations than the open-ended and payment scale but lower than the closed-ended, it is hypothesised that valuations obtained using different initial bids demonstrate the existence of starting point bias. Across all studies, respondents who have a high health motivation, are well educated, have a high household income and who are particularly worried about the disease have a positive effect on the willingness to pay for colorectal cancer screening.",
