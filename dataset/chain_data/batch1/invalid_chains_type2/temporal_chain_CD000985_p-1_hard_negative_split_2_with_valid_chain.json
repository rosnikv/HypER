        "abstract": "Sixty patients were recruited into a randomized parallel group comparison of three thrombolytic regimens for acute or subacute peripheral arterial thrombosis. There were no significant differences in age, duration of history, length of occlusion or presence of neurosensory deficit between the groups. Initially successful lysis was significantly greater with intra\u2010arterial (IA) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt\u2010PA) than with either streptokinase (Sk) (P < 0.04) or intravenous (IV) rt\u2010PA (P < 0.01). The duration of therapy varied from a median of 35 h with IA rt\u2010PA to 40 h with Sk (P > 0.5). The median (confidence interval) increase in ankle:brachial pressure index following IA rt\u2010PA of 0.57 (0.33\u20130.82) was significantly higher than for either Sk of 0.24 (0\u20130.57) or for IV rt\u2010PA of 0.18 (0\u20130.41). Limb salvage at 30 days was achieved in 80, 60 and 45 per cent respectively for IA rt\u2010PA, Sk and IV rt\u2010PA. Haemorrhagic complications occurred in six patients following Sk and in 13 following IV rt\u2010PA; only one minor haemorrhage occurred following a catheter perforation in a patient who received IA rt\u2010PA (P < 0.05). IA rt\u2010PA provides a more effective, safer fibrinolytic regimen than conventional therapy with Sk. IV rt\u2010PA has not been as successful and carries a significantly higher risk of haemorrhagic complications.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nIntra-arterial thrombolysis is commonly used as the initial treatment of acute or subacute lower extremity ischemia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the efficacy and cost of thrombolysis, we retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive cases (87 patients) in which intra-arterial lysis (urokinase) was used as the initial treatment for native arterial lower extremity occlusive disease. The mean age of patients was 67 years, 57% of the patients were male, and preexisting peripheral vascular disease was present in 74%. Presenting symptoms were limb-threatening ischemia (53%) and claudication (47%). Acute symptoms (< 2 weeks' duration) were present in 48%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 30-day morbidity rate was 31%, and four patients died. Complications were significant bleeding (23%), ischemic stroke (1%), and renal failure with (2%) and without (2%) dialysis. Concomitant angioplasty was performed in 63%. Complete or significant lysis as demonstrated with angiography was achieved in 75% of iliac, 58% of femoropopliteal, and 41% of crural vessels (P <.001). Within 30 days of lysis, 9% of patients underwent major amputation and 20% surgical revascularization (in 3 patients the extent of revascularization was lessened by the lytic therapy). Amputation-free survival was 83% and 75% at 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Relief of ischemia (defined as relief of claudication or limb salvage without major surgical intervention) was achieved in only 70% and 43% of patients at 30 days and 2 years, respectively (Kaplan-Meier analysis; mean follow-up, 31 months). Patients with aortoiliac disease had significantly better outcomes than those with infrainguinal disease (P =.03). Duration or type of presenting symptoms did not predict outcome. The cost of the initial hospitalization per patient for thrombolysis was $18,490.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThrombolysis can be as or more costly than surgery and is associated with a suboptimal outcome in a significant number of patients. These data lead us to caution against a uniform policy of initial thrombolysis for patients who present with lower extremity ischemia.",

        "abstract": "Thromboembolic disease occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients with significant co-morbidities and variable presentations, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. To decrease these complications, multiple different endovascular modalities have been developed and used to treat this challenging problem. Physicians are now left with a broad array of endovascular and surgical options. Unfortunately, there are little data that accurately compare these modalities. Therefore, an individual approach to each patient with acute ischemia from thromboembolic disease must be employed. In order to tailor the treatment to the needs of each patient, the physician must be familiar with the techniques, complications, technology, and relative strengths and weaknesses of each treatment modality. This article will first outline the main technical considerations for performing surgical thromboembolectomy. The complications of operative thromboembolectomy will then be discussed followed by the data comparing operative and nonoperative therapy.

        "title": "Acute Limb Ischemia: Surgical Thromboembolectomy and the Clinical Course of Arterial Revascularization at Ankle",
        "abstract": "Abstract Surgical thromboembolectomy for acute limb ischemia using Fogarty catheter is basically a blind procedure. Therefore, the complete removal of thromboemboli in all calf arteries is difficult even if completion angiography or radiological intervention is performed. The purpose of this study is to identify whether limb salvage could be achieved if at least one ankle artery was revascularized by surgical thromboembolectomy. We also observed the effectiveness of below-knee popliteal approach. Over 1\u2009year, surgical thromboembolectomy via below-knee popliteal artery was performed on 18 acutely ischemic limbs in 14 consecutive patients. All patients were diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and computed tomography (CT) angiography. Surgical thromboembolectomy was terminated when a pulse was detected by a handheld vascular Doppler device in at least one ankle artery after closing the arteriotomy. Patients were observed during postoperative anticoagulation therapy. Of the 14 patients, 1 died and 1 underwent amputation due to the already necrotized lesion in the foot. After 1\u2009week of anticoagulation therapy, two or more arterial pulses were detected at the ankles in all 15 limbs from the remaining 12 patients. During the 6 to 18 months of follow-up, all 15 limbs were salvaged successfully. In acute limb ischemia, successful limb salvage could be achieved by the revascularization of at least one ankle artery by surgical thromboembolectomy with concomitant anticoagulation therapy. Below-knee popliteal approach is an effective method and is worth for further study compared with other approaches.",

        "title": "Investigation of the Effects of Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio and Preoperative Computed Tomographic Angiography on the Occurrence of Acute Kidney Injury in Diabetic Patients following Surgical Thromboembolectomy",
        "abstract": "Acute lower extremity ischemia (ALI) is a cardiovascular emergency resulting from embolic and thrombotic causes. Although endovascular techniques have advanced, surgical thromboembolectomy is still the gold standard. Emergency thromboembolectomy surgery involves an ischemia-reperfusion injury, which also poses a risk for acute renal injury (AKI). The stress hyperglycemia rate (SHR) has recently emerged as an important prognostic value in emergency cardiovascular events. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the impact of preoperative contrast-enhanced tomographic angiography (CTA) and the SHR value on postoperative AKI in emergency thromboembolectomy procedures in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM). In this retrospective analysis, patients with DM who received emergency surgical thromboembolectomy after being hospitalized at our hospital with ALI between 20 October 2015, and 10 September 2022, were included. Patients were classified into two groups: Group 1 (N = 159), who did not develop AKI, and Group 2 (N = 45), who did. The 45 patients in Group 2 and the 159 patients in Group 1 had median ages of 59 (39\u201390) and 66 (37\u201393), respectively (p = 0.008). The percentage of patients in Group 2 with Rutherford class IIB and admission times longer than 6 h was higher (p = 0.003, p = 0.027, respectively). To determine the variables affecting AKI after surgical embolectomy procedures, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used. In multivariate analysis Model 1, age > 65 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.425, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.230\u20131.980, p < 0.001), preoperative high creatinine (OR: 4.194, 95% CI: 2.890\u20136.156, p = 0.003), and Rutherford class (OR: 0.874, 95% CI: 0.692\u20130.990, p = 0.036) were determined as independent predictors for AKI. In Model 2, age > 65 years (OR: 1.224 CI: 1.090\u20131.679, p = 0.014), preoperative high creatinine (OR: 3.975, 95% CI: 2.660\u20135.486, p = 0.007), and SHR (OR: 2.142, CI: 1.134\u20133.968, p = 0.003), were determined as independent predictors for amputation. In conclusion, when an emergency thromboembolectomy operation is planned in insulin-dependent DM patients, renal risky groups can be identified, and renal protective measures can be taken. In addition, to reduce the renal risk, according to the suitability of the clinical conditions of the patients, the decision to perform a CTA with contrast can be taken by looking at the SHR value.",
