        "abstract": "Uncontrolled studies have suggested that sulphasalazine may be an effective second line agent in rheumatoid arthritis. Sulphasalazine was therefore compared with placebo and intramuscular sodium aurothiomalate in 90 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. After six months' treatment both sulphasalazine and sodium aurothiomalate had produced significant clinical and laboratory benefit, whereas placebo had produced no significant change in any variable. Thirteen patients stopped taking the placebo because of lack of effect whereas only two patients stopped taking sulphasalazine and one sodium aurothiomalate for this reason. The major toxicity encountered in the group treated with sulphasalazine was nausea or vomiting, or both; this may be related to slow acetylator phenotype. Sulphasalazine appears to be an effective second line agent, and further pharmacokinetic studies might prove useful in diminishing gastrointestinal side effects.",

        "abstract": "Sulphasalazine is known to be effective as a second line agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The two chemical constituents of sulphasalazine (sulphapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid) were assessed separately in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Over 24 weeks sulphapyridine showed a pronounced second line effect comparable with sulphasalazine and with a similar toxicity profile, whereas 5-aminosalicylic acid showed only a weak first line effect. Thus sulphapyridine appears to be the active moiety responsible for the second line effect of sulphasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis. The efficacy of the antibacterial component of sulphasalazine yet again permits speculation about the role of a bacterial pathogen in the aetiopathogenesis of rheumatoid disease.",

        "abstract": "Our studies have shown that Salazopyrin EN is an effective slow-acting anti-rheumatic drug, improving clinical synovitis, depressing the acute phase response, capable of inducing remissions and possibly influencing the progression of joint damage. It is well-tolerated in the long-term with comparatively few serious side effects. Its mechanism of action, however, is still not entirely clear. We have found that the sulphapyridine moiety penetrates the synovial membrane and also that it can modify immune function. While Salazopyrin undoubtedly has an important role in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, it probably also has a place in the treatment of seronegative arthropathies and the spondyloarthritides. Furthermore we suggest that it should be used as an anchor drug in combination therapy to attempt to suppress disease activity further and limit joint damage.",

        "abstract": "Two 19 year old patients with juvenile chronic arthritis developed liver toxicity during treatment with sulphasalazine. A significant increase in the levels of liver enzymes in serum samples was noticed in relation to the initiation of treatment in one patient and to the increase in dose in the second. The enzymes returned to normal levels 14 days after the drug had been stopped. A rechallenge in one of the patients caused re-exacerbation. This is the first report of liver toxicity induced by sulphasalazine in juvenile chronic arthritis. As spontaneous liver involvement in juvenile chronic arthritis is not rare, the possibility of drug induced hepatitis should be recognised in these patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nSulfasalazine (SSZ) has recently been shown to be effective for the management of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). This study investigated the efficacy and adverse effects of SSZ therapy in children with JRA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from the medical records of 24 children with JRA who were treated with oral SSZ during the period from 1993 through 2000 were analyzed retrospectively. Disease onset was polyarticular in six children, oligoarticular in 11, and systemic in seven. All patients had received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 17 had received SSZ and azathioprine (AZA) concomitantly. The initial dose of SSZ averaged 21.6 mg.kg-1.d-1. The mean duration of treatment was 13.3 months (range, 3-66 mo). The mean duration of follow-up was 16.6 months (range, 3-66 mo) from the start of SSZ therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty children (83%) showed clinical improvement and 18 children (75%) achieved clinical remission. Patients with systemic-onset JRA had lower response rates than did those with an oligoarticular onset (p < 0.05). SSZ was discontinued in seven patients following 7 months of clinical remission and 10 months of treatment. Relapse occurred in four patients (16.7%) following a mean of 17 months of clinical remission. All achieved remission again after restarting the regimen and increasing the SSZ dosage by one-third. Adverse effects related to SSZ were found in only three patients (12.5%): nausea and epigastralgia in two, skin rash in the other.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSSZ in combination with other drugs (NSAIDs or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) is safe and appears to be an effective treatment for JRA, especially in patients with the oligoarticular- and polyarticular-onset disease.",

ESR revealed more responsiveness to treatment compared to CRP (SRMs were -0.69 and -0.31, respectively). At the time of diagnosis, high CRP levels (>or= 5mg/dL) correlated with poor therapeutic response, as do positive CRP (> 0.8 mg/dL) and high ESR levels (> 40 mm/h) after treatment for six months. Overall, initial high CRP levels (>or= 5mg/dL) demonstrated the strongest predictive role of failure of the first remission.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor disease diagnosis, ESR can be a better parameter than CRP but a high initial CRP level can strongly predict treatment failure of the first remission.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nImplant prosthodontic treatment outcomes for patients suffering from autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with or without concomitant connective tissue diseases (CTD) were evaluated.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThirty-four female patients' (25 isolated RA; nine RA+CTD) implant survival/success rate, peri-implant conditions (marginal bone loss, pocket depth, plaque index, gingiva index and bleeding index) and incidence of prosthodontic maintenance were retrospectively evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nImplants evaluated presented a high implant survival (100%) and a 3.5-year success (93.8%) rate during the follow-up programme (mean 47.6 month) without difference between isolated RA (94.6%) and RA and concomitant CTD (92.3%), respectively. In isolated RA, acceptable marginal bone resorption (mean: 2.1 mm; SD: 0.5 mm), pocket depth (mean: 2.8 mm; SD:3.2 mm) and healthy soft-tissue conditions (plaque/bleeding/gingiva index Grade 0 in 80%) were noticed. However, patients with RA+CTD presented increased bone resorption (mean: 3.1 mm; SD: 0.7 mm) and more vulnerable soft-tissue conditions (higher bleeding index) differing significantly to patients with isolated RA (p<0.01). Peri-implant parameters were significantly influenced by the patients' underlying disease (RA, RA+CTD; Kruskal-Wallis test, Jonckheere-Terpstra test).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn contrast to isolated RA, in RA patients with concomitant CTD, differences in the peri-implant parameters such as pronounced marginal bone resorption and bleeding may be anticipated and appear to be significantly influenced by the patients' underlying disease.",

        "title": "Assessment of the Tissue Response to Modification of the Surface of Dental Implants with Carboxyethylphosphonic Acid and Basic Fibroblastic Growth Factor Immobilization (Fgf-2): An Experimental Study on Minipigs",
        "abstract": "Simple Summary This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of treating the surface of dental implants with carboxyethylphosphonic acid for the immobilization of FGF-2, the influence of FGF-2 on cortical bone in close contact with dental implants, new bone formation around dental implants in the presence of FGF-2 and the influence of FGF-2 on the interthread bone area of dental implants during the healing period after insertion. Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implant surface treatment with carboxyethylphosphonic acid and fibroblast growth factor 2 on the bone\u2013implant interface during the osseointegration period in vivo using an animal model. The present research was carried out in six minipigs, in whose left tibia implants were inserted as follows: eight implants with a standard surface treatment, for the control group, and eight implants with a surface treatment of carboxyethylphosphonic acid and immobilization of FGF-2, for the test group. At 4 weeks after the insertion of the implants, the animals were sacrificed for the histomorphometric analysis of the samples. The means of the results for the implant\u2013bone contact variable (BIC) were 46.39 \u00b1 17.49% for the test group and 34.00 \u00b1 9.92% for the control group; the difference was not statistically significant. For the corrected implant\u2013bone contact variable (BICc), the mean value of the test group was 60.48 \u00b1 18.11%, and that for the control group, 43.08 \u00b1 10.77%; the difference was statistically significant (p-value = 0.035). The new bone formation (BV/TV) showed average results of 27.28 \u00b1 3.88% for the test group and 26.63 \u00b1 7.90% for the control group, meaning that the differences were not statistically significant (p-value = 0.839). Regarding the bone density at the interthread level (BAI/TA), the mean value of the test group was 32.27 \u00b1 6.70%, and that of the control group was 32.91 \u00b1 7.76%, with a p-value of 0.863, while for the peri-implant density (BAP/TA), the mean value of the test group was 44.96 \u00b1 7.55%, and that for the control group was 44.80 \u00b1 8.68%, without a significant difference between the groups. The current research only found a significant difference for the bone\u2013implant contact at the cortical level; therefore, it could be considered that FGF-2 acts on the mineralization of bone tissue. The application of carboxyethylphosphonic acid on the surface of implants can be considered a promising alternative as a biomimetic coating for the immobilization of FGF-2. Despite no differences in the new bone formation around the implants or in the interthread or peri-implant bone density being detected, the biofunctionalization of the implant surface with FGF-2 accelerates the mineralization of the bone\u2013implant interface at the cortical level, thereby reducing the osseointegration period.",

        "title": "Bone Response to Osteopontin-Functionalized Carboxyethylphosphonic Acid-Modified Implants. Experimental Study in a Minipig Model",
        "abstract": "Currently, dental implants have become a common and reliable treatment for restoring masticatory function in edentulous patients. Their surface topography is of great importance for the adhesion and remodeling of bone cells, both in the initial phases and over time, and different strategies have been proposed to improve the biological performance of conventional sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched implant surfaces. Corrosion has been identified as one of the causes of implant failure due to contact with oral fluids. Carboxyethylphosphonic acid is a potent anticorrosive that would form stable bonds with titanium oxide, generating an organic layer on which modifications could be made to improve cell adhesion. Osteopontin is considered a molecule capable of improving the osseointegration of titanium. Our study evaluated the osseointegration capacity of titanium implants modified with carboxyethylphosphonic acid and functionalized with osteopontin in a minipig model. A total of 16 implants were inserted in the tibial diaphysis of two minipigs, 8 implants modified with carboxyethylphosphonic acid and functionalized with osteopontin from the experimental group and 8 from the control group with sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched surface treatment. After 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the samples were analyzed by histomorphometric analysis, assessing bone-implant contact, cortical bone-implant contact, percentage of new bone, peri-implant bone density and interthread bone area interthread. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.18. Statistical significance was found between groups for the percentage of new bone (p = 0.04) and for interthread bone area interthread (p = 0.01). Functionalization of titanium surfaces by osteopontin may be of interest for conditioning bone remodeling in the early stages of osseointegration, although more in vivo studies are needed to determine its real influence in this aspect.",
