        "title": "Gastrointestinal toxicity with celecoxib vs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: the CLASS study: A randomized controlled trial. Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nConventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000.\n\n\nSETTING\nThree hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nIncidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255",

        "title": "Bayesian methods in cost-effectiveness studies: objectivity, computation and other relevant aspects.",
        "abstract": "In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) of a cost-effectiveness (CE) study, the unknown parameters are considered as random variables. A crucial question is what probabilistic distribution is suitable for synthesizing the available information (mainly data from clinical trials) about these parameters. In this context, the important role of Bayesian methodology has been recognized, where the parameters are of a random nature. We explore, in the context of CE analyses, how formal objective Bayesian methods can be implemented. We fully illustrate the methodology using two CE problems that frequently appear in the CE literature. The results are compared with those obtained with other popular approaches to PSA. We find that the discrepancies can be quite marked, specially when the number of patients enrolled in the simulated cohort under study is large. Finally, we describe in detail the numerical methods that need to be used to obtain the results.",

        "abstract": "Mixture model is a probabilistic model that denotes the presence of subpopulations within an overall population meanwhile finite mixture model is a mixture model with finite-dimensional. In this paper, finite mixture model is applied and the application of Bayesian method to fit finite mixture model is popular and these application is adopt in the present study in order to explore the relationship between rubber price and exchange rate for Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia. Exchange rate plays leading role for a country because it represents the development for that country. The changes of exchange rate influence the flows of investment either the import or export prices for a nation's. While another data set that adopt is rubber price. Rubber is an economic commodity that prospers in tropical climate. It is an important raw material because the latex that extracted is the primary source of natural rubber that enables to produce many useful products such as tires, surgical gloves, industrial hoses, rubber sheeting, industrial form parts and others household rubber products. Results found that rubber price effect on the change of exchange rate for Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia.",

        "abstract": "This paper examined the relationships between exchange rates and the volumes of Thailand\u2019s top two majors agricultural goods export which were rice and rubber exports. The results indicated that exchange rates had negative significant effects on Thailand\u2019s agricultural goods export volumes. Results also showed that the exchange rates influenced total agricultural, rubber, and rice goods export volumes respectively. For the qualitative research, interviewing 17 business men who came from rice exports companies 6 persons and from rubber exports companies 11 persons used the in-depth interview. The results showed the effect of exchange rate had strong fluctuation then exporters could not handle it on time, and make the problems all parts of working in companies. Moreover, the best way to do hedging exchange rate risk for exporters, Companies had to book the forward contact in order to reduce the risk.",

        "title": "Export Analysis of Major Commodities in Malaysia",
        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the factors associated with the commodity export demand and to explore and quantify the contribution of the commodity export to economic growth. The technique of (VECM) Vector Error Correction is applied to estimate the export and economic growth model. It tests whether there has been a long-run relationship between commodity export volume and exogenous variables such as own price, substitute price, exchange rate, world population and industrial production index. The results indicated that there is a long run relationship among variables. The result suggests that exchange rate have a negative impact to the palm oil, rubber and tin where depreciation may reduce export of these commodities. The findings of the research also show that the commodities export has mixed effect on economic growth in Malaysia. Export of petroleum, palm oil and sawlog has a positive and significant relationship with economic growth in the long run while only petroleum and palm oil contributed to the economic growth in the short run. The evidence of impulse response function shows that exchange rate and FDI shock have a relatively higher significant impact on all exports of major commodities and economic growth respectively. This study implies that export of major commodities in Malaysia should be treated as an engine of growth. The effective management of exchange rate and export promotion policies can play a significant role in increasing commodity exports thus will improve Malaysia economic growth.",

        "title": "Competitiveness and determinants of Indonesia's natural rubber exports in main partner countries",
        "abstract": "The main destination countries play an important role in Indonesia's natural rubber exports, as most of Indonesia's natural rubber is exported to these countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative advantage and determinants of Indonesia's natural rubber exports to major partner countries. The RCA (Revealed Comparative Advantage) index is used to assess the comparative advantage, and panel data regression analysis is used to analyze the determinants of exports to the main partner countries (USA, China, Japan, India, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Belgium and Turkey). The results of this study indicate that Indonesian natural rubber has a comparative advantage in the main partner countries, which are characterized by RCA index >1. In addition, it was determined that based on panel data regression, the increase in the world price of natural rubber and export restriction policies have led to a decline in natural rubber exports from Indonesia. It is found that the population of Indonesia reduces exports, while the population of partner countries increases exports due to population growth, which will increase the consumption of natural rubber. On the other hand, the increase in Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) will lead to an increase in natural rubber production capacity, which will contribute to an increase in exports. It is found that the previous year's demand was also taken into account by partner countries that import Indonesian natural rubber. The results of this study can be useful for the Indonesian government and stakeholders (such as natural rubber producers and exporters) to identify strategies to improve export performance",
