        "abstract": "Background:\u2002 Collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon with a benign and sometimes relapsing course. Frequency among patients with chronic diarrhea and normal looking colonoscopy is around 10\u201315%. To date, treatment of CC and LC is not well defined. Data about these conditions are mostly derived from retrospective studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response to treatment and the clinical course of CC and LC in a large group of patients prospectively diagnosed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe association between smoking and inflammatory bowel disease has long been recognized, but its role in the development of microscopic colitis is less well defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to identify all available studies on the association between smoking and risk of microscopic colitis and to synthesize their results.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to May 2018 for cohort studies and case-control studies that compared the risk of microscopic colitis among current/former smokers vs individuals who have never smoked. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the included studies and pooled together using a random-effects model, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven studies (2 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) with 262,312 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Relative to never-smokers, current smokers had significantly increased odds of microscopic colitis, with a pooled OR of 2.99 (95% CI, 2.15-4.15; I2, 64%). Former smokers also had significantly higher odds of microscopic colitis compared with never-smokers, with a pooled OR of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.37-1.94; I2, 0%). Funnel plots were symmetric and did not provide suggestive evidence of publication bias for both analyses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe current systematic review and meta-analysis found a significantly higher risk of microscopic colitis among current smokers compared with never-smokers. The risk attenuated among former smokers but remained significantly higher among never-smokers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nThe association between microscopic colitis (MC) and cancer risk is unclear. Large, population-based studies are lacking.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a nationwide cohort study of 11,758 patients with incident MC (diagnosed 1990-2016 in Sweden), 50,828 matched reference individuals and 11,614 siblings to MC patients. Data were obtained through Sweden\u00b4s pathology departments and from the Swedish Cancer Register. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the end of follow up (mean: 6.7 years), 1,239 (10.5%) of MC patients had received a cancer diagnosis, compared to 4,815 (9.5%) of reference individuals (aHR 1.08 (95%CI=1.02-1.16)). The risk of cancer was highest during the first year of follow up. The absolute excess risks for cancer at 5, 10 and 20 years after MC diagnosis were +1.0% (95%CI=0.4%-1.6%), +1.5% (0.4%-2.6%) and +3.7% (-2.3-9.6%), respectively, equivalent to one extra cancer event in every 55 individuals with MC followed for ten years.MC was associated with an increased risk of lymphoma (aHR 1.43, 1.06-1.92) and lung cancer (aHR 1.32, 1.04-1.68) but with decreased risks of colorectal (aHR 0.52, 0.40-0.66) and gastrointestinal cancers (aHR 0.72, 0.60-0.85). We found no association with breast or bladder cancer. Using siblings as reference group to minimize the impact of shared genetic and early environmental factors, patients with MC were still at an increased risk of cancer (HR=1.20; 95%CI=1.06-1.36).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis nationwide cohort study demonstrated an 8% increased risk of cancer in MC patients. The risk was highest during the first year of follow up.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe study sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of colorectal adenoma or cancer in patients with microscopic colitis (MC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA comprehensive literature search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the effect of MC on the risk of colorectal adenoma or cancer.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwelve studies reporting the outcomes of 50\u00a0795 patients with MC were eligible for this meta-analysis. MC was negatively associated with the risk of colorectal adenoma compared with participants without MC (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58; P < .001; I2\u00a0=\u00a087.3%). Also, the rate of colorectal cancer was lower in the patients with MC compared with the general population (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89; P = .01; I2\u00a0=\u00a091.6%). In addition, sensitivity and subgroup analyses indicated that the results were robust.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present systematic review indicated that patients with MC may be associated with a lower risk of colorectal adenoma or cancer. The clinical data support the current professional society guideline. A surveillance colonoscopy program is not recommended as standard for patients with MC.",
