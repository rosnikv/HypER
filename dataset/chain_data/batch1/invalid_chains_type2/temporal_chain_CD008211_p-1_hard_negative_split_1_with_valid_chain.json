        "title": "Technical Considerations and Patient Comfort in Total Colonoscopy with and without a Transparent Cap: Initial Experiences from a Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS\nEven though colonoscopy was introduced 30 years ago, endoscopists still leave a small percentage of the colonic mucosal surface unexamined because of the limitations of the procedure, so there is still room for technical improvements. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of attaching a transparent cap to the tip of the colonoscope, partly to gather basic data and experience for planning a larger randomized study, and partly to evaluate any technical advantages or disadvantages, and also to appraise the patients' experiences.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn 50 consecutive patients examined by a single experienced endoscopist, a prospective pilot study was carried out comparing the use of a colonoscope fitted with a transparent cap (in half of the colonoscopies) with the use of an ordinary colonoscope without a cap (in the remaining 25 patients). The following parameters were recorded: indication for colonoscopy, time to reach the cecum, total time for the colonoscopy, findings, diagnosis, type of colonoscopy (diagnostic or therapeutic, partial or total, ileal intubation), the amount of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy, and complications. At the end of the examination and also before leaving the hospital, the patients were asked by a nurse to estimate pain experienced during the colonoscopy, using a visual analogue scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time for the procedure, the ability to perform a complete colonoscopy (including ileal intubation when it was medically relevant), and the complication rate turned out to be similar in both groups. There were no differences between the amounts of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy or between the patients' estimations of the pain experienced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe time to reach the cecum and the total time for the colonoscopy is the same with or without the cap, which is well tolerated by patients. Using the cap greatly facilitates the possibility of finding small polyps behind folds in the colon, because the folds can be straightened, thereby improving the view, although in this small pilot study it could not be proven that the number of polyps found was greater using a cap-fitted colonoscope.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Colonoscopy is an established method of colorectal cancer screening, but has an adenoma miss rate of 10\u201320%. Detection rates are expected to improve with optimised visualisation methods. This prospective randomised study evaluated narrow-band imaging (NBI), a new technique that may enhance image contrast in colon adenoma detection. Methods: Eligible patients presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to undergo wide-angle colonoscopy using either conventional high-resolution imaging or NBI during instrument withdrawal. The primary outcome parameter was the difference in the adenoma detection rate between the two techniques. Results: A total of 401 patients were included (mean age 59.4 years, 52.6% men). Adenomas were detected more frequently in the NBI group (23%) than in the control group (17%) with a number of 17 colonoscopies needed to find one additional adenoma patient; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.129). When the two techniques were compared in consecutive subgroups of 100 study patients, adenoma rates in the NBI group remained fairly stable, whereas these rates steadily increased in the control group (8%, 15%, 17%, and 26.5%, respectively). Significant differences in the first 100 cases (26.5% versus 8%; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) could not be maintained in the last 100 cases (25.5% versus 26.5%, p\u200a=\u200a0.91). Conclusions: The increased adenoma detection rate means of NBI colonoscopy were statistically not significant. It remains speculative as to whether the increasing adenoma rate in the conventional group may have been caused by a training effect of better polyp recognition on NBI.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Colonoscopy, the \u201cgold standard\u201d screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC), has known diagnostic limitations. Advances in endoscope technology have focused on improving mucosal visualisation. In addition to increased angle of view and resolution features, recent colonoscopes have non-white-light optics, such as narrow band imaging (NBI), to enhance image contrast. We aimed to study the neoplasia diagnostic characteristics of NBI, by comparing the neoplasm miss rate when the colonoscopy was performed under NBI versus white light (WL). Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: US Veterans hospital. Patients: Elective colonoscopy adults. Intervention: We randomly assigned patients to undergo a colonoscopic examination using NBI or WL. All patients underwent a second examination using WL, as the reference standard. Main outcome measures: The primary end point was the difference in the neoplasm miss rate, and secondary outcome was the neoplasm detection rate. Results: In 276 tandem colonoscopy patients, there was no significant difference of miss or detection rates between NBI or WL colonoscopy techniques. Of the 135 patients in the NBI group, 17 patients (12.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5 to 19.4%) had a missed neoplasm, as compared with 17 of the 141 patients (12.1%; 95% CI 7.2 to 18.6%) in the WL group, with a miss rate risk difference of 0.5% (95% CI \u22127.2 to 8.3). 130 patients (47%) had at least one neoplasm. Missed lesions with NBI showed similar characteristics to those missed with WL. All missed neoplasms were tubular adenomas, the majority (78%) was \u2a7d5 mm and none were larger than 1 cm (one-sided 95% CI up to 1%). Nonpolypoid lesions represented 35% (13/37) of missed neoplasms. Interpretation: NBI did not improve the colorectal neoplasm miss rate compared to WL; the miss rate for advanced adenomas was less than 1% and for all adenomas was 12%. The neoplasm detection rates were similar high using NBI or WL; almost a half the study patients had at least one adenoma. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00628147",

        "abstract": "Objective. Because of the high recurrence rates of colorectal adenomas, regular surveillance by colonoscopy has been recommended, but there is still a dearth of information on the long-term results of follow-up colonoscopy after polypectomy. The aims of this study were to determine the differences between initial adenomas and metachronous lesions, to evaluate the effect of long-term surveillance and to describe the hypothetical origin of the colorectal adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence. Material and methods. Between 1978 and 2003 a total of 1091 patients undergoing periodic surveillance examinations were prospectively documented at the Erlangen Registry of Colorectal Polyps. Differences between initial and metachronous lesions found during long-term follow-up were studied. Statistical analysis using \u03c72 testing of adenoma characteristics found in four subsequent recurrence periods was carried out, and the relative risk (RR) for the development of metachronous adenomas of advanced pathology was calculated. Results. In comparison with the initial findings, metachronous adenomas are generally significantly smaller lesions (p<0.00001), usually tubular in shape (p<0.00001) and bearing high-grade dysplasia less often (p<0.00001) and are usually located in the right colon (p<0.00001). These differences are found between the initial and four subsequent generations of metachronous adenomas. The number of synchronous adenomas is reduced only in the first recurrence (p<0.001); in the further generations equal proportions of multiplicity are found, as in the baseline examination. Patients with adenomas of advanced pathology, i.e. large, tubulovillous or villous adenomas at baseline, have a significantly higher risk for large (RR 2.73; 95% CI 1.77\u20134.20), tubulovillous or villous (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06\u20132.25) or multiple (RR 2.45; 95% CI 1.83\u20133.29) metachronous adenomas at the first recurrence. Conclusions. Metachronous adenomas show the uniform characteristics of being small tubular lesions rarely bearing high-grade dysplasia, usually located in the right colon. Thus regular follow-up colonoscopy can provide sufficient colorectal carcinoma prevention.",

        "abstract": "Advanced colorectal polyps are identified based on size \u226510 mm, high-grade dysplasia, and/or villous histology. A diagnosis of tubular adenoma (TA) is recommended if villous change occupies <20% of the lesion, or tubulovillous adenoma (TVA) is recommended if there is 20% to 80% villosity. We hypothesized that even subtle villous changes (1% to 20%) would correlate with advanced molecular features. Two hundred sixty-nine colorectal adenomas were examined for KRAS and BRAF mutation and immunohistochemical staining of &bgr;-catenin, O6-Methyl Guanine DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT), and p53. Adenomas were classified as TA1 (0% villosity, n=70), TA2 (1% to 20% villosity, n=81), or TVA (21% to 80% villosity, n=118). Clinical and molecular features were analyzed by univariate &khgr;2 and multivariate logistic regression. There was an incremental increase in KRAS mutation frequency with increasing villous compartment (17.9% TA1, 59.0% TA2, 78.4% TVA; P<0.001). MGMT was more frequently lost in TA2 (37.0%) than in TA1 (8.6%) (P<0.001) but did not differ from TVA (39.8%). p53 overexpression was more common in TA2 (38.3%) than in TA1 (10.0%) (P<0.001) but did not differ from TVA (32.2%). On multivariate analysis, TA2 adenomas were more likely to have a KRAS mutation [odds ratio (OR) 6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.0-14.2], MGMT loss (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 2.4-16.0), or p53 overexpression (OR 5.6, 95% CI, 2.3-13.7) than TA1. We have identified a subgroup of TAs based on subtle villous changes. These adenomas are more likely to show molecular features that are characteristic of TVAs than TAs. These data support the concept that any villous change may indicate increased malignant potential and may be useful to consider when assigning surveillance guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aim: To evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) in colorectal adenomas, and to correlate this expression with different clinicopathological parameters. Patients and Methods: The study was retrospectively designed. Thirty three paraffin blocks from patients with colorectal adenoma and 20 samples of non-tumerous colonic tissue taken as control group were included in the study. MMP-7 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry method. The scoring of immunohistochemical staining was conducted utilizing a specified automated cellular image analysis system (Digimizer). Results: The frequency of positive immunohistochemical expression of MMP-7 was significantly higher in adenoma than control group (45.45% versus 10%) (P value < 0.001). Strong MMP-7 staining was mainly seen in adenoma cases (30.30%) in comparison with control (0%) the difference is significant (P < 0.001). The three digital parameters of MMP-7 immunohistochemical expression (Area (A), Number of objects (N), and intensity (I)) were significantly higher in adenoma than control. Mean (A and I) of MMP-7 showed a significant correlation with large sized adenoma (\u2265 1cm) (P < 0.05), also a significant positive correlation of the three digital parameters (A, N, and I) of MMP-7 expression with villous configuration and severe dysplasia in colorectal adenoma had been identified (P < 0.05). Conclusion: MMP-7 plays an important role in the growth and malignant conversion of colorectal adenomas as it is more likely to be expressed in advanced colorectal adenomatous polyps with large size, severe dysplasia and villous histology. The use of automated cellular image analysis system (Digmizer) to quantify immunohistochemical staining yields more consistent assay results, converts semi-quantitative assay to a truly quantitative assay, and improves assay objectivity and reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "In \u201cClinicopathological correlations of VEGFA and MMP-7 genes expression in different types of colorectal adenoma polyps\u201d, Pezeshkian et al1 observed that VEGF-A and MMP-7 genes expression can indicate possible progression from colon adenoma to carcinoma. The role of angiogenic factors in cancer development and in favoring lymphovascular invasion is now widely known as well as the Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are able to degrade extracellular matrix, representing tissue-remodeling enzymes and key elements in tumor invasion and metastasis2. However, in this work the evaluation of expression of VEGF-A and MMP-7 in adenomacarcinoma sequence is of considerable interest, suggesting new prognostic and risk assessment markers in the view of colorectal cancer prevention based on screening colonoscopy. The results of the authors were in agreement with other similar series in the literature, highlighting that higher expression of VEGF-A and MMP-7 genes is observed in adenoma polyps respect to control group and increased levels of these genes could be associated to malignancy. Indeed, Ruffolo et al3 evaluated the expression of VEGF-A messenger RNA through Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and VEGF-A immunohistochemical staining in a series of 92 patients with colonic adenoma or cancer patients, submitted to screening colonoscopy or surgery. The results demonstrated that the VEGF-A expression changes along the colorectal carcinogenesis pathway showing a neat step up at the passage from high-grade dysplasia to invasive cancer. In addition, Kaklamanis et al4 have evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and p53 in a series of 16 hyperplastic polyps, 35 solitary tubular and tubulovillous adenomas, and 47 cases sporadic colorectal carcinomas arising on the basis of preexisting adenomas. It was observed that VEGF associates with angiogenesis in colorectal cancer, and its pattern of expression in adenomas is maintained in the arising carcinomas, since VEGF positive cancer arose in VEGF positive adenoma, whilst VEGF negative cancer arose in VEGF not expressing adenomas Qasim et al5 have evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of MMP-7 of 33 paraffin blocks from patients with colorectal adenoma, comparing with a control group of non-tumorous colonic tissue. They showed that MMP-7 plays an important role in the growth and malignant conversion of colorectal adenomas since it is more likely expressed in advanced colorectal adenomatous polyps with large size, severe dysplasia and villous histology. The use of such biomarkers joined to other solid markers involved in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, such as mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), STAT3, long form leptin receptor, could provide a panel of risk to develop cancer in adenoma. Moreover, the translation of the data to an immunohistochemical approach could provide a manageable test to apply in a screening setting.",

The identification of the expression pattern of cancer related genes such as Hypoxia-inducible factor \u2013 1 (HIF-1\u03b1), can be useful in detection of the malignancy in polyps. The aim of this study is the evaluation of HIF-1alpha mRNA expression and risk of malignancy transitions in colorectal polyps. Patients and Methods: In this study, 54 samples of fresh polyps and 20 samples of normal mucosa were collected as the control group from patients. The demographic and clinical data of the patients were collected. The RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed. HIF-1alpha gene expression was investigated by Real-time PCR method and relative quantification. Fold change of gene expression was evaluated by (2-\u2206\u2206ct) method. The statistical analysis was performed by the Prism software (version 5). Results: There was no significant difference in the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA between adenoma and hyperplastic polyps compared to the control group (p>0.05), and also we did not found significant difference in the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA between polyps group (p>0.05). No significant correlation between clinicopathological features and HIF-1 alpha expression was observed in colorectal polyps (p>0.05). Conclusions: While HIF-1alpha gene has a critical role in angiogenesis and tumor malignancy, but in this study we did not found significant expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA in colorectal polyps. Finally, we conclude that, HIF-1alpha gene is not a suitable prognostic biomarker for indicating malignancy progression to CRC.",

Fifty-four biopsy samples from colorectal polyp patients and from 20 healthy subjects were collected. The mucosal mRNA expression level of TLR9 gene was identified by real time PCR. Fold change of gene expression was evaluated by 2-\u0394\u0394ct method. There was a significant relationship between the lower expression of TLR9 gene in the polyp cases compared to normal individuals (P value = 0.0005), Also, decreased TLR9 mRNA expression was obtained in adenomas in contrast to hyperplastic and normal groups (P value = 0.0008).

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of important TLRs in different histological types of colorectal polyps and evaluate their relationship with intestinal microbiota. The expression levels of TLR2, 3, 4, and 5 were analyzed in intestinal biopsy specimens of 21 hyperplastic polyp (HP), 16 sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), 29 tubular adenoma (TA), 21 villous/tubulovillous (VP/TVP) cases, and 31 normal controls. In addition, selected gut bacteria including Streptococcus bovis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Roseburia spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. were quantified in fecal samples using absolute qRT PCR, and, finally, the association between TLRs and these gut microbiota- was evaluated by Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient. Higher expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in VP/TVP and TA, and lower expression levels of TLR3 and TLR5 in all type of polyps were observed. The differences in TLR expression patterns was not only dependent on the histology, location, size, and dysplasia grade of polyps but also related to the intestinal microbiota patterns. TLR2 and TLR4 expression was directly associated with the F. nucleatum, E. faecalis, S. bovis, Porphyromonas, and inversely to Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia quantity. Furthermore, TLR3 and TLR5 expression was directly associated with Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, and Lactobacillus quantity.

Therefore, understanding of this transformation process would help in both preventive therapies and evaluation of malignancy risks. This study uncovers alterations in gene expressions as potential biomarkers that are revealed by integration of several network-based approaches. In silico analysis performed on a unified microarray cohort, which is covering 150 normal colon and adenomatous polyp samples. Significant gene modules were obtained by a weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Gene modules with similar profiles were mapped to a colon tissue specific functional interaction network. Several clustering algorithms run on the colon-specific network and the most significant sub-modules between the clusters were identified. The biomarkers were selected by filtering differentially expressed genes which also involve in significant biological processes and pathways. Biomarkers were also validated on two independent datasets based on their differential gene expressions. To the best of our knowledge, such a cascaded network analysis pipeline was implemented for the first time on a large collection of normal colon and polyp samples. We identified significant increases in TLR4 and MSX1 expressions as well as decrease in chemokine profiles with mostly pro-tumoral activities. These biomarkers might appear as both preventive targets and biomarkers for risk evaluation. As a result, this research proposes novel molecular markers that might be alternative to endoscopic approaches for diagnosis of adenomatous polyps.",
