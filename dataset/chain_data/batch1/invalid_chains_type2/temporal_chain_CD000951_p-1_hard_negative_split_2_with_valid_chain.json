        "title": "Supplementation with Folic Acid during Methotrexate Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "The folic acid antagonist methotrexate (n-10-methyl-aminopterin) is useful in low doses (2.5 to 20 mg/wk) for treating chronic inflammatory diseases [1-7]. Many trials have established the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis [7-13]. Compared with other disease-modifying drugs, methotrexate has the highest probability of drug continuation at 10 years. Dose response-related toxic effects have been reported in 30% to 90% of patients given methotrexate [13]. Toxic effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic abnormalities, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity [14-22]. Some side effects of methotrexate administration, such as gastrointestinal intolerance, mimic complicated folate deficiency [23]. Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; further, folate stores are decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate, suggesting that impaired folate status is related to toxicity [24-26]. Folic acid supplementation has been reported anecdotally to lessen toxicity in patients receiving methotrexate treatment [27, 28]. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7 mg of folic acid weekly (1 mg/d or 2265 nmol/d) decreased methotrexate toxicity without affecting efficacy [29]. This was confirmed by Stewart and colleagues [30] in a retrospective chart review. Folinic acid (leucovorin, citrovorum factor) is a one-carbon-substituted, fully reduced folate that has also been administered during methotrexate therapy [31-36]. Low doses of the vitamin (1 to 7 mg/wk) have decreased methotrexate toxicity [35, 36]. Higher doses negate efficacy and lessen toxicity [31, 32]. Thus, the folinic acid dose may critically affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The influence of the folic acid dose on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy remains controversial, and the effects of different doses of folic acid are not known [37, 38]. Some investigators argue that if toxic effects occur, the most rational approach is to reduce the dose of methotrexate rather than to provide folic acid supplements [37]. We designed a larger and longer study to evaluate different doses of folic acid, assuming that toxicity could be reduced without changing the efficacy of methotrexate. Methods Participants Patients aged 19 to 78 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology's revised criteria for rheumatoid arthritis consented to participate in the trial [39]. Enrollment criteria included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed more than 6 months previously, onset after the age of 16 years, and at least three of the following signs or symptoms: 3 or more swollen joints, 6 or more tender joints, at least 45 minutes of morning stiffness, and a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h. Referring rheumatologists and the principal investigator did the screening. Exclusion criteria included serious concomitant medical illnesses, liver enzyme levels twice the upper limit of normal, leukocyte counts less than 3.5 109/L or platelet counts less than 150 109/L, and use of methotrexate within the past 6 months. Gold salts were stopped for at least 10 days before the trial. This short washout period mirrors actual rheumatology practice. Patients remained under the care of their rheumatologists, abstained from alcohol use, did not become pregnant, and received stable doses of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If prednisone was taken at entry, the dose could not exceed 10 mg/d. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was allowed during the study. Study Design Figure 1 shows the trial design. To maintain the double-blind status of the trial, the statistician carried out the randomization using a computer program in which the algorithm was transparent and a coded vial number represented the treatment assignment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups by a sequential treatment assignment process designed to balance the sample with respect to baseline features, including age, sex, folate-containing vitamin use, rheumatoid factor status, and prednisone use [40]. Patients agreed to discontinue therapy with folate-containing vitamins during the trial. Rheumatoid factor was considered positive if the level was more than 30 IU/mL or if the titer was more than 1:160. Patients received either visually identical placebo or 5 mg (low-dose folic acid group) or 27.5 mg folic acid (high-dose folic acid group) each week, prepared by the Hospital Investigational Drug Service. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the mean SD folic acid content was 1 0.15 mg (2.3 0.3 mol) and 5.5 0.3 mg (12.5 0.7 mol) per capsule in the low-dose and high-dose folic acid groups, respectively. Lederle Laboratories provided the methotrexate (Rheumatrex; Pearl River, New York), which was started in a median oral dose of 16.5 mol (7.5 mg) per week and increased in 5.5-mol (2.5 mg) increments at the rheumatologist's discretion. Methotrexate was taken either in an undivided or a divided dose (that is, every 12 hours for three doses). The methotrexate dosing regimens were identical among the study groups. Folic acid supplements were given 5 days per week when methotrexate was not ingested. Compliance with the regimen was reinforced using a digital reminder cap (Counter Cap; Senetics, Boulder, Colorado). All participants and investigators were blinded to vitamin capsule content until the study was complete. Figure 1. Study design for the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical Assessment Patients were evaluated immediately before methotrexate initiation at a mean of 13, 26, 39, and 53 weeks (Figure 1). Each patient was assessed by the same physician-nutritionist (SLM). Two research assistants (JSA or WHV) did the joint evaluations. In most cases, patients were examined by the same observer throughout the study. The joint counts for tenderness and swelling were not significantly different between the two observers (P = 0.6 for tenderness; P = 0.9 for swelling). The following variables were evaluated at each visit: 1) number of the 58 diarthrodial joints with swelling; 2) number of the 60 joints with tenderness on pressure or with pain on passive motion (or both); 3) joint swelling and tenderness indices, expressed as a sum, with each joint graded for swelling as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 [severe]; 4) mean grip strength (three measurements) for both hands expressed in mm Hg; 5) duration of morning stiffness expressed in hours; 6) patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity graded as 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (very severe); 7) current medications and doses; 8) a 1-day dietary recall using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software, Food Database version 6A, Nutrient Database version F21 [41]; 9) eight activities of daily living assessed and averaged at baseline and at 12 months using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and scored on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) [42]; and 10) presence, duration, intensity, and severity of toxic effects at every follow-up visit and every 3 weeks by telephone interview (done by SLM). Laboratory Assessments At the initial visit, complete blood cell count, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzyme (aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase), rheumatoid factor by nephelometry, and serum creatinine values were obtained. The complete blood cell count, creatinine, and liver function tests were repeated at all visits. If laboratory values were obtained more frequently than stipulated in the protocol, they were recorded and became part of the toxicity score. Blood for plasma and erythrocyte folate levels, using a methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay, was drawn at all visits [43]. At baseline, blood was drawn for a vitamin panel (plasma and erythrocyte folate, vitamins B12, A, C, and E, carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, pyridoxine) [44-51]. If patients had abnormal values for any of the vitamins, other than folate, the abnormality was treated with single vitamin supplements. Radiographic Assessment Hand and wrist radiographs taken within 6 months of entering the trial were assessed by one of the rheumatologists (GSA) without knowledge of study status. Joint erosions and space narrowing were determined by the modified method of Sharp [52]. Results were expressed as the mean raw scores for joint erosion and joint space narrowing. Toxicity: Frequency and Severity Toxic effects and discontinuation of therapy with study medications due to toxicity were considered primary outcomes. We determined a toxicity score, modified from the one previously used, for each patient at each visit or until methotrexate therapy was discontinued [29] (Appendix). Efficacy We determined patient response to treatment using a modification of the criteria used in our previous folic acid supplementation trial and by others [8, 29, 53]. We defined marked improvement in the joint swelling index and the joint tenderness and pain index as a net decrease of 50% or more in value at any follow-up visit compared with visit 1. We defined moderate improvement as a 30% to 49% net decrease in the index, and no change as the index value remaining within 30% of the original value. We defined worsening as an increase in the index value of 30% or more. We examined the effects of folic acid supplementation on changes in physician and patient global assessments, grip strength, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, findings of the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, complete blood cell counts, blood folate levels, and dietary folate and vitamin B12 intake.

Long-term low-dose methotrexate therapy (25 mg or less once a week) inhibits production of thymidylate, purines, and methionine and leads to accumulation of adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory substance. These actions inhibit cellular proliferation, decrease formation of antibodies, and decrease production of mediators of inflammation such as interleukins and eicosanoids. Three uncontrolled trials and two controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy of low-dose methotrexate therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease and have also suggested possible benefit for ulcerative colitis and for remission maintenance indications in both diseases. Although methotrexate is generally well tolerated for long-term use at a low dose, several serious toxicities potentially limit its use.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethotrexate is a promising new agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Methotrexate is currently used as a treatment for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. This study sought to evaluate the hepatic effects of long-term methotrexate therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to determine whether the established guidelines for monitoring methotrexate-related hepatotoxicity with surveillance liver biopsy in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis are applicable to these patients.METHODS:Thirty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving cumulative methotrexate doses of \u22651500 mg were studied. Liver chemistry tests were obtained before and during therapy. Twenty patients underwent liver biopsies as recommended for methotrexate-treated patients with psoriasis; the biopsies were reviewed and graded according to Roenigk's criteria for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity (a grading system for methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis patients) by a liver pathologist blinded to the methotrexate dose.RESULTS:In patients who had liver biopsies, the mean cumulative methotrexate dose was 2633 mg (range, 1500\u20135410 mg), given for a mean of 131.7 wk (range, 66\u2013281 wk). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had mild histological abnormalities (Roenigk's grade I and II), and one patient had hepatic fibrosis (Roenigk's grade IIIB). Abnormal liver chemistry tests, present in 6 of 20 (30%) patients, did not identify the patient with Roenigk's grade IIIB hepatotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS:Cumulative methotrexate doses up to 5410 mg given up to 281 wk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are associated with little hepatotoxicity. Surveillance liver biopsies based on cumulative methotrexate doses are not warranted in these patients.",

        "abstract": "We investigated whether polymorphisms in reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1 G80A) and gamma-glutamyl-hydrolase (GGH-401C/T) are predictive of methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG) levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with weekly low-dose methotrexate (MTX). Adult patients treated with MTX were enrolled in a multicentred study. Blood was drawn at the time of the visit, DNA was extracted and red blood cell (RBC) MTXPG levels (up to the penta-order of glutamation) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorometry. A G80A polymorphism in SLC19A1 and a -401C/T promoter polymorphism in GGH were measured by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were used to predict long-chain RBC MTXPG3-5. In 226 adult patients receiving MTX (median 15 mg range: 5-25 mg) median RBC long-chain MTXPG3-5 was 56 nmol/l (range < 5-224 nmol/l). A total of 35 patients carried the SLC19A1 80AA genotype whereas 36 patients carried the GGH-401TT genotype. Weekly MTX dose, age, presence of the SLC19A1 80AA and GGH-401TT genotypes predicted independently and significantly MTXPG3-5 levels (global r = 0.38; P < 0.0001). Patients with the GGH-401TT genotype were 4.8-fold [odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-13.0; P = 0.002] more likely to have MTXPG3-5 below the group median compared to patient carriers of the GGH-401CC or CT genotype. Conversely, those with the SLC19A1 80AA genotype were 3.4-fold more likely to have MTXPG3-5 levels above the group median compared to those with the SLC19A1 80GG or 80GA genotype (OR CI 95% 1.4-8.4; P = 0.007).

If the Disease Activity Score in 44 joints (DAS44) was >2.4 at 3 months, MTX was increased to 25 mg/week. MTX efficacy was evaluated at 3 and 6 months and compared for genotypes in 3 analyses: patients with and without good response (DAS44<or=2.4), patients with and without good improvement (DeltaDAS44>1.2), and patients with and without moderate improvement (DeltaDAS44>0.6). The association between MTX-related adverse drug events (ADEs) and genotype was evaluated by comparing genotypes between patients with and without ADEs, specifically pneumonitis, gastrointestinal ADEs, skin and mucosal ADEs, and elevated liver enzyme levels. The following SNPs were analyzed: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) -473G>A, DHFR 35289G>A, and reduced folate carrier 80G>A.

Twenty-four baseline variables possibly influencing disease state and drug response were selected. In addition, 17 polymorphisms in 13 genes related to the MTX mechanism of action, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, were determined. Factors were compared between responders (defined as patients with a DAS < or = 2.4 at 6 months) and nonresponders. In case of differences, a stepwise selection procedure identified the predictors for response. A clinical score was designed by simplifying regression coefficients of the independent variables.

        "abstract": "Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are uptake transporters for a broad range of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. To investigate the physiologic and pharmacologic roles of OATPs of the 1A and 1B subfamilies, we generated mice lacking all established and predicted mouse Oatp1a/1b transporters (referred to as Slco1a/1b-/- mice, as SLCO genes encode OATPs). Slco1a/1b-/- mice were viable and fertile but exhibited markedly increased plasma levels of bilirubin conjugated to glucuronide and increased plasma levels of unconjugated bile acids. The unexpected conjugated hyperbilirubinemia indicates that Oatp1a/1b transporters normally mediate extensive hepatic reuptake of glucuronidated bilirubin. We therefore hypothesized that substantial sinusoidal secretion and subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated reuptake of glucuronidated compounds can occur in hepatocytes under physiologic conditions. This alters our perspective on normal liver functioning. Slco1a/1b-/- mice also showed drastically decreased hepatic uptake and consequently increased systemic exposure following i.v. or oral administration of the OATP substrate drugs methotrexate and fexofenadine. Importantly, intestinal absorption of oral methotrexate or fexofenadine was not affected in Slco1a/1b-/- mice. Further analysis showed that rifampicin was an effective and specific Oatp1a/1b inhibitor in controlling methotrexate pharmacokinetics. These data indicate that Oatp1a/1b transporters play an essential role in hepatic reuptake of conjugated bilirubin and uptake of unconjugated bile acids and drugs. Slco1a/1b-/- mice will provide excellent tools to study further the role of Oatp1a/1b transporters in physiology and drug disposition.",

Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a genetically polymorphic influx transporter expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes, and it mediates the hepatic uptake of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Recent studies have demonstrated that OATP1B1 plays a major, clinically important role in the hepatic uptake of many drugs. A common single-nucleotide variation (coding DNA c.521T>C, protein p.V174A, rs4149056) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 decreases the transporting activity of OATP1B1, resulting in markedly increased plasma concentrations of, for example, many statins, particularly of active simvastatin acid. The variant thereby enhances the risk of statin-induced myopathy and decreases the therapeutic indexes of statins. However, the effect of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C variant is different on different statins. The same variant also markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of several other drugs. Furthermore, certain SLCO1B1 variants associated with an enhanced clearance of methotrexate increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity by methotrexate in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) potently inhibit OATP1B1, causing clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, OATP1B1 plays a major role in the hepatic uptake of drugs, and genetic variants and drug interactions affecting OATP1B1 activity are important determinants of individual drug responses. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the expression, function, substrate characteristics, and pharmacogenetics of OATP1B1 as well as its role in drug interactions, in parts comparing with those of other hepatocyte-expressed organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1.",

        "abstract": "The hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) influence the pharmacokinetics of several drug classes and are involved in many clinical drug\u2013drug interactions. Predicting potential interactions with OATPs is, therefore, of value. Here, we developed in vitro and in silico models for identification and prediction of specific and general inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1. The maximal transport activity (MTA) of each OATP in human liver was predicted from transport kinetics and protein quantification. We then used MTA to predict the effects of a subset of inhibitors on atorvastatin uptake in vivo. Using a data set of 225 drug-like compounds, 91 OATP inhibitors were identified. In silico models indicated that lipophilicity and polar surface area are key molecular features of OATP inhibition. MTA predictions identified OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 as major determinants of atorvastatin uptake in vivo. The relative contributions to overall hepatic uptake varied with isoform specificities of the inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Interindividual variability in protein expression of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and multidrug resistance-linked P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or ABCB1 was quantified in frozen human livers (n = 64) and cryopreserved human hepatocytes (n = 12) by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method. Membrane isolation, sample workup, and LC-MS/MS analyses were as described before by our laboratory. Briefly, total native membrane proteins, isolated from the liver tissue and cryopreserved hepatocytes, were trypsin digested and quantified by LC-MS/MS using signature peptide(s) unique to each transporter. The mean \u00b1 S.D. (maximum/minimum range in parentheses) protein expression (fmol/\u00b5g of membrane protein) in human liver tissue was OATP1B1- 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 (7), OATP1B3- 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 (8), OATP2B1- 1 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 (5), and P-gp- 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 (8). Transporter expression in the liver tissue was comparable to that in the cryopreserved hepatocytes. Most important is that livers with SLCO1B1 (encoding OATP1B1) haplotypes *14/*14 and *14/*1a [i.e., representing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), c.388A > G, and c.463C > A] had significantly higher (P < 0.0001) protein expression than the reference haplotype (*1a/*1a). Based on these genotype-dependent protein expression data, we predicted (using Simcyp) an up to \u223c40% decrease in the mean area under the curve of rosuvastatin or repaglinide in subjects harboring these variant alleles compared with those harboring the reference alleles. SLCO1B3 (encoding OATP1B3) SNPs did not significantly affect protein expression. Age and sex were not associated with transporter protein expression. These data will facilitate the prediction of population-based human transporter-mediated drug disposition, drug-drug interactions, and interindividual variability through physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.",

        "abstract": "We quantified, by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, transporter protein expression of BSEP, MATE1, MRP3, MRP4, NTCP, and OCT1 in our human liver bank (n = 55) and determined the relationship between protein expression and sex, age and genotype. These data complement our previous work in the same liver bank where we quantified the protein expression of OATPs, BCRP, MDR1, and MRP2. In addition, we quantified and compared the interspecies differences in expression of the hepatobiliary transporters, corresponding to the above human transporters, in liver tissue and hepatocytes of male beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, Sprague-Dawley rats, and Wistar rats. In all the species, the sinusoidal OATPs/Oatps were the most abundant hepatic transporters. However, there were notable interspecies differences in the relative abundance of the remaining transporters. For example, the next most abundant transporter in humans and monkeys was OCT1/Oct1, whereas it was Mrp2 and Ntcp in dogs/Wistar rats and Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. In contrast, the protein expression of the efflux transporters BCRP/Bcrp, MDR1/Mdr1, MRP3/Mrp3, MRP4/Mrp4, and MATE1/Mate1 was much lower across all the species. For most transporters, the expression in the liver tissues was comparable to that in the unplated cryopreserved hepatocytes. These data on human liver transporter protein expression complete the picture of the expression of major human hepatobiliary transporters important in drug disposition and toxicity. In addition, the data on expression of the corresponding hepatobiliary transporters in preclinical species will be helpful in interpreting and extrapolating pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and toxicological results from preclinical studies to humans.",

        "abstract": "Although data are available on the change of expression/activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes in liver cirrhosis patients, corresponding data on transporter protein expression are not available. Therefore, using quantitative targeted proteomics, we compared our previous data on noncirrhotic control livers (n = 36) with the protein expression of major hepatobiliary transporters, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), multidrug resistance\u2013associated protein (MRP)2, MRP3, MRP4, sodium taurocholate\u2013cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), organic anion\u2013transporting polypeptides (OATP)1B1, 1B3, 2B1, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in alcoholic (n = 27) and hepatitis C cirrhosis (n = 30) livers. Compared with control livers, the yield of membrane protein from alcoholic and hepatitis C cirrhosis livers was significantly reduced by 56 and 67%, respectively. The impact of liver cirrhosis on transporter protein expression was transporter-dependent. Generally, reduced protein expression (per gram of liver) was found in alcoholic cirrhosis livers versus control livers, with the exception that the expression of MRP3 was increased, whereas no change was observed for MATE1, MRP2, OATP2B1, and P-gp. In contrast, the impact of hepatitis C cirrhosis on protein expression of transporters (per gram of liver) was diverse, showing an increase (MATE1), decrease (BSEP, MRP2, NTCP, OATP1B3, OCT1, and P-gp), or no change (BCRP, MRP3, OATP1B1, and 2B1). The expression of hepatobiliary transporter protein differed in different diseases (alcoholic versus hepatitis C cirrhosis). Finally, incorporation of protein expression of OATP1B1 in alcoholic cirrhosis into the Simcyp physiologically based pharmacokinetics cirrhosis module improved prediction of the disposition of repaglinide in liver cirrhosis patients. These transporter expression data will be useful in the future to predict transporter-mediated drug disposition in liver cirrhosis patients.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to develop and perform initial validation of dynamic MRI enhanced with gadoxetic acid as hepatobiliary contrast agent to quantify hepatic perfusion and hepatocyte function in patients with chronic liver disease. Free-breathing, dynamic gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was performed at 3.0 T using a 3D time-resolved angiography sequence with stochastic trajectories during 38 min. A dual-input three-compartment model was developed to derive hepatic perfusion and hepatocyte function parameters. Method feasibility was assessed in 23 patients with biopsy-proven chronic liver disease. Parameter analysis could be performed in 21 patients (91%). The hepatocyte function parameters were more discriminant than the perfusion parameters to differentiate between patients with minimal fibrosis (METAVIR F0-F1), intermediate fibrosis (F2-F3) and cirrhosis (F4). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) to diagnose significant fibrosis (METAVIR F \u2265 2) were: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87-1; P<0.001) for biliary efflux, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.73-1; P<0.01) for sinusoidal backflux, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.61-1; P<0.05) for hepatocyte uptake fraction and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.54-1; P<0.05) for hepatic perfusion index (HPI), respectively. These initial results in patients with chronic liver diseases show that simultaneous quantification of hepatic perfusion and hepatocyte function is feasible with free breathing dynamic gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Hepatocyte function parameters may be relevant to assess liver fibrosis severity.",

        "abstract": "Estimation of liver function is important to monitor progression of chronic liver disease (CLD). A promising method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with gadoxetate, a liver-specific contrast agent. For this method, we have previously developed a model for an average healthy human. Herein, we extended this model, by combining it with a patient-specific non-linear mixed-effects modeling framework. We validated the model by recruiting 100 patients with CLD of varying severity and etiologies. The model explained all MRI data and adequately predicted both timepoints saved for validation and gadoxetate concentrations in both plasma and biopsies. The validated model provides a new and deeper look into how the mechanisms of liver function vary across a wide variety of liver diseases. The basic mechanisms remain the same, but increasing fibrosis reduces uptake and increases excretion of gadoxetate. These mechanisms are shared across many liver functions and can now be estimated from standard clinical images.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Accurate biomarkers for quantifying liver fibrosis are important for clinical practice and trial end-points. We compared the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and 31P-MR spectroscopy, with fibrosis stage and serum fibrosis algorithms in a clinical setting. Also, in a subset of patients, MR- and transient elastography (MRE and TE) was evaluated when available. Methods Patients were recruited prospectively if they were scheduled to undergo liver biopsy on a clinical indication due to elevated liver enzyme levels without decompensated cirrhosis. Within a month of the clinical work-up, an MR-examination and liver needle biopsy were performed on the same day. Based on late-phase gadoxetate-enhanced MRI, a mathematical model calculated hepatobiliary function (relating to OATP1 and MRP2). The hepatocyte gadoxetate uptake rate (KHep) and the normalised liver-to-spleen contrast ratio (LSC_N10) were also calculated. Nine serum fibrosis algorithms were investigated (GUCI, King\u2019s Score, APRI, FIB-4, Lok-Index, NIKEI, NASH-CRN regression score, Forns' score, and NAFLD-fibrosis score). Results The diagnostic performance (AUROC) for identification of significant fibrosis (F2\u20134) was 0.78, 0.80, 0.69, and 0.78 for MRE, TE, LSC_N10, and GUCI, respectively. For the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3\u20134), the AUROCs were 0.93, 0.84, 0.81, and 0.82 respectively. Conclusion MRE and TE were superior for non-invasive identification of significant fibrosis. Serum fibrosis algorithms developed for specific liver diseases are applicable in this cohort of diverse liver diseases aetiologies. Gadoxetate-MRI was sufficiently sensitive to detect the low function losses associated with fibrosis. None was able to efficiently distinguish between stages within the low fibrosis stages. Lay summary Excessive accumulation of scar tissue, fibrosis, in the liver is an important aspect in chronic liver disease. To replace the invasive needle biopsy, we have explored non-invasive methods to assess liver fibrosis. In our study we found that elastographic methods, which assess the mechanical properties of the liver, are superior in assessing fibrosis in a clinical setting. Of interest from a clinical trial point-of-view, none of the tested methods was sufficiently accurate to distinguish between adjacent moderate fibrosis stages.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Heart failure is associated with high morbidity and mortality and linked with several pre-existing health conditions and risk factors. Early detection and prompt management in heart failure improves patient outcomes. Liver involvement is associated with heart failure disease progression, and hence liver biomarkers and liver fibrosis may have a prognostic impact. Several blood test based markers and scoring systems estimate liver fibrosis and hence can be useful prognostic tools. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a series of 303 patients with decompensated heart failure in a city in western Romania over a period of 6 months. Several biochemical parameters were measured, the FIB-4 score was estimated and echocardiography was performed. Results for targeted variables are presented using descriptive statistics. Patients were analyzed based on their LVEF categories. Statistical analysis was based on ANOVA one-way tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Pairwise comparisons were performed based on Bonferroni adjusted significance tests. The correlations between FIB-4 score, LVEF and NT-pro BNP in patients with and without diabetes and hypertension were explored using Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient. Result: Age, gender, NYHA class, death, history of (h/o) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), h/o coronary artery disease (CAD), h/o arrhythmias, sodium, potassium, creatinine, eGFR, uric acid, NT-pro BNP, left atrial volume, LDL, HDL, and TG were analyzed by LVEF categories using ANOVA one-way tests, Chi-square tests, and Bonferroni correction comparisons. We found a strong statistically significant correlation between each of NT-pro BNP, left atrial volume, LDL, and HDL with the LVEF categories. Discussion: Early detection of cardiac dysfunction leads to better management in patients with cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes and hypertension. High LDL and low HDL levels contribute to a reduction in left ventricular (LV) function. Available literature suggests the FIB-4 score as superior to other non-invasive markers of fibrosis. It utilizes the patient\u2019s age, platelet count, AST, and ALT, which can be available retrospectively, making it an easy and inexpensive tool. FIB-4 score has a few limitations. Conclusions: Our study has shown a statistically significant positive correlation between severity categories of LVEF and FIB-4 score for heart failure patients with and without diabetes, and for heart failure patients with or without hypertension. We propose the implementation of FIB-4 score as a prognostic tool for heart failure.",
