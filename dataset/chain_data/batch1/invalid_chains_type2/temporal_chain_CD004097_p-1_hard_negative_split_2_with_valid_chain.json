        "title": "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Weight Reduction and Exercise for Diabetes Management in Older African-American Subjects",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate a weight loss and exercise program designed to improve diabetes management in older African-Americans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Overweight African-Americans (n = 64) ages 55\u201379 years with NIDDM were randomized to either an intervention (12 weekly group sessions, 1 individual session, and 6 biweekly group sessions) or usual care (1 class and 2 informational mailings). Clinical and behavioral variables were assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS Significant net differences in the intervention versus usual care were observed for weight (\u22122.0 kg, P = 0.006), physical activity, and dietary intake of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and nutrition knowledge at 3 months (all P < 0.05) and for weight at 6 months (\u22122.4 kg; P = 0.006) and mean HbA1c values at 3 and 6 months (respectively, \u22121.6 and \u22122.4%, both P < 0.01). After the adjustment for changes in weight and activity, the intervention participants were \u223c twice as likely to have a one unit decrease in HbA1c value as those in usual care. Blood pressure increase sin usual care participants resulted in net differences (intervention minus control) at 3 and 6 months of \u22123.3 (P = 0.09) and \u22124.0 (P = 0.05) mmHg diastolic, respectively, and \u22128.4 (P = 0.06) and \u22125.9 (P > 0.10) mmHg systolic, respectively. Blood lipid profiles improved more in intervention than usual care participants, but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS The intervention program was effective in improving glycemic and blood pressure control. The decrease in HbA1c values was generally independent of the relatively modest changes in dietary intake, weight, and activity and may reflect indirect program effects on other aspects of self-care.",

        "abstract": "Coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and cognitive disorders become more prevalent as people age. Besides delaying the onset of many of these conditions, regular exercise may improve function and delay disability and morbidity in those who have them. Further, exercise may work synergistically with medication to combat the effects of some chronic diseases. Special adaptations for older patients include lower-intensity exercise (eg, fewer repetitions), low-impact exercise (cycling, exercise while sitting), and modified equipment (smaller weights, special shoes, loose clothing). Unresolved issues include development of optimal strategies for motivating older patients to begin and maintain exercise programs.",

        "abstract": "This article describes the development and implementation of an Interprofessional Falls Prevention Program (IFPP) designed for community\u2010dwelling seniors. The program was a collaborative pilot research study conducted in a retirement home and an outpatient hospital setting. The pilot was successful and was positioned into a permanent falls prevention program. The IFPP aimed at improving physical function and balance and reducing the fear of falling in seniors with a history of falls. The pilot study included an interprofessional falls assessment followed by a 12\u2010week program of once\u2010weekly group education and exercise sessions, 3\u2010 and 6\u2010month follow\u2010up visits, and individual counseling. To measure program effectiveness, the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up and Go Test, the Falls Efficacy Scale, and the Morse Fall Risk Scale were used at baseline, upon program completion, and at 3\u2010 and 6\u2010month follow\u2010up. Process measures were also collected, including patient satisfaction. Persistent improvements were found in participants' balance, strength, functional mobility, and fear of falling. Patient satisfaction with the program was high. Challenges faced in program implementation are also highlighted.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAssess characteristics of trauma patients who sustained falls from their own height, more specifically focusing on presence of severe injuries, diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRetrospective study including all adult blunt trauma patients admitted in the emergency room in a period of 9 months. Lesions with AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale)>3 were considered \"severe\". Variables were compared between victims of fall from their own height (group I) and other blunt trauma mechanisms (group II). Student's t, chi square and Fisher exact tests were used for statistical analysis, considering p<0.05 as significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 1993 trauma patients included, 305 (15%) were victims of falls from their own height. In group I, mean age was 52.2 \u00b1 20.8 years and 64.8% were male. Injuries in the head segment were the most frequently observed (62.2%), followed by injuries in the extremities (22.3%), thorax (1.3%) and abdomen (0.7%). Severe injuries (AIS>3) were more frequent in the head (8.9%), followed by extremities (4.9%). In group I, craniotomies were needed in 2.3%. By comparing groups, we observed that victims of falls from their own height had significantly higher mean age, higher mean systolic blood pressure, and higher head AIS mean, as well as lower ISS mean, thorax AIS mean, abdomen AIS mean and extremities AIS mean.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nImportance of the trauma mechanism in victims of falls from own height should be emphasized due to a considerable possibility of occult severe injuries, mainly in the cephalic segment.",

Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t, chi-square and Fisher tests, considering p <0.05 as significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study included 281 patients (group I-149, group II-132). The age ranged between 70 and 99 years (79.1 + 6.7 years), with 52.3% male.

Methods: A total of 362 geriatric patients (aged 60 years and above) with major trauma following road traffic accidents in Malaysia extracted from the National Trauma Database (NTrD) from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. Results: Median age of the geriatric patients was found to be 67 years, with majority male patients (85%), of Malay ethnicity (48%) and sustained blunt injury (99.7%). Most of them had low injury severity, hemodynamically stable and more than half sustained injuries to head and neck region (54.7%). Very elderly group had significantly higher mortality rate than elderly group (P <0.001) with the increase in odds of mortality persisted even after adjustment for physiological status and injury severity (Odds Ratio, OR: 2.75, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.51-5.05, P=0.001). Conclusions: Injury patterns from road traffic accidents and its associated fatalities involving older people had emerged to be public safety concerns in Malaysia.

This study aims to assess the outcome in mortality and functional outcome, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and factors associated with poor outcomes in patients with TBI more than 60 years old.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis single centre retrospective cohort study was carried out involving patients age 60 years old and above with TBI between June 2018 to May 2021. The mortality and GOS at hospital discharge, 30th day, and 90th day of trauma were analysed. The simple logistic regression (SLR) and multiple logistic regression (MLR) were performed to determine factors associated with poor outcomes and mortality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 248 patients were analysed. The mean age was 67.5 \u00b1 6.31 years. 156 (62.9%), 26 (10.5%), and 66 (26.6%) had mild, moderate, and severe TBI, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 9.7% and the median(IQR) GOS score were 4(2); p<0.001 at hospital discharge, 30th day and 90th day.
