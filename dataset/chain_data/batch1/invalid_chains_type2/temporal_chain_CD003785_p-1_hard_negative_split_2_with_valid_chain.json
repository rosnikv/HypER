        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and consensus statements (CS) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antagonists.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for CPGs and CS on the use of infliximab, etanercept, and/or adalimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, published through October 10, 2006. Sources included electronic databases (Medline, EMBase, BIOSIS, etc.), guideline registries, and pertinent Web sites. Review of 4,915 citations revealed 16 CPGs and 20 CS. Two independent reviewers evaluated development methods of selected studies using the 23-item Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument and compared recommendations between guidelines.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 16 guidelines, only 5 (31%) were based on a systematic review of relevant research evidence. Only 4 (25%) of the guidelines fulfilled > or = 60% of the AGREE criteria. AGREE scores were lower for guidelines from rheumatology societies than government agencies when reporting scope and purposes (P = 0.03), stakeholder involvement (P = 0.03), and clarity and presentation (P = 0.01). Guidelines scored higher than CS in most domains. Overall, guideline recommendations were consistent with respect to the use of biologic agents after failure of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, but differed or did not provide specific guidance on tests for screening.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGuidelines for introducing TNFalpha antagonists in rheumatoid arthritis often fail to meet expected methodologic criteria and therefore vary significantly in quality and with respect to some recommendations for patient assessment and management.",

        "title": "Phase 1 trial of adalimumab in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): II. Report of the FONT (Novel Therapies for Resistant FSGS) study group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) resistant to current treatment regimens are at high risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Antifibrotic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists, are a promising strategy to slow or halt the decline in renal function, based on preclinical and clinical data.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nPhase 1 clinical trial to assess the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of adalimumab, a human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor alpha.\n\n\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS\n10 patients (4 male and 6 female) aged 16.8 +/- 9.0 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 105 +/- 50 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were studied.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAdalimumab, 24 mg/m(2), every 14 days for 16 weeks (total, 9 doses).\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nPharmacokinetic assessment, tolerability, and safety.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and pharmacokinetic assessment after initial dosing and steady state.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPharmacokinetic evaluation indicated that the area under the curve was decreased by 54% (P < 0.001) and clearance was increased by 160% (P < 0.01) in patients with resistant FSGS compared with healthy controls and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Adalimumab was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or infectious complications attributable to the drug. Proteinuria decreased by > or = 50% in 4 of 10 treated patients.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nInsufficient power to assess the safety or efficacy of adalimumab therapy for patients with resistant FSGS.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPharmacokinetic assessment showed increased clearance of adalimumab in patients with resistant primary FSGS and validated the need to evaluate the disposition of novel therapies for this disease to define appropriate dosing regimens. The study provides a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of adalimumab as an antifibrotic agent for resistant FSGS in phase 2/3 clinical trials.",

        "title": "Impact of Glomerular Kidney Diseases on the Clearance of Drugs",
        "abstract": "Numerous physiologic variations, including urinary protein excretion, low serum albumin concentrations, and reductions in kidney function (clearance), exist in patients with glomerulonephritis. These factors could alter the disposition of numerous drugs. The purpose of the current article was to review the influence of glomerulonephritis on the pharmacokinetics of drugs used clinically or experimentally in the treatment of these conditions. Several articles or presentations were located that reported on the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressant, cytotoxic, and therapeutic antibody drugs in populations with glomerulonephritis. Most publications reported an increase in systemic clearance in glomerulonephritis as compared with populations in whom the drugs were typically used and in patients with nonglomerular forms of chronic kidney disease. It appears that the increase in systemic clearance is predominantly through nonrenal clearance pathways, although enhancement of renal clearance has also been appreciated for some drugs. Available preliminary data suggest specific alterations in the activity of individual pathways of drug metabolism and transport. Recommendations are provided for the design of future studies of drugs in the glomerulonephritis population and for inclusion of patients with urinary protein excretion in studies that assess drug pharmacokinetics.",

        "title": "A survey of renal impairment pharmacokinetic studies for new oncology drug approvals in the USA from 2010 to early 2015: a focus on development strategies and future directions",
        "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guidance document in 2010 on pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in renal impairment (RI) on the basis of observations that substances such as uremic toxins might result in altered drug metabolism and excretion. No specific recommendations for oncology drugs were included. We surveyed the publicly available FDA review documents of 29 small molecule oncology drugs approved between 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. The objectives were as follows: (i) summarize the impact of RI on PK at the time of the initial new drug application; (ii) identify limitations of the guidance; and (iii) outline an integrated approach to study the impact of RI on these drugs. Our survey indicates that the current FDA guidance does not appear to provide clear strategic or decision pathways for RI studies in terms of small molecule oncology drugs. The FDA review documents indicate an individualized approach to the review because of the complex pharmacologic nature of these drugs and patient populations. Overall, the strategy for carrying out a RI study during clinical development or as a postmarketing study requires integration with the totality of data, including mass balance, absolute bioavailability, drug\u2013drug interaction, hepatic dysfunction, population PK, exposure\u2013response analysis, the therapeutic window for best guidance, and determination of the optimal doses for special oncology populations.",

        "title": "Food Effect Study Design With Oral Drugs: Lessons Learned From Recently Approved Drugs in Oncology",
        "abstract": "Evaluation of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of oral oncology drugs is critical to drug development, as food can mitigate or exacerbate toxicities and alter systemic exposure. Our aim is to expand on current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance and provide data\u2010driven food\u2010effect study design recommendations specific to the oncology therapeutic area. Data for recently approved small\u2010molecule oncology drugs was extracted from the clinical pharmacology review in the sponsor's FDA submission package. Information on subject selection, meal types, timing of the study relative to the pivotal trial, and study outcomes was analyzed. The number of subjects enrolled ranged from 12 to 60, and the majority of studies (19 of 29) were conducted in healthy volunteers. Using AstraZeneca cost data, healthy volunteer studies were estimated to cost 10\u2010fold less than cancer patient studies. Nine of 29 (31%) studies included meals with multiple levels of fat content. Analysis of a subset of 16 drugs revealed that final results for the food\u2010effect study were available before the start of the pivotal trial for only 2 drugs. Conducting small food\u2010effect studies powered to estimate effect, rather than confirm no effect, with only a standardized high\u2010fat meal according to FDA guidance may eliminate unnecessary studies, reduce cost, and improve efficiency in oncology drug development. Starting food\u2010effect studies as early as possible is key to inform dosing in pivotal trials.",

        "title": "Exploratory Food Effect Assessment in Patients in Early Clinical Development of Oncology Drugs",
        "abstract": "Instructions for administration with regard to food are a key aspect of how patients experience oral drugs. Through potential effects on pharmacokinetics, the food condition can influence safety and efficacy, and thereby is one of many dimensions of dose optimization. Regulatory guidance from major health authorities advocates for the early investigation of food effect (FE) in clinical development. In oncology, exploratory FE (eFE) evaluation is often incorporated into the first\u2010in\u2010human (FIH) studies in patients to inform food condition of later clinical studies. However, the design aspects of such exploratory assessments are generally under\u2010reported and barely described, and yet complex, due to uniqueness of FIH study design and drug development process in oncology. Herein, we review literature of eFE assessment study design in oncology in patients, and present the Novartis experience in the design, execution, and impact of eFE in FIH oncology studies from 2014 to 2021. Based on this, we propose a roadmap for eFE assessment in early clinical drug development for oncology drugs in patients, including a framework for common study design options with a focus on study\u2010 and patient\u2010level timing for typical scenarios. We also provide a broad spectrum of decision\u2010making factors which should be evaluated to drive the design and implementation of eFE assessment, spanning from clinical development strategy, FIH study design, to compound\u2010specific features.",
