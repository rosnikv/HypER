        "abstract": "In this study, we hypothesized that bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) protect ischemic myocardium through paracrine effects that can be further augmented with preconditioning. In in vitro experiments, cell survival factors such as Akt and eNOS were significantly increased in BMSCs following anoxia. In the second series of experiments following coronary ligation in mice, left ventricles were randomly injected with the following: DMEM (G-1), BMSCs (G-2), and preconditioned BMSCs (G-3). Four days after myocardial infarction, BMSCs were observed within injured myocardium in G-2 and G-3. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes within periinfarct area were significantly reduced in G-3. Four weeks after myocardial infarction, smaller left ventricular (LV) dimension and increased LV ejection fraction were observed in G-3. Infarct area was significantly reduced in G-3. However, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were observed in low numbers within periinfarct area in G-2 and G-3. In conclusion, BMSCs secreted cell survival factors under ischemia, and they prevented apoptosis in cardiomyocytes adjacent to the infarcted area. Preconditioning of BMSCs enhanced their survival and ability to attenuate LV remodeling, which was attributable, in part, to paracrine effects.",

        "abstract": "Human dental pulp contains precursor cells termed dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) that show self\u2010renewal and multilineage differentiation and also secrete multiple proangiogenic and antiapoptotic factors. To examine whether these cells could have therapeutic potential in the repair of myocardial infarction (MI), DPSC were infected with a retrovirus encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expanded ex vivo. Seven days after induction of myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation, 1.5 \u00d7 106 GFP\u2010DPSC were injected intramyocardially in nude rats. At 4 weeks, cell\u2010treated animals showed an improvement in cardiac function, observed by percentage changes in anterior wall thickening left ventricular fractional area change, in parallel with a reduction in infarct size. No histologic evidence was seen of GFP+ endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or cardiac muscle cells within the infarct. However, angiogenesis was increased relative to control\u2010treated animals. Taken together, these data suggest that DPSC could provide a novel alternative cell population for cardiac repair, at least in the setting of acute MI.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a major public health problem that causes significant mortality despite recent advances in its prevention and treatment. Therefore, approaches based on adult stem cells represent a promising alternative to conventional therapies for this life-threatening condition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that have been isolated from multiple tissues and differentiate to various cell types. Here we have analyzed the capacity of MSCs from human bone marrow (BMSC), adipose tissue (ATSC), and dental pulp (DPSC) to differentiate to cells with a cardiac phenotype. Differentiation of MSCs was induced by long-term co-culture with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs). Shortly after the establishment of MSC-CM co-cultures, expression of connexin 43 and the cardiac-specific markers troponin I, beta-myosin heavy chain, atrial natriuretic peptide, and alpha-sarcomeric actinin was detected in BMSCs, ATSCs, and DPSCs. Expression of differentiation markers increased over time in the co-cultures, reaching the highest levels at 4 weeks. Translocation of the transcription factors NKX2.5 and GATA4 to the nucleus was observed in all three cultures of MSCs during the differentiation process; moreover, nuclear localization of NKX2.5 and GATA4 correlated with expression of alpha-sarcomeric actinin. These changes were accompanied by an increase in myofibril organization in the resulting CM-like cells as analyzed by electron microscopy. Thus, our results provide novel information regarding the differentiation of tissue-specific MSCs to cardiomyocytes and support the potential use of MSCs in cell-based cardiac therapies.",

        "abstract": "Despite refinements of medical and surgical therapies, heart failure remains a fatal disease. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure, and only palliative measures are available to relieve symptoms and prolong the patient's life span. Because mammalian cardiomyocytes irreversibly exit the cell cycle at about the time of birth, the heart has traditionally been considered to lack any regenerative capacity. This paradigm, however, is currently shifting, and the cellular composition of the myocardium is being targeted by various regeneration strategies. Adult progenitor and stem cell treatment of diseased human myocardium has been carried out for more than 10 years (Menasche et al., 2001; Stamm et al., 2003), and it has become clear that, in humans, the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, despite potent proangiogenic effects, is limited (Stamm et al., 2009). More recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and related cell types are being evaluated in preclinical models of heart disease as well as in clinical trials (see Published Clinical Trials, below). MSCs have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into lineages that normally originate from the embryonic mesenchyme (connective tissues, blood vessels, blood-related organs) (Caplan, 1991; Prockop, 1997; Pittenger et al., 1999). The current definition of MSCs includes plastic adherence in cell culture, specific surface antigen expression (CD105(+)/CD90(+)/CD73(+), CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD11b(-) or CD14(-)/CD19(-) or CD79\u03b1(-)/HLA-DR1(-)), and multilineage in vitro differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic) (Dominici et al., 2006 ). If those criteria are not met completely, the term \"mesenchymal stromal cells\" should be used for marrow-derived adherent cells, or other terms for MSC-like cells of different origin. For the purpose of this review, MSCs and related cells are discussed in general, and cell type-specific properties are indicated when appropriate. We first summarize the preclinical data on MSCs in models of heart disease, and then appraise the clinical experience with MSCs for cardiac cell therapy.",

        "title": "Intracoronary Infusion of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Precursor Cells Directly After Experimental Acute Myocardial Infarction Reduces Infarct Size, Abrogates Adverse Remodeling, and Improves Cardiac Function",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) are a specific Stro-3+ subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow. MPCs exert extensive cardioprotective effects, and are considered to be immune privileged. Objective: This study assessed the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of intracoronary delivery of allogeneic MPCs directly after acute myocardial infarction in sheep. Methods and Results: Initially, intracoronary delivery conditions were optimized in 20 sheep. These conditions were applied in a randomized study of 68 sheep with an anterior acute myocardial infarction. Coronary flow was monitored during MPC infusion, and cardiac function was assessed using invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography at baseline and during 8 weeks follow-up. Coronary flow remained within thrombolysis in myocardial infarction III definitions in all sheep during MPC infusion. Global left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by pressure\u2013volume loop analysis deteriorated in controls to 40.7\u00b12.6% after 8 weeks. In contrast, MPC treatment improved cardiac function to 52.8\u00b10.7%. Echocardiography revealed significant improvement of both global and regional cardiac functions. Infarct size decreased by 40% in treated sheep, whereas infarct and border zone thickness were enhanced. Left ventricular adverse remodeling was abrogated by MPC therapy, resulting in a marked reduction of left ventricular volumes. Blood vessel density increased by >50% in the infarct and border areas. Compensatory cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was reduced in border and remote segments, accompanied by reduced collagen deposition and apoptosis. No microinfarctions in remote myocardial segments or histological abnormalities in unrelated organs were found. Conclusions: Intracoronary infusion of allogeneic MPCs is safe, feasible, and markedly effective in a large animal model of acute myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Several cell-based therapies for adjunctive treatment of acute myocardial infarction have been investigated in multiple clinical trials, but the benefits still remain controversial. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow\u2013derived mononuclear cell (BMMNC) therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but also explores the effect of newer generations of stem cells. Methods and Results\u2014A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of stem cell therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction that were published between January 2002 and September 2013. The defined end points were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, infarct size, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates. Also, several subgroup analyses were performed on BMMNC trials. Overall, combining the results of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), LV ejection fraction increased by +2.10% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68\u20133.52; P=0.004) in the BMMNC group as compared with controls, evoked by a preservation of LV end-systolic volume (\u22124.05 mL; 95% CI, \u22126.91 to \u22121.18; P=0.006) and a reduction in infarct size (\u22122.69%; 95% CI, \u22124.83 to \u22120.56; P=0.01). However, there is no effect on cardiac function, volumes, or infarct size, when only RCTs (n=9) that used MRI-derived end points were analyzed. Moreover, no beneficial effect could be detected on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates after BMMNC infusion after a median follow-up duration of 6 months. Conclusions\u2014Intracoronary infusion of BMMNC is safe, but does not enhance cardiac function on MRI-derived parameters, nor does it improve clinical outcome. New and possibly more potent stem cells are emerging in the field, but their clinical efficacy still needs to be defined in future trials.",

Similar effects were noted when data were analyzed after excluding studies with discrepancies in reporting of outcomes. The benefits also persisted when cardiac catheterization was performed in control patients as well. Although imaging modalities partly influenced the outcomes, LV ejection fraction improved in BMC-treated patients when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Early (<48 hours) BMC injection after myocardial Infarction was more effective in reducing infarct size, whereas BMC injection between 3 and 10 days proved superior toward improving systolic function. A minimum of 50 million BMCs seemed to be necessary, with limited additional benefits seen with increasing cell numbers. BMC therapy was safe and improved clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial Infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and cerebrovascular accident during follow-up, albeit with differences between acute myocardial Infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease subgroups. Conclusions: Transplantation of adult BMCs improves LV ejection fraction, reduces infarct size, and ameliorates remodeling in patients with ischemic heart disease. These effects are upheld in the analyses of studies using magnetic resonance imaging and also after excluding studies with discrepant reporting of outcomes. BMC transplantation may also reduce the incidence of death, recurrent myocardial Infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and cerebrovascular accident during follow-up. ( Circ Res . 2015;117:558-575. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.304792.) and results. 8 However, discrepancies in reporting of design and methods 8 may only have limited potential to influence the overall conclusions of these studies. Therefore, to delineate the effect of discrepancies on collective outcomes of cell therapy trials, we performed separate me-ta-analysis after excluding studies with discrepancies in reporting of primary outcomes, such as LVEF. Discrepancies in reporting results included incorrect calculation of effects (LVEF, infarct size, LVESV, and LVEDV) or discrepant reporting of results in different published reports in clinical trials. The results from early studies of BMC therapy as well as meta-analyses of diverse subsets of clinical trials have been discordant. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled data from 48 randomized controlled trials of BMC therapy that enrolled 2602 patients with ischemic heart disease. Our results show that BMC injection in patients with ischemic heart disease is associated with modest yet significant improvements in left ventricular structure and function. This analysis also suggests significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction when magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cardiac function. Importantly, the benefits of BMC therapy were also noted in meta-analysis performed after exclusion of studies with discrepancies in reporting of outcomes and when cardiac catheterization was performed in control patients. BMC-treated patients experienced substantive reduction in all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and cerebrovascular accident, in-dicating significantly favorable clinical outcomes despite numerically small improvements in cardiac parameters. These results provide a robust basis for the conduct of large randomized controlled trials using patient-important clinical outcomes as primary end points.",

In the BM-MNC groups, cells were either administered 5 to 7 days (early) or 3 to 4 weeks (late) after AMI. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline and after 12 months. The current analysis investigates the change from baseline to 12 months in global LV ejection fraction, LV volumes, scar size, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values comparing the 2 treatment groups with control in a linear regression model. Besides the complete case analysis, multiple imputation analysis was performed to address for missing data. Furthermore, the long-term clinical event rate was computed. The absolute change in LV ejection fraction from baseline to 12 months was -1.9\u00b19.8% for control (mean\u00b1SD), -0.9\u00b110.5% for the early treatment group, and -0.7\u00b110.1% for the late treatment group.

No information is available in humans about the relative efficacy of MSCs and CPCs and whether their combination is more efficacious than either cell type alone. Objective: CONCERT-HF (Combination of Mesenchymal and c-kit+ Cardiac Stem Cells As Regenerative Therapy for Heart Failure) is a phase II trial aimed at elucidating these issues by assessing the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of transendocardial administration of autologous MSCs and CPCs, alone and in combination, in patients with HF caused by chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy (coronary artery disease and old myocardial infarction). Methods and Results: Using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multitreatment, and adaptive design, CONCERT-HF examines whether administration of MSCs alone, CPCs alone, or MSCs+CPCs in this population alleviates left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, reduces scar size, improves quality of life, or augments functional capacity. The 4-arm design enables comparisons of MSCs alone with CPCs alone and with their combination. CONCERT-HF consists of 162 patients, 18 in a safety lead-in phase (stage 1) and 144 in the main trial (stage 2). Stage 1 is complete, and stage 2 is currently randomizing patients from 7 centers across the United States.

Hybrid cells were sorted into 96\u2010well microplates for clonal expansion to derive unique cloned hCCs, which were then characterized for various cellular and molecular properties. hCCs exhibited enhanced survival relative to the parent cells and promoted cardiomyocyte survival in response to serum deprivation in vitro. Conclusions The generation of hCC is demonstrated and validated in this study, representing the next step toward implementation of a novel cell product for therapeutic development.

        "abstract": "Myocardial delivery of human c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells (hCICs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), an emerging approach for treating the failing heart, has been limited by an incomplete understanding of the effects on host myocardium. This computational study aims to model hCIC and hMSC effects on electrophysiology and calcium cycling of healthy and diseased human cardiomyocytes (hCM), and reveals a possible cardiotherapeutic benefit independent of putative regeneration processes. First, we developed an original hCIC mathematical model with an electrical profile comprised of distinct experimentally identified ion currents. Next, we verified the model by confirming it is representative of published experiments on hCIC whole-cell electrophysiology and on hCIC co-cultures with rodent cardiomyocytes. We then used our model to compare electrophysiological effects of hCICs to other non-excitable cells, as well as clinically relevant hCIC-hMSC combination therapies and fused hCIC-hMSC CardioChimeras. Simulation of direct coupling of hCICs to healthy or failing hCMs through gap junctions led to greater increases in calcium cycling with lesser reductions in action potential duration (APD) compared with hMSCs. Combined coupling of hCICs and hMSCs to healthy or diseased hCMs led to intermediate effects on electrophysiology and calcium cycling compared to individually coupled hCICs or hMSCs. Fused hCIC-hMSC CardioChimeras decreased healthy and diseased hCM APD and calcium transient amplitude compared to individual or combined cell treatments. Finally, to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing cell-based therapies, we randomized populations of 2,500 models incorporating variable hMSC and hCIC interventions and simulated their effects on restoring diseased cardiomyocyte electrophysiology and calcium handling. The permutation simulation predicted the ability to correct abnormal properties of heart failure hCMs in fibrotic, but not non-fibrotic, myocardium. This permutation experiment also predicted paracrine signaling to be a necessary and sufficient mechanism for this correction, counteracting the fibrotic effects while also restoring arrhythmia-related metrics such as upstroke velocity and resting membrane potential. Altogether, our in silico findings suggest anti-fibrotic effects of paracrine signaling are critical to abrogating pathological cardiomyocyte electrophysiology and calcium cycling in fibrotic heart failure, and support further investigation of delivering an optimized cellular secretome as a potential strategy for improving heart failure therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Myocardial delivery of non-excitable cells\u2014namely human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells (hCICs)\u2014remains a promising approach for treating the failing heart. Recent empirical studies attempt to improve such therapies by genetically engineering cells to express specific ion channels, or by creating hybrid cells with combined channel expression. This study uses a computational modeling approach to test the hypothesis that custom hypothetical cells can be rationally designed to restore a healthy phenotype when coupled to human heart failure (HF) cardiomyocytes. Methods: Candidate custom cells were simulated with a combination of ion channels from non-excitable cells and healthy human cardiomyocytes (hCMs). Using a genetic algorithm-based optimization approach, candidate cells were accepted if a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 50% relative to healthy hCM was achieved for both action potential and calcium transient waveforms for the cell-treated HF cardiomyocyte, normalized to the untreated HF cardiomyocyte. Results: Custom cells expressing only non-excitable ion channels were inadequate to restore a healthy cardiac phenotype when coupled to either fibrotic or non-fibrotic HF cardiomyocytes. In contrast, custom cells also expressing cardiac ion channels led to acceptable restoration of a healthy cardiomyocyte phenotype when coupled to fibrotic, but not non-fibrotic, HF cardiomyocytes. Incorporating the cardiomyocyte inward rectifier K+ channel was critical to accomplishing this phenotypic rescue while also improving single-cell action potential metrics associated with arrhythmias, namely resting membrane potential and action potential duration. The computational approach also provided insight into the rescue mechanisms, whereby heterocellular coupling enhanced cardiomyocyte L-type calcium current and promoted calcium-induced calcium release. Finally, as a therapeutically translatable strategy, we simulated delivery of hMSCs and hCICs genetically engineered to express the cardiomyocyte inward rectifier K+ channel, which decreased action potential and calcium transient RMSEs by at least 24% relative to control hMSCs and hCICs, with more favorable single-cell arrhythmia metrics. Conclusion: Computational modeling facilitates exploration of customizable engineered cell therapies. Optimized cells expressing cardiac ion channels restored healthy action potential and calcium handling phenotypes in fibrotic HF cardiomyocytes and improved single-cell arrhythmia metrics, warranting further experimental validation studies of the proposed custom therapeutic cells.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper. The source paper's computational model and findings on the effects of hCICs and hMSCs on electrophysiology and calcium cycling of human cardiomyocytes are used as a basis for this paper's investigation into the design of custom therapeutic cells. This paper builds upon the source paper's results and explores a new angle of optimizing cell-based therapies."
