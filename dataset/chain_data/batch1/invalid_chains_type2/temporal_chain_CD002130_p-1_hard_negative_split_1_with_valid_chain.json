        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPlatelets are believed to play a part in the ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty, such as abrupt closure of the coronary vessel during or soon after the procedure. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhen administered in conjunction with primary coronary stenting for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may provide additional clinical benefit, but data on this combination therapy are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 300 patients with acute myocardial infarction in a double-blind fashion either to abciximab plus stenting (149 patients) or placebo plus stenting (151 patients) before they underwent coronary angiography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 30 days and 6 months after the procedure. The angiographic patency of the infarct-related vessel and the left ventricular ejection fraction were evaluated at 24 hours and 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 30 days, the primary end point--a composite of death, reinfarction, or urgent revascularization of the target vessel--had occurred in 6.0 percent of the patients in the abciximab group, as compared with 14.6 percent of those in the placebo group (P=0.01); at 6 months, the corresponding figures were 7.4 percent and 15.9 percent (P=0.02). The better clinical outcomes in the abciximab group were related to the greater frequency of grade 3 coronary flow (according to the classification of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) in this group than in the placebo group before the procedure (16.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent, P=0.01), immediately afterward (95.1 percent vs. 86.7 percent, P=0.04), and six months afterward (94.3 percent vs. 82.8 percent, P=0.04). One major bleeding event occurred in the abciximab group (0.7 percent); none occurred in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with placebo, early administration of abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction improves coronary patency before stenting, the success rate of the stenting procedure, the rate of coronary patency at six months, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes.",

        "title": "Comparison of angioplasty with stenting, with or without abciximab, in acute myocardial infarction.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAs compared with thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in acute myocardial infarction reduces the rates of death, reinfarction, and stroke, but recurrent ischemia, restenosis, and reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. When used in combination with PTCA, coronary stenting and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may further improve outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 2082 patients with acute myocardial infarction to undergo PTCA alone (518 patients), PTCA plus abciximab therapy (528), stenting alone with the MultiLink stent (512), or stenting plus abciximab therapy (524).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNormal flow was restored in the target vessel in 94.5 to 96.9 percent of patients and did not vary according to the reperfusion strategy. At six months, the primary end point - a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel - had occurred in 20.0 percent of patients after PTCA, 16.5 percent after PTCA plus abciximab, 11.5 percent after stenting, and 10.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab (P<0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups in the rates of death, stroke, or reinfarction; the difference in the incidence of the primary end point was due entirely to differences in the rates of target-vessel revascularization (ranging from 15.7 percent after PTCA to 5.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab, P<0.001). The rate of angiographically established restenosis was 40.8 percent after PTCA and 22.2 percent after stenting (P<0.001), and the respective rates of reocclusion of the infarcted-related artery were 11.3 percent and 5.7 percent (P=0.01), both independent of abciximab use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt experienced centers, stent implantation (with or without abciximab therapy) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA substantial proportion of patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy for myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation have inadequate reperfusion or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery, leading to an increased risk of complications and death.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 3491 patients, 18 to 75 years of age, who presented within 12 hours after the onset of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and randomly assigned them to receive clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo. Patients received a fibrinolytic agent, aspirin, and when appropriate, heparin (dispensed according to body weight) and were scheduled to undergo angiography 48 to 192 hours after the start of study medication. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of an occluded infarct-related artery (defined by a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade of 0 or 1) on angiography or death or recurrent myocardial infarction before angiography.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rates of the primary efficacy end point were 21.7 percent in the placebo group and 15.0 percent in the clopidogrel group, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7 percentage points in the rate and a 36 percent reduction in the odds of the end point with clopidogrel therapy (95 percent confidence interval, 24 to 47 percent; P<0.001). By 30 days, clopidogrel therapy reduced the odds of the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia leading to the need for urgent revascularization by 20 percent (from 14.1 to 11.6 percent, P=0.03). The rates of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients 75 years of age or younger who have myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation and who receive aspirin and a standard fibrinolytic regimen, the addition of clopidogrel improves the patency rate of the infarct-related artery and reduces ischemic complications.",

        "title": "Impact of Pretreatment With Clopidogrel on Initial Patency and Outcome in Patients Treated With Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014 The main goal of the initial treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is prompt reperfusion of the infarct-related artery. The value of pretreatment with clopidogrel before primary percutaneous coronary intervention is currently unclear. Methods and Results\u2014 Studies were retrieved through MEDLINE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register searches over the past 20 years. Two authors independently performed the study selection and data extraction. Randomized controlled studies were included when the research subjects were unselected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Pilot trials, studies that enrolled patients undergoing rescue percutaneous coronary intervention, and studies with angiographic assessment not performed by a core laboratory or 2 blinded investigators were excluded. Thirty-eight treatment groups, including 8429 patients, were included. Initial patency was higher in treatment groups in which patients received pretreatment with clopidogrel (34.3%; 95% confidence interval, 32.9 to 35.8) compared with those in which patients did not receive clopidogrel before initial coronary angiography (25.8%; 95% confidence interval, 24.5 to 27.1). In multivariate-weighted logistic regression analysis, pretreatment with clopidogrel was an independent predictor of early reperfusion (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 1.74; P<0.0001) and improved clinical outcome. Conclusions\u2014 Initial patency and clinical outcome were improved in treatment groups that received pretreatment with clopidogrel. These results in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention are in line with the experience of pretreatment with clopidogrel in elective patients, non\u2013ST-elevation coronary syndromes, and thrombolytic studies.",

        "abstract": "The impact of thienopyridine administration prior to primary stenting in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been well studied. We therefore examined the database from the prospective, multicenter, controlled CADILLAC trial in which 1,036 patients were randomized to bare metal stenting with or without abciximab to determine whether patients who received a thienopyridine prior to bare metal stenting in AMI had superior clinical outcomes. Per operator discretion, 659 patients (63.6%; Th+) received either a 500 mg ticlopidine loading dose (n = 623) or a 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose (n = 40), while 377 patients (36.4%; Th-) received no thienopyridine prior to stent implantation. Baseline and procedural characteristics of the two groups, including abciximab use (52.5% vs 52.8%, P = 0.93) were well matched. Th+ compared to Th- patients had lower rates of core lab assessed TIMI 0/1 flow postprocedure (0.8% vs 2.7%, P = 0.01). Th+ compared to Th- patients also had significantly reduced in-hospital and 30-day rates of ischemic target vessel revascularization (TVR) (1.1% vs 3.2%, P = 0.01 and 1.5% vs 3.8%, P = 0.02, respectively) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (2.7% vs 5.8%, P = 0.01 and 4.0% vs 6.9%, P = 0.03, respectively), results that remained significant after covariate adjustment. In conclusion, in this large prospective, controlled trial, patients receiving a thienopyridine prior to primary stenting in AMI were less likely to have TIMI 0/1 flow postprocedure and experienced reduced in-hospital and 30-day rates of ischemic TVR and MACE compared to those not administered a thienopyridine prior to stent implantation.",
