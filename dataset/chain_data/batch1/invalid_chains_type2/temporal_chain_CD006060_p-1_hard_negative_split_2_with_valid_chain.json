        "abstract": "Context\nPioglitazone reduces cardiovascular risk in nondiabetic patients after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) but is associated with increased risk for bone fracture.\n\n\nObjective\nTo characterize fractures associated with pioglitazone by location, mechanism, severity, timing, and sex.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Patients\nPatients were 3876 nondiabetic participants in the Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke trial randomized to pioglitazone or placebo and followed for a median of 4.8 years. Fractures were identified through quarterly interviews.\n\n\nResults\nAt 5 years, the increment in fracture risk between pioglitazone and placebo groups was 4.9% [13.6% vs 8.8%; hazard ratio (HR), 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 1.89). In each group, \u223c80% of fractures were low energy (i.e., resulted from fall) and 45% were serious (i.e., required surgery or hospitalization). For serious fractures most likely to be related to pioglitazone (low energy, nonpathological), the risk increment was 1.6% (4.7% vs 3.1%; HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.09). Increased risk for any fracture was observed in men (9.4% vs 5.2%; HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.48) and women (14.9% vs 11.6%; HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.78; interaction P = 0.13).\n\n\nConclusions\nFractures affected 8.8% of placebo-treated patients within 5 years after an ischemic stroke or TIA. Pioglitazone increased the absolute fracture risk by 1.6% to 4.9% and the relative risk by 47% to 60%, depending on fracture classification. Our analysis suggests that treatments to improve bone health and prevent falls may help optimize the risk/benefit ratio for pioglitazone.",

        "title": "Targeting Pioglitazone Hydrochloride Therapy After Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack According to Pretreatment Risk for Stroke or Myocardial Infarction",
        "abstract": "Importance There is growing recognition that patients may respond differently to therapy and that the average treatment effect from a clinical trial may not apply equally to all candidates for a therapy. Objective To determine whether, among patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and insulin resistance, those at higher risk for future stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) derive more benefit from the insulin-sensitizing drug pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with patients at lower risk. Design, Setting, and Participants A secondary analysis was conducted of the Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone for secondary prevention. Patients were enrolled from 179 research sites in 7 countries from February 7, 2005, to January 15, 2013, and were followed up for a mean of 4.1 years through the study\u2019s end on July 28, 2015. Eligible participants had a qualifying ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 180 days of entry and insulin resistance without type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Interventions Pioglitazone or matching placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures A Cox proportional hazards regression model was created using baseline features to stratify patients above or below the median risk for stroke or MI within 5 years. Within each stratum, the efficacy of pioglitazone for preventing stroke or MI was calculated. Safety outcomes were death, heart failure, weight gain, and bone fracture. Results Among 3876 participants (1338 women and 2538 men; mean [SD] age, 63 [11] years), the 5-year risk for stroke or MI was 6.0% in the pioglitazone group among patients at lower baseline risk compared with 7.9% in the placebo group (absolute risk difference, \u20131.9% [95% CI, \u20134.4% to 0.6%]). Among patients at higher risk, the risk was 14.7% in the pioglitazone group vs 19.6% for placebo (absolute risk difference, \u20134.9% [95% CI, \u20138.6% to 1.2%]). Hazard ratios were similar for patients below or above the median risk (0.77 vs 0.75; P\u2009=\u2009.92). Pioglitazone increased weight less among patients at higher risk but increased the risk for fracture more. Conclusions and Relevance After an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients at higher risk for stroke or MI derive a greater absolute benefit from pioglitazone compared with patients at lower risk. However, the risk for fracture is also higher. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00091949",

        "title": "Personalized evidence based medicine: predictive approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects",
        "abstract": "Abstract The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of \u201creference class forecasting\u201d: implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of \u201csimilar\u201d patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to \u201cpredictive\u201d heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on \u201crisk modeling\u201d (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on \u201ceffect modeling\u201d (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "Methodological issues in psychological treatment research : applications to gambling research and therapist effects",
        "abstract": "Over the last couple of decades evidence-based psychotherapies have flourished, and there are now therapies that are well-established for a wide range of problems. At the same time the mental-health burden is still enormous, and challenges to the dissemination of treatments are substantial. Despite the considerable gains in knowledge that have been made, many issues remain unsolved, and there are many reasons to be skeptical of the current quality of the evidence. The aim of this thesis was to explore methodological challenges that impact the evaluation of psychological treatments in general but also gambling treatment trials specifically. In the first part, I present a broader overview of some of the contemporary issues that concern the scientific investigation of psychotherapies. Two issues are then explored in more detail, 1) the broader issue of therapist effects in longitudinal studies, and 2) the more specific issue of analyzing semicontinuous data as a treatment outcome. After expanding on these issues, the findings are then used in two clinical gambling studies. In Study I, we investigated the consequences of ignoring therapist effects in longitudinal data. We derived what factors impact the type I errors, and performed an extensive simulation study. The empirical simulation results validated the analytical results and showed that even when 5% of the variance in slopes is at the therapist level, the type I errors can be substantially inflated. When analyzing data from longitudinal studies, investigators should account for the possibility that therapists might have different overall slopes. In an LMM, this can be accounted for by including a random slope at the therapist level. In order to help investigators plan multilevel longitudinal studies, an R package (powerlmm) was developed. In Study II, we investigated the challenges of estimating treatment effects in gambling studies using gambling expenditure as an outcome. Gambling outcomes are typically very skewed and can include a large number of zeros. Investigators typically try to analyze such data mostly by log transforming the outcome, or continue with a standard analysis based on normally distributed residuals. In this paper, we propose that a marginalized two-part model can be a more attractive option. We compared the performance of the proposed two-part model to the typical methods used by investigators. The performance of these models were compared using real data and via different Monte Carlo simulation scenarios. The choice of an appropriate estimand for treatment effects was also discussed, and we argue that gambling researchers should primarily be concerned with the overall reduction in gambling losses. In Study III, we applied and extended the work in Study II to investigate how concordant gamblers and their concerned significant others (CSOs) were in their reports of gambling losses. The sample consisted of problem gamblers and their CSOs participating in a trial comparing individual CBT versus behavioral couples therapy. A total of 133 dyads were included, and we used their baseline reports of gambling losses using the timeline followback covering the last 30 days. Overall we found that there was a fair level of agreement, ICC = .57, 95% CI [.48, .64]. There were some evidence that partner CSOs had a higher level of agreement compared to parent CSOs, ICCdiff = .20, 95% CI [.03, .39]. In Study IV, we applied the results from Study I, II, and III to investigate the effects of an internet-delivered program aimed at the CSOs of treatment refusing problem gamblers. In total, 100 CSOs of treatment-refusing problem gamblers were randomized to either ten weeks of ICBT or a waitlist control. At posttest the intervention group reported an improvement on the CSO\u2019s emotional consequences (d = -0.90, 95% CI [-1.47, -0.33]), relationship satisfaction (d = 0.41, 95% [0.05, 0.76]), anxiety (d = -0.45, 95% [-0.81, -0.09]), depression (d = -0.49, 95% [-0.82, -0.16]). Any effects on the CSO\u2019s reports on gambling losses and on treatment-seeking were inconclusive. Problem gamblers are hard to influence via their CSO proxies; however, the intervention had a clinically meaningful effect on the CSO\u2019s coping as measured by their emotional consequences, anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction. Several methodological issues are discussed in relation to this RCT. For transparency and for better pooling of data, we also published the raw data, including all measured outcomes together with the R scripts used to analyze the trial. The data and scripts can be downloaded from https://osf.io/awtg7. Psychotherapy researchers face significant challenges, and there is a great need for high-quality psychotherapy trials, a better appreciation of the methodological issues, and more transparent reporting practices. Hopefully, improvements to psychotherapy research will follow, and that these improvements will improve clinical practice and reduce the mental health burden in general. List of Scientific Papers I.
