The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral methotrexate in chronic steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with active ulcerative colitis who have received steroids and/or immunosuppressives for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months with a current Mayo Clinic score of > or = 7 were included in the study. Methotrexate (12.5 mg) or placebo was added to their treatment once weekly for 9 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-seven patients were included (methotrexate, 30 patients, placebo, 37 patients). The proportion of patients entering first remission (methotrexate, 46.7%; placebo, 48.6%), the time to reach first remission (methotrexate, 4.1 +/- 1.9 months; placebo, 3.4 +/- 1.7 months), as well as the proportions of patients having a relapse after first remission (methotrexate, 64.3%; placebo, 44.4%) were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean Mayo Clinic score, the mean monthly steroid dose, and the proportion of abnormal laboratory results during the study were also similar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg was not found to be better than placebo in the induction or maintenance of remission in patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Background Thiopurine drugs (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) are well established in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, some patients are intolerant or resistant to thiopurine drugs and their management remains a challenge. Several studies have suggested methotrexate is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Objective This study was conducted because the overall data on clinical efficacy of methotrexate in inflammatory bowel disease remain limited and there are no data regarding fistulating Crohn's disease or concomitant use of methotrexate with thiopurine drugs in inflammatory bowel disease. Methods This study was a retrospective review of medical notes. Clinical response was defined as sustained withdrawal of oral steroids or fistula improvement. New episodes of steroid therapy, infliximab or surgery during the first 6 months were considered as failure to achieve clinical response. Results Seventy-two patients were studied (66 Crohn's disease and six ulcerative colitis). The mean dose of methotrexate used was 18.2 mg/week. Clinical response was achieved in 22 of 54 patients (40.7%) who completed 6 months of methotrexate treatment. For patients with Crohn's disease, fistula improvement was achieved in eight of 18 (44.4%) patients compared with 11 of 30 (36.7%) receiving methotrexate for steroid withdrawal. Clinical response was achieved in six of 15 patients (40%) treated with methotrexate and azathioprine at the same time compared with 16 of 39 patients (41%) treated with methotrexate alone. Conclusions Methotrexate is reasonably effective in clinical practice as a steroid sparing agent in inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy in fistulating Crohn's disease justifies its use as an immunomodulator in these patients. Combined azathioprine and methotrexate treatment appears to offer no advantage over methotrexate alone.",

        "abstract": "Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are a major family of phase II drug\u2010metabolizing enzymes. SULT\u2010catalyzed sulfonation regulates hormone activities metabolizes drugs detoxifies xenobiotic toxicants bioactivates carcinogens. Human dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (hSULT2A1 DHEA\u2010ST) plays a very important role in sulfating endogenous hydroxysteroids and exogenousxenobiotics. Our recent studies have shown that methotrexate can induce hSULT2A1 expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism involved in hSULT2A1 induction we generated the promoter sequence of hSULT2A1 by PCR and constructed a reporter gene vector. Both reporter gene assay and endogenous induction results suggested that human constitutive active receptor (hCAR) mediates the methotrexate induction of hSULT2A1 in both Caco\u20102 and Hep G2 cells. Human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) also upregulated hSULT2A1 gene expression while human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) downregulated it. Human pregnane X receptor suppressed hCAR\u2010mediated methotrexate induction of hSULT2A1 in both Caco\u20102 and Hep G2 cells. hVDR competed with hCAR for the hSULT2A1 promoter in Caco\u20102 cells. hCAR inhibited hVDR\u2010mediated vitamin D3 induction of hSULT2A1 but not methotrexate induction of hSULT2A1. These results strongly support the hypothesis that cross\u2010talk occurs among nuclear receptors in the signal transduction pathway of hSULT2A1 and that interactions among nuclear receptors also depend on ligands (inducers) in the system. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SULTs are not only important for xenobiotic detoxification but they also play important biological roles in the regulation of the activities of various biosignaling molecules and other cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of influenza A virus lung infection on the expression of SULTs in the lung, brain, and liver of female C57BL/6 mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time that SULT2B1b enzyme activity and protein expression are significantly up-regulated in the lung and brain of female mice in response to lung influenza A virus infection. Real-time quantitative PCR results are consistent with Western blot and enzymatic activity data. In mouse liver, mSULT2B1b is not significantly changed. Enzyme activities, protein expression, and mRNA expression of SULT1A1 and SULT2A1 in the lung, brain, and liver of mice were not significantly affected by the infection. The induction of SULT2B1b may be used to inactivate natural liver X receptor ligands and activate the proliferation of T cells in response to influenza A virus infection in the lung and brain of mice. Our results raise the possibility that regulation of SULT2B1b may influence acquired immune responses to infectious diseases.",

Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by oxysterols has been known to be an antiproliferative factor. Overexpression of SULT2B1b impairs LXR's response to oxysterols, by which it regulates lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate in vivo and in vitro effects of SULT2B1b on liver proliferation and the underlying mechanisms. Primary rat hepatocytes and C57BL/6 mice were infected with adenovirus encoding SULT2B1b. Liver proliferation was determined by measuring the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining labeling index. The correlation between SULT2B1b and PCNA expression in mouse liver tissues was determined by double immunofluorescence. Gene expressions were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. SULT2B1b overexpression in mouse liver tissues increased PCNA-positive cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increased expression of PCNA in mouse liver tissues was only observed in the SULT2B1b transgenic cells. Small interference RNA SULT2B1b significantly inhibited cell cycle regulatory gene expressions in primary rat hepatocytes.

        "abstract": "Intracellular lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and subsequent apoptosis are the major pathogenic events of metabolic disorders, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Recently, a novel regulatory oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3b, 25-diol 3-sulfate (25HC3S), has been identified, and hydroxysterol sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) has been elucidated as the key enzyme for its biosynthesis from 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) via oxysterol sulfation. The product 25HC3S and the substrate 25HC have been shown to coordinately regulate lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 25HC3S decreases levels of the nuclear liver oxysterol receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), inhibits SREBP processing, subsequently downregulates key enzymes in lipid biosynthesis, decreases intracellular lipid levels in hepatocytes and THP-1-derived macrophages, prevents apoptosis, and promotes cell proliferation in liver tissues. Furthermore, 25HC3S increases nuclear PPAR\u03b3 and cytosolic I\u03baB\u03b1 and decreases nuclear NF-\u03baB levels and proinflammatory cytokine expression and secretion when cells are challenged with LPS and TNF\u03b1. In contrast to 25HC3S, 25HC, a known LXR ligand, increases nuclear LXR and decreases nuclear PPARs and cytosol I\u03baB\u03b1 levels. In this review, we summarize our recent findings, including the discovery of the regulatory oxysterol sulfate, its biosynthetic pathway, and its functional mechanism.

        "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is mainly caused by uncontrolled inflammatory response, and it remains without effective therapeutic options. 25\u2010hydroxycholesterol (25HC) has been reported to be a potent regulator of inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 25HC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2010induced ALI. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with 25HC intraperitoneally before intratracheal exposure to LPS. Our results showed that 25HC pretreatment improved survival rate, attenuated the pathological changes of the lung and decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines in mice. Consistently, 25HC reduced expression of Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR4)\u2010mediated inflammatory cytokines in vitro. These effects of 25HC were obtained by preventing LPS binding to TLR4 via interaction with myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD\u20102). Crystal structure analysis suggested that 25HC could bind MD\u20102 with high affinity into its hydrophobic pocket. Furthermore, LPS\u2010induced activation of Akt/NF\u2010\u03baB pathway was partially down\u2010regulated by 25HC pretreatment. In summary, this study demonstrates that 25HC could inhibit the overwhelming inflammatory response through MD\u20102 interaction, which suppresses Akt/NF\u2010\u03baB signalling pathway.

        "abstract": "CH25H has received significant attention due to its broad antiviral activity, which it mediates by catalyzing the production of 25HC. Most studies have focused on the antiviral mechanisms of CH25H; however, whether viruses also actively regulate CH25H expression has not yet been reported. Previous studies demonstrated that pCH25H inhibits PRRSV replication not only via production of 25HC but also by ubiquitination and degradation of viral nonstructural protein 1\u03b1. In this study, we expanded on previous work and found that PRRSV actively degrades pCH25H through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. PRRSV E protein, a viral structural protein, is involved in this process. This study reveals a novel mechanism of interaction between virus and host during PRRSV infection. ABSTRACT Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is one of the most important infectious diseases affecting the global pig industry. Previous studies from our group and other groups showed that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), a multitransmembrane endoplasmic reticulum-associated enzyme, catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication. However, PRRSV infection also actively decreases porcine CH25H (pCH25H) expression, through unidentified mechanisms. In this study, we found that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a major role in pCH25H degradation during PRRSV infection and that the PRRSV-encoded envelope (E) protein interacts with pCH25H. PRRSV E protein degraded pCH25H via ubiquitination, and the ubiquitination site was at pCH25H Lys28. Interestingly, PRRSV E protein appeared to specifically degrade pCH25H but not human CH25H, likely because of a Lys28Arg substitution in the human orthologue. As expected, ubiquitin-mediated degradation by E protein attenuated the antiviral effect of pCH25H by downregulating 25HC production. In addition, we found that knockdown of pCH25H decreased E protein-induced inflammatory cytokine expression and that pCH25H overexpression had the opposite effect. These findings suggested that regulation of pCH25H expression was associated with E protein-induced inflammatory responses. Taken together, our results and those of previous studies of the anti-PRRSV effects of CH25H highlight the complex interplay between PRRSV and pCH25H. IMPORTANCE CH25H has received significant attention due to its broad antiviral activity, which it mediates by catalyzing the production of 25HC.

        "abstract": "The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) remains a persistent hazard in the global pig industry. DEAD (Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu) box helicase 21 (DDX21) is a member of the DDX family. In addition to its function of regulating cellular RNA metabolism, DDX21 also regulates innate immunity and is involved in the replication cycle of some viruses. However, the relationship between DDX21 and PRRSV has not yet been explored. Here, we found that a DDX21 overexpression promoted PRRSV replication, whereas knockdown of DDX21 reduced PRRSV proliferation. Mechanistically, DDX21 promoted PRRSV replication independently of its ATPase, RNA helicase, and foldase activities. Furthermore, overexpression of DDX21 stabilized the expressions of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nucleocapsid proteins, three known antagonists of interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2). Knockdown of DDX21 activated the IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting that the effect of DDX21 on PRRSV-encoded IFN-\u03b2 antagonists may be a driving factor for its contribution to viral proliferation. We also found that PRRSV infection enhanced DDX21 expression and promoted its nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation. Screening PRRSV-encoded proteins showed that nsp1\u03b2 interacted with the C-terminus of DDX21 and enhanced the expression of DDX21. Taken together, these findings reveal that DDX21 plays an important role in regulating PRRSV proliferation through multiple mechanisms.",

        "title": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus degrades DDX10 via SQSTM1/p62-dependent selective autophagy to antagonize its antiviral activity",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a typical immunosuppressive virus devastating the global swine industry. DEAD-box helicases (DDXs) are a family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases that are predominantly implicated in modulating cellular RNA metabolism. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies have suggested that some DDXs are associated with innate immunity and virus infection, so they are considered potential antiviral targets. Herein, we screened 40 DDXs and found that ectopic expression of DDX10 exhibited a significant anti-PRRSV effect, while DDX10 knockdown promoted PRRSV proliferation. Further analysis revealed that DDX10 positively regulates type I interferon production, which may contribute to its anti-PRRSV effect. Interestingly, PRRSV infection promoted DDX10 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for macroautophagic/autophagic degradation to block the antiviral effect of DDX10. By screening PRRSV-encoded proteins, we found that the viral envelope (E) protein interacted with DDX10. In line with the autophagic degradation of DDX10 during PRRSV infection, E protein could induce autophagy and reduce DDX10 expression in wild-type cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) cells. When further screening the cargo receptors for autophagic degradation, we found that SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) interacted with both DDX10 and E protein, and E protein-mediated DDX10 degradation was almost entirely blocked in SQSTM1 KO cells, demonstrating that E protein degrades DDX10 by promoting SQSTM1-mediated selective autophagy. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which PRRSV escapes host antiviral innate immunity through selective autophagy, providing a new target for developing anti-PRRSV drugs.Abbreviations: ACTB: actin beta; ATG: autophagy related; co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; CQ: chloroquine; DDX10: DEAD-box helicase 10; E: envelope; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; hpi: hours post infection; hpt: hours post transfection; IFA: indirect immunofluorescence assay; IFN-I: type I IFN; IFNB/IFN-\u03b2: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; KO: knockout; MAP1LC3B/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MOI: multiplicity of infection; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; NFKB/NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor kappa B; OPTN: optineurin; ORF: open reading frame; PRRSV: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; SeV: sendai virus; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TCID50: 50% tissue culture infective dose; WT: wild type.",

        "abstract": "Viruses employ various evasion strategies to establish prolonged infection, with evasion of innate immunity being particularly crucial. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a significant pathogen in swine industry, characterized by reproductive failures in sows and respiratory distress in pigs of all ages, leading to substantial economic losses globally. In this study, we found that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) of PRRSV antagonizes innate immune responses via inhibiting the expression of type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which is achieved by degrading multiple proteins of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway (RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7). Furthermore, we showed that PRRSV Nsp5 is located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it promotes accumulation of RLR signaling pathway proteins. Further data demonstrated that Nsp5 activates reticulophagy (ER-phagy), which is responsible for the degradation of RLR signaling pathway proteins and IFN-I production. Mechanistically, Nsp5 interacts with one of the ER-phagy receptor family with sequence similarity 134 member B (FAM134B), promoting the oligomerization of FAM134B. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which PRRSV utilizes FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy to elude host antiviral immunity.IMPORTANCEInnate immunity is the first line of host defense against viral infections. Therefore, viruses developed numerous mechanisms to evade the host innate immune responses for their own benefit. PRRSV, one of the most important endemic swine viruses, poses a significant threat to the swine industry worldwide. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that PRRSV utilizes its non-structural protein Nsp5 to degrade multiple proteins of RLR signaling pathways, which play important roles in IFN-I production. Moreover, FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy was further proved to be responsible for the protein's degradation. Our study highlights the critical role of ER-phagy in immune evasion of PRRSV to favor replication and provides new insights into the prevention and control of PRRSV.",
