        "abstract": "In a double-blind, randomised multicentre study buflomedil, a vasoactive substance, was compared with placebo in the treatment of 93 patients with chronic arterial occlusive disease. After a run-in period of four weeks the patients received either buflomedil (600 mg daily) or placebo over 12 weeks. The pain-free and the total walking distances improved significantly in both groups. However, the differences in the improvement between the two groups were highly signifi cant and in favour of buflomedil: for the pain-free walking distance p<0.001 and for the total walking distance p<0.01. The results indicate that buflomedil has a beneficial effect on the symptoms and lengthens the walking distance in patients with arterial occlusive disease.",

        "abstract": "In this multicenter trial 169 patients with chronic intermittent claudication due to obstructive peripheral vascular disease were randomized in a double- blind fashion into two parallel groups receiving either 250 mg ticlopidine or placebo, twice daily. At entry, the two groups (83 ticlopidine, 86 placebo) were well matched for the major clinical features apart from an excess of women in the ticlopidine group. At six months, 167 patients were alive, 2 having died of malignant disease (1 from each group). At this stage, 39 patients from the ticlo pidine group and 29 from the placebo group (p = 0.04) had increased their walking distance by more than 50% of baseline values. For the groups as a whole pain-free and total walking distance were greater in the ticlopidine group than in the placebo group (194 vs 124 meters, p = 0.03 and 236 vs 170 meters, p = 0.04, respectively). Two patients from the ticlopidine group vs 9 patients from the placebo group (p = 0.03) developed significant cardiovascular events during the study. These results indicate that ticlopidine has a beneficial effect both in the treatment of the symptoms and the prevention of vascular complica tions in patients with intermittent claudication.",

        "abstract": "Patients with intermittent claudication due to atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease are at high risk for thrombotic events in cerebral, cardiac, and peripheral territories. Antiplatelet therapy has been shown to lower the incidence of these events in other high-risk groups. The antiplatelet agent ticlopidine should contribute to improve symptoms and prevent cardiovascular complications. Three double-blind placebo-controlled trials using ticlopidine 500 to 1000 mg for a period of 2 weeks to 1 year demonstrated significant benefits in patients with chronic arterial occlusion due to thromboangitis obliterans or arteriosclerotic ulcers. In three relatively small placebo-controlled studies in intermittent claudication, ticlopidine has not been associated with significant improvements in walking distances. This presentation is a review of larger randomized trials especially designed to assess the effects of ticlopidine in patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD). The ACT study, a French-Swiss multicenter trial started in December 1982 and completed in October 1985, involved 169 patients with chronic intermittent claudication due to obstructive peripheral vascular disease.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCilostazol is a new phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses platelet aggregation and also acts as a direct arterial vasodilator. This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of cilostazol for treatment of stable, moderately severe intermittent claudication.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nStudy inclusion criteria included age > or =40 years, initial claudication distance (ICD) on treadmill (12.5% incline, 3.2 km/h) between 30 and 200 m, and confirmation of diagnosis of chronic lower-extremity arterial occlusive disease. After stabilization and single-blind placebo lead-in, 81 subjects (62 male, 19 female) from 3 centers were randomized unequally (2:1) to 12 weeks of treatment with cilostazol 100 mg PO BID or placebo. Primary outcome measures included ICD and maximum distance walked (absolute claudication distance, or ACD). Secondary outcome measures included ankle pressures, subjective assessments of benefit by patients and physicians, and safety. Treatment and control groups were similar with respect to age, severity of symptoms, ankle pressures, and smoking status. Statistical analyses used intention-to-treat analyses for each of 77 subjects who had > or =1 treadmill test after initiation of therapy. Comparisons between groups were based on logarithms of ratios of ICD and ACD changes from baseline using ANOVA test at last treatment visit. The estimated treatment effect showed a 35% increase in ICD (P<0.01) and a 41% increase in ACD (P<0.01). There was no significant change in resting or postexercise ankle/brachial indexes. Patients' and physicians' subjective assessments corroborated the measured improvements in walking performance observed in the cilostazol-treated group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCilostazol improved walking distances, significantly increasing ICD and ACD. The data suggest cilostazol is safe and well tolerated for the treatment of intermittent claudication.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRestenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary (balloon) angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major drawback of the procedure. We previously reported that cilostazol, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, inhibited intimal proliferation after directional coronary atherectomy and reduced the restenosis rate in humans. The present study aimed to determine the effect of cilostazol on restenosis after PTCA.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTwo hundred eleven patients with 273 lesions who underwent successful PTCA were randomly assigned to the cilostazol (200 mg/d) group or the aspirin (250 mg/d) control group. Administration of cilostazol was initiated immediately after PTCA and continued for 3 months of follow-up. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed before PTCA and after PTCA and at follow-up. Reference diameter, minimal lumen diameter, and percent diameter stenosis (DS) were measured by quantitative coronary angiography. Angiographic restenosis was defined as DS at follow-up >50%. Eligible follow-up angiography was performed in 94 patients with 123 lesions in the cilostazol group and in 99 patients with 129 lesions in the control group. The baseline characteristics and results of PTCA showed no significant difference between the 2 groups. However, minimal lumen diameter at follow-up was significantly larger (1.65+/-0.55 vs 1.37+/-0.58 mm; P<0.0001) and DS was significantly lower (34.1+/-17.8% vs 45.6+/-19. 3%; P<0.0001) in the cilostazol group. Restenosis and target lesion revascularization rates were also significantly lower in the cilostazol group (17.9% vs 39.5%; P<0.001 and 11.4% vs 28.7%; P<0. 001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCilostazol significantly reduces restenosis and target lesion revascularization rates after successful PTCA.",

        "title": "Cyclic AMP inhibited proliferation of human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, accompanied by induction of p53 and p21.",
        "abstract": "Although cAMP is an important second messenger that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of platelet aggregation and dilatation of blood vessels, little is known about the action of cAMP on the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Thus, we initially studied the effects of cAMP accumulation by using various cAMP stimulants, including a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor (cilostazol) on human aortic VSMC growth. Accumulation of cAMP inhibited the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated VSMC growth in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01), whereas PDGF significantly stimulated the growth of human VSMCs. Thus, we focused on the role of cell cycle regulatory genes, especially on a negative regulator, an anti-oncogene, p53. The protein of p53 was potentiated by cilostazol as well as forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, whereas PDGF decreased p53 expression. Upregulation of p53 protein by cAMP was further confirmed by the observation that the decrease in p21, a p53-inducible protein, by PDGF was significantly attenuated by cilostazol in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). These results revealed that accumulation of cAMP inhibited VSMC proliferation, which was at least in part due to an increase in p53-p21 expression. Because p53 and p21 have been reported to induce apoptosis, we examined apoptotic cells for cAMP accumulation. Incubation of VSMCs with cilostazol resulted in a significant increase in apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner compared with vehicle treatment as assessed by nuclear chromatic morphology (P<0.01); forskolin also stimulated apoptotic cells. Consistent with nuclear staining, DNA fragmentation in VSMCs treated with forskolin as well as 8-bromo-cAMP and cilostazol was significantly increased compared with DNA fragmentation in VSMCs treated with vehicle, whereas PDGF significantly decreased the rate of DNA fragmentation (P<0.01). Overall, these results demonstrated that cAMP inhibited the proliferation of human aortic VSMCs, accompanied by p53-p21-mediated apoptosis. Analogues of cAMP that have direct inhibitory effects on VSMC proliferation can be considered as potential antiproliferative drugs against VSMC growth.",

        "title": "Pharmacological treatment for prevention of restenosis",
        "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity among adults in the Western world. Coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) have gained widespread acceptance for the treatment of symptomatic CAD. There has been an explosive growth worldwide in the utilisation of PCI, such as balloon angioplasty and stenting, which now accounts for over 50% of coronary revascularisation. Despite the popularity of PCI, the problem of recurrent narrowing of the dilated artery (restenosis) continues to vex investigators. In recent years, significant advances have occurred in the understanding of restenosis. Two processes seem to contribute to restenosis: remodelling (vessel size changes) and intimal hyperplasia (vascular smooth muscle cell [VSMC] proliferation and extracellular matrix [ECM] deposition). Despite considerable efforts, pharmacological approaches to decrease restenosis have been largely unsuccessful and the only currently applied modality to reduce the restenosis rate is stenting. However, stenting only prevents remodelling and does not inhibit intimal hyperplasia. Several potential targets for inhibiting restenosis are currently under investigation including platelet activation, the coagulation cascade, VSMC proliferation and migration, and ECM synthesis. In addition, new approaches for local drug therapy, such as drug eluting stents, are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. In this article, we critically review the current status of drugs that are being evaluated for restenosis at various stages of development (in vitro, preclinical animal models and human trials).",

        "abstract": "Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to the stenosis of coronary arteries and vascular grafts. Local delivery of anti\u2010proliferative drugs can prevent vascular stenosis. To understand the cellular responses to anti\u2010proliferative agents, we investigated the signaling events in cultured human aortic SMCs (ASMCs), saphenous venous SMCs (VSMCs), and dermal fibroblasts (DFs) in response to paclitaxel or etoposide. Cellular mitochondrial and proliferative activities were examined with the methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) dye reduction and the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay, respectively. Cell proliferation was almost completely suppressed by paclitaxel or etoposide, but apoptosis was achieved in only about 50% of cells at the highest drug concentrations, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms to prevent apoptosis. Examination of three important signaling pathways revealed significant differences between ASMCs, VSMCs, and DFs. Treatment with either paclitaxel or etoposide caused a transient phosphorylation/activation of p42 MAPK in ASMCs and DFs, but had no effect on phospho\u2010p42/44 MAPK in VSMCs. High\u2010dose etoposide enhanced p38 MAPK activation in ASMCs, but not in VSMCs. The p38 inhibitor, PD169316, partially inhibited etoposide\u2010induced ASMC apoptosis, but induced apoptosis in VSMCs. The effects of etoposide and paclitaxel on Akt also differed between ASMCs and VSMCs. These observations indicate that ASMCs and VSMCs differ in the response of signaling pathways to anti\u2010proliferative agents. In ASMCs, p42/44 MAPK appears to serve a pro\u2010survival role, whereas p38 MAPK is a pro\u2010apoptotic regulator. In contrast, p38 MAPK is an important pro\u2010survival regulator in VSMCs and p42/44 MAPK appears to play a minor role in responding to anti\u2010proliferative drugs. J. Cell.

Vinpocetine has been shown to improve vascular remolding; however, little is known about the direct effects of vinpocetine on vascular complications mediated by diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of vinpocetine on hyperglycemia-facilitated neointimal hyperplasia and explore its possible mechanism. Materials and Methods Nondiabetic and diabetic rats were subjected to balloon injury of the carotid artery followed by 3-week treatment with either vinpocetine (10 mg/kg/day) or saline. Morphological analysis and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining were performed on day 21. Rat VSMCs proliferation was determined with 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine cell proliferation assays. Chemokinesis was monitored with scratch assays, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed using a 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) flow cytometric assay. Apoptosis was detected by annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometric assay. Cell signaling was assessed by immunblotting. Results Vinpocetine prevented intimal hyperplasia in carotid arteries in both normal (I/M ratio: 93.83 \u00b1 26.45% versus 143.2 \u00b1 38.18%, P<0.05) and diabetic animals (I/M ratio: 120.5 \u00b1 42.55% versus 233.46 \u00b1 33.98%, P<0.05) when compared to saline. The in vitro study demonstrated that vinpocetine significantly inhibited VSMCs proliferation and chemokinesis as well as ROS generation and apoptotic resistance, which was induced by high glucose (HG) treatment. Vinpocetine significantly abolished HG-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK1/2 without affecting their total levels. For downstream targets, HG-induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly inhibited by vinpocetine. Vinpocetine also attenuated HG-enhanced expression of PCNA, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. Conclusions Vinpocetine attenuated neointimal formation in diabetic rats and inhibited HG-induced VSMCs proliferation, chemokinesis and apoptotic resistance by preventing ROS activation and affecting MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-\u03baB signaling.",

The epigenetic abnormalities are increasingly considered to be relevant to the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. But the epigenetic mechanisms linking diabetes and coronary restenosis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the protective effect and underlying mechanisms of demethylases JMJD2A inhibition in balloon-injury induced neointimal formation in diabetic rats. Methods: JMJD2A inhibition was achieved by the chemical inhibitor 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vitro, we investigated the proliferation, migration and inflammation of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to high glucose (HG). In vivo, diabetic rats induced using high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (35mg/kg) underwent carotid artery balloon injury. Morphometric analysis was performed using hematein eosin and immumohistochemical staining. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was conducted to detect modification of H3K9me3 at inflammatory genes promoters. Results: The global JMJD2A was increased in HG-stimulated VSMCs and balloon-injured arteries of diabetic rats, accompanied by decreased H3K9me3. The inhibition of JMJD2A suppressed VSMCs proliferation, migration and inflammation induced by high glucose (HG) in vitro. And JMJDA2A inhibition attenuated neointimal formation in balloon-injured diabetic rats. The underlying mechanisms were relevant to the restoration of H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of MCP-1 and IL-6, and then the suppressed expression of MCP-1 and IL-6. Conclusion: The JMJD2A inhibition significantly attenuated neointimal formation in balloon injured diabetic rats via the suppression of VSMCs proliferation, migration, and inflammation by restoring H3K9me3.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that lysine (K)-specific demethylase 3A (KDM3A) is associated with diverse diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications in response to high glucose levels. However, the effects of KDM3A on the pathological progression of cardiovascular injuries in response to high insulin levels remain unknown. The present study aimed to explore whether KDM3A knockdown may attenuate high insulin-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction, and to further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Primary VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats. Lentiviral vectors encoding control-small interfering (si)RNA or KDM3A-siRNA were transduced into VSMCs for 72 h, and cells were subsequently incubated in medium containing 100 nM insulin for a further 5 days. Cellular proli feration, migration and apoptosis were measured by Cell Counting kit-8, Transwell chamber assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using the dihydroethidium fluorescent probe. The mRNA expression levels of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of KDM3A, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB/p65, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein and Bcl-2 were evaluated by western blotting. Lentivirus transduction with KDM3A-siRNA markedly reduced the elevated expression of KDM3A induced by high insulin stimulation in VSMCs. In addition, inhibition of KDM3A significantly ameliorated insulin-induced VSMC proliferation and migration, which was accompanied by decreased ROS levels, cell apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine levels. Furthermore, KDM3A gene silencing mitigated phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB/p65 activation. In conclusion, KDM3A inhibition may exert numerous protective effects on high insulin-stimulated VSMCs, and the underlying mechanisms may be partly associated with inactivation of MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and novel therapeutic targets still need to be investigated to alleviate myocardial injury and the ensuing maladaptive cardiac remodelling. Accumulating studies have indicated that lncRNA H19 might exert a crucial regulatory effect on cardiovascular disease. In this study, we aimed to explore the biological function and molecular mechanism of H19 in MI. To investigate the biological functions of H19, miRNA\u201022\u20103p and KDM3A, gain\u2010 and loss\u2010of\u2010function experiments were performed. In addition, bioinformatics analysis, dual\u2010luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, RNA pull\u2010down assays, quantitative RT\u2010PCR and Western blot analyses as well as rescue experiments were conducted to reveal an underlying competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. We found that H19 was significantly down\u2010regulated after MI. Functionally, enforced H19 expression dramatically reduced infarct size, improved cardiac performance and alleviated cardiac fibrosis by mitigating myocardial apoptosis and decreasing inflammation. However, H19 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Bioinformatics analysis and dual\u2010luciferase assays revealed that, mechanistically, miR\u201022\u20103p was a direct target of H19, which was also confirmed by RIP and RNA pull\u2010down assays in primary cardiomyocytes. In addition, bioinformatics analysis and dual\u2010luciferase reporter assays also demonstrated that miRNA\u201022\u20103p directly targeted the KDM3A gene. Moreover, subsequent rescue experiments further verified that H19 regulated the expression of KDM3A to ameliorate MI\u2010induced myocardial injury in a miR\u201022\u20103p\u2010dependent manner. The present study revealed the critical role of the lncRNAH19/miR\u201022\u20103p/KDM3A pathway in MI.

One JMJD subfamily consists of JMJD1A/KDM3A, JMJD1B/KDM3B, and JMJD1C/KDM3C that are roughly 50% identical at the amino acid level. All three JMJD1 proteins are capable of removing dimethyl and monomethyl marks from lysine 9 on histone H3 and might also demethylate histone H4 on arginine 3 and nonhistone proteins. Analysis of knockout mice revealed critical roles for JMJD1 proteins in fertility, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease. Importantly, a plethora of studies demonstrated that especially JMJD1A and JMJD1C are overexpressed in various tumors, stimulate cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and facilitate efficient tumor growth. However, JMJD1A may also inhibit the formation of germ cell tumors. Likewise, JMJD1B appears to be a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia, but a tumor promoter in other cancers. Notably, by reducing methylation levels on histone H3 lysine 9, JMJD1 proteins can profoundly alter the transcriptome and thereby affect tumorigenesis, including through upregulating oncogenes such as CCND1, JUN, and MYC. This epigenetic activity of JMJD1 proteins is sensitive to heavy metals, oncometabolites, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species, whose levels are frequently altered within cancer cells. In conclusion, inhibition of JMJD1 enzymatic activity through small molecules is predicted to be beneficial in many different cancers, but not in the few malignancies where JMJD1 proteins apparently exert tumor-suppressive functions.",

        "abstract": "Post\u2011translational modifications of histones by histone demethylases have an important role in the regulation of gene transcription and are implicated in cancers. Recently, the family of lysine (K)\u2011specific demethylase (KDM) proteins, referring to histone demethylases that dynamically regulate histone methylation, were indicated to be involved in various pathways related to cancer development. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the effects of KDMs on cancer growth, metastasis and drug resistance, and a majority of KDMs have been indicated to be oncogenes in both leukemia and solid tumors. In addition, certain KDM inhibitors have been developed and have become the subject of clinical trials to explore their safety and efficacy in cancer therapy. However, most of them focus on hematopoietic malignancy. This review summarizes the effects of KDMs on tumor growth, drug resistance and the current status of KDM inhibitors in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Histone methylation plays a key function in modulating gene expression, and preserving genome integrity and epigenetic inheritance. However, aberrations of histone methylation are commonly observed in human diseases, especially cancer. Lysine methylation mediated by histone methyltransferases can be reversed by lysine demethylases (KDMs), which remove methyl marks from histone lysine residues. Currently, drug resistance is a main impediment for cancer therapy. KDMs have been found to mediate drug tolerance of many cancers via altering the metabolic profile of cancer cells, upregulating the ratio of cancer stem cells and drug\u2010tolerant genes, and promoting the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition and metastatic ability. Moreover, different cancers show distinct oncogenic addictions for KDMs. The abnormal activation or overexpression of KDMs can alter gene expression signatures to enhance cell survival and drug resistance in cancer cells. In this review, we describe the structural features and functions of KDMs, the KDMs preferences of different cancers, and the mechanisms of drug resistance resulting from KDMs. We then survey KDM inhibitors that have been used for combating drug resistance in cancer, and discuss the opportunities and challenges of KDMs as therapeutic targets for cancer drug resistance.",

        "title": "The Unique Role of the Second Coordination Sphere to Unlock and Control Catalysis in Nonheme Fe(II)/2-Oxoglutarate Histone Demethylase KDM2A.",
        "abstract": "Nonheme Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent histone lysine demethylases 2A (KDM2A) catalyze the demethylation of the mono- or dimethylated lysine 36 residue in the histone H3 peptide (H3K36me1/me2), which plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation and can be involved in many cancers. Although the overall catalytic mechanism of KDMs has been studied, how KDM2 catalysis takes place in contrast to other KDMs remains unknown. Understanding such differences is vital for enzyme redesign and can help in enzyme-selective drug design. Herein, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) to explore the complete catalytic mechanism of KDM2A, including dioxygen diffusion and binding, dioxygen activation, and substrate oxidation. Our study demonstrates that the catalysis of KDM2A is controlled by the conformational change of the second coordination sphere (SCS), specifically by a change in the orientation of Y222, which unlocks the 2OG rearrangement from off-line to in-line mode. The study demonstrates that the variant Y222A makes the 2OG rearrangement more favorable. Furthermore, the study reveals that it is the size of H3K36me3 that prevents the 2OG rearrangement, thus rendering the enzyme inactivity with trimethylated lysine. Calculations show that the SCS and long-range interacting residues that stabilize the HAT transition state in KDM2A differ from those in KDM4A, KDM7B, and KDM6A, thus providing the basics for the enzyme-selective redesign and modulation of KDM2A without influencing other KDMs.",
