        "title": "EVALUATING THE SAFETY AND POTENTIAL USE OF A WEIGHT-BEARING EXERCISE, TAI-CHI CHUAN, FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS",
        "abstract": "The safety of a traditional Chinese exercise, Tai-Chi Chuan, on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was evaluated. RA patients, who received 1 h of Tai-Chi Chuan instruction once (n = 20) and twice (n = 15) a week for 10 consecutive wk in two separate studies, showed no deterioration in their clinical disease activities compared with the corresponding controls (n = 11 and 9, respectively). Testing parameters included joint tenderness, joint swelling, time to walk 50 feet, handgrip strength and a written functional assessment. No significant exacerbation of joint symptoms using this weight-bearing form of exercise was observed. Tai-Chi Chuan exercise appears to be safe for RA patients and may serve as an alternative for their exercise therapy and part of their rehabilitation program. Weight-bearing exercises have the potential advantages of stimulating bone growth and strengthening connective tissue, but this effect needs to be documented in long-term studies.",

        "abstract": "Older persons who are willing to begin exercise programs are often not willing to continue them. At the Atlanta FICSIT (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques) site, individuals aged 70+ were randomized to Tai Chi (TC), individualized balance training (BT), and exercise control education (ED) groups for 15 weeks. In a follow-up assessment 4 months post-intervention, 130 subjects responded to exit interview questions asking about perceived benefits of participation. Both TC and BT subjects reported increased confidence in balance and movement, but only TC subjects reported that their daily activities and their overall life had been affected; many of these subjects had changed their normal physical activity to incorporate ongoing TC practice. The data suggest that when mental as well as physical control is perceived to be enhanced, with a generalized sense of improvement in overall well-being, older persons' motivation to continue exercising also increases.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Tai Chi Chuan (TTC) exercise has beneficial effects on the components of physical condition and can produce a substantial reduction in the risk of multiple falls. Previous studies have shown that short term TCC exercise did not improve the scores in the single leg stance test with eyes closed and the sit and reach test. There has apparently been no research into the effects of TCC on total body rotation flexibility and heart rate responses at rest and after a three minute step test. Methods\u2014In this cross sectional study, 28 male TCC practitioners with an average age of 67.5 years old and 13.2 years of TCC exercise experience were recruited to form the TCC group. Another 30 sedentary men aged 66.2 were selected to serve as the control group. Measurements included resting heart rate, left and right single leg stance with eyes closed, modified sit and reach test, total body rotation test (left and right), and a three minute step test. Results\u2014Compared with the sedentary group, the TCC group had significantly better scores in resting heart rate, three minute step test heart rate, modified sit and reach, total body rotation test on both right and left side (p<0.01), and both right and left leg standing with eyes closed (p<0.05). According to the American Fitness Standards, the TCC group attained the 90th percentile rank for sit and reach and total body rotation test, right and left. Conclusion\u2014Long term regular TCC exercise has favourable effects on the promotion of balance control, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness in older adults.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Scientific evidence supporting the numerous physical, psychological, andsocial benefits ofdance, specifically European/Western dance (ballet, jazz, modern), aerobic dance, anddance/movement therapy, indicate thatdance isan effective activity for promoting the health andwell-being of individuals. This article evaluates research related to dance forms having sociocultural or traditionallceremonial influences, which wehave labeled cultural dance. An extensive literature review located 14 studies pertaining to cultural dance, of which only 4 were experimental or quasi-experimental, 2 were physiological, and 8 were descriptive. The experimental and physiological literature documented the benefits of dance-related cultural activity interventions among various subgroups of thepopulation; the descriptive literature illustrated therole andimportance ofcultural dance forms within diverse communities. The research has established that cultural dance serves multiple functions (e.g., traditionallceremonial practices, celebrations, healing, spirituality, cultural transmission, andsocial connectedness); however, there is limited scientific evidence that such dance forms are linked to improved health andfitness status. We recommend that cultural dance receive greater promotion and study as a public health intervention to increase physical activity, especially among groups at risk for inactivity, including females, older adults, andsome racial!ethnic groups.

        "abstract": "This article provides evidence of a culturally specific dance intervention to decrease obesity as measured by body fat and body mass index (BMI) in African American women. A community partnership was formed with two African American churches to develop an intervention to address the issue of obesity. The culturally specific dance intervention was delivered two times per week for 8 weeks, choreographed to gospel music selected by the experimental group participants, and taught by an African American woman. Body fat and BMI were assessed at three time points and revealed significant differences between the two groups. Attending a minimum of 7 classes was enough to show an observed dose effect and the intervention was found to be culturally specific by understanding their roles as African American women. This community partnership was an effective way to promote a church-based, culturally specific dance intervention to improve the health of African American women.",

        "abstract": "Obesity, age, and comorbidity can lead to limitations in physical function, especially in middle aged, community-dwelling, African American women. To determine the clinical implications of limitations in physical function, instruments that assess physical function need to be tested in this population. The purpose of the authors in this secondary analysis was to report the internal consistency and validity of the Physical Function component of the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument in middle-aged, community-dwelling, African American women. In 2006, 126 community-dwelling African American women completed the Physical Function component, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, and the 6 Minute Walk Test at baseline. Results indicated Cronbach's alphas were excellent (all >.92) for the Physical Function component and the three subscales. The Physical Function component correlated directly with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (r = .37, p < .01) and the 6 Minute Walk Test (r = .36, p < .01) but was inversely correlated with age (r = \u2212.42, p < .01) and comorbidity (r = \u2212.35, p < .01). However, obesity was not correlated (r = \u2212.11, p > .05). A three-factor structure of the Physical Function component was confirmed. Thus, the Physical Function component was a reliable and valid measure to screen African American women who were at risk for function limitations. Future recommendations are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:This secondary analysis examined the immediate and maintaining effects of a 12\u2010week line\u2010dancing intervention on upper and lower extremity activities in underserved adults who receive care from a nurse\u2010managed clinic (NMC). Data sources:This one\u2010group, repeated measures, feasibility study consisted of 40 participants recruited from an urban apartment complex that housed a NMC. Of the 40 participants, 21 participants completed the 12\u2010week line\u2010dancing intervention. Physical function of the upper and lower extremities was measured with the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument at baseline, 12, and 18 weeks to determine the maintaining effects. Conclusions:Age ranged from 45 to 87 years (M = 63; SD = 7.8), body mass index (BMI) was 33.4 (SD = 7.8), 92% were female, and 75% were African American. At baseline, participants showed limitations in all aspects of physical function. Significant improvements in upper and lower extremity activities were noted at 12 weeks and maintained at 18 weeks. Implications for practice:Although line\u2010dancing mainly involves the lower body, there were significant improvements in upper extremity activities at 12 weeks, which were maintained at 18 weeks. The maintaining effects support line\u2010dancing as an intervention to improve upper and lower extremity activities needed for independent living. NMCs are important settings for health promotion interventions in underserved adults.",

        "title": "Dance-based exergaming to improve physical function in aging and stroke",
        "abstract": "Background: Aging and stroke-induced sensori-motor and balance impairments increase postural instability, thus leading to increased fall risk. Thus developing a training paradigm that promotes cardiovascular fitness while addressing postural stability and ambulatory function might be crucial in addressing community based activity profiles among these population groups. Purpose: To examine the effect of a multidimensional, dance-based exergaming training on improving postural stability, walking function, cardiac autonomic modulation and to further assess if these improvements would be carried over to community based activity profiles. Methods: Community dwelling individuals with hemiparethic stroke (N = 15) and healthy older adults (N =15) received dance-based exergaming training for 6 weeks using the commercially available Kinect dance gaming \u201c Just Dance 2014\u201d for one hour and thirty minutes. Change in balance control was evaluated by the Limits of Stability test (Neurocom Inc.). The post-training changes in self-initiated center of pressure response time (RT), the movement velocity (MV), the maximum excursion (MXE) were examined. Heart rate variability was determined for pre- and post-intervention for 10 minutes in (1) supine. Gait speed and cadence were recorded using an electronic walkway. Changes in PA during community ambulation (one week before and after intervention) were assessed using Omran HJ-321 Tri-Axis Pedometer. To determine if the changes in functional measures assessing mobility (Berg Balance Scale [BERG]), endurance (six-minute walk test [6MWT]), and gait (speed and cadence) correlated with improved community ambulation, the difference in clinical measures and gait performance from pre- to post intervention was linearly regressed with the changes in community ambulation. Results: Post-training the RT was significantly reduced (p<0.05). Similarly, post-training, MV and MXE were significantly higher (p<0.05). Post-training there was a significant improvement in autonomic modulation in the supine position, indicating an improvement in LF, HF and LF/HF (p<0.05). Maximum work load and maximum oxygen uptake increased significantly post-training (p<0.05). The change in number of steps recorded in daily living from pre-to post intervention correlated with the pre-post change scores for functional measures BERG, 6MWT, gait speed, and cadence (p<0.05). Conclusion: The dance-based exergaming provides a benchmark for incorporating long-term adherent PA regimen in aging and stroke population, which along with improving cardiovascular functioning and walking function, improves community based activity profiles.",
