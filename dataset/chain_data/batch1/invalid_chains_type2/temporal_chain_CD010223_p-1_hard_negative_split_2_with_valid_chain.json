        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) are the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, the former account for about 70-80% of liability to develop AITDs. However, at least 20-30% is contributed by environmental factors, which include certainly smoking (at least for Graves' disease and orbitopathy), probably stress, iodine and selenium intake, several drugs, irradiation, pollutants, viral and bacterial infections, allergy, pregnancy, and post-partum. Evidence for the intervention of these factors is often limited, and the mechanisms whereby environmental factors may concur to the onset of AITDs are in many instances unclear. Nevertheless, gene-environment interaction seems a fundamental process for the occurrence of AITDs.",

        "abstract": "A controversy exists on the value of upper thyrotropin (TSH) reference level. Currently available studies are based on cross-sectional data leaving uncertainty about the prognostic significance of the upper TSH reference level. With the present study we sought to establish reference values for serum thyroid function tests that are of both diagnostic and prognostic significance. We used data from the prospective population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) with a 5 year follow-up (6080 person-years). We included data from 1203 subjects (525 women) without prevalent subclinical or manifest thyroid disorders. An event-free reference population was separated comprising 1053 subjects (473 women). When comparing reference values as analyzed from either the whole reference population or the event-free reference population, we observed notable differences in TSH reference intervals. While the lower TSH reference values were similar in both populations, the upper value was 1.95 mIU/l and thus by 7.6% lower in subjects without incident events compared to the whole reference population. Both populations did not substantially differ with respect to serum FT3 and FT4 reference intervals. The upper TSH reference value is lower than recommended when both diagnostic and prognostic significance are considered in the definition of the TSH reference range.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to establish new reference intervals for serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels in Japanese subjects without antithyroid antibodies. We reviewed the serum TSH level of all patients 20 years of age and over who attended the outpatient clinic of our hospital between January 1, 2003, and September 20, 2010. The thyroid gland of every patient was examined by ultrasonography, and subjects found to have a normal thyroid were chosen. The following subjects were excluded: subjects with past history of thyroid diseases; subjects whose serum was positive for antithyroid antibodies; pregnant women; patients taking medication that might affect their free thyroxine (fT(4)) level or TSH levels. Ultimately, 1388 subjects were included in the reference population. The serum TSH levels shifted to higher ranges as the age of the groups increased. The calculated reference range was 0.39-4.29 mIU/L in the 20-29-year-old group, 0.34-3.90 mIU/L in the 30-39-year-old group, 0.56-5.02 mIU/L in the 40-49-year-old group, 0.51-5.30 mIU/L in the 50-59-year-old group, 0.60-4.85 mIU/L in the 60-69-year-old group, 0.62-6.15 mIU/L in the over 70-year-old group. The results of this study showed that the upper limit of the normal range of serum TSH levels increased with age in a Japanese population. Since the number of elderly reference subjects was relatively small, further study is needed. Setting the age- and race-specific reference limits for serum TSH levels is important in order to prevent significant misclassifications of patients with abnormal TSH levels.",

The aim of the present study was to determine reference intervals for thyrotropin (TSH) and free T4 (FT4), based on the criteria of the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) in an Iranian population. Material and methods: This study was conducted within the framework of Tehran Thyroid Study (TTS), an ongoing prospective cohort of 5704 randomly selected individuals, age \u226520 yr. A total of 2199 individuals (43.3% male, 56.7% female), based on NACB criteria were included in this study. Reference limit analysis was performed for the negative thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) group. Results: After applying all exclusion criteria except TPOAb positivity (10.5%), data of 2459 participants remained for analysis. Of these, 953 (43.3%) were males and 1246 (56.7%) were females; the mean\u00b1SD age was 43.53\u00b114.16 yr. The mean\u00b1SD and median+IQR for TSH were 1.77 mU/l \u00b11.24 and 1.46 (0.93\u20132.23) mU/l, respectively. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles TSH were 0.32 mU/l and 5.06 mU/l respectively. The mean\u00b1SD and median (IQR) for FT4 for all negative TPOAb subjects were 1.19\u00b10.16 and 1.18 (1.08\u20131.31) ng/dl respectively. Conclusion: Reference ranges for thyroid function tests need to be derived from national databases. This study determined age and sex specific TSH and FT4 reference ranges in a Tehranian population, which could eventually enable clinicians to classify patients more appropriately.",

        "abstract": "Background Recent studies have shown an association between thyroid hormone levels and metabolic syndrome (MetS) among euthyroid individuals; however, there have been some inconsistencies between studies. Here, we evaluated the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and MetS in euthyroid middle-aged subjects in a large cohort. Methods A retrospective analysis of 13,496 euthyroid middle-aged subjects who participated in comprehensive health examinations was performed. Subjects were grouped according to thyroid stimulating hormone, total triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), and T3-to-T4 ratio quartile categories. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) for MetS according to thyroid hormone quartiles using logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Results Of the study patients, 12% (n=1,664) had MetS. A higher T3 level and T3-to-T4 ratio were associated with unfavourable metabolic profiles, such as higher body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The proportion of participants with MetS increased across the T3 quartile categories (P for trend <0.001) and the T3-to-T4 ratio quartile categories (P for trend <0.001). The multi-variate-adjusted OR (95% confidence interval) for MetS in the highest T3 quartile group was 1.249 (1.020 to 1.529) compared to the lowest T3 quartile group, and that in the highest T3-to-T4 ratio quartile group was 1.458 (1.141 to 1.863) compared to the lowest T3-to-T4 ratio quartile group, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusion Serum T3 levels and T3-to-T4 ratio are independently associated with MetS in euthyroid middle-aged subjects.

        "abstract": "Thyroid hormones control both metabolic pathways and body composition, whereas little knowledge is available about the possible influence of skeletal muscle mass (MM) on thyroid hormone metabolism and circulating levels. This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Population Health Unit of the National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS \u201cS. de Bellis\u201d (Italy) and investigating the extent to which skeletal MM affects thyroid function in obesity. Two hundred twenty-seven consecutive healthy volunteers (155 women and 72 men) with overweight and obesity (BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2) and taking no medication or supplement were assessed for hormone, metabolic and routine laboratory parameters. Body composition parameters were collected by using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). MM was directly related to the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), insulin, triglycerides, uric acid and free-triiodothyronine (FT3) serum levels, FT3 to the free-thyroxine (FT4) ratio, and insulin-resistance (HOMA-IR), and inversely related to age, total, and HDL-cholesterol serum levels. Multiple regression models confirmed the relationship between MM and the FT3 to FT4 ratio, independently of age, BMI, TSH, triglycerides, and insulin serum levels. The same analyses run by gender showed that this relationship maintained significance only in men. Increased skeletal MM in obesity results in improved thyroid activity mediated by increased T4 conversion to T3, and higher FT3 circulating levels, particularly in men. In conclusion, preserving a greater skeletal MM in obesity helps to enhance thyroid activity. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04327375.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Low T3 syndrome is defined by a fall in free triiodothyronine (FT3) in spite of normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and often normal free thyroxin (FT4). A low FT3/FT4 ratio, a relevant marker for low T3 syndrome, is known as a risk of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, as well as low muscle mass in the general population. Because of the local activation of T4 to FT3 in muscle tissue, we examined the association of FT3/FT4 ratio with serum creatinine, a marker of muscle mass and strength in HD patients to investigate the significance of muscle tissue in the development of low T3 syndrome in HD patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study derived from our prospective cohort study, named DREAM, of Japanese HD patients. After the exclusion of patients with treated and untreated thyroid dysfunction, 332 patients were analyzed in the study. Results: The serum FT4 and TSH of HD patients (n = 332) were 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 ng/dL. and 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcIU/mL, which were within the respective normal range, while serum FT3 was 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 pg/mL. As many as 101 out of 332 (30.4%) HD patients exhibited a serum FT3 less than the normal lower limit of 2.2 pg/mL. The serum FT3/FT4 ratio correlated significantly positively with serum creatinine, and inversely with serum log CRP and total cholesterol, while it exhibited a tendency towards positive correlation with serum albumin. Multiple regression analysis, which included serum creatinine, albumin, and log CRP, simultaneously, in addition to sex, age, diabetic kidney disease or not, log HD duration, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and Kt/V, as independent variables, revealed an independent and significant positive association of serum creatinine, but not serum albumin or CRP, with the serum FT3/FT4 ratio. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated an independent and positive correlation of serum creatinine with the serum FT3/FT4 ratio in HD patients. The lack of association of the serum FT3/FT4 ratio with serum albumin and CRP suggested the presence of a creatinine-specific mechanism to associate with serum FT3/FT4 ratio. Because of the local activation of T4 to T3 at muscle tissue, a lower muscle mass may be causatively associated with low T3 syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Introduction The relationship between thyroid function/homeostasis parameters and renal function has been extensively studied. However, the relationship between thyroid function and thyroid homeostasis parameters with albuminuria among elderly individuals remains unclear. Methods The population was divided into an albuminuria group and a non-albuminuria group for baseline characteristic difference analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the association between thyroid function, and thyroid homeostasis parameters and albuminuria. The nonlinear relationship was explored with restricted cubic splines. Meanwhile, we investigated whether the relationship also existed in the diabetes and hypertension subgroups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the effectiveness of the indices. Results FT4 and TFQIFT4 were positively correlated with albuminuria (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.02\u20131.23, p = 0.02; OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.08\u20132.99, p = 0.03), and FT3/FT4 was negatively correlated with albuminuria (OR = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.00\u20130.26, p = 0.003). Additionally, the nonlinear relationship between FT3/FT4 as well as TSHI and albuminuria was approximately U-shaped. Similar results were observed in the hypertension subgroup but not in the diabetes subgroup. There was a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between FT3 and albuminuria in the diabetes group. In addition, FT3/FT4 performed better than TFQI, TT4RI, and TSHI in ROC analyses for albuminuria prediction. Conclusion FT4, TFQIFT4, and a low FT3/FT4 ratio were risk factors for albuminuria in euthyroid individuals over 60 years old. However, FT3 was more associated with albuminuria in the diabetes subgroup. TSH was not associated with albuminuria in any analysis. In our study, we attempted to provide more reasonable thyroid parameters and basis for evaluating patients with underlying albuminuria. FT3/FT4 may be used as a helpful indicator to predict albuminuria and provide novel ideas for the evaluation and treatment of albuminuria.",
