        "title": "Acupuncture treatment of severe knee osteoarthrosis. A long\u2010term study",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Acupuncture treatment of patients waiting for arthroplasty surgery. Methods: 29 patients with a total of 42 osteoarthritic knees were randomized to two groups. Group A was treated while Group B served as a no\u2010treatment control group. After 9 weeks Group B was treated too. Analgesic consumption, pain and objective measurements were registered. All objective measures were done by investigators who were \u201cblinded\u201d as to Group A & B. In the second part of the study 17 patients (26 knees) continued with treatments once a month. Registration of analgesic consumption, pain and objective measurements continued. Total study period 49 weeks. Results: Comparing Group A to B there was a significant reduction in pain, analgesic consumption and in most objective measures. In Group A + B combined there was an 80% subjective improvement, and a significantly increased knee range movement \u2013 an increase mainly in the worst knees. Results were significantly better in those who had not been ill for a long time. In the second part of the study, it was shown that it was possible to maintain the improvements. Conclusions: Acupuncture can ease the discomfort while waiting for an operation and perhaps even serve as an alternative to surgery. Seven patients have responded so well that at present they do not want an operation. (USD 9000 saved per operation).",

        "title": "Electroacupuncture reduces morphine-induced emesis in ferrets: a pilot study.",
        "abstract": "We treated morphine-induced emesis in ferrets with electroacupuncture (EA) for five minutes at the acupuncture point Neiguan (P6) using two different frequencies of stimulation: 1.0 Hz and 5.0 Hz (n = 5 ferrets per group). Both EA treatments reduced the number of emetic episodes (39% reduction of episodes, p < or = 0.05 at 1.0 Hz; 43% reduction of episodes, p < or = 0.05 at 5.0 Hz) and prolonged the onset time of emesis as compared with control receiving no EA. This model demonstrates that under these conditions EA is effective as an antiemetic against morphine in the ferret and may allow for further studies on the mechanisms of acupuncture and emesis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\u2002 The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic value and possible mechanisms of transcutaneous electroacupuncture (TEA) in a double\u2010blind and cross\u2010over study in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). Twenty\u2010seven patients with FD were enrolled and the study consisted of two parts: (i) acute effects of TEA at PC6 and ST36 on gastric slow waves and heart rate variability and (ii) chronic (2\u2003weeks) effects of TEA at PC6 and ST36 on dyspepsia symptoms, gastric slow waves, heart rate variability and neuropeptide Y (NPY) and motilin. The results of this study are: (i) The dyspepsia symptom score was decreased by 55% at the end of chronic TEA and the improvement was significant (P\u2003<\u20030.01); (ii) the high frequency (HF) assessed from the spectral analysis of heart rate variability was markedly increased with both acute TEA (76% increase, P\u2003=\u20030.01) and chronic TEA (75% increase, P\u2003=\u20030.025); (iii) gastric slow waves were not altered by either acute or chronic TEA; and (iv) the plasma level of NPY but not motilin was increased after chronic TEA. Non\u2010invasive and needleless transcutaenous electroacupuncture at ST36 and PC6 markedly improves dyspepsia symptoms and the improvement may be associated with the increase in HF heart rate variability and the modulation of NPY.",

        "title": "Ameliorating effects and mechanisms of electroacupuncture on gastric dysrhythmia, delayed emptying, and impaired accommodation in diabetic rats.",
        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) on gastric accommodation, gastric dysrhythmia, and gastric emptying (GE) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Five experiments were performed in five groups of STZ-induced diabetic rats to study the effects of EA at ST-36 (Zusanli) on gastric slow-wave dysrhythmia, delayed GE and intestinal transit, impaired gastric accommodation, and the mechanisms of EA involving the autonomic and opioidergic pathways. We found the following: 1) EA improved gastric dysrhythmia in the diabetic rats. The normal percentage of slow waves was 55.4 +/- 2.9% at baseline and significantly increased to 69.2 +/- 2.2% with EA (P = 0.01); this effect was blocked by naloxone. 2) EA resulted in a 21.4% increase in GE and 18.2% increase in small intestinal transit in the diabetic rats. 3) EA restored diabetes-induced impairment in gastric accommodation. Gastric accommodation was 0.98 +/- 0.13 ml with sham EA and significantly increased to 1.21 +/- 0.15 ml with EA (P = 0.01), and this effect was blocked by naloxone. 4) EA increased vagal activity assessed by the spectral analysis of the heart rate variability. We concluded that EA at ST-36 improves gastric dysrhythmia, delayed GE and intestinal transit, and impaired accommodation in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and the improvement seems to be mainly mediated via the vagal pathway. EA may have a promising therapeutic potential for diabetic gastroparesis.",

        "title": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on ST36 and SP6 acupoints prevents hyperglycaemic response during anaesthesia: a randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Background and objective Hyperglycaemia is a common result of stress signals caused by pain and surgical procedure. Volatile anaesthetics also directly manipulate glucose homeostasis by affecting pancreatic insulin release and induce hyperglycaemia without surgical stress. We determined the preoperative application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to the Chinese acupoints ST36 (Zusanli) and SP6 (Sanyinjiao) as a complementary therapy for controlling plasma glucose and improving insulin resistance during anaesthesia. Methods We designed a single-blind, randomised controlled clinical study of female patients, scheduled for elective hysterectomy. The 52 patients consented to enrolment and were assigned to receive either TENS (n = 26) on bilateral ST36 and SP6 acupoints with continuous mode at a frequency of 15 Hz and the intensity of 10 mA synchronously for 30 min or non-stimulation (placebo group, n = 26) preoperatively. Haemodynamics, blood glucose and plasma insulin were measured during general anaesthesia. Results At baseline, there was no significant difference between the TENS group and the placebo group in plasma glucose and insulin levels as well as homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. In the placebo group, plasma glucose, insulin and HOMA index increased during induction of general anaesthesia, surgical incision, and throughout the operation. Plasma glucose and insulin levels as well as HOMA index were significantly lower in the TENS group as compared to the placebo group at different time points after discontinuation of TENS application. These results indicate the positive effect of prevention of hyperglycaemia and the increased sensitivity of plasma insulin in the TENS group. Conclusion We found TENS at bilateral ST36 and SP6 acupoints to be an alternative means of managing the plasma glucose level and improving insulin resistance perioperatively.",

        "abstract": "An 80-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus presented to the hospital with low back pain. He was initially managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol and epidural steroid injection. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), applied on the back and buttocks, was subsequently advised. Initially, TENS was applied once every 24 hours. On improvement of pain symptoms, it was increased to thrice every 24 hours. The patient then complained of symptoms of hypoglycaemia (blood sugar level < 4 mmol/L). Discontinuation of TENS resulted in raised blood sugar level. When TENS was restarted, the same hypoglycaemic response was noted. The insulin dosage was adjusted to half of the patient's routine daily requirement with continued application of TENS. This incidental finding has alerted us to hypoglycaemic episodes following TENS application, which may be due to effective pain control, decreased sympathetic stimulation, enhanced insulin sensitivity or altered muscle metabolism due to electrical stimulation.",

        "title": "Effects of different frequencies of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on venous vascular reactivity",
        "abstract": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a type of therapy used primarily for analgesia, but also presents changes in the cardiovascular system responses; its effects are dependent upon application parameters. Alterations to the cardiovascular system suggest that TENS may modify venous vascular response. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of TENS at different frequencies (10 and 100 Hz) on venous vascular reactivity in healthy subjects. Twenty-nine healthy male volunteers were randomized into three groups: placebo (n=10), low-frequency TENS (10 Hz, n=9) and high-frequency TENS (100 Hz, n=10). TENS was applied for 30 min in the nervous plexus trajectory from the superior member (from cervical to dorsal region of the fist) at low (10 Hz/200 \u03bcs) and high frequency (100 Hz/200 \u03bcs) with its intensity adjusted below the motor threshold and intensified every 5 min, intending to avoid accommodation. Venous vascular reactivity in response to phenylephrine, acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent) was assessed by the dorsal hand vein technique. The phenylephrine effective dose to achieve 70% vasoconstriction was reduced 53% (P<0.01) using low-frequency TENS (10 Hz), while in high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz), a 47% increased dose was needed (P<0.01). The endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and independent (sodium nitroprusside) responses were not modified by TENS, which modifies venous responsiveness, and increases the low-frequency sensitivity of \u03b11-adrenergic receptors and shows high-frequency opposite effects. These changes represent an important vascular effect caused by TENS with implications for hemodynamics, inflammation and analgesia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To elucidate the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in pregnancies with placental insufficiency. Methods: Pregnant rats were subjected to uterine artery ligation and to TENS according to the following groups: ligated stimulated (LS); ligated non-stimulated (LN), control stimulated (CS); and control non-stimulated (CN). Fetal external measurements, such as crown\u2013rump length (CRL), fronto-occipital distance (FOD), thoracic ventral-dorsal (TVDD) and abdominal ventral-dorsal (AVDD) distances were analyzed together with the area occupied by fetal internal organs. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in fetal organs. Thickness of junctional, labyrinth and intermediate placental zones was analyzed by morphometric evaluation in HE-stained slides, and placental hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alfa expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: In LN and CS groups compared to the CN group, CRL was reduced (27.51/28.95 versus 30.16\u2009mm), as well as FOD (6.63/6.63 versus 7.36\u2009mm), AVDD (7.38/8.00 versus 8.61\u2009mm) and TVDD (6.46/6.87 versus 7.23\u2009mm). Brain GLUT-1 expression was higher in LS (1.3%) and CS (1.8%). The area occupied by placental vessels in the labyrinth zone (29.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.51 versus 20.83\u2009\u00b1\u20097.63) and intermediate zone (26.46\u2009\u00b1\u200910.21 versus 10.86\u2009\u00b1\u20098.94) was larger in the LS group than in the LN group. Conclusions: Our results suggest a negative effect of TENS on placental development, thus compromising the maintenance of adequate blood flow to the fetus.",
