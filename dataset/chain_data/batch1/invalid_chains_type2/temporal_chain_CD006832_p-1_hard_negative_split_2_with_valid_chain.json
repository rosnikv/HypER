        "title": "Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe administration of growth hormone can attenuate the catabolic response to injury, surgery, and sepsis. However, the effect of high doses of growth hormone on the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the outcome in critically ill adults who are hospitalized for long periods is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out two prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in parallel involving 247 Finnish patients and 285 patients in other European countries who had been in an intensive care unit for 5 to 7 days and who were expected to require intensive care for at least 10 days. The patients had had cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple trauma, or acute respiratory failure. The patients received either growth hormone (mean [+/-SD] daily dose, 0.10 +/- 0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo until discharge from intensive care or for a maximum of 21 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe in-hospital mortality rate was higher in the patients who received growth hormone than in those who did not (P<0.001 for both studies). In the Finnish study, the mortality rate was 39 percent in the growth hormone group, as compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. The respective rates in the multinational study were 44 percent and 18 percent. The relative risk of death for patients receiving growth hormone was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.9) in the Finnish study and 2.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.5) in the multinational study. Among the survivors, the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital and the duration of mechanical ventilation were prolonged in the growth hormone group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with prolonged critical illness, high doses of growth hormone are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.",

        "title": "Splanchnic hemodynamics in critical illness",
        "abstract": "Splanchnic blood flow and blood volume are highly variable in critically ill patients, depending on the underlying disease, compensatory mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions. During low blood flow states or hypoxemia, adaptive mechanisms include profound reductions in splanchnic blood flow and volume. The splanchnic organs are both source and target of systemic inflammation and significant derangements in splanchnic blood flow and metabolism may occur under these conditions. Therapeutic interventions such as vasoactive drugs or nursing procedures may have additional effects on splanchnic tissue perfusion and metabolic demands. Although transient reduction of splanchnic perfusion may be life-saving under certain circumstances, splanchnic hypoperfusion may contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation, sepsis, and multiple organ failure via several mechanisms, including ischemia and reperfusion injury, increased mucosal permeability, translocation of endotoxin and bacteria, and local activation of cytokines and their inflammatory mediators. The clinical syndromes of systemic inflammation, sepsis, and multiple organ failure are associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and are major contributors to the high cost of modern intensive care.",

        "abstract": "Morbidity after colorectal surgery can be reduced with intraoperative oesophageal Doppler monitor (ODM) guided fluid therapy. We audited the effect of introducing ODM-guided fluid therapy in enhanced recovery laparoscopic colorectal surgery. ODM group (n = 40) outcomes (toleration of diet, Post Operative Morbidity Survery (POMS) score, complications) were compared to matched patients (n = 40) who had the same surgery using a conventional approach to fluid management. Mean (SD) time to tolerate diet was shorter in the ODM group (2.3 (1.6) days vs 3.8 (2.4) days, p = 0.003). The ODM group had a lower mean (SD) POMS score on post-operative day 1 (2 (1.4) vs 4 (1.1), p = 0.001), fewer postoperative complications (14 patients vs 20, p = 0.009) and a lower rate of unplanned critical care area admission (1 vs 6, p= 0.001). Introduction of intraoperative ODM-guided stroke volume optimization was associated with improved outcomes in patients undergoing enhanced recovery laparoscopic colorectal surgery.",

        "explanation": "The paper discusses the use of oesophageal Doppler-guided fluid management in laparoscopic colorectal surgery, which is related to the splanchnic hemodynamics in critical illness discussed in the source paper. However, the paper does not directly build upon the source paper's findings or use them as a sub-hypothesis, but rather explores a related concept in a different context."
