        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPlatelets are believed to play a part in the ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty, such as abrupt closure of the coronary vessel during or soon after the procedure. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhen administered in conjunction with primary coronary stenting for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may provide additional clinical benefit, but data on this combination therapy are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 300 patients with acute myocardial infarction in a double-blind fashion either to abciximab plus stenting (149 patients) or placebo plus stenting (151 patients) before they underwent coronary angiography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 30 days and 6 months after the procedure. The angiographic patency of the infarct-related vessel and the left ventricular ejection fraction were evaluated at 24 hours and 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 30 days, the primary end point--a composite of death, reinfarction, or urgent revascularization of the target vessel--had occurred in 6.0 percent of the patients in the abciximab group, as compared with 14.6 percent of those in the placebo group (P=0.01); at 6 months, the corresponding figures were 7.4 percent and 15.9 percent (P=0.02). The better clinical outcomes in the abciximab group were related to the greater frequency of grade 3 coronary flow (according to the classification of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) in this group than in the placebo group before the procedure (16.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent, P=0.01), immediately afterward (95.1 percent vs. 86.7 percent, P=0.04), and six months afterward (94.3 percent vs. 82.8 percent, P=0.04). One major bleeding event occurred in the abciximab group (0.7 percent); none occurred in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with placebo, early administration of abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction improves coronary patency before stenting, the success rate of the stenting procedure, the rate of coronary patency at six months, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAs compared with thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in acute myocardial infarction reduces the rates of death, reinfarction, and stroke, but recurrent ischemia, restenosis, and reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. When used in combination with PTCA, coronary stenting and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may further improve outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 2082 patients with acute myocardial infarction to undergo PTCA alone (518 patients), PTCA plus abciximab therapy (528), stenting alone with the MultiLink stent (512), or stenting plus abciximab therapy (524).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNormal flow was restored in the target vessel in 94.5 to 96.9 percent of patients and did not vary according to the reperfusion strategy. At six months, the primary end point - a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel - had occurred in 20.0 percent of patients after PTCA, 16.5 percent after PTCA plus abciximab, 11.5 percent after stenting, and 10.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab (P<0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups in the rates of death, stroke, or reinfarction; the difference in the incidence of the primary end point was due entirely to differences in the rates of target-vessel revascularization (ranging from 15.7 percent after PTCA to 5.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab, P<0.001). The rate of angiographically established restenosis was 40.8 percent after PTCA and 22.2 percent after stenting (P<0.001), and the respective rates of reocclusion of the infarcted-related artery were 11.3 percent and 5.7 percent (P=0.01), both independent of abciximab use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt experienced centers, stent implantation (with or without abciximab therapy) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of coronary artery stents in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nThe review was conducted following accepted guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials that include comparisons of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) versus PTCA with stent, stent versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and drug-eluting stents (DES) versus non-DES in patients with CAD in native or graft vessels and those with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and unstable angina were also included. Data on the following outcome measures were included in the review: combined event rate or event-free survival, death, acute myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation, repeat treatment (PTCA, stent or CABG) and binary restenosis. An economic model was developed based on extrapolation of trends in mortality and revascularisation from clinical trials data to a 5-year time horizon.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 50 studies comparing the use of stents with PTCA, six comparing stents with CABG and 12 comparing DES eluting stents with non-DES. No studies were identified that compared DES with PTCA or DES with CABG. Existing quality of life data suggest that revascularisation procedures reduce the patient's quality of life for a short period only. Stents were found to be more effective than PTCA in preventing adverse events and revascularisations. In multiple-vessel disease there was no evidence of a difference in mortality (at 1 year) between patients treated surgically and those receiving a stent. Patients treated surgically required fewer revascularisations. There is no evidence of a difference in mortality between patients receiving DES and those treated with bare metal stents at 1 year. A reduction in event rate at 9 and 12 months was found in patients treated with DES. This event rate is primarily made up of increased revascularisation rates in patients treated with bare metal stents. Two-year outcome data from one study indicate that this benefit of DES continues over the longer term. The economic model proved sufficient to indicate long-term trends in cost-effectiveness. CABG was found initially to be more expensive than bare metal stenting in multivessel disease and may have higher immediate risks, but over time the cost differential is reduced and long-term outcomes favour CABG over stenting. A similar situation was found for DES versus CABG in multiple-vessel disease. However, DES may not generally be considered a cost-effective alternative to bare metal stenting in single-vessel disease by policy makers as substantially higher costs are involved with a very small outcome benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDES might be considered cost-effective if the additional cost (compared with ordinary stents) was substantially reduced, the outcome benefits from the use of DES were much improved, and/or its use were targeted on the subgroups of patients with the highest risks of requiring reintervention. Long-term clinical studies are needed that focus on significant outcomes such as mortality. Further research should consider: the differences among plain stents; head-to-head comparisons within DES, CABG compared with DES; and the evaluation of newer non-DES against DES. Evaluation of the effects of revascularisation procedures and especially repeat revascularisation procedures on the patient's quality of life would also be useful, as would the development and testing of risk assessment tools to identify patients likely to need further revascularisations.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of drug eluting stents (DES) compared with conventional stents for treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease in the UK. Design: Cost\u2013utility analysis of audit based patient subgroups by means of a simple economic model. Setting: Tertiary care. Participants: 12 month audit data for 2884 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting at the Cardiothoracic Centre Liverpool between January 2000 and December 2002. Main outcome measures: Risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months of index procedure and reduction in risk from use of DES. Economic modelling was used to estimate the cost\u2013utility ratio and threshold price premium. Results: Four factors were identified for patients undergoing elective surgery (n \u200a=\u200a 1951) and two for non-elective surgery (n \u200a=\u200a 933) to predict risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months. Most patients fell within the subgroup with lowest risk (57% of the elective surgery group with 5.6% risk and 91% of the non-elective surgery group with 9.9% risk). Modelled cost\u2013utility ratios were acceptable for only one group of high risk patients undergoing non-elective surgery (only one patient in audit data). Restricting the number of DES for each patient improved results marginally: 4% of stents could then be drug eluting on economic grounds. The threshold price premium justifying 90% substitution of conventional stents was estimated to be \u00a3112 (US$212, \u20ac162) (sirolimus stents) or \u00a389 (US$167, \u20ac130) (paclitaxel stents). Conclusions: At current UK prices, DES are not cost effective compared with conventional stents except for a small minority of patients. Although the technology is clearly effective, general substitution is not justified unless the price premium falls substantially.",

Device representatives were eager to promote this new product that could dramatically reduce restenosis.1 Patients expected to be treated with this new and \u201cbetter\u201d technology. Lastly, cardiologists had a potent new tool at their disposal that they increasingly incorporated into practice until it became the default revascularization device instead of bare-metal stents in many parts of the world. This quick and widespread adoption in DES resulted in its frequent use in relatively untested and off-label indications. At the Cleveland Clinic, the use of DES mirrored the community and many interventional practices throughout the world, where the penetration of this device peaked at >90%.\n\nWhile DES use was increasing, McFadden and colleagues sounded an alarm with the publication of a report on 4 patients who experienced late stent thrombosis.2 Although this could have been a chance finding, DES were systematically shown to confer an increased risk of late thrombosis relative to bare-metal stents.3 This safety issue has been confirmed by several independent analyses with patient-level data from the pivotal randomized trials.1,4,5\n\nStent thrombosis is uncommon, although when it occurs it \u2026",

Methods and Results\u2014 Consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for ULMD had prospective platelet reactivity assessment by light transmittance aggregometry after a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel. The primary end point of the study was cardiac mortality, and the secondary end point was stent thrombosis. From January 2005 to September 2008, 215 consecutive patients were treated with DES for ULMD. The incidence of HRPR after clopidogrel loading was 18.6%. The median follow-up was 19.3 months.

        "abstract": "Summary In patients suffering from acute coronary syndromes or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, oral antiplatelet treatment is routinely administered with the primary aim of inhibiting platelet-mediated thrombus formation and subsequent abrupt vessel occlusion. Simultaneous inhibition of blood platelet cyclooxygenase-1 by aspirin and of the P2Y12 receptor by clopidogrel or prasugrel is currently recommended in this setting. Inter-individual response variability to aspirin and especially to clopidogrel is the subject of much debate as evidence has grown over the years linking an attenuated response to treatment with the occurrence of ischaemic events. Consequently, the clinical entity of high (on-treatment) platelet reactivity (HPR) was born and subsequently characterised in numerous studies over the last decade. Until recently, alternative treatment options were limited in patients exhibiting HPR. At present the antiplatelet therapy landscape is changing with the advent of prasugrel and ticagrelor as alternative and more potent treatment options. Different tests for monitoring platelet function are available and are being increasingly employed in research projects and clinical routine. These tests may prove useful for achieving optimal platelet inhibition for the individual patient, and several centres now incorporate such testing in day-to-day practice. Widespread adoption of this practice and incorporation into clinical guidelines awaits the results of ongoing trials in which treatment is changed based on platelet function monitoring. This review aims to summarise available facts and fiction in relation to platelet function testing and reactivity with a particular focus on P2Y12 receptor inhibition in patients undergoing coronary stent placement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The term resistance has been applied to interindividual variability in platelet reactivity during antiplatelet therapy or to thrombosis despite appropriate therapy. In particular \u201caspirin resistance\u201d and \u201cclopidogrel resistance\u201d have been the subject of intense investigation for their association with poor cardiovascular outcomes. Several mechanisms have been investigated including resistance arising from poor bioavailability, especially in clopidogrel therapy as resulting from a loss of function variant in hepatic metabolism required for prodrug activation. A limitation of studies linking on-treatment reactivity and clinical outcome is that they have been performed in high-risk patients with recent atherothrombotic disease. On-treatment platelet reactivity correlates with acuity of recent atherothrombosis, and variability in pretreatment platelet function predicts on-treatment platelet function for both aspirin and clopidogrel. It is therefore likely that high on-treatment platelet function at the time of testing may often result from underlying platelet hyperreactivity related to acute atherothrombosis, rather than true pharmacological resistance. The association of high on-treatment platelet reactivity with poor clinical outcomes may therefore be attributed to variability in underlying burden of disease instead of, or in addition to, pharmacological resistance to antiplatelet therapy.",

Those who have aspirin nonresponders have a greater risk of clinically cardiovascular events. The purpose of the study was to look for the prevalence, associated factors and the outcomes of aspirin nonresponders among patients with ischaemic stroke. Patients with ischaemic stroke who were treated during January 2011\u2013August 2011 were included. Urine 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (dTXB2) was measured to determine the response to aspirin in patients.
