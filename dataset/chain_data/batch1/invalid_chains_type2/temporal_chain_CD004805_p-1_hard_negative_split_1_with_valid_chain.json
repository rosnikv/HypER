        "abstract": "Abstract Objective : To examine the effect of a reduced sodium and increased potassium and magnesium intake on blood pressure. Design : Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. Setting : General population of a suburb of Rotterdam. Subjects : 100 men and women between 55 and 75 years of age with untreated mild to moderate hypertension. Interventions : During 24 weeks the intervention group received a mineral salt (sodium: potassium: magnesium 8:6:1) and foods prepared with the mineral salt. Controls received common salt and foods. Main outcome measure : Change in blood pressure. Results - Complete follow up was achieved for 97 of the 100 randomised subjects. Systolic blood pressure (mean of measurements at weeks 8, 16, and 24) fell by 7.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 11.2) and diastolic blood pressure by 3.3 mm Hg (0.8 to 5.8) in the mineral salt group compared with the controls, with a 28% decrease in urinary sodium excretion and a 22% increase in urinary potassium excretion. Twenty five weeks after the study the difference in blood pressure between the groups was no longer detectable. Conclusion : Replacing common sodium salt by a low sodium, high potassium, high magnesium mineral salt could offer a valuable non -pharmacological approach to lowering blood pressure in older people with mild to moderate hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To assess further the relation in Intersalt of 24 hour urinary sodium to blood pressure of individuals and populations, and the difference in blood pressure from young adulthood into middle age. Design: Standardised cross sectional study within and across populations. Setting: 52 population samples in 32 countries. Subjects: 10 074 men and women aged 20-59. Main outcome measures: Association of sodium and blood pressure from within population and cross population multiple linear regression analyses with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias. Relation of sample median daily urinary sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age. Results: In within population analyses (n=10 074), individual 24 hour urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol (for example, 170 v 70 mmol) was associated with systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher on average by 3/0 to 6/3 mm Hg (with and without body mass in analyses). Associations were larger at ages 40-59. In cross population analyses (n=52), sample median 24 hour sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol was associated with median systolic/diastolic pressure higher on average by 5-7/2-4 mm Hg, and estimated mean difference in systolic/diastolic pressure at age 55 compared with age 25 greater by 10-11/6 mm Hg. Conclusions: The strong, positive association of urinary sodium with systolic pressure of individuals concurs with Intersalt cross population findings and results of other studies. Higher urinary sodium is also associated with substantially greater differences in blood pressure in middle age compared with young adulthood. These results support recommendations for reduction of high salt intake in populations for prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels. Key messages The within population findings were previously underestimated because of incomplete correction for the regression dilution problem Revised estimates of the within population association of sodium to blood pressure in Intersalt are concordant with the cross population findings for 52 samples Estimates of the effect of median sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol/day over a 30 year period (age 55 minus age 25) were a greater difference of 10-11 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 6 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure These results lend further support to recommendations for mass reduction of high salt intake for the prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels and high blood pressure in populations",

        "abstract": "This chapter presents analyses of relations of dietary variables to blood pressure, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP), for men in the special intervention (SI) and usual care (UC) groups in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. For each dietary factor, analyses were done at baseline, for trial years 1-6, and for change from baseline to years 1-6. Analyses were done for all participants and for men receiving or not receiving antihypertensive drug treatment and were controlled for age, race, education, serum cholesterol, smoking, special diet status, and (for specific nutrients) body mass index and alcohol intake. Nutrient data for trial years 1-6, which are based on four or five dietary recalls per man, are more reliable than the baseline or change data, which are based on only one recall. Therefore, this summary focuses on data for trial years 1-6, for SI and UC men pooled. Regression analyses confirmed direct independent relations of body mass index, alcohol intake, sodium, and ratio of sodium to potassium to SBP and DBP, and an inverse relation of potassium to SBP and DBP. Dietary starch was directly related to SBP and DBP; dietary saturated fatty acid and cholesterol and Keys score were directly related to DBP; dietary magnesium, fiber, and caffeine were inversely related to SBP and DBP; and dietary protein, polyunsaturated fatty acids, the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid, and other simple carbohydrates were inversely related to DBP. Method problems, all tending to produce underestimations, are also reviewed.",

Adoption of a healthier lifestyle may have contributed to this favorable trend. Not all subgroups have benefited equally, however, particularly African Americans. According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)6 (1988 to 1991), 24% of the US population was classified as having hypertension. Blood pressure level and hypertension prevalence increase with age: high-normal and high blood pressure continue to be major contributors to cardiovascular disease.7 \n\nThe relationship between dietary electrolyte consumption and blood pressure is the focus of this brief review. Evidence for a positive association between sodium chloride (NaCl) intake and blood pressure is discussed. Increasing evidence also suggests that dietary patterns associated with low intakes of potassium, calcium, and possibly magnesium also contribute to higher levels of blood pressure. An understanding of these associations has important implications not only for the prevention and treatment of hypertension but also for developing population-based strategies to decrease cardiovascular disease risk by shifting the overall blood pressure distribution toward lower levels.\n\nA high NaCl intake convincingly contributes to elevated arterial pressure in a number of animal models of genetic and acquired hypertension.

        "abstract": "The inverse relationship between intake of dairy products and blood pressure levels was first suggested by several epidemiologic surveys in the early 1980\u2019s that revealed low calcium intake in populations with increased prevalence of hypertension. Subsequent laboratory and clinical investigations provided further evidence of the association between calcium and blood pressure, but the results of these studies were often inconsistent due to variations in study design and methods, study participants and calcium sources. The recently published results of the large and carefully executed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Study, \u201cDASH,\u201d which demonstrated a dramatic blood-pressure lowering effect of diets rich in dairy products, fruits and vegetables, addressed many of the issues contributing to the inconsistencies in the blood pressure-calcium data. In the following review, we discuss the evolution of the scientific evidence of the association between dietary calcium intake and blood pressure, the findings and significance of the DASH trial and the consensus that now exists among health professionals regarding the importance of adequate dairy product intake for optimal blood pressure regulation.",

        "abstract": "Recent clinical and biochemical evidence supporting the hypothesis that consumption of dairy products may be associated with reduced blood pressure and risk of stroke is reviewed. The two prospective studies of dairy food consumption and stroke incidence both indicate that a higher intake of dairy foods reduces risk. It is difficult to associate any one mineral in dairy products to reduction in blood pressure or stroke incidence because an appropriate metabolic balance of all three is important and because of the strong correlations among Ca, Mg and K intakes when dairy products are consumed. In fact, the evidence reviewed indicates that although K apparently has the greatest effect, all three minerals potentially contribute to blood pressure and stroke reduction, i.e., a dietary balance of all three is recommended. Milk and food products such as yogurt made from milk, which retain substantial amounts of K, Ca and Mg, are important dietary sources of all three of these minerals. In addition, milk is a low Na food, which, as seen in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) II, provides further benefit in blood pressure reduction. New studies have associated dairy food consumption with other potential mechanisms affecting stroke, mainly reduction of platelet aggregation and insulin resistance. Further research is required to explore the relationship of dairy food consumption and stroke.",

Design and setting: Questionnaires covering nutritional and sensory perceptions of three types of milk. Subjects: Three hundred and sixty-one randomly selected shoppers in Melbourne, Australia. Results: Generally, respondents held positive perceptions about milk. Milk was considered as having good sensory properties, providing a good source of nutrients, and being a convenient and safe product. However, despite these findings, misperceptions and unawareness about the nutrient content of milk were prevalent. Negative perceptions were most common for whole milk and were mostly related to its perceived high fat, cholesterol and energy contents. Soy milk received lower ratings on sensory quality and convenience than dairy milk. There were few sociodemographic differences in consumers' perceptions. Although reduced-fat milk consumption was more frequent among elderly people and type of milk consumption was related to parenthood, no other significant effects of demographic variables were found on the consumption of specific milk types. Conclusion: Although positive perceptions were common, negative perceptions and misperceptions appear to be prevalent, presenting a challenge for nutrition education. Sociodemographic factors were not shown to be important predictors of perceptions and type of milk consumption.",

        "abstract": "The global markets are increasingly being integrated due to globalization and liberalisation. Drastic changes prompted by technological change are daily transpiring in the agricultural produce marketing which put smallholder farmers\u2019market survival at stake. The notable changes are manifested in terms of value addition and product differentiation. This study was undertaken to identify factors that determine milk value chain choice amongst smallholder dairy in Iringa and Tanga urban. The specific objectives were: to assess and compare profitability between informal and formal milk value chain participants; examining factors that influence choice of milk marketing channels/outlets among smallholder dairy farmers. Purposive and random sampling techniques were employed in selecting 160 smallholder dairy farmers and 62 middlemen. Both descriptive and quantitave techniques (Gross Margin and Multinomial Logistic Regression) were used in data analysis. The enterprises\u2019 profitability between dairy farmers selling milk through the informal and formal milk channels was statistically different (P< 0.05), implying thatinformal milk channel is shown significantly being more profitable than the formal channel, with a mean difference of 385.00 TZSper litre. The Multinomial Logistic results show that, the highly statistically significant variables at 1% (P<0.01) level of significance are the price offered per litre of milk, family size of household, education level of household head, sex of household head, volume of milk produced, and access to credits. These findings suggest that an adjustment in each one of the significant variables can significantly influence the probability of participation in either formal or informal marketing channels. In view of research findings, several policy proposals are suggested. These include offering reasonable prices price per litre of milk, propelling collective actions, provision of non-price incentives, re-structuring existing dairy institutional arrangements,establishing milk collection centers,encouraging value addition (adoption of best upgrading practices) and investment in dairy processing (empowering SMEs).",

        "abstract": "Agriculture accounts for 33.3% of total GDP, 78% of total exports and more than 70% of total employment to the Ethiopian economy (NBE, 2019; USDA, 2019). Development of smallholder crops and pastoral agriculture will be further enhanced and hence will remain the main source of growth and rural transformation during the GTP II period (NPC, 2016). However, development of the agricultural sector has been hampered by a range of constraints which include land degradation, low technological inputs, weak institutions, and lack of appropriate and effective agricultural policies and strategies (Aklilu, 2015). Ethiopia is known to be the birthplace for coffee. Coffee is the major export commodity cultivated in Ethiopia. Coffee grown in Ethiopia is known all over the world for its excellent quality and flavour. Today, Ethiopia stands as the biggest coffee producer and exporter in Africa and also ranks amongst the leading producers and exporters in the world. According to NBE (2019) report, export earnings from coffee grew by 13.5 percent over last year same quarter due to 36.0 percent increase in export volume despite a 16.5 percent decline in the international price; coffee\u2019s contribution to total export earnings remained close to 32 percent. There are structural changes taking place in the coffee export sector in Ethiopia. Cooperatives and commercial farms are on the increase, with lower concentration ratios in the export sector. On the other hand, the share of the incumbents in the local coffee market is large. While the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which was established in 2008, introduced regulatory, institutional, and organisational innovations in the coffee market, informal norms and conventions remain the primary institutions governing transactions in the local markets (Fekadu et al., 2016). An efficient, integrated, and accurately responsive market mechanism is of critical importance for optimal allocation of resources in agriculture and for stimulating farmers to increase output. A total area of 6,606.55 ha was allocated for coffee production (in 2016/17 meher season) in Arsi Zone (CSA, 2017) and Gololcha district is found on the 14th from top 18 coffee producing districts in Oromia (Warner et al., 2015). A total area of 13,466 Ha of land was allocated for production and 35,750 quintals of coffee clean bean was obtained in 2018 (GDOoANR, 2018). However, the study conducted by Degaga et al. (2017) showed farmers in the study area sold dried cherries to local traders at a low price which could not cover their cost of production. Various studies on coffee producers\u2019 market outlet choices (Diro et al., 2017; Engida, 2017; Negeri, 2017; and Asefa et al., 2016) were conducted in different parts of the country. However, past studies conducted on different regions of Ethiopia, did not address the market outlet choice decision of coffee producers in the study area. Therefore, given the potential of Gololcha District for coffee production, the results of this study are of real importance as they shed light on factors affecting the choice of appropriate market outlets. Hence, this study has aimed to identify the determinants of market outlet choice decision of coffee producers in the study area.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the factors influencing garlic producers\u2019 market outlet selection decisions in Goncha Siso Enese District, Ethiopia. A total of 359 garlic producer households were polled, and the results were analyzed using a multivariate probit (MVP) model. According to the MVP model results, extension contact, access to market information, quantity of garlic sold, and farm experience in farming were negatively and significantly associated with the choice of consumer outlet. Besides this, the estimated MVP for retailer outlet choice is positively influenced by the amount of quantity sold, and farm experiences in garlic have a significant and positive effect on the choice of retailer outlets. In contrast, education level, access to credit, extension contact, and land area allocated for garlic have a negative influence on the choice of retail outlet. Moreover, wholesaler outlet choice is significantly and positively influenced by education level, access to credit, amount of quantity sold, extension contact, and distance to market, whereas it is negatively influenced by lagged price. Assembler outlet is also positively influenced by sex, distance to market, access to market information, and quantity sold, and negatively affected by extension contact and lag price. The implication is that, if smallholder garlic producers have access to alternative market outlets, they must select an appropriate combination of market outlets to maximize their income in the long run. It is suggested that equal access to marketing infrastructure in potential production areas, the garlic production system, and rural-urban development infrastructure should be improved and made more accessible.",

The average yield in the region was lower than its potential, indicating a need to improve farming practices. Data were collected from 359 garlic producers using random sampling. The Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production function was used to estimate technical efficiency, which was found to be 73%. This means that about 27% of potential garlic output was lost due to inefficiency. Factors such as land size, seed, fertilizer, insecticide, and oxen days were found to have a positive and significant impact on garlic production. On the other hand, factors like age, extension contact, distance, renting land, garlic disease shock, access to finance, and access to information were linked to technical inefficiency. The study suggests that investing in high-quality seeds, improved farming inputs, and access to information can enhance garlic output by leveraging its high efficiency level.",

The Cobb-Douglass production function and the stochastic frontier analysis were used to determine the factors influencing garlic production, the technical efficiency level, and the determinants of technical inefficiency. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation was used to analyse the data. The level of technical efficiency at various levels of standard operating procedures adoption was measured using descriptive statistical analysis. Farm size, seeds, urea and NPK fertiliser, herbicides, yellow sticky traps, family labour, mulch, and farmers\u2019 participation in garlic development programs significantly affected garlic production. The technical efficiency varied within 0.37-0.99, with a mean of 0.71. Farmers\u2019 practices and standard operating procedure adoption significantly reduced technical inefficiency. Generally, the level of standard operating procedure adoption is moderate. In the high standard operating procedure adoption group, the mean technical efficiency is 0.77, while in the moderate level group, it is 0.68. The findings of this study can be used as a model for other garlic-importing countries to enhance production and strengthen food security",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it also investigates the technical efficiency of garlic production using the stochastic frontier approach. However, it focuses on a different aspect, namely the adoption of standard operating procedures, and is conducted in a different region, Indonesia."
