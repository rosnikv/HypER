        "title": "Low-Dose Prednisone Therapy for Patients with Early Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: Clinical Efficacy, Disease-Modifying Properties, and Side Effects: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial",
        "abstract": "Drug treatment for rheumatoid arthritis usually consists of a combination of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (for example, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, gold salt, or a combination). New biological agents, such as tumor necrosis factor- blocking agents and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists, appear promising (1, 2). Glucocorticoids have had a special place in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis since the publication of the report by Hench and coworkers showing that cortisone dramatically alleviated the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting inflammation (3). This period of enthusiasm in the 1950s was followed by a long period in which glucocorticoids were applied cautiously for rheumatoid arthritis because of their many side effects and the recognition that inhibition of inflammation is not necessarily associated with retardation of joint damage (4). Ongoing research on glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis focused on both inflammation and joint damage. Some recent studies showed that glucocorticoids reduced the progression of joint damage when added to therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These findings suggested that glucocorticoids might also have disease-modifying properties. If this could be confirmed, glucocorticoids might be used more often, especially since potential serious adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy are more easily managed today (5). Secondary osteoporosis is inhibited by potent bisphosphonates, and gastrointestinal complications of glucocorticoid therapy, especially in combination with NSAIDs, can be reduced by misoprostol, proton-pump inhibitors, or cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs. As yet, disease-modifying properties of low-dose glucocorticoids as monotherapy for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis have not been investigated. The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical efficacy, disease-modifying properties, and side effects of low-dose glucocorticoids as monotherapy for previously untreated patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Patients From October 1992 through October 1995, all consecutive outpatients at the rheumatology departments of the Deventer and Zutphen Hospitals, the Netherlands, who were at least 18 years of age and had early previously untreated rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration < 1 year) that satisfied classification criteria were invited to participate in the study [6]. To be included, patients had to have active disease, which was defined as the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: 1) early-morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes or longer, 2) 28-joint score for tenderness and 28-joint score for swelling of 3 or more, and 3) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 28 mm or higher after 1 hour (7, 8). Exclusion criteria were contraindications to prednisone or NSAIDs, active gastrointestinal problems, serious complicating diseases, severe hypertension, hemorrhagic diathesis, treatment with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs, alcohol or drug abuse, and psychiatric or mental problems. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before participation. Of the 118 eligible patients, 37 declined to participate (Figure 1). Figure 1. Trial profile. Intervention Pharmacy personnel at Deventer Hospital used a computer-generated randomization procedure to randomly assign the 81 participating patients, in blocks of 10, to one of two treatment groups. One group received two tablets of prednisone, 5 mg, once daily at breakfast, and one group received placebo. The pharmacology department at Deventer Hospital prepared and labeled the prednisone and placebo tablets, which were identical in shape and color, and distributed them to patients in unlabeled boxes. Only the pharmacist could access the allocation table. Both groups of patients received 500 mg of elementary calcium in the evening. The code of randomization was broken after 2 years of treatment, and the prednisone dosage was tapered. Surplus tablets of the study medication were counted at every visit, and adherence was satisfactory (96%). Use of NSAIDs was not regulated. Local glucocorticoid injections were permitted only when absolutely necessary. Physical therapy and additional use of paracetamol were allowed. After 6 months, sulfasalazine (2 g/d) could be prescribed as rescue medication. The decision to add sulfasalazine was made on clinical grounds (activity of rheumatoid arthritis). Design and Setting The ethics committees of the University Medical Center Utrecht and the Deventer and Zutphen Hospitals approved the trial. The study was considered ethically acceptable when it was designed (19891991); later, however, it became clear that irreversible joint damage is an early feature of rheumatoid arthritis. With our present knowledge, it would probably be considered unethical to compare the effects of prednisone and placebo in patients who did not receive a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for at least 6 months. In our study, sulfasalazine could be prescribed as rescue medication only after 6 months to avoid obscuring the effects of prednisone monotherapy. Measurements All clinical outcome measurements, except those for disability and radiologic outcomes, were performed at baseline and every 3 months. Disability, which was assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and radiologic outcomes were measured every 6 months. Early-morning stiffness was recorded in minutes (maximum, 720 minutes). Morning pain and general well-being were assessed on a horizontal visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm, with 0 representing the best score (no problems) and 100 representing the worst score. Swelling and tenderness were assessed with the 28-joint score (7, 8). Grip strength was measured in kPa with a vigorimeter (range, 0 to 200 kPa); the mean of three measurements was calculated for each hand. Disability was assessed with a validated Dutch version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Vragenlijst Dagelijks Functioneren) (9), which had a range of 0 to 3 (0 represented the best score [no problems], and 3 represented the worst score). Serum C-reactive protein level was measured in mg/L. To investigate the possible sparing effect of the trial medication, we recorded the use of NSAIDs and analgesics, the frequency of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, and the use of physiotherapy. The patients recorded the use of NSAIDs, analgesics, and physical therapy in standardized patient diaries. To calculate the use of NSAIDs and to compare different NSAIDs, we arbitrarily chose naproxen as a reference. One thousand mg of naproxen was defined as 1 unit and was considered to be approximately equivalent to 600 mg of azapropazone, 100 mg of diclofenac, 200 mg of flurbiprofen, 1600 mg of ibuprofen, 100 mg of indomethacin, 200 mg of ketoprofen, 15 mg of meloxicam, 1000 mg of nabumetone, 20 mg of piroxicam, and 600 mg of tiaprofenic acid. Every 3 months, the first author recorded use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Radiologic outcome measures were erosions, joint space narrowing, and the total score for both (range, 0 to 448). The total score is the sum of the erosions and narrowing scores in 44 joints in the hands and feet, assessed on plain radiography and scored with the van der Heijde modification of the Sharp method (10, 11). Radiologic outcome measures also included the number of patients with erosive disease in each group and the number of radiologically affected joints per patient. Radiographs were taken at entry and every 6 months. An assistant prepared the radiographs to be read, and all identifying patient data on the radiographs were concealed from the readers. The readers had no knowledge of patient identity when they scored the radiographs. Radiographs were read in random patient order and were scored for each patient in temporal order. Scoring in temporal order clearly has advantages, as a comparative study has shown (11). However, with this method, scores can either be stable or increase; a decrease (indicating improvement) is not possible. The first author and an independent radiologist viewed all available radiographs at one center. When the readers' total scores for individual cases differed by 25% or more, agreement was reached through discussion. Joint damage was defined as a score that exceeded 0. To correct for possible differences between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who developed little or no joint damage, we also analyzed data only from patients who developed joint damage. Furthermore, radiologic damage was also analyzed with a cutoff point of 4 modified Sharp units. A score of 0 to 3 was interpreted as no damage, and scores of 4 or greater were interpreted as joint damage. This cutoff point seems to reflect clinically relevant change (12) and was also used in our study to define erosive rheumatoid arthritis. At the start of the study and every 3 months for 2 years, standardized lists were used to document adverse effects. We noted the occurrence of infections and the use of antibiotics; the latter was checked at the patient's pharmacy. For hypertension, the first author used a single device to measure blood pressure in mm Hg. For steroid diabetes, serum glucose level was measured in mmol/L. Hyperglycemia was defined according to the World Health Organization standard: postprandial, a glucose level of at least 11.0 mmol/L (198 mg/dL), and fasting, at least 6.6 mmol/L (119 mg/dL). Urinary glucose level was measured by using a semiquantitative method (dipstick). A value less than 2.7 mmol/L (49 mg/dL) was considered negative, a value of 2.7 to 5.5 mmol/L (50 to 99 mg/dL) was considered a trace, a value of 5.6 to 16.6 mmol/L (100 to 299 mg/dL) was considered 1+, a value of 16.7 to 54.9 mmol/L (300 to 989 mg/dL) was considered 2+, and a value of 55 mmol/L or greater ( 990 mg/dL) was considered 3+.

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the impact of the combination of infliximab plus methotrexate (MTX) on the progression of structural damage in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Subanalyses were carried out on data for patients with early RA in the Anti-TNF Therapy in RA with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) study, in which 428 patients with active RA despite MTX therapy received placebo with MTX (MTX-only) or infliximab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every (q) 4 or 8 weeks with MTX (infliximab plus MTX) for 102 weeks. Early RA was defined as disease duration of 3 years or less; 82 of the 428 patients (19%) met this definition. Structural damage was assessed with the modified van der Heijde-Sharp score. The changes from baseline to week 102 in total modified van der Heijde-Sharp score were compared between the infliximab plus MTX groups and the MTX-only group. Results: The erosion and joint space narrowing scores from baseline to week 102 in the cohort of patients with early RA decreased significantly in each infliximab dose regimen compared with the MTX-only regimen. Consistent benefit was seen in the joints of both hands and feet. Conclusions: Infliximab combined with MTX inhibited the progression of structural damage in patients with early RA during the 2 year period of treatment. Early intervention with infliximab in patients with active RA despite MTX therapy may provide long term benefits by preventing radiographic progression and preserving joint integrity.",

We undertook this study to compare clinical and radiographic outcomes of 4 different treatment strategies, with intense monitoring in all patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, 508 patients were allocated to 1 of 4 treatment strategies: sequential disease-modifying antirheumatic drug monotherapy (group 1), step-up combination therapy (group 2), initial combination therapy with tapered high-dose prednisone (group 3), and initial combination therapy with the tumor necrosis factor antagonist infliximab (group 4). Treatment adjustments were made every 3 months in an effort to obtain low disease activity (a Disease Activity Score in 44 joints of < or =2.4).\n\n\nRESULTS\nInitial combination therapy including either prednisone (group 3) or infliximab (group 4) resulted in earlier functional improvement than did sequential monotherapy (group 1) and step-up combination therapy (group 2), with mean scores at 3 months on the Dutch version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (D-HAQ) of 1.0 in groups 1 and 2 and 0.6 in groups 3 and 4 (P < 0.001). After 1 year, mean D-HAQ scores were 0.7 in groups 1 and 2 and 0.5 in groups 3 and 4 (P = 0.009).

        "abstract": "Objectives Evaluation of long-term safety of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Pooled observed case analysis of data from patients with moderate-to-severe, active RA treated with rituximab in a global clinical trial programme. Results As of September 2010, 3194 patients had received up to 17 rituximab courses over 9.5\u2005years (11\u2005962 patient-years). Of these, 627 had >5 years\u2019 follow-up (4418 patient-years). A pooled placebo population (n=818) (placebo+methotrexate (MTX)) was also analysed. Serious adverse event and infection rates generally remained stable over time and multiple courses. The overall serious infection event (SIE) rate was 3.94/100 patient-years (3.26/100 patient-years in patients observed for >5\u2005years) and was comparable with placebo+MTX (3.79/100 patient-years). Serious opportunistic infections were rare. Overall, 22.4% (n=717) of rituximab-treated patients developed low immunoglobulin (Ig)M and 3.5% (n=112) low IgG levels for \u22654\u2005months after \u22651 course. SIE rates were similar before and during/after development of low Ig levels; however, in patients with low IgG, rates were higher than in patients who never developed low IgG. Rates of myocardial infarction and stroke were consistent with rates in the general RA population. No increased risk of malignancy over time was observed. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that rituximab remains generally well tolerated over time and multiple courses, with a safety profile consistent with published data and clinical trial experience. Overall, the findings indicate that there was no evidence of an increased safety risk or increased reporting rates of any types of adverse events with prolonged exposure to rituximab during the 9.5\u2005years of observation.",

However, even when patients receive maintenance treatment with azathioprine or methotrexate, the relapse rate remains high. Rituximab may help to maintain remission.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with newly diagnosed or relapsing granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, or renal-limited ANCA-associated vasculitis in complete remission after a cyclophosphamide-glucocorticoid regimen were randomly assigned to receive either 500 mg of rituximab on days 0 and 14 and at months 6, 12, and 18 after study entry or daily azathioprine until month 22. The primary end point at month 28 was the rate of major relapse (the reappearance of disease activity or worsening, with a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score >0, and involvement of one or more major organs, disease-related life-threatening events, or both).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 115 enrolled patients (87 with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 23 with microscopic polyangiitis, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated vasculitis) received azathioprine (58 patients) or rituximab (57 patients). At month 28, major relapse had occurred in 17 patients in the azathioprine group (29%) and in 3 patients in the rituximab group (5%) (hazard ratio for relapse, 6.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.56 to 27.96; P=0.002). The frequencies of severe adverse events were similar in the two groups. Twenty-five patients in each group (P=0.92) had severe adverse events; there were 44 events in the azathioprine group and 45 in the rituximab group. Eight patients in the azathioprine group and 11 in the rituximab group had severe infections, and cancer developed in 2 patients in the azathioprine group and 1 in the rituximab group.

        "abstract": "The prognosis of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitides (AAV), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and eosinophilic GPA (EGPA), has been fundamentally improved over the last five decades by the use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, turning them from consistently fatal diseases into chronic conditions. The long-term course is now largely determined by the frequency of disease flares and by accruing damage caused by disease activity and treatment-related comorbidities. This review summarizes the evidence derived from clinical trials performed during the last 30 years and the remaining clinical unmet needs that new studies aim to address. In MPA and GPA, ongoing studies assess (i) different strategies to reduce cumulative glucocorticoid doses currently used for induction and maintenance of remission, (ii) the efficacy of new drugs and (iii) the optimal duration of immunosuppression and the use of biomarkers to individualize therapy. Prospective randomized trials also target disease-associated cardiovascular risk and infections. The first prospective controlled trials specifically designed for EGPA have recently been launched and could lead to new therapeutic options for patients diagnosed with this rare disease. This is an exciting time for researchers in the field of AAV, and for patients as collaborative efforts raise the hope of developing new therapies and more individualized approaches to the management of the diseases, maximizing efficacy while minimizing treatment toxicities.",

        "title": "Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis): Evolving Concepts in Treatment",
        "abstract": "Abstract Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly termed Wegener's granulomatosis, is the most common of the pulmonary vasculitides. GPA typically involves the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract (bronchi and lung), and kidney, with varying degrees of disseminated vasculitis. Cardinal histologic features include a necrotizing vasculitis involving small vessels, extensive \u201cgeographic\u201d necrosis, and granulomatous inflammation. The spectrum and severity of the disease is heterogeneous, ranging from indolent disease involving only one site to fulminant, multiorgan vasculitis. Circulating antibodies against cytoplasmic components of neutrophils (ANCAs) play a role in the pathogenesis, and often correlate with activity of the disease. Treatment strategies are evolving. Cyclophosphamide (CYC) plus corticosteroids was the mainstay of therapy for generalized, multisystemic GPA since the 1970s. However, within the past decade, rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody directed against B cells, has been shown to be at least as effective (and possibly more effective) as CYC. Furthermore, the use of RTX may reduce the need for maintenance immunosuppression. Optimal therapy for GPA remains controversial, and additional studies are required to determine the role and duration of maintenance therapy following successful induction therapy.",

        "title": "Cranial Base Manifestations of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis",
        "abstract": "Objective Although granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis) is classically characterized by systemic disease involving the kidneys and airway, approximately 10% of patients who have it present with isolated central nervous system disease. When involving the skull base, GPA frequently mimics more common pathology, resulting in diagnostic challenges and delay. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the cranial base manifestations of GPA, highlighting aspects most relevant to the skull base surgeon. Study Design Retrospective review. Setting Tertiary academic referral center. Subjects and Methods Retrospective analysis of all patients with skull base GPA treated at a tertiary referral center from January 1, 1996, to May 1, 2018. Results Twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one (72%) initially presented with skull base symptomatology as their cardinal manifestation of GPA. Twenty-four (82%) presented with cranial neuropathy at some point in their disease course. The trigeminal nerve was most commonly involved (12 of 24, 50%), followed by the facial (11 of 24, 46%) and optic (8 of 24, 33%) nerves. Eighteen patients reported hearing loss attributed to the GPA disease process, presenting as conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. The most common locations for GPA-derived inflammatory skull base disease on imaging included the cavernous sinus (12 of 29, 41%) and the orbit (7 of 29, 24%). Conclusion Establishing the diagnosis of skull base GPA remains challenging. Cranial neuropathy is diverse in presentation and often mimics more common conditions. Imaging findings are also unpredictable and frequently nonspecific. Careful review of patient history, clinical presentation, serology and biopsy results, and imaging can reveal important clues toward the diagnosis.",

        "title": "From Head to Toe: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis.",
        "abstract": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. It is an uncommon multisystem disease involving predominantly small vessels and is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. GPA can involve virtually any organ. Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and can be classified as granulomatous (eg, ear, nose, and throat disease; lung nodules or masses; retro-orbital tumors; pachymeningitis) or vasculitic (eg, glomerulonephritis, alveolar hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex, scleritis). The diagnosis of GPA relies on a combination of clinical findings, imaging study results, laboratory test results, serologic markers, and histopathologic results. Radiology has a crucial role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with GPA. CT and MRI are the primary imaging modalities used to evaluate GPA manifestations, allowing the differentiation of GPA from other diseases that could simulate GPA. The authors review the main clinical, histopathologic, and imaging features of GPA to address the differential diagnosis in the affected organs and provide a panoramic picture of the protean manifestations of this infrequent disease. The heterogeneous manifestations of GPA pose a significant challenge in the diagnosis of this rare condition. By recognizing the common and unusual imaging findings, radiologists play an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with GPA and aid clinicians in the differentiation of disease activity versus disease-induced damage, which ultimately affects therapeutic decisions.

        "title": "Cutaneous Deep Ulcerations as Initial Presentations of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Two Case Reports and Differential Diagnosis",
        "abstract": "Background: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody (ANCA)-associated small-vessel vasculitis characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Symptoms of skin involvement can appear in 30\u201350% of patients with GPA, and may present as the initial presentation. Case Presentation: We describe two patients who presented with multiple deep, large, nonhealing skin ulcers postoperatively with purulent drainage and fever. Both patients were diagnosed with GPA after an extensive evaluation, including histopathology. Infectious, connective tissue disease and malignant etiologies were excluded. Their cANCA and PR3-ANCA levels were positive. Patient 2 was diagnosed early and recovered well after treatment with corticosteroids and rituximab; however, Patient 1 had a poor prognosis due to a long disease course. Conclusions: Diseases with multiple deep, large skin ulcers and fever can be infectious or noninfectious. Atypical manifestations may lead to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. GPA may initially present in a localized form before progressing to a generalized disease. The two cases we have highlighted will prompt clinicians to nevertheless call for a low threshold for diagnosis.",
