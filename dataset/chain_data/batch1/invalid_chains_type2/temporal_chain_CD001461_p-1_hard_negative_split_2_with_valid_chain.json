        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nType B fibroblastic synoviocytes are abundant in inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and can secrete cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether cell lines derived from RA type B synoviocytes could also serve as accessory cells for T lymphocyte activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCells from RA synoviocyte lines, with or without preculture in interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), were cultured with purified peripheral blood T cells, in the presence or absence of superantigens or other accessory cell-dependent T cell mitogens. T cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation, and synoviocyte surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA type B synoviocyte lines were potent accessory cells for T cell responses to bacterial superantigens or lectins, and direct cell-cell contact was required. Preculture in IFN gamma augmented synoviocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and of ligands for some T cell costimulatory receptors, but synoviocyte accessory cell function was evident even in the absence of IFN gamma. Blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies supported the notion of a role CD2, CD11a/CD18 and MHC class II molecules in synoviocyte-dependent T cell activation. Monoclonal antibodies against IFN gamma, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha failed to block the T cell proliferative responses, but anti-IL-2 was strongly inhibitory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCultured RA and type B synoviocytes can perform some of the functions of professional antigen-presenting cells. If such cells have similar properties in vivo, they may be important participants in activation of immune responses, in addition to their previously described synthetic and proinflammatory roles. If RA synovial tissue T cells, like normal peripheral blood T cells, can respond to superantigens presented by synoviocytes, this interaction could be important in the pathogenesis of RA.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

MTB and MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibit class II MHC (MHC-II) expression and Ag processing by a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent mechanism that is shown in this study to involve a defect in IFN-\u03b3 induction of class II transactivator (CIITA). Exposure of macrophages to MTB or MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced MHC-II expression, but not IL-4-induced MHC-II expression, by preventing induction of mRNA for CIITA (total, type I, and type IV), IFN regulatory factor-1, and MHC-II.

        "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

        "abstract": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 is a critical negative regulator of cytokine signaling and is induced by Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Gue\u0301rin (M. bovis BCG) in mouse macrophages. However, little is known about the early receptor proximal signaling mechanisms underlying mycobacteria-mediated induction of SOCS3. We demonstrate here for the first time that M. bovis BCG up-regulates NOTCH1 and activates the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, leading to the expression of SOCS3. We show that perturbing Notch signaling in infected macrophages results in the marked reduction in the expression of SOCS3. Furthermore, enforced expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in RAW 264.7 macrophages induces the expression of SOCS3, which can be further potentiated by M. bovis BCG. The perturbation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling resulted in marked reduction in SOCS3 levels and expression of the NOTCH1 target gene, Hes1. The down-regulation of MyD88 resulted in a significant decrease in SOCS3 expression, implicating the role of the TLR2-MyD88 axis in M. bovis BCG-triggered signaling. However, the SOCS3 inducing ability of M. bovis BCG remains unaltered also upon infection of macrophages from TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice. More importantly, signaling perturbation data suggest the involvement of cross-talk among members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades with NOTCH1 signaling in SOCS3 expression. Furthermore, SOCS3 expression requires the NOTCH1-mediated recruitment of Suppressor of Hairless (CSL) and nuclear factor-\u03baBtothe Socs3 promoter. Overall, these results implicate NOTCH1 signaling during inducible expression of SOCS3 following infection of macrophages with an intracellular bacillus-like M. bovis BCG.",

        "abstract": "Expression of the cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 (CIS) protein and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins represents an important element of host cell reactions in response to infection. We have demonstrated previously that Cryptosporidium parvum infection down-regulates microRNA-98 (miR-98) and let-7 to induce CIS expression in biliary epithelial cells. We report here that down-regulation of miR-98 and let-7 also coordinates epithelial expression of SOCS4 after C. parvum infection. Targeting of the SOCS4 3' untranslated region by miR-98 or let-7 resulted in translational repression. Functional manipulation of miR-98 caused reciprocal alterations in SOCS4 protein expression. Transfection of miR-98 precursor abolished C. parvum-stimulated SOCS4 up-regulation. Moreover, expression of SOCS4 in epithelial cells showed an inhibitory effect on phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins induced by C. parvum. These data suggest that miRNAs play an important role in the coordinated regulation of CIS and SOCS expression in epithelial cells in response to C. parvum infection.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs have emerged as key regulators of immune responses. They influence immune cells' function and probably the outcome of several infections. Currently, it is largely unknown if helminth parasites and their antigens modify host microRNAs expression. The aim of this study was to explore if excreted/secreted antigens of Taenia crassiceps regulate LPS-induced miRNAs expression in human Dendritic Cells. We found that these antigens repressed LPS-let-7i induction but not mir-146a or mir-155 and this correlates with a diminished inflammatory response. This let-7i downregulation in Dendritic Cells constitutes a novel feature of the modulatory activity that helminth-derived antigens exert on their host.",

        "abstract": "Helminth parasites are highly successful pathogens, chronically infecting a quarter of the world's population, causing significant morbidity but rarely causing death. Protective immunity and expulsion of helminths is mediated by T\u2010helper 2 (Th2) cells, type 2 (M2) macrophages, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and eosinophils. Failure to mount these type 2 immune responses can result in immunopathology mediated by Th1 or Th17 cells. Helminths have evolved a wide variety of approaches for immune suppression, especially the generation of regulatory T cells and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines interleukin\u201010 and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2. This is a very effective strategy for subverting protective immune responses to prolong their survival in the host but has the bystander effect of modulating immune responses to unrelated antigens. Epidemiological studies in humans have shown that infection with helminth parasites is associated with a low incidence of allergy/asthma and autoimmunity in developing countries. Experimental studies in mice have demonstrated that regulatory immune responses induced by helminth can suppress Th2 and Th1/Th17 responses that mediate allergy and autoimmunity, respectively. This has provided a rational explanation of the \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 and has also led to the exploitation of helminths or their immunomodulatory products in the development of new immunosuppressive therapies for inflammatory diseases in humans.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies in humans have demonstrated that infection with helminth parasites is associated with a reduced risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Mechanistic studies in mice have linked the protective effect of helminths on autoimmunity to the suppressive activity of helminth-induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) or Th2 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of mice with Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory products (FHES) attenuated the clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Protection was associated with a significant reduction in the infiltration of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells into the brain. Although FHES enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine and Th2 responses, protection against EAE was independent of IL-4, IL-10, and Tregs. However, administration of FHES induced production of the type 2 cytokines IL-33 and IL-5, which promoted accumulation of eosinophils. FHES-induced expansion of eosinophils and protection against EAE was lost in IL-33\u2212/\u2212 mice and upon neutralization of IL-5. Furthermore, transfer of FHES-induced or IL-33\u2013induced eosinophils conferred protection against EAE. In addition, treatment of mice with recombinant IL-33 attenuated autoimmunity, and this was dependent on IL-5. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report a role for helminth-induced IL-5 and IL-33 in protection against autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "Helminth infection induces Th2-biased immune responses and inhibitory/regulatory pathways that minimize excessive inflammation to facilitate the chronic infection of helminth in the host and in the meantime, prevent host hypersensitivity from autoimmune or atopic diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms behind modulation on inflammatory diseases are yet to be clarified. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is one of the important inhibitory receptors involved in the balance of host immune responses during chronic infection. Here, we used the murine model to examine the role of PD-1 in CD4+ T cells in the effects of Trichinella spiralis infection on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mice infected with T. spiralis demonstrated higher expression of PD-1 in the spleen CD4+ T cells than those without infection. Mice infected with T. spiralis 2\u2009weeks prior to being immunized with type II collagen displayed lower arthritis incidence and significantly attenuated pathology of CIA compared with those of uninfected mice. The therapeutic effect of T. spiralis infection on CIA was reversed by blocking PD-1 with anti-PD-1 antibody, associated with enhanced Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory responses and reduced Th2 responses. The role of PD-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell differentiation and proliferation during T. spiralis infection was further examined in PD-1 knockout (PD-1\u2212/\u2212) C57BL/6 J mice. Interestingly, T. spiralis-induced alteration of attenuated Th1 and enhanced Th2/regulatory T cell differentiation in wild-type (WT) mice was effectively diminished in PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice characterized by recovered Th1 cytokine levels, reduced levels of Th2 and regulatory cytokines and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells. Moreover, T. spiralis-induced CD4+ T cell proliferation suppression in WT mice was partially restored in PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. This study introduces the first evidence that PD-1 plays a critical role in helminth infection-attenuated CIA in a mouse model by regulating the CD4+ T cell function, which may provide the new insights into the mechanisms of helminth-induced immunomodulation of host autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "Helminth-modulated macrophages contribute to attenuating inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases. The programmed death 1 (PD-1) plays an important role in macrophage polarization and is essential in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. Here, we investigate the role of PD-1-mediated polarization of M2 macrophages and the protective effects of excretory/secretory products from Trichinella spiralis adult worms (AES) on DSS-induced colitis in mice. Colitis in mice was induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) daily. Mice with DSS-induced colitis were treated with T. spiralis AES intraperitoneally, and pathological manifestations were evaluated. Macrophages in mice were depleted with liposomal clodronate. Markers for M1-type (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1) and M2-type (CD206, Arg-1) macrophages were detected by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Macrophage expression of PD-1 was quantified by flow cytometry; RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages were used for in vitro tests, and PD-1 gene knockout mice were used for in vivo investigation of the role of PD-1 in AES-induced M2 macrophage polarization. Macrophage depletion was found to reduce DSS-induced colitis in mice. Treatment with T. spiralis AES significantly increased macrophage expression of CD206 and Arg-1 and simultaneously attenuated colitis severity. We found T. spiralis AES to enhance M2 macrophage polarization; these findings were confirmed studying in vitro cultures of RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages from mice. Further experimentation revealed that AES upregulated PD-1 expression, primarily on M2 macrophages expressing CD206. The AES-induced M2 polarization was found to be decreased in PD-1 deficient macrophages, and the therapeutic effects of AES on colitis was reduced in PD-1 knockout mice. In conclusion, the protective effects of T. spiralis AES on DSS-induced colitis were found to associate with PD-1 upregulation and M2 macrophage polarization. Thus, PD-1-mediated M2 macrophage polarization is a key mechanism of helminth-induced modulation of the host immune system.",

        "title": "Therapeutic Efficacy of Excretory-Secretory Products of Trichinella spiralis Adult Worms on Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury in a Mouse Model",
        "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication of systemic inflammation or sepsis with high morbidity and mortality. Although many studies have confirmed that helminth-derived proteins had strong immunomodulatory functions and could be used to treat inflammatory diseases, there is no report on the therapeutic effect of excretory-secretory products of Trichinella spiralis adult worms (Ts-AES) on sepsis-induced ALI. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of Ts-AES on sepsis-induced ALI and the underlying immunological mechanism and the signaling pathway were investigated. The results indicated that after being treated with Ts-AES, the survival rate of mice with CLP-induced sepsis was significantly increased to 50% for 72 hours after CLP surgery compared to PBS control group with all mice died. The sepsis-induced ALI was largely mitigated characterized by reduced inflammation cell infiltration and pathological changes in lung tissue, with decreased lung injury scores and lung wet/dry weight ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of Ts-AES is associated with stimulated Tregs response with increased regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2). The expression of HMGB1, TLR2 and MyD88 in lung tissue was inhibited after treatment of Ts-AES. Our results demonstrated that Ts-AES play an important role in immunomodulation and confer a therapeutic effect on sepsis-induced ALI through inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activation of Tregs and increased level of regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 are possibly involved in the immunomodulatory functions of Ts-AES through HMGB1/TLR2/MyD88 signal pathway. The findings suggest Ts-AES is a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced ALI and other inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "As of 31 December 2021, COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, had been confirmed in more than 285 million people worldwide, with more than 5.4 million dead resulting in a case fatality ratio of 1.89%. This figure is likely to be vastly underestimated, as a proportion was not registered officially as COVID-19-related/excess deaths. The United States recorded the highest number (54,656,866) of confirmed cases. In Africa, there are 47 countries affected, with 7,065,972 cumulative cases and 155,081 deaths were recorded by 31 Dec 2021 (WHO African Region numbers at a glance). To date, the currently approved vaccines have been effective in preventing COVID-19, particularly in regards to severe symptoms (1). However, several immune escape mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and the rapid emergence of mutated variants (2) pose a great challenge to the efficacy of these vaccines. Patients with severe COVID-19 tend to have a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, TNF-a, CXCL10, MCP1, and MIP1a) (3), suggesting that a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (4) (also loosely referred to as a cytokine storm), which is a form of life-threatening systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), can often feature in severe COVID-19 infections. Among the increased levels of inflammatory mediators in COVID-19 patients, the plasma levels of IL-6, an amplifier in the cytokine storm, are significantly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors (5). The main cause of death of COVID-19 is due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with this high severity being dependent on the cytokine storm. Sepsis has been defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (6). Endothelium damage, vascular permeability, microvascular dysfunction, coagulation pathway activation, and impaired tissue oxygenation occur during sepsis and can lead to multisystem organ dysfunction (MODS), organ failure and consequently a potentially lethal outcome. As many patients with severe COVID-19 show typical clinical manifestations of septic shock, with other symptoms meeting the diagnostic criteria for sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 International Consensus (6), Li et al. hypothesized that viral sepsis is a crucial process in severe COVID-19 cases (7). Accumulating evidence further links the pathology of severe COVID19, such as acute kidney injury, to sepsis (8).",

Chronic helminth infections (CHIs) confer immunological tolerance to harmless and self\u2010antigens mediated by regulatory T cells (Treg) that are up\u2010regulated. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), abnormal adaptive immune response and unrestrained innate immune response could result in local and systemic immune\u2010mediated tissue damage.
