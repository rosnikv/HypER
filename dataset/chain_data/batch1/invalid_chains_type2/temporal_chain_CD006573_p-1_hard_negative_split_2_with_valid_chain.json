        "title": "Peginterferon alfa\u20102a for hepatitis C after liver transplantation: Two randomized, controlled trials",
        "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for recurrent hepatitis C after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We therefore performed two randomized, controlled trials\u2014a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial\u2014to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a in patients who had undergone OLT. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 54 patients within 3 weeks after OLT, and the treatment trial enrolled 67 patients 6 to 60 months after OLT. In each trial, patients were randomized to treatment with once weekly injections of 180 \u03bcg peginterferon alfa\u20102a or no antiviral treatment for 48 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks thereafter. Peginterferon alfa\u20102a treated patients had significantly lower hepatitis C virus RNA levels and more favorable changes in hepatic histological features compared with untreated controls. However, only 2 treated patients in the prophylaxis trial (8%) and 3 in the treatment trial (12%) achieved a sustained virological response. In the prophylaxis trial, 8 patients (31%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 9 (32%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely; whereas in the treatment trial, 10 patients (30%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 6 (19%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely. The incidence of acute rejection was similar in the treated and untreated groups in both the prophylaxis (12% vs. 21%; P = .5) and treatment (12% vs. 0%; P = .1) trials. In conclusion, peginterferon alfa\u20102a treatment for 48 weeks is safe and tolerable and offers some efficacy in the post\u2010OLT setting. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients who have undergone OLT. (HEPATOLOGY 2005;41:289\u2013298.)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEltrombopag is a new, orally active thrombopoietin-receptor agonist that stimulates thrombopoiesis. We evaluated its ability to increase platelet counts and facilitate treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with HCV-related cirrhosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy-four patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and platelet counts of 20,000 to less than 70,000 per cubic millimeter were randomly assigned to receive eltrombopag (30, 50, or 75 mg daily) or placebo daily for 4 weeks. The primary end point was a platelet count of 100,000 per cubic millimeter or more at week 4. Peginterferon and ribavirin could then be initiated, with continuation of eltrombopag or placebo for 12 additional weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 4, platelet counts were increased to 100,000 per cubic millimeter or more in a dose-dependent manner among patients for whom these data were available: in 0 of the 17 patients receiving placebo, in 9 of 12 (75%) receiving 30 mg of eltrombopag, in 15 of 19 (79%) receiving 50 mg of eltrombopag, and in 20 of 21 (95%) receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag (P<0.001). Antiviral therapy was initiated in 49 patients (in 4 of 18 patients receiving placebo, 10 of 14 receiving 30 mg of eltrombopag, 14 of 19 receiving 50 mg of eltrombopag, and 21 of 23 receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag) while the administration of eltrombopag or placebo was continued. Twelve weeks of antiviral therapy, with concurrent receipt of eltrombopag or placebo, were completed by 36%, 53%, and 65% of patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg of eltrombopag, respectively, and by 6% of patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse event during the initial 4 weeks was headache; thereafter, the adverse events were those expected with interferon-based therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEltrombopag therapy increases platelet counts in patients with thrombocytopenia due to HCV-related cirrhosis, thereby permitting the initiation of antiviral therapy.

        "abstract": "Eltrombopag is a first\u2010in\u2010class, orally bioavailable, small\u2010molecule, nonpeptide agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR), which is being developed as a treatment for thrombocytopenia of various etiologies. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the activity of eltrombopag is dependent on expression of TpoR, which activates the signaling transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways. The objective of this preclinical study is to determine if eltrombopag interacts selectively with the TpoR to facilitate megakaryocyte differentiation in platelets. Functional thrombopoietic activity was demonstrated by the proliferation and differentiation of primary human CD34+ bone marrow cells into CD41+ megakaryocytes. Measurements in platelets in several species indicated that eltrombopag specifically activates only the human and chimpanzee STAT pathways. The in vivo activity of eltrombopag was demonstrated by an increase of up to 100% in platelet numbers when administered orally (10 mg/kg per day for 5 days) to chimpanzees. In conclusion, eltrombopag interacts selectively with the TpoR without competing with Tpo, leading to the increased proliferation and differentiation of human bone marrow progenitor cells into megakaryocytes and increased platelet production. These results suggest that eltrombopag and Tpo may be able to act additively to increase platelet production. STEM CELLS 2008;27:424\u2013430",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Eltrombopag, an oral, nonpeptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist, has been shown to increase platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia and chronic hepatitis C. This multicenter phase 2 study assessed the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in patients receiving first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Research design and methods: Patients (N\u2009=\u2009183) were randomized to placebo or eltrombopag 50\u2009mg, 75\u2009mg, or 100\u2009mg given orally following chemotherapy on days 2 through 11 of each 21-day cycle, for at least two cycles. The primary endpoint was the difference in platelet count from day 1 in cycle 2 to the platelet nadir in cycle 2. Clinical trial registry number: NCT00102726. Results: Although the primary endpoint was not met, postnadir platelet counts increased during cycles 1 and 2 in all eltrombopag treatment groups compared with placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events across all study arms (including placebo) were nausea and alopecia and eltrombopag was generally well tolerated. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary information that eltrombopag does increase platelets in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced solid tumors. Further investigation is needed to identify the optimal dose(s) and schedule of eltrombopag in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Eltrombopag (EP) is a small-molecule, nonpeptide thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist that has been approved recently for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Prior studies have shown that EP stimulates megakaryopoiesis in BM cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and the results also suggested that it may inhibit leukemia cell growth. In the present study, we studied the effects of EP on leukemia cell proliferation and the mechanism of its antiproliferative effects. We found that EP leads to a decreased cell division rate, a block in G(1) phase of cell cycle, and increased differentiation in human and murine leukemia cells. Because EP is species specific in that it can only bind TPO-R in human and primate cells, these findings further suggested that the antileukemic effect is independent of TPO-R. We found that treatment with EP leads to a reduction in free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner. Experimental increase of intracellular iron abrogated the antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects of EP, demonstrating that its antileukemic effects are mediated through modulation of intracellular iron content. Finally, determination of EP's antileukemic activity in vivo demonstrated its ability to prolong survival in 2 mouse models of leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Thrombocytopenia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is a frequent cause of haemorrhage\u2010related morbidity and mortality, and is associated with increased risk of leukaemic transformation and reduced overall survival. In addition, thrombocytopenia in MDS limits the tolerability and therapeutic efficacy of disease\u2010modifying therapies, such as azacitidine or lenalidomide. The recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) erythropoiesis\u2010stimulating agents, epoetin and darbepoetin, are an established component of anaemia management in lower\u2010risk MDS. Their success has, in turn, driven the development of haematopoietic growth factors targeting thrombocytopenia. While recombinant thrombopoietin (THPO) proved too immunogenic for clinical use, novel thrombopoiesis\u2010stimulating agents (TSAs) have the potential to reduce bleeding events, decrease dependency on platelet transfusions and extend exposure to disease\u2010modifying therapies. Two TSAs, eltrombopag and romiplostim, have demonstrated benefit in chronic immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) and safety and efficacy data for use of these agents in MDS is growing. However, important safety concerns remain, such as the potential for stimulation of neoplastic myeloid clones by THPO agonists. In this narrative review, we discuss the rationale and biological mechanism for TSAs in MDS, describe the agents currently available and their mechanism of action, and present current clinical data relating to TSA safety and efficacy in the context of MDS.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TRAs) in elderly patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is uncertain. In 384 ITP patients treated with TRAs when aged \u226560 years, we investigated TRAs response and switch, thrombotic/hemorrhagic risk, and sustained responses off-treatment (SROT). After 3 months, 82.5% and 74.3% of eltrombopag and romiplostim-treated patients achieved a response, respectively (p=0.09); 66.7% maintained the response (median follow-up: 2.7 years). Eighty-five (22.2%) patients switched to the alternative TRA; while no cross-toxicity was observed, 83.3% of resistant patients had a response after the switch. During TRA, 34 major thromboses (3 fatal) and 14 major hemorrhages (none fatal) occurred in 18 and 10 patients, respectively, and were associated with thrombosis history (SHR: 2.04, p=0.05) and platelet count <20x109/L at TRA start (SHR: 1.69, p=0.04), respectively. A recurrent event occurred in 15.6% of patients surviving thrombosis, in all cases but one during persisting TRA treatment (incidence rate: 7.7 per 100 patient-years). All recurrences occurred in the absence of adequate antithrombotic secondary prophylaxis. Sixty-two (16.5%) responding patients discontinued TRA; 53 (13.8%) patients maintained SROT, which was associated with TRA discontinuation in complete response (p<0.001). Very old age (\u226575, 41.1%) was associated with more frequent TRAs start in persistent/acute phase but not with response or thrombotic/hemorrhagic risk. TRAs are effective in elderly ITP patients, with no fatal haemorrhages and with SROT in a significant portion of patients; in patients with thrombosis history caution is warranted and a careful risk/benefit balance should be carried out.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Chronic immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) in adults is a serious autoimmune disease in which platelets are prematurely destroyed, leaving the patient vulnerable to bruising and bleeding. Initial treatment starts with corticosteroids. In patients who become resistant or intolerant to corticosteroids, the thrombopoietic agents (TPOs), consisting of romiplostim (ROM), eltrombopag (ELT), and avatrombopag (AVA), or the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib (FOS), are appropriate next lines of therapy. In this study, the comparative safety, effectiveness, and cost of care between fostamatinib and the TPOs were evaluated in a real-world setting. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 17 community hematology practices across the USA was conducted to identify adult ITP patients who received one of the four agents. Data collection consisted of patient demographics, disease characteristics, as well as number and type of prior treatments. From the first day until the end of treatment, data were also collected on platelet (PLT) counts, adverse events, the use of rescue IVIG, platelet transfusions, and corticosteroids. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to compare PLT-related endpoints between agents. Results: A sample of 179 ITP patients who had received at least one of the four agents was identified. This resulted in a final sample of 51, 87, 127, and 44 patients who received FOS, ELT, ROM, or AVA, respectively. At month six, there were no significant differences between FOS and the TPOs in terms of the proportion of patients with the PLT count being \u226530 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, \u226550 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL as well as the proportion of patients whose PLT levels doubled relative to baseline. The frequency of thromboembolic events (TEs) was 3.9% in FOS patients compared to 9.2%, 4.7%, and 11.4% in the ELT, ROM, and AVA groups. The mean cost per patient with FOS was $99,209 (95% CI: $59,595\u2013$115,074), compared to $92,426 (95% CI: $68,331\u2013$115,519), $108,482 (95% CI: $84,782\u2013$132,182), and $131,050 (95% CI: $83,327\u2013$179,897) for ELT, ROM, or AVA, respectively. Conclusions: In this real-world analysis, FOS was comparable to the TPOs in maintaining PLTs at clinically beneficial levels. Given these findings, the choice of therapy should be based on overall patient safety, preexisting risk factors for TEs, and cost effectiveness.",
