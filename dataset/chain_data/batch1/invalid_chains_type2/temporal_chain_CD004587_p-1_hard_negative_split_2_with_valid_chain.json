        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRestenosis after coronary stenting necessitates repeated percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedures. The delivery of paclitaxel to the site of vascular injury may reduce the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt 73 U.S. centers, we enrolled 1314 patients who were receiving a stent in a single, previously untreated coronary-artery stenosis (vessel diameter, 2.5 to 3.75 mm; lesion length, 10 to 28 mm) in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A total of 652 patients were randomly assigned to receive a bare-metal stent, and 662 to receive an identical-appearing, slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent. Angiographic follow-up was prespecified at nine months in 732 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn terms of base-line characteristics, the two groups were well matched. Diabetes mellitus was present in 24.2 percent of patients; the mean reference-vessel diameter was 2.75 mm, and the mean lesion length was 13.4 mm. A mean of 1.08 stents (length, 21.8 mm) were implanted per patient. The rate of ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization at nine months was reduced from 12.0 percent with the implantation of a bare-metal stent to 4.7 percent with the implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.59; P<0.001). Target-lesion revascularization was required in 3.0 percent of the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent, as compared with 11.3 percent of the group that received a bare-metal stent (relative risk, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.43; P<0.001). The rate of angiographic restenosis was reduced from 26.6 percent to 7.9 percent with the paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.46; P<0.001). The nine-month composite rates of death from cardiac causes or myocardial infarction (4.7 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively) and stent thrombosis (0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively) were similar in the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent and the group that received a bare-metal stent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with bare-metal stents, the slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent is safe and markedly reduces the rates of clinical and angiographic restenosis at nine months.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Long-term comparative data of first-generation drug-eluting stents are scarce. We investigated clinical and angiographic outcomes of sirolimus-eluting (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) at 5 years as part of the Sirolimus-Eluting Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents for Coronary Revascularization (SIRTAX) LATE study. Methods and Results\u2014 A total of 1012 patients were randomly assigned to SES or PES. Repeat angiography was completed in 444 of 1012 patients (43.8%) at 5 years. Major adverse cardiac events occurred in 19.7% of SES- and 21.4% of PES-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17; P=0.39) at 5 years. There were no differences between SES and PES in terms of cardiac death (5.8% versus 5.7%; P=0.35), myocardial infarction (6.6% versus 6.9%; P=0.51), and target lesion revascularization (13.1% versus 15.1%; P=0.29). Between 1 and 5 years, the annual rate of target lesion revascularization was 2.0% (95% confidence interval, 1.4% to 2.6%) for SES and 1.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.9% to 2.0%) for PES. Among patients undergoing paired angiography at 8 months and 5 years, delayed lumen loss amounted to 0.37\u00b10.73 mm for SES and 0.29\u00b10.59 mm for PES (P=0.32). The overall rate of definite stent thrombosis was 4.6% for SES and 4.1% for PES (P=0.74), and very late definite stent thrombosis occurred at an annual rate of 0.65% (95% confidence interval, 0.40% to 0.90%). Conclusions\u2014 Long-term follow-up of first-generation drug-eluting stents shows no significant differences in clinical and angiographic outcomes between SES and PES. The continuous increase in late lumen loss in conjunction with the ongoing risk of very late stent thrombosis suggests that vascular healing remains incomplete up to 5 years after implantation of first-generation drug-eluting stents.

Methods and Results\u2014 PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for randomized clinical trials, until March 2012, that compared any of the Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved durable stent and polymer DES (sirolimus-eluting stent [SES], paclitaxel-eluting stent [PES], everolimus-eluting stent [EES], zotarolimus-eluting stent [ZES], and ZES-Resolute [ZES-R]) with each other or against BMS for de novo coronary lesions, enrolling at least 100 patients and with follow-up of at least 6 months. Short-term (\u2a7d1 year) and long-term efficacy (target-vessel revascularization, target-lesion revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis) outcomes were evaluated and trial-level data pooled by both mixed-treatment comparison and direct comparison analyses. From 76 randomized clinical trials with 117 762 patient-years of follow-up, compared with BMS, each DES reduced long-term target-vessel revascularization (39%\u201361%), but the magnitude varied by DES type (EES\u223cSES\u223cZES-R>PES\u223cZES>BMS), with a >42% probability that EES had the lowest target-vessel revascularization rate. There was no increase in the risk of any long-term safety outcomes, including stent thrombosis, with any DES (versus BMS). In addition, there was reduction in myocardial infarction (all DES except PES versus BMS) and stent thrombosis (with EES versus BMS: Rate ratio, 0.51; 95% credibility interval, 0.35\u20130.73). The safest DES appeared to be EES (>86% probability), with reduction in myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis compared with BMS. Short-term outcomes were similar to long-term outcomes, with SES, ZES-R, and everolimus-eluting stent being the most efficacious and EES being the safest stent. Conclusions\u2014 DES are highly efficacious at reducing the risk of target-vessel revascularization without an increase in any safety outcomes, including stent thrombosis. However, among the DES types, there were considerable differences, such that EES, SES, and ZES-R were the most efficacious and EES was the safest stent.",

After 12 months of treatment with a thienopyridine drug (clopidogrel or prasugrel) and aspirin, patients were randomly assigned to continue receiving thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo for another 18 months; all patients continued receiving aspirin. The coprimary efficacy end points were stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) during the period from 12 to 30 months. The primary safety end point was moderate or severe bleeding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 9961 patients were randomly assigned to continue thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo. Continued treatment with thienopyridine, as compared with placebo, reduced the rates of stent thrombosis (0.4% vs. 1.4%; hazard ratio, 0.29 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.17 to 0.48]; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (4.3% vs. 5.9%; hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85]; P<0.001). The rate of myocardial infarction was lower with thienopyridine treatment than with placebo (2.1% vs. 4.1%; hazard ratio, 0.47; P<0.001).

        "abstract": "Background Patients who have had an acute coronary syndrome are at high risk for recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events. We sought to determine whether alirocumab, a human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin\u2013kexin type 9 (PCSK9), would improve cardiovascular outcomes after an acute coronary syndrome in patients receiving high\u2010intensity statin therapy. Methods We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial involving 18,924 patients who had an acute coronary syndrome 1 to 12 months earlier, had a low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of at least 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter), a non\u2010high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter), or an apolipoprotein B level of at least 80 mg per deciliter, and were receiving statin therapy at a high\u2010intensity dose or at the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alirocumab subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg (9462 patients) or matching placebo (9462 patients) every 2 weeks. The dose of alirocumab was adjusted under blinded conditions to target an LDL cholesterol level of 25 to 50 mg per deciliter (0.6 to 1.3 mmol per liter). The primary end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. Results The median duration of follow\u2010up was 2.8 years. A composite primary end\u2010point event occurred in 903 patients (9.5%) in the alirocumab group and in 1052 patients (11.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.93; P<0.001). A total of 334 patients (3.5%) in the alirocumab group and 392 patients (4.1%) in the placebo group died (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). The absolute benefit of alirocumab with respect to the composite primary end point was greater among patients who had a baseline LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg or more per deciliter than among patients who had a lower baseline level. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups, with the exception of local injection\u2010site reactions (3.8% in the alirocumab group vs. 2.1% in the placebo group). Conclusions Among patients who had a previous acute coronary syndrome and who were receiving high\u2010intensity statin therapy, the risk of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events was lower among those who received alirocumab than among those who received placebo.

        "abstract": "Platelets play a significant role in atherothrombosis. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is critically involved in the regulation of LDL metabolism and interacts with platelet function. The effect of PCSK9 in platelet function is poorly understood. The authors of this article sought to characterize platelets as a major source of PCSK9 and PCSK9\u2019s role in atherothrombosis. In a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), platelet count, platelet reactivity, and platelet-derived PCSK9 release were analyzed. The role of platelet PCSK9 on platelet and monocyte function was investigated in vitro. Platelet count and hyper-reactivity correlated with plasma LDL in CAD. The circulating platelets express on their surface and release substantial amounts of PCSK9. Release of PCSK9 augmented platelet-dependent thrombosis, monocyte migration, and differentiation into macrophages/foam cells. Platelets and PCSK9 accumulated in tissue derived from atherosclerotic carotid arteries in areas of macrophages. PCSK9 inhibition reduced platelet activation and platelet-dependent thrombo-inflammation. The authors identified platelets as a source of PCSK9 in CAD, which may have an impact on LDL metabolism. Furthermore, platelet-derived PCSK9 contributes to atherothrombosis, and inhibition of PCSK9 attenuates thrombo-inflammation, which may contribute to the reported beneficial clinical effects.",

        "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), mainly secreted in the liver, is a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis inducing LDL receptors\u2019 degradation. Beyond lipid metabolism, PCSK9 is involved in the development of atherosclerosis, promoting plaque formation in mice and human, impairing the integrity of endothelial monolayer and promoting the events that induce atherosclerosis disease progression. In addition, the PCSK9 ancillary role in the atherothrombosis process is widely debated. Indeed, recent evidence showed a regulatory effect of PCSK9 on redox system and platelet activation. In particular, the role of PCSK9 in the activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox2) system, of MAP-kinase cascades and of CD36 and LOX-1 downstream pathways, suggests that PCSK9 may be a significant cofactor in atherothrombosis development. This evidence suggests that the serum levels of PCSK9 could represent a new biomarker for the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Finally, other evidence showed that PCSK9 inhibitors, a novel pharmacological tool introduced in clinical practice in recent years, counteracted these phenomena. In this review, we summarize the evidence concerning the role of PCSK9 in promoting oxidative-stress-related atherothrombotic process.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic-related cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) are characterized by high serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that can promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To answer the need for better LDL-C control in individuals at high and very high risk for CVD, a new injectable innovative family of lipid-lowering (LL) monoclonal antibodies against the protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been approved. However, the effect of these drugs on vascular function, such as ROS generation and arterial stiffness, has not already been extensively described. In this report, we present data from 18 males with high to very high CV risk undergoing LL treatment (LLT) with either statin and ezetimibe or ezetimibe monotherapy, who experienced, after a 2-month treatment with Evolocumab, a significant improvement in blood pressure (BP)-adjusted carotid\u2013femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) (p-value = 0.0005 in the whole cohort, p-value = 0.0046 in the sub-cohort undergoing background LLT with statin and ezetimibe, p-value = 0.015 in the sub-cohort undergoing background LLT with ezetimibe monotherapy), which was significantly associated with a decrease in freshly isolated leukocytes (PBMCS)-derived H2O2 production (p-value = 0.004, p-value = 0.02 and p-value = 0.05, respectively, in the whole cohort, in the statin + ezetimibe sub-cohort, and the ezetimibe sub-cohort).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAtherosclerosis, a leading cause of mortality, necessitates effective management of hypercholesterolemia, specifically elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The emergence of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) has revolutionised lipid-lowering. PCSK9i demonstrates substantial LDL-C reduction and cardiovascular benefits, particularly in statin-intolerant or nonresponsive individuals. However, the potential pleiotropic effects of PCSK9i, especially on arterial stiffness, remain a subject of investigation. This systematic review and meta-analysis seek to provide a nuanced understanding of the potential pleiotropic effects of PCSK9i, specifically on arterial health. The primary objective was to analyse the influence of PCSK9i on arterial stiffness, extending beyond traditional lipid-lowering metrics and contributing to a more comprehensive approach to cardiovascular risk reduction.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic search was conducted across major databases, clinical trial registries and grey literature. Inclusion criteria comprised adults in prospective cohort studies undergoing PCSK9i augmentation in lipid-lowering therapy, with a focus on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWv). Random-effects meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression models were employed to assess the pooled effect of adding PCSK9i to lipid-lowering interventions on arterial stiffness.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive studies (158 participants) met the inclusion criteria, demonstrating a significant reduction in PWv (mean difference: -2.61\u2009m/s [95% CI: -3.70, -1.52]; ES: -1.62 [95% CI: -2.53, -.71]) upon adding PCSK9i to lipid-lowering interventions. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression models suggested potential sex-based and baseline PWv-dependent variations, emphasising patient-specific characteristics.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe meta-analysis provides robust evidence that adding PCSK9i to lipid-lowering interventions significantly improves arterial stiffness, indicating broader vascular benefits beyond LDL-C reduction.",
