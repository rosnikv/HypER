        "abstract": "The specific maneuvers that cause women to be incontinent can become important diagnostic aids and major factors in differentiating the effectiveness of the current pharmacological, surgical, and behavioral treatments for urinary incontinence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether meaningful dimensions could be identified within the multiple movements that produce urine loss in stress\u2010incontinent women. The Stress Incontinence Questionnaire (SIQ) was constructed from items derived from a compilation of studies and reports of urinary incontinence experts. An exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood method of extraction and a varimax rotation procedure identified four dimensions: active maneuvers, passive maneuvers, planned maneuvers, and unplanned maneuvers. The alpha coefficients for the four identified factors were acceptable and ranged from 0.71 to 0.79, with 8\u2010week test\u2010retest correlations for the active (r =.87), passive (r =.87), planned (r =.85), and the unplanned maneuvers (r =.60) all highly significant. The four factors also showed differential patterns of relationships with various gynecologic and urologic measures. These latter findings suggest that the factors identified in this study may be acknowledging different types or components of stress incontinence. In either case, the findings may have implications for treatment approaches to stress incontinence. Further research is needed to substantiate the various components of stress incontinence found in this study and the implications these findings may have for treatment of incontinence.",

        "abstract": "Electricite de France-Gaz de France (EDF-GDF) is the only utility firm in France involved in production, transmission and distribution of energy. For several reasons, EDF-GDF is a unique setting for epidemiology. The company employs about 150 000 workers in all regions of France, from large cities to small villages; there is a wide socioeconomic range of occupational positions, including white and blue-collars workers. The workforce is very stable: due to their civil servant-like status, employees almost never leave the company and are not lost to follow-up even after retirement, since retirement benefits are paid by the company itself. An extensive human resources system allows for a complete follow-up of the workers, even when they retire. EDF-GDF has its own Occupational Health and Social Security system; about 300 physicians work for the company and are responsible for the health surveillance of the workers. During the seventies the medical department of EDF-GDF decided to build a comprehensive database on the health of the workforce. The database was designed in close collaboration with researchers at INSERM\u2014the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research\u2014Research Unit 88, directed at that time by one of us who was also a Scientific advisor for the medical department of the company (MG). The database contained demographic, socioeconomic and professional data on each worker. An exhaustive register of sick leave, accidents, permanent disabilities, compensated diseases, causes of death, cancer and coronary heart disease incidence among active workers was created. Further, a job-exposure matrix was established for 30 potentially carcinogenic agents. 1,2 Using these databases several epidemiological studies on working accidents, sick leave, cancer and mortality were carried out. However the absence of individual level data on lifestyle, self-reported health conditions and the social environment limited the ability to study numerous research questions in-depth. With the aim of overcoming some of these shortcomings, researchers at INSERM designed a new project to develop a longitudinal cohort made of a sample of volunteer EDF-GDF workers: the GAZEL Cohort Study (GAZEL stands for GAZ and ELectricite). The management, the unions and the medical department of EDF-GDF gave their consent to the project, and the company accepted to provide regular access to all personal and health data files. EDF-GDF and the worker\u2019s social activities organization decided to fund INSERM Unit 88 for the major part of the GAZEL Cohort Study costs on a regular basis; regular funding came also from INSERM Unit 88\u2019s own budget, and specific funding for the setting up of a biobank came from private foundations (Fondation de France and Association pour la recherche sur le cancer). These resources allow only for the basic functioning of the cohort and all specific research projects must find their own additional funding. The GAZEL Cohort Study was launched in January 1989. INSERM Unit 88 (now Unit 687: Public Health and Epidemiology of Occupational and Social Determinants of Health) manages the project and has had full responsibility for it since the beginning, without any interference from the company in relation to the scientific work or publication of results.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nChanges in health following retirement are poorly understood. We used serial measurements to assess the effect of retirement on sleep disturbances.\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective cohort study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe French national gas and electricity company.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nFourteen thousand seven hundred fourteen retired employees (79% men).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS\nAnnual survey measurements of sleep disturbances ranging from 7 years before to 7 years after retirement (a mean of 12 measurements). Before retirement 22.2% to 24.6% of participants reported having disturbed sleep. According to repeated-measures logistic-regression analysis with generalized estimating equations estimation, the odds ratio (OR) for having a sleep disturbance in the postretirement period was 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.77), compared with having a sleep disturbance in the preretirement period. The postretirement improvement in sleep was more pronounced in men (OR 0.66 [0.63-0.69]) than in women (OR 0.89 [0.84-0.95]) and in higher-grade workers than lower-grade workers. Postretirement sleep improvement was explained by the combination of preretirement risk factors suggesting removal of work-related exposures as a mechanism. The only exception to the general improvement in sleep after retirement was related to retirement on health grounds. In this group of participants, there was an increase in sleep disturbances following retirement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRepeated measurements provide strong evidence for a substantial and sustained decrease in sleep disturbances following retirement. The possibility that the health and well-being of individuals are significantly worse when in employment than following retirement presents a great challenge to improve the quality of work life in Western societies in which the cost of the aging population can only be met through an increase in average retirement age.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To determine, using longitudinal analyses, if retirement is followed by a change in the risk of incident chronic diseases, depressive symptoms, and fatigue. Design Prospective study with repeat measures from 7 years before to 7 years after retirement. Setting Large French occupational cohort (the GAZEL study), 1989-2007. Participants 11\u2009246 men and 2858 women. Main outcome measures Respiratory disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke, mental fatigue, and physical fatigue, measured annually by self report over the 15 year observation period; depressive symptoms measured at four time points. Results The average number of repeat measurements per participant was 12.1. Repeated measures logistic regression with generalised estimating equations showed that the cumulative prevalence of self reported respiratory disease, diabetes, and coronary heart disease and stroke increased with age, with no break in the trend around retirement. In contrast, retirement was associated with a substantial decrease in the prevalence of both mental fatigue (odds ratio for fatigue one year after versus one year before retirement 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.21) and physical fatigue (0.27, 0.26 to 0.30). A major decrease was also observed in depressive symptoms (0.60, 0.53 to 0.67). The decrease in fatigue around retirement was more pronounced among people with a chronic disease before retirement. Conclusions Longitudinal modelling of repeat data showed that retirement did not change the risk of major chronic diseases but was associated with a substantial reduction in mental and physical fatigue and depressive symptoms, particularly among people with chronic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recent studies based on self-reported data suggest that retirement may have beneficial effects on mental health, but studies using objective endpoints remain scarce. This study examines longitudinally the changes in antidepressant medication use across the 9 years spanning the transition to retirement. Methods: Participants were Finnish public-sector employees: 7138 retired at statutory retirement age (76% women; mean age, 61.2 years), 1238 retired early due to mental health issues (78% women; mean age, 52.0 years), and 2643 retired due to physical health issues (72% women; mean age, 55.4 years). Information on purchase of antidepressant medication 4 years before and 4 years after retirement year was based on comprehensive national pharmacy records in 1994\u20132005. Results: One year before retirement, the use of antidepressants was 4% among those who would retire at statutory age, 61% among those who would retire due to mental health issues, and 14% among those who would retire due to physical health issues. Retirement-related changes in antidepressant use depended on the reason for retirement. Among old-age retirees, antidepressant medication use decreased during the transition period (age- and calendar-year-adjusted prevalence ratio for antidepressant use 1 year after versus 1 year before retirement = 0.77 [95% confidence interval = 0.68 to 0.88]). Among those whose main reason for disability pension was mental health issues or physical health issues, there was an increasing trend in antidepressant use prior to retirement and, for mental health retirements, a decrease after retirement. Conclusions: Trajectories of recorded purchases of antidepressant medication are consistent with the hypothesis that retirement is beneficial for mental health.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nRetirement from paid work is a major life event facing increasingly large numbers of people in the coming years. We examined trajectories of mental health five years before and five years after old-age and disability retirement using data on purchases of psychotropic drugs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study included all employees from the City of Helsinki, Finland, retiring between 2000-2008 due to old age (N=4456) or disability (N=2549). Purchases of psychotropic drugs were analyzed in 20 3-month intervals before and after retirement using graphical methods and growth curve models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOld-age retirement was unrelated to purchases of psychotropic drugs. Among disability retirees, psychotropic medication tripled before retirement. The average increase was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.73-1.16] daily defined doses (DDD) 5-1.5 years before retirement; from 1.5 years until retirement it was 5.68 DDD (95% CI 5.33-6.03) for each 3-month interval. After disability retirement, purchases of antidepressants decreased on average by 0.40 DDD (95% CI 0.57-0.23) for each 3-month interval, those of hypnotics and sedatives increased by 0.30 DDD (95% CI 0.12-0.47), and no changes were seen for other psychotropic drugs. The changes before and after retirement were largest among those who retired due to mental disorders and those whose retirement had been granted as temporary.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhile no overall decrease in psychotropic medication after retirement was observed, purchases of antidepressants decreased after disability retirement. Long-term trajectories suggest that disability retirement might be prevented if mental health problems were tackled more efficiently earlier in the pre-retirement period.",

        "abstract": "Objectives The effect of retirement on mental health is not well understood. We examined the prevalence of hospital treatment for depression and purchase of antidepressant medication before, during and after retirement in a Danish population sample. We hypothesised that retirement was followed by reduced prevalence of hospital treatment for depression and antidepressant purchase. Methods Participants were 245\u2005082 Danish workers who retired between 2000 and 2006. Information on retirement, hospital treatment and antidepressant purchases were obtained from Danish national registers. The yearly prevalence of hospital treatment for depression and antidepressant purchases was estimated in relation to the year of retirement from 5\u2005years prior to the retirement year to 5\u2005years after retirement. Using logistic regressions with generalised estimating equations we analysed the trends in prevalence before, during and after the retirement. Results Two of 1000 participants were hospitalised with depression in the year of their retirement and 63 of 1000 purchased antidepressant medication during the retirement year. The prevalence of hospital treatment for depression increased before and around retirement, followed by a slight decline from 2\u2005years after retirement with the prevalence of hospitalisation dropping from 0.21%(retirement +2\u2005years) to 0.16% (retirement +5\u2005years). For antidepressants, we observed a steady increase in purchases before retirement (retirement \u22122\u2005years). This increase levelled off in the years around retirement, but continued after retirement (retirement +2\u2005years). Conclusions Overall, this study did not confirm the hypothesis that retirement is beneficial for mental health measured by hospitalisation with depression and treatment with antidepressants. Although the temporary levelling off of the increase in antidepressant treatment around time of retirement might indicate a beneficial effect, this possible effect was only short-term.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nRetirement is a turning point in human life, resulting in changes to physical and mental health status. The aim of this study was to examine the factors that are related with depression and anxiety symptoms in Greek male veterans after retirement.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 502 veterans participated in a cross-sectional study. Beck Depression Inventory for depression assessment and Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory for anxiety assessment were used. The Ethics Committee of the Technological Educational Institution of Thessaly granted permission for conducting the research, and informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Questionnaires were filled in electronically using a platform that was made for the specific research. Mean values, standard deviations, Student t test, nonparametric cluster analysis of variance, Pearson's and Spearman's coefficients, and linear regression were conducted, using the Statistical Program for Social Services version 19.0.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSevere depression was found in 3.8% of veterans with a mean score of 6.78, whereas 23.2% displayed mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression. Mean score of state anxiety was found to be 36.55 and of trait anxiety 33.60. Veterans who were discharged because of stressful working conditions, those who have a high body mass index, consume regularly alcohol, smoke and were not satisfied by changes in their everyday life after retirement had significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety, although those who retired because of family problems had significantly more symptoms of depression. Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that dissatisfaction related to lifestyle changes had statistically significant effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety, and stressful working conditions as a leading cause for retirement had statistically significant effect on depression. Finally, according to linear regression analyses results, those who were satisfied with their professional evolution had 1.80 times lower score in depression scale.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe sense of satisfaction derived from fulfilling work-related expectations when finishing a career, with changes in everyday life, and smoking and alcohol reduction, may contribute to a better adjustment during the retirement period. To our knowledge, this was the first study examining depression and anxiety levels in Greek veterans, and the sample size was large, covering a randomly chosen veteran population. On the other, it was a convenient sample, although the study results could not focus on direct-term effects of retirement (up to 3 years of retirement from active service).

        "abstract": "Subjective well-being is an essential part of mental health in both religious and non-religious communities. On a global scale, most research on the relationship between religiosity and subjective well-being is conducted on English-speaking, Western, and Christian populations. This large-scale study is expected to complement and balance previous research by reporting the important role of resilience as a mediator in the relationship between religiosity, social support, and self-efficacy on subjective well-being based on a sample of Indonesians, the world's largest Muslim population. Data collection uses adaptation of standardized scales, namely the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) for measurement of Subjective well-being, Resilience Evaluation Scale (RES) for resiliency, The Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS) for religiosity, The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) for social support, and the General Self-efficacy scale (GSES) for self-efficacy. A convenience sample of 1640 Muslim undergraduate students made up the responses. This study's findings suggest that self-efficacy, social support, and religiosity all directly influence resilience. Subjective well-being is directly affected by religion, social support, self-efficacy, and resilience. The association between self-efficacy, social support, self-religion, and subjective well-being is mediated by resilience. Resilience partially mediates the relationship between religiosity, social support, and self-efficacy with subjective well-being. This research has practical implications for the practice of Islamic guidance and counseling, notably the use of religion as a tool to build resilience, for instance, through a more positive reading of difficulties as God's gift for personal growth.",
