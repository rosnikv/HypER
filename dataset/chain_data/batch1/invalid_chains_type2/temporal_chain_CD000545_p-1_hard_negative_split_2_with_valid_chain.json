        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe comparative efficacy and safety of infliximab and azathioprine therapy alone or in combination for Crohn's disease are unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluated the efficacy of infliximab monotherapy, azathioprine monotherapy, and the two drugs combined in 508 adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who had not undergone previous immunosuppressive or biologic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram of body weight at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks plus daily oral placebo capsules; 2.5 mg of oral azathioprine per kilogram daily plus a placebo infusion on the standard schedule; or combination therapy with the two drugs. Patients received study medication through week 30 and could continue in a blinded study extension through week 50.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 169 patients receiving combination therapy, 96 (56.8%) were in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 (the primary end point), as compared with 75 of 169 patients (44.4%) receiving infliximab alone (P=0.02) and 51 of 170 patients (30.0%) receiving azathioprine alone (P<0.001 for the comparison with combination therapy and P=0.006 for the comparison with infliximab). Similar numerical trends were found at week 50. At week 26, mucosal healing had occurred in 47 of 107 patients (43.9%) receiving combination therapy, as compared with 28 of 93 patients (30.1%) receiving infliximab (P=0.06) and 18 of 109 patients (16.5%) receiving azathioprine (P<0.001 for the comparison with combination therapy and P=0.02 for the comparison with infliximab). Serious infections developed in 3.9% of patients in the combination-therapy group, 4.9% of those in the infliximab group, and 5.6% of those in the azathioprine group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who were treated with infliximab plus azathioprine or infliximab monotherapy were more likely to have a corticosteroid-free clinical remission than those receiving azathioprine monotherapy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe risk of infection associated with tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF) and thiopurines (combination therapy) is uncertain. We assessed the risk of serious and opportunistic infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with thiopurine monotherapy, anti-TNF monotherapy, or combination therapy in a large cohort of patients in France.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a nationwide population-based study of patients (18 years or older) with a diagnosis of IBD in the French national health insurance database; we collected data from January 1, 2009 until December 31, 2014. The risks of serious and opportunistic infections associated with exposure to combination therapy, anti-TNF, and thiopurine monotherapies were compared using marginal structural Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for baseline and time-varying sociodemographic characteristics, medications, and comorbidities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 190,694 patients with IBD included in our analysis, 8561 serious infections and 674 opportunistic infections occurred. Compared with anti-TNF monotherapy, combination therapy was associated with increased risks of serious infection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.45) and opportunistic infection (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.32-2.91). Compared with thiopurine monotherapy, anti-TNF monotherapy was associated with increased risks of serious infection (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.56-1.88), mycobacterial infection (HR,\u00a01.98; 95% CI, 1.15-3.40), and bacterial infection (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.23-4.58, respectively). Conversely, anti-TNF monotherapy was associated with decreased risk of opportunistic viral infection compared with thiopurine monotherapy (HR,\u00a00.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.87).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a nationwide cohort study of patients with IBD in France, we found heterogeneity in risks of serious and opportunistic infections in patients treated with immune-suppressive regimens. These should be carefully considered and weighed against potential benefits for IBD treatment in patient management.",

We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and utilized multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men). Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), \u22652 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7).

        "title": "Immunogenicity and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions and immunosuppressive therapy in a monocentric cohort",
        "abstract": "Introduction In light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, protecting vulnerable groups has become a high priority. Persons at risk of severe disease, for example, those receiving immunosuppressive therapies for chronic inflammatory cdiseases (CIDs), are prioritised for vaccination. However, data concerning generation of protective antibody titres in immunosuppressed patients are scarce. Additionally, mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine technology leading to increased insecurity especially in patients with CID. Objective Here we present for the first time, data on the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of immunosuppressed patients as compared with healthy controls. Methods 42 healthy controls and 26 patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs 50.5 years). Immunisations were performed according to national guidelines with mRNA vaccines. Antibody titres were assessed by ELISA before initial vaccination and 7\u2009days after secondary vaccination. Disease activity and side effects were assessed prior to and 7\u2009days after both vaccinations. Results Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as neutralising activity could be detected in all study participants. IgG titres were significantly lower in patients as compared with controls (2053 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL \u00b11218 vs 2685\u00b11102). Side effects were comparable in both groups. No severe adverse effects were observed, and no patients experienced a disease flare. Conclusion We show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines lead to development of antibodies in immunosuppressed patients without considerable side effects or induction of disease flares. Despite the small size of this cohort, we were able to demonstrate the efficiency and safety of mRNA vaccines in our cohort.",

        "title": "Dual biologic therapy with ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis and vedolizumab for Crohn\u2019s disease: A case report and review of literature",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Little is known about the safety and efficacy of using two or more biologics for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). CASE SUMMARY This case report and narrative review demonstrate the potential safety of dual biologic therapy (DBT) in a 45-year-old female with two separate immune-mediated diseases. She had a history of multiple sclerosis for which she was receiving treatment with ocrelizumab, and she had been recently diagnosed with CD after presenting with diarrhoea. The CD diagnosis was confirmed radiologically, endoscopically, histologically, and biochemically. The patient received treatment with vedolizumab, a gut-specific inhibitor of the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin on leukocytes. No adverse reactions were observed for the duration of treatment. The safety of ocrelizumab and vedolizumab for the treatment of different immune-mediated diseases was demonstrated. CONCLUSION DBT may be a safe and effective option for the treatment of refractory disease or multiple immune-mediated diseases. Newer biologics, which have improved safety profiles and gut specificity, may provide promising avenues for treatment. However, caution must be exercised in the appropriate selection of biologics given their inherent immunosuppressive properties, side effects, and efficacy profiles. Current evidence suggests that biologic therapy is not associated with a worse prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, but treatment decisions should be made in a multidisciplinary setting. Further research from controlled trials is needed to better understand the safety profile of DBT in CD. The immunopathological mechanisms underlying DBT also remain to be clarified.",

        "abstract": "Background: An association between certain immunomodulatory therapies (rituximab, ipilimumab, and other immune checkpoint inhibitors) and inflammatory (non-ischemic and non-infectious) colitis in oncologic and non-oncologic patient populations is well documented in the medical literature. Objective: The purpose of this case series is to describe adverse event reports of new onset, inflammatory colitis in association with ocrelizumab in patients with multiple sclerosis submitted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or published in the medical literature. Methods: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and medical literature were searched. Results: A review of postmarketing cases from FAERS and published medical literature identified 38 cases consistent with inflammatory, non-ischemic, and non-infectious colitis in association with ocrelizumab. The median time-to-onset was 8\u2009months. Cases were reported using the following diagnostic terms: Crohn\u2019s disease (13), unspecified colitis (11), microscopic colitis (5), ulcerative colitis (5), medication-induced colitis (3), and autoimmune colitis (2). Conclusions: This case series highlights ocrelizumab induced immune-mediated colitis that can be clinically severe and potentially life-threatening. Based on the findings of this review, the ocrelizumab Prescribing Information was amended to include immune-mediated colitis in the Warnings and Precautions section.",
