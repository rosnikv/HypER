        "abstract": "Periodontal disease is a common infection-induced inflammatory disease among individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of treatment of periodontal disease on the level of metabolic control of diabetes. A total of 113 Native Americans (81 females and 32 males) suffering from periodontal disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were randomized into 5 treatment groups. Periodontal treatment included ultrasonic scaling and curettage combined with one of the following antimicrobial regimens: 1) topical water and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 2) topical 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 3) topical povidone-iodine and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 4) topical 0.12% CHX and placebo; and 5) topical water and placebo (control group). Assessments were performed prior to and at 3 and 6 months after treatment and included probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque and determination of serum glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). After treatment all study groups showed clinical and microbial improvement. The doxycycline-treated groups showed the greatest reduction in probing depth and subgingival Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to the control group. In addition, all 3 groups receiving systemic doxycycline showed, at 3 months, significant reductions (P < or = 0.04) in mean HbA1c reaching nearly 10% from the pretreatment value. Effective treatment of periodontal infection and reduction of periodontal inflammation is associated with a reduction in level of glycated hemoglobin. Control of periodontal infections should thus be an important part of the overall management of diabetes mellitus patients.",

        "title": "Periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus: a two-way relationship.",
        "abstract": "Severe periodontal disease often coexists with severe diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a risk factor for severe periodontal disease. A model is presented whereby severe periodontal disease increases the severity of diabetes mellitus and complicates metabolic control. We propose that an infection-mediated upregulation cycle of cytokine synthesis and secretion by chronic stimulus from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and products of periodontopathic organisms may amplify the magnitude of the advanced glycation end product (AGE)-mediated cytokine response operative in diabetes mellitus. In this model, the combination of these 2 pathways, infection and AGE-mediated cytokine upregulation, helps explain the increase in tissue destruction seen in diabetic periodontitis, and how periodontal infection may complicate the severity of diabetes and the degree of metabolic control, resulting in a 2-way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease/infection. This proposed dual pathway of tissue destruction suggests that control of chronic periodontal infection is essential for achieving long-term control of diabetes mellitus. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that elimination of periodontal infection by using systemic antibiotics improves metabolic control of diabetes, defined by reduction in glycated hemoglobin or reduction in insulin requirements.",

        "title": "Pathophysiological relationships between periodontitis and systemic disease: recent concepts involving serum lipids.",
        "abstract": "Periodontitis has been traditionally regarded as a chronic inflammatory oral infection. However, recent studies indicate that this oral disease may have profound effects on systemic health. The search for cellular/molecular mechanisms linking periodontitis to changes in systemic health and systemic physiology has resulted in the evolution of a new area of lipid research establishing linkages between existing multidisciplinary biomedical literature, recent observations concerning the effects of serum lipids on immune cell phenotype/function, and a heightened interest in systemic responses to chronic localized infections. There appears to be more than a casual relationship between serum lipid levels and systemic health (particularly cardiovascular disease, diabetes, tissue repair capacity, and immune cell function), susceptibility to periodontitis, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In terms of the potential relationship between periodontitis and systemic disease, it is possible that periodontitis-induced changes in immune cell function cause metabolic dysregulation of lipid metabolism through mechanisms involving proinflammatory cytokines. Sustained elevations of serum lipids and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines may have a serious negative impact on systemic health. The purpose of this paper is to present the background, supporting data, and hypotheses related to this concept. As active participants in this emerging and exciting area of investigation, we hope to stimulate interest and awareness among biomedical scientists and practitioners.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis has been linked to clinical cardiovascular disease but not to subclinical atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether periodontitis is associated with carotid artery intima-media wall thickness (IMT). Cross-sectional data on 6017 persons aged 52 to 75 years were obtained from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study 1996 to 1998 examination. The dependent variable was carotid IMT \u22651 mm. Periodontitis was defined by extent of attachment loss \u22653 mm: none/mild (<10%), moderate (10% to <30%), or severe (\u226530%). Covariates included age, sex, diabetes, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, smoking, waist-hip ratio, education, and race/study center. Odds of IMT \u22651 mm were higher for severe periodontitis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.53) and moderate periodontitis (OR 1.40, CI 1.17 to 1.67) compared with no periodontitis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, severe periodontitis (OR 1.31, CI 1.03 to 1.66) was associated with IMT \u22651 mm, while adjusting for the other factors in the model. These results provide the first indication that periodontitis may play a role in the pathogenesis of atheroma formation, as well as in cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nChronic infections, including periodontal infections, may predispose to cardiovascular disease. The present study investigates the relationship of periodontal disease and tooth loss with subclinical atherosclerosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 711 subjects with a mean age of 66+/-9 years and no history of stroke or myocardial infarction in the Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study. Subjects received a comprehensive periodontal examination, extensive in-person cardiovascular disease risk factor measurements, and a carotid scan using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. Regression models were adjusted for conventional risk factors (age, sex, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, race-ethnicity, education, physical activity) and markers of cultural background, healthy lifestyle, and psychosocial health.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMeasures of both current and cumulative periodontitis became more severe as tooth loss increased. A significant association was observed between tooth loss levels and carotid artery plaque prevalence. Among those with 0 to 9 missing teeth, 46% had carotid artery plaque, whereas among those with >or=10 missing teeth, carotid artery plaque prevalence was approximately 60% (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data suggest that tooth loss is a marker of past periodontal disease in this population and is related to subclinical atherosclerosis, thereby providing a potential pathway for a relationship with clinical events.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014The association between serum antibody levels to major periodontal pathogens and coronary heart disease (CHD) was analyzed in a prospective population-based study. Methods and Results\u2014The population comprised 1023 men (aged 46 to 64 years) in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study. The subjects with CHD at baseline (n=113) were more often seropositive for Porphyromonas gingivalis IgA (38.9% versus 28.5%, P=0.021) and IgG (60.2% versus 46.7%, P=0.007) than those without CHD. During the 10-year follow-up, 109 men free from CHD at baseline experienced an acute myocardial infarction or CHD death. The men with an end point were more often seropositive for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans IgA (15.5% versus 10.2%, P=0.019) than those who remained healthy. In the highest tertile of A. actinomycetemcomitans IgA-antibodies compared with the lowest one, the relative risk (RR) for an end point adjusted for CHD risk factors was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.3). In the Porphyromonas gingivalis IgA-antibody tertiles, the highest RR of 2.1 (1.3 to 3.4) was observed in the second tertile. All antibody levels correlated positively with the carotid artery intima-media thickness. Conclusions\u2014High-serum antibody levels to major periodontal pathogens are associated with subclinical, prevalent, and future incidence of CHD. Periodontal pathogens or host response against them may contribute to the pathogenesis of CHD.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular and periodontal diseases are common inflammatory conditions in the human population. In atherogenesis, inflammation plays a continuous role from endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules to the development of the fatty streak, established plaque, and finally plaque rupture. Exposures to infections like periodontal disease have been postulated to perpetuate inflammatory events in atherogenesis. Recent observational studies and meta-analyses continue to demonstrate a modest but statistically significant increased risk for cardiovascular disease among persons exposed to periodontal disease or infection. Experiments with animal models further indicate that periodontal infection can increase atherosclerosis in the presence or absence of hypercholesterolemia. While the available pilot data in patients suggest that periodontal interventions can improve surrogate serum biomarkers and vascular responses associated with cardiovascular disease, the effect of these interventions on true outcomes of cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and stroke is presently unknown. Nevertheless, clinicians and patients should be aware of the consistent association between cardiovascular and periodontal diseases along with the potential preventive benefits of periodontal interventions. Cardiovascular disease accounts for 29% of deaths",

        "abstract": "Periodontal disease is an inflammatory disease that has numerous consequences both locally and systemically. The aim of this study was to assess whether periodontal disease causes systemic inflammatory response in otherwise healthy, adult dogs. We estimated the total mouth periodontal score (TMPS), measured the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), hematocrit, and albumin, and determined the white blood cell (WBC) and polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts in client-owned dogs. There was a statistically significant relationship between the gingival bleeding index (TMPS-G) and CRP concentration, and WBC and PMN counts, possibly during the active periods of periodontal tissue destruction. No correlation was found between the periodontal destruction index (TMPS-P) and the measured blood parameters. We conclude that chronic periodontal disease does not cause anemia or a reduction in serum albumin.

        "abstract": "Periodontal disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease, which is believed to be the most prevalent in humans and dogs. Changes in the oral microbial ecology and host response are considered as two of the factors that modulate the clinical outcome. It has been postulated that specific antigens or enzymes produced by plaque bacteria initiate host inflammatory response leading to periodontal destruction[1]. It has also been suggested that PD has a systemic impact on the organism of the dog[2,3]. Plaque bacteria are known to be organized in biofilms both in humans and animals[4,5]. Pioneering species in biofilms are replaced by others after they have altered their habitat, making it suitable for new, more pathogenic species to colonize the subgingival environment. Local and systemic factors may influence the composition of the biofilm and therefore elicit inflammatory response of the host and result in PD[5]. However, little research has been performed concerning the fluctuations in subgingival communities during the transition from health to disease. Socransky, et al.[6] have defined cluster community ordinations in subgingival human plaque microorganisms, tightly related within and between core groups characterized as complexes. This conceptual spatiotemporal model of human plaque has been characterized as the \u201cred\u201d, \u201corange\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cpurple\u201d complexes, exhibiting tight relationships with the clinical parameters measured for periodontal disease[7]. 1Companion Animal Clinic, School of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 2Private Practitioner, Thermi, Thessaloniki, Greece 3Laboratory teaching staff, Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Environmental Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 4Department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Implant Biology, School of Dentistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece",
