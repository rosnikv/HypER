        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of adjunctive prednisolone on morbidity, pericardial fluid resolution, and mortality in HIV seropositive patients with effusive tuberculous pericarditis. DESIGN Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial. SETTING Two medical school affiliated referral hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. PATIENTS 58 HIV seropositive patients aged 18\u201355 years with tuberculous pericarditis. INTERVENTIONS All patients received standard short course antituberculous chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to receive prednisolone or placebo for six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical improvement, echocardiographic and radiologic pericardial fluid resolution, and death. RESULTS 29 patients were assigned to prednisolone and 29 to placebo. After 18 months of follow up there were five deaths in the prednisolone treated group and 10 deaths in the placebo group. Mortality was significantly lower in the prednisolone group (log rank \u03c72\u2009=\u20098.19, df\u2009=\u20091, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Resolution of raised jugular venous pressure (p\u2009=\u20090.017), hepatomegaly (p\u2009=\u20090.007), and ascites (p\u2009=\u20090.015), and improvement in physical activity (p\u2009=\u20090.02), were significantly more rapid in the prednisolone treated patients. However, there was no difference in the rate of radiologic and echocardiographic resolution of pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive prednisolone for effusive tuberculous pericarditis produced a pronounced reduction in mortality. It is suggested prednisolone should be added to standard short course chemotherapy to treat HIV related effusive tuberculous pericarditis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is controversy regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids in tuberculous pericarditis, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised by HIV.\n\n\nAIM\nTo determine the effectiveness of adjuvant corticosteroids in tuberculous pericarditis.\n\n\nDESIGN\nSystematic review of randomized controlled trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (June 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2003), EMBASE (1980 to May 2002), and the reference lists of existing reviews, for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of adjuvant corticosteroids in the treatment of suspected tuberculous pericarditis. We also contacted organizations and individuals working in the field. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used meta-analysis with a fixed effects model to calculate the summary statistics, provided there was no statistically significant heterogeneity, and expressed results as relative risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFour trials with a total of 469 participants met our criteria. Three (total n = 411) tested adjuvant steroids in participants with suspected tuberculous pericarditis in the pre-HIV era. Fewer participants died in the intervention group, but the potentially large reduction in mortality was not statistically significant (relative risk RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.36-1.16, n = 350; p = 0.14). One trial with 58 patients that enrolled HIV-positive individuals also showed a promising but non-significant trend on mortality (RR 0.50, 95%CI 0.19-1.28; p = 0.15). There was no significant beneficial effect of steroids on re-accumulation of pericardial effusion or progression to constrictive pericarditis. Patients with pericardial effusion were significantly more likely to be alive with no functional impairment at 2 years following treatment. However, the effect was not sustained in a sensitivity analysis that included patients who were lost to follow-up.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nSteroids could have large beneficial effects on mortality and morbidity in tuberculous pericarditis, but published trials are too small to be conclusive. Large placebo-controlled trials are required, and should include sufficient numbers of HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants, and an adequate adjuvant steroid dose.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the single greatest health challenge facing Africa today. However, the impact of the HIV epidemic on the cardiovascular system in Africans has received scant attention in the world literature. Methods and Results\u2014 We searched MEDLINE (January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2004) and reference lists of literature on HIV and the heart in Africa and contacted experts in the field. The search for this review yielded 22 articles involving HIV and the cardiovascular system from 8 countries in Africa. Conclusions\u2014 The available information suggests that there are unique features in the etiology, presentation, and spectrum of HIV-associated cardiovascular disorders in people living in Africa. First, pericardial disease may be the initial manifestation of HIV infection in the early stages of the illness. Second, the etiology of cardiac disease tends to reflect the prevalent infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Third, unique cardiovascular disorders such as aneurysm of large vessels have been reported in association with HIV infection in several parts of Africa. Finally, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has put pressure on the meager healthcare resources and fragile infrastructure in many African countries, making the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease unrelated to HIV even more difficult.",

        "title": "Prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy in HIV-infected African patients not receiving HAART: a multicenter, observational, prospective, cohort study in Rwanda.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nSeveral studies performed before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have shown that HIV-1 infection is an important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. However, factors associated with the development of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy in developing countries are still debated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy, diagnosed by echocardiography, in HIV-infected Rwandese patients not receiving HAART and the risk factors associated with its development.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA sample of 416 HIV-infected african patients, without a previous definite history of cardiovascular disease, attending University hospitals in Rwanda, from January to December 2005, were included in a multicenter, observational, prospective, cohort study, with the collaboration of two European Clinical Centers (in France and in Italy). Clinical and laboratory tests along with echocardiographic examination were performed in all patients included in the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of 416 patients included in the study, dilated cardiomyopathy was documented by echocardiography in 71 (17.7%). By both univariate and multivariate analysis, low socio-economic status, estimated duration of HIV-1 infection, CD4 count, HIV-1 viral load, CDC stage B and C of HIV disease and low plasmatic level of selenium were factors significantly associated with the development of cardiomyopathy. Alcohol consumption and smoking were factors associated with the development of cardiomyopathy only by univariate analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHIV-associated cardiomyopathy is a significant clinical problem in HIV-infected patients not receiving HAART in Rwanda. Early tracking of cardiomyopathy in African HIV-infected patients is therefore recommended. Before administering HAART, clinicians should be aware of a possible existing cardiomyopathy to ensure appropriate, comprehensive, and rational patient care.",

        "abstract": "HIV infection is associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis. These conditions result in elevation of plasma natriuretic peptide (NP) levels. The present study compares N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) levels in HIV-infected and -uninfected women and identifies factors influencing NT-pro-BNP levels in HIV-infected women. A total of 454 HIV-infected and 200 HIV-uninfected participants from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) had NT-pro-BNP determination. Elevated NT-pro-BNP level was defined using previously determined age stratified cut-off values of >164 ng/liter (age <60 years) and >225 (age > or = 60 years). HIV-infected women were older (41.6 +/- 8.9 vs. 38.9 +/- 10.5 years, p < 0.01) and were more likely to have anemia, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, and kidney dysfunction than HIV-uninfected women. HIV-infected women had significantly higher NT-pro-BNP levels (142.4 +/- 524.8 vs. 73.6 +/- 115.1 ng/liter, p = 0.01) and a higher prevalence of elevated NT-pro-BNP (12.1% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.08). In univariate analyses, elevated NT-pro-BNP was significantly associated with age, systolic BP, hypertension, anemia, triglyceride levels, kidney disease, and HCV seropositivity, but not HIV infection. In multivariate analysis, elevated NT-pro-BNP levels were significantly associated with anemia and kidney function, and had a borderline association with the presence of HCV antibodies. Among HIV-infected women, NT-pro-BNP levels were not independently associated with measures of severity of infection or with HAART use. Although HIV-infected women have higher NT-pro-BNP levels than HIV-uninfected women, the differences are due to non-HIV factors such as anemia, kidney disease, and HCV coinfection. These findings suggest that natriuretic peptide levels are a global marker of comorbidity in the setting of HIV infection.",

        "abstract": "Background:Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing in HIV-infected patients. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a significant predictor of CVD in the general population. We aimed to quantify the risk of CVD events associated with NT-proBNP at baseline in the Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy study. Methods:In a nested case\u2013control study, NT-proBNP was measured at baseline in 186 patients who experienced a CVD event over an average of 2.8 years of follow-up and in 329 matched controls. Odds ratios (ORs) associated with baseline levels of NT-proBNP for CVD were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results:At baseline median NT-proBNP [interquartile range (IQR)] was 48.1 (18.5, 112.9) pg/ml in patients who developed a CVD event and 25.7 (12.4, 50.2) pg/ml in controls. The unadjusted OR for the highest versus the lowest quartile was 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1\u20136.5, P < 0.0001]. After adjustment for baseline covariates and CVD risk factors, OR was 2.8 (95% CI 1.4\u20135.6, P = 0.003); with additional adjustment for IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and D-dimer, OR was 2.3 (95% CI 1.1\u20134.9, P = 0.02).

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a significant predictor of CVD in the general population and is associated with mortality in HIV. Design and methods:The 96-week Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy Bone with Rosuvastatin in HIV (SATURN-HIV) trial randomized 147 patients on stable antiretroviral therapy with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level lower than 130\u200amg/dl and without overt heart failure to 10\u200amg daily rosuvastatin or placebo. We measured NT-proBNP levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Baseline and changes in NT-proBNP were compared between groups. Spearman correlation was used to explore relationships between baseline NT-proBNP, inflammation, and CVD risk markers. Multivariable analyses were conducted to assess associations with NT-proBNP levels. Results:Median age was 46 years, 80% were men, 69% were African American, and 46% were on protease inhibitors. At baseline, median (Q1, Q3) NT-proBNP was higher in the rosuvastatin group than placebo [41 (20, 66.5) versus 25\u200apg/ml (11, 56), P\u200a=\u200a0.012)]. Baseline NT-proBNP correlated with bulb and common carotid artery intima-media thickness, coronary calcium score, interleukin 6, and cystatin C.

        "abstract": "Objective: Vasoactive cardiovascular hormones such as the N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are produced upon ventricular stretch and play a central role in neurohumoral pathways of the heart regulating cardiovascular remodeling and volume homeostasis. The impact of HIV infection on these neurohumoral pathways of the heart and its potential reversibility by combinations of antiretroviral therapies remain unclear. Methods: We assessed serum levels of NT-proBNP in 219 antiretroviral therapy\u2013na\u00efve HIV-infected patients with a normal cardiac and renal status at treatment initiation and after attainment of viremic control. Results: Before antiretroviral therapy, NT-proBNP as a surrogate of myocardial function displayed a significant correlation with absolute CD4+ cell count (r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.31; P\u200a<\u200a0.001) as well as with HIV viral load (r\u200a=\u200a0.26; P\u200a<\u200a0.001).

After viremic control, no statistical correlation was present. Conclusion: Higher NT-proBNP levels were observed in treatment-na\u00efve patients with low CD4+ cell count and high HIV viral load, indicating a subclinical impact of HIV infection on myocardial function.

Participants Convenience sample of 200 PLHIV (\u226530 years with no prior history of CVD). Outcome measures Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and its association with hsTnI and hsCRP levels. Results Across 200 PLHIV (median age 46 years, IQR 38\u201353; 61% women), the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol >6.1\u2009mmol/L) and hypertension were 19% (n=30/199) and 30% (n=60/200), respectively. Smoking and diabetes prevalence was 3% (n=5/200) and 4% (n=7/200). HscTnI was below the limit of quantification (<2.5\u2009ng/L) in 65% (n=109/169). High (>3\u2009mg/L), intermediate (1\u20133\u2009mg/L) and low (<1\u2009mg/L) hsCRP levels were found in 38% (n=75/198), 33% (n=65/198) and 29% (n=58/198), respectively. Framingham laboratory-based risk scores classified 83% of PLHIV at low risk with 12% and 5% at intermediate and high risk, respectively. Older age (adjusted OR (aOR) per year increase 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08) and systolic blood pressure (140\u2013159\u2009mm Hg (aOR 2.96; 95%\u2009CI 1.09 to 7.90) and >160\u2009mm Hg (aOR 4.68, 95%\u2009CI 1.55 to 14) compared with <140\u2009mm Hg) were associated with hscTnI levels.
