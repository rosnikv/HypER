        "title": "Chelation Therapy for Intermittent Claudication: A Double\u2010Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of repeated intravenous infusions of EDTA, which has become known as \u201cchelation therapy,\u201d has been promoted for treating intermittent claudication as well as a wide range of other disorders. Multiple reports of excellent results in large numbers of patients have encouraged the use of this regimen. The lack of well-controlled studies substantiating the benefits of this treatment has limited its use mainly to private clinics. The aim of the study was to assess the benefits of chelation therapy in patients with intermittent claudication. Methods and ResultsA double-blind, randomized, controlled trial included 32 patients with intermittent claudication who were randomized to a treatment group (15) and a control group (17). Main outcome measures were subjective and measured walking distances and ankle/brachial pulse indices. Other outcome measures included lifestyle and subjective parameters of improvement, cardiac function, ECG, renal function, hematology, blood glucose, and lipid biochemistry. No clinically significant differences in main outcome measures between chelation therapy and placebo groups were detected up to 3 months after treatment. Measures of mood state, activities of daily living, and quality of life factors were not consistently affected by chelation therapy. An equal propor-tion (13%) of each group thought that they had received the active agent. The proportion of patients showing an improvement in walking distance was not significantly different between the chelation group (60%) and the control group (59%). ConclusionsChelation therapy has no significant beneficial effects over placebo in patients with intermittent claudication.",

        "title": "EDTA chelation treatment for peripheral vascular disease",
        "abstract": "DEAR SIR, this Journal and one other published the results of a study by Guldager et al. and associated Danish surgeons, Sloth-Nielsen et al. [ l , 21 which claimed to disprove the effectiveness of EDTA chelation treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Because this study and a recently published study by van Rij et al. [3] (both of which claim to be \u2018controlled \u2019 clinical trials) conflict with the vast preponderance of previously published work, they should be examined closely. Forty years of clinical experience and dozens of published studies have shown precisely the opposite effect. Olszewer & Carter [4] reported that 2379 out of 2482 cardiovascular patients had objective improvement with treatment. Chappell & Stahl [5] published a meta-analysis of 19 studies and 22 765 patients, which showed a correlation coefficient of 0.88 between treatment with EDTA and improvement in cardiovascular function. The same authors did a follow-up meta-analysis [6] using unpublished data collected from 1241 patients and 32 clinicians to examine for a \u2018Type 1 \u2019 publication bias. No such bias was found, and the correlation coefficient was identical. Hancke & Flytlie [7] reported that 82 of 92 patients who were on the waiting list for bypass or amputation were able to cancel their surgery after treatment. Clearly, there is a serious discrepancy between this data and the above-mentioned \u2018controlled \u2019 trials. Criticisms of the Danish surgeons\u2019 study have been published in other journals [%lo]. Some of the problems with the study were as follows. 1 Most of the subjects continued to smoke throughout the treatment and this added a highly significant confounding variable that by itself may have made the study biased and of questionable significance. 2 The study was not properly randomized or doubleblinded as claimed. This was confirmed by a report by the Danish Committee for Investigation into neither a blind post-tally nor a blind judge were used. 3 Very sick patients (A/B indices averaged 0.5) were given minimal treatment (30-40 treatments would be a standard course for patients with severe disease, not 20). 4 Magnesium is an important part of the protocol published by the American College for Advancement in Medicine [12], not only to reduce infusion pain but also because of its effect on the Ca/Mg pump across cell membranes and in bone remodelling. It also has a mild vasodilatory effect. The authors omitted magnesium from the treatment protocol and erroneously claimed that the ACAM protocol had been followed. This claim was also criticized by the uvvu. 5 On the one hand the surgeons claimed that disodium EDTA did not cause pain with infusion, but on the other hand they reported that more than onethird of the placebo group (given normal saline) and almost half of the treatment group suffered phlebitis as a side-effect. This is an extremely high incidence of phlebitis with normal saline infusion or even with EDTA treatment according to the generally accepted protocol. Furthermore, it is highly improbable that the authors\u2019 treatment solution (disodium EDTA with a pH of 3.8-4.5) would not cause pain with infusion and especially with infiltration. Disodium EDTA in a vein produces vasospasm even with a physiological pH. 6 Individual patients reported that they were instructed to attach their own i.v.s without close supervision [9]. This policy, coupled with the further report that the same patient had severe pain with one accidental infiltration and no pain with a larger one that occurred later, raises the possibility that some of the bottles may have been mixed up. This would explain why both the placebo and the treatment groups had about a 50% increase in walking distance. 7 Iron-containing supplements were given to subjects during each treatment.

        "title": "Applications Of EDTA Chelation Therapy",
        "abstract": "Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, or EDTA, is a synthetic amino acid approved by the FDA for the removal of toxic metal ions such as lead. EDTA is used in isolation for heavy metal poisoning; however, the vast majority of practitioners who offer intravenous EDTA treatments utilize it as a part of a comprehensive therapy program for treating atherosclerosis and other chronic degenerative diseases. Treatment is aimed at removing accumulations in the body of harmful levels of aluminum, iron, copper, and toxic heavy metals, all of which enhance free radical damage. Treatment objectives also include the removal of metastatic calcium from soft tissues, enhancement of the levels of ionic magnesium intracellularly, and reduction of pathologically enhanced clotting mechanisms, especially platelet adhesiveness. Because of its mechanism of action, EDTA chelation therapy might be useful to prevent or treat rapid oxidation of LDL cholesterol, ischemia-reperfusion injuries, arrythmias, hypertension in the presence of low-level lead accumulation, and congestive cardiomyopathy due to iron overload. Reports also indicate autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, and scleroderma respond to EDTA chelation therapy. (Alt Med Rev 1997;2(6):426-432)",

        "abstract": "As the prevalence of childhood and adolescent anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns continues to rise, there has been an unprecedented increase in support of mind-body practices like yoga, dance, meditation, mindfulness, aerobic exercise, and more-in part driven by the mental health burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While a growing body of evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of mind-body approaches, gaps in funding for and empirical research on mechanistic underpinnings, methodology development to assess multi-component therapeutic practices, dissemination and implementation, and diversity in researchers, practitioners, and recipients remain. As a consequence, the neurobiological impacts of mind-body techniques are not well understood nor broadly accepted as standard forms of care by clinicians and insurers-often being considered as 'alternative' rather than 'complementary' or 'integrative'. In this commentary, we summarize work from our labs and others highlighting the promise of mind-body approaches for improving mental health in youth, in line with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to address health disparities. We offer a potential framework for implementation and research-the Expressive Therapies Continuum. We also propose solutions to key research and policy gaps, that by could have positive public health impacts for those who are struggling and to prevent emergence of psychiatric illness, especially in developing youth.",

        "title": "Effects of mind\u2013body therapies on depression among adolescents: a systematic review and network meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Depression poses significant threats to adolescents\u2019 health globally. Research has shown the potential of mind\u2013body therapies to alleviate depression, but limited studies have directly compared the therapeutic effects of different types of mind\u2013body therapies on adolescent depression and the optimal therapy remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria to explore the effectiveness of different types of mind\u2013body therapies as interventions to improve depression among adolescents, and to identify the most effective interventions. Methods A comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus up to January 2024 was conducted to assess the impact of mind\u2013body therapies on depression among adolescents. The risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated using Cochrane Review Manager 5.4. STATA 18.0 was used for network meta-analysis. The node-splitting method was used to test the local inconsistency of the network meta-analysis. Funnel plots and the Egger\u2019s test were utilized to assess the potential impact of bias in this study. Result This network meta-analysis included 9 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 955 subjects. The results indicated that yoga, dance therapy and Tai Chi were more effective than other mind\u2013body therapies in reducing symptoms of depression among adolescents. Specifically, according to the SUCRA ranking, yoga was rated to be the optimal intervention for adolescents with depression (SCURA: 82.2%), followed by dance therapy (SCURA: 77.5%) and Tai Chi (SCURA: 64.9%). Conclusion This study revealed that mind\u2013body therapies have positive effects on improving depression among adolescents. Yoga may be the most effective intervention among the different types of mind\u2013body therapies. However, due to the small sample size of patients included, the certainty of the results was limited to some extent. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to strengthen the evidence base when more relevant studies become available.
