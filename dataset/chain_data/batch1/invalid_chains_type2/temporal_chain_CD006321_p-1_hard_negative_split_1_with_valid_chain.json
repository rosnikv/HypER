The aim of this study was to compare effects of this treatment regimen and placebo in patients with short-bowel syndrome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 8 patients with short-bowel syndrome (average small bowel length, 71 cm; mean duration, 12.9 years) was performed. Active treatment was growth hormone (0.14 mg.kg-1.day-1), oral glutamine (0.63 g.kg-1.day-1), and the HCLF diet for 21 days. The weight, basal metabolic rate, nutrient and electrolyte balance, serum insulin-like growth factor I levels, D-xylose absorption, morphology and DNA proliferation of small intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal transit were evaluated. Treatments were compared by paired t test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActive treatment transiently increased body weight, significantly but modestly increased the absorption of sodium and potassium, and decreased gastric emptying. The assimilation of macronutrients, stool volumes, and morphometry of small bowel mucosa were not statistically different in the two treatment arms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough treatment with growth hormone, glutamine, and HCLF diet for 3 weeks resulted in modest improvements in electrolyte absorption and delayed gastric emptying, there were no improvements in small bowel morphology, stool losses, or macronutrient absorption.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether treatment with a potent protease-resistant analog of human glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) might augment the adaptive response to massive intestinal resection, rats were divided into resected, which had 75% of the midjejunoileum removed, sham-resected, and nonsurgical groups. Within each group, animals were assigned to 21 days of treatment with the drug (0.1 \u03bcg/g of the GLP-2 analog in phosphate-buffered saline) or vehicle alone subcutaneously twice daily. Food intake; weight gain; jejunal and ileal diameters, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt depths, and villus heights; mucosal sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter, and micrograms of DNA per centimeter; andd-xylose absorption were measured. There was a significant increase in diameter, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt-villus height, sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter and micrograms of DNA per centimeter in both the jejunum and ileum in response to resection and a significant additive response to the GLP-2 analog in the jejunum but not in the ileum. The ratio of milligrams of protein per centimeter to micrograms of DNA per centimeter of mucosa was not different among groups, consistent with hyperplasia.d-Xylose absorption was significantly reduced in response to resection; however, the GLP-2 analog enhanced the absorptive capacity in control animals and restored the absorptive capacity in resected animals. Thus the GLP-2 analog induces mucosal hyperplasia and enhances the rate and magnitude of the proximal intestinal adaptive response to massive resection.",

        "abstract": "We wished to determine whether exogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 infusion stimulates intestinal growth in parenterally fed immature pigs. Piglets (106-108 days gestation) were given parenteral nutrient infusion (TPN), TPN + human GLP-2 (25 nmol. kg(-1). day(-1)), or sow's milk enterally (ENT) for 6 days. Intestinal protein synthesis was then measured in vivo after a bolus dose of [1-(13)C]phenylalanine, and degradation was calculated from the difference between protein accretion and synthesis. Crypt cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured in situ by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Intestinal protein and DNA accretion rates and villus heights were similar in GLP-2 and ENT pigs, and both were higher (P < 0.05) than in TPN pigs. GLP-2 decreased fractional protein degradation rate, whereas ENT increased fractional protein synthesis rate compared with TPN pigs. Percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in GLP-2 and ENT groups was 48 and 64% lower, respectively, than in TPN group (P < 0.05). However, ENT, but not GLP-2, increased percentage of BrdU-positive crypt cells above that in TPN piglets. We conclude that GLP-2 increases intestinal growth in premature, TPN-fed pigs by decreasing proteolysis and apoptosis, whereas enteral nutrition acts via increased protein synthesis and cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Exogenous glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) mimics the stimulatory effect of enteral nutrition on intestinal mucosal growth in preterm neonatal pigs. Little is known about its effects on small intestinal function. In this study, we investigated whether the trophic actions of GLP-2 and enteral nutrition are paralleled by effects on small intestinal function. Cesarean-delivered piglets (92% of gestation) were given either a parenteral nutrient infusion [total parenteral nutrition (TPN), n = 7], TPN + human GLP-2 (25 nmol/kg/d, n = 8), or enteral nutrition (ENT, n = 6) for 6 d. Gene expression (mRNA) and activities of lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), maltase-glucoamylase (MGA), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), aminopeptidase N (ApN), and A (ApA) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured. Both GLP-2 and enteral nutrition increased mucosal weight (+30\u201340%, p < 0.05) relative to TPN. GLP-2 stimulated jejunal MGA and SI mRNA abundance and activity levels but did not change LPH in parenterally fed pigs (p < 0.05). Enteral nutrition decreased jejunal LPH and MGA mRNA abundance and activity and increased ileal ApN, ApA, and DPP IV activities relative to TPN (p < 0.05). We conclude that GLP-2 and enteral nutrition exert different effects on intestinal enzyme function despite similar effects on intestinal growth. In addition, the effects of GLP-2 on intestinal function in these parenterally fed, premature neonatal pigs differed from those previously reported for similarly fed term neonates.",

        "abstract": "Intestinal function depends on the presence of luminal nutrients and is altered during starvation and refeeding. Amino acids are essential for enterocytes, but the luminal supply is compromised with changes in dietary intake. To test the hypothesis that during periods of restricted luminal nutrient availability mucosal cells undergo adaptations aimed toward preserving amino acid supply, the expression of amino acid and peptide transporter mRNAs was quantified in rats with no oral intake, whose nutritional status was maintained with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The role of the intestinotrophic hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) was investigated in the adaptive responses. Rats were administered TPN with or without exogenous GLP-2. Amino acid and peptide transporter mRNAs in small intestine mucosa were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Compared with orally fed rats, removal of luminal nutrition increased the expression of ASCT1, SAT2, and GLYT1 mRNAs in the duodenum and of ASCT2, EAAC1, NBAT, and PepT1 mRNAs in the ileum. CAT1, PAT1, and SN2 mRNA abundances were unaffected. GLP-2 reversed these effects. Three subgroups of transporters were identified by regional differences in response to TPN. This may reflect differing roles for substrates of transporters located apically and basally and along the proximal-distal axis of the intestine. The importance of maintaining amino acid supply for intestinal mucosal cells is illustrated.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Parenteral nutrition is a critically important intervention for children with intestinal dysfunctions. However, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with no enteral feeding is associated with small intestine atrophy and malabsorption, which complicate the transition to enteral nutrition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the intestinotrophic peptide glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which reduces TPN-associated atrophy and maintains nutrient absorption in adult rats, for preventing nutrient malabsorption in neonates receiving TPN. Methods: Term pigs obtained by cesarean delivery received from birth TPN alone (TPN; n = 7) or TPN with GLP-2 (25 nmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121; GLP-2; n = 8) or were fed sow milk enterally (n = 7). The small intestine was removed on postnatal day 6 to measure morphological responses and absorption of glucose, leucine, lysine and proline by intact tissues and brush border membrane vesicles and to quantify the abundances of mRNA and protein for enterocyte glucose transporters (SGLT-1 and GLUT2). Results: Relative to TPN alone, administration of GLP-2 resulted in small intestines that were larger (P < 0.01), had greater abundances of mRNA and protein for SGLT-1, but not for GLUT2, and had higher capacities to absorb nutrients (P < 0.01). Moreover, the intestines of GLP-2 pigs were comparable in size and absorptive capacities with those of pigs fed sow milk enterally. Conclusions: Providing GLP-2 to neonates receiving TPN prevents small intestine atrophy, results in small intestine absorptive capacities that are comparable to when nutrients are provided enterally and may accelerate the transition from TPN to enteral nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Luminal nutrients stimulate structural and functional regeneration in the intestine through mechanisms thought to involve insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). We investigated the relationship between IGF-I and GLP-2 responses and mucosal growth in rats fasted for 48 h and then refed for 2 or 4 days by continuous intravenous or intragastric infusion or ad libitum feeding. Fasting induced significant decreases in body weight, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and bioactive GLP-2, jejunal mucosal cellularity (mass, protein, DNA, and villus height), IGF-I mRNA, and ileal proglucagon mRNA. Plasma IGF-I concentration was restored to fed levels with 2 days of ad libitum refeeding but not with 4 days of intravenous or intragastric refeeding. Administration of an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-2 (rat GLP-2 3-33) during ad libitum refeeding partially attenuated mucosal growth and prevented the increase in plasma IGF-I to fed levels; however, plasma GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA were restored to fed levels. Intragastric refeeding restored intestinal cellularity and functional capacity (sucrase activity and sodium-glucose transporter-1 expression) to fed levels, whereas intravenous refeeding had no effect. Intestinal regeneration after 4 days of intragastric or 2 days of ad libitum refeeding was positively associated with increases in plasma concentrations of GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA.

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Obese and diabetic mice display enhanced intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxaemia that participate in the occurrence of metabolic disorders. Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

Recently, the mechanisms of ASD have encompassed emerging theories involving the gastrointestinal, immune, and nervous systems.

In this systematic review, we have synthesized relevant evidences from the existing literature, evaluating them in an interdependent manner and in doing so, outlining their possible connections. Specifically, we first discussed gastrointestinal and immuno-inflammation pathways in-depth, exploring the relationships between microbial composition, bacterial metabolites, gut mucosa, and immune system constituents. Accounting for temporal differences in the mechanisms involved in neurodevelopment, prenatal and postnatal phases were further elucidated, where the former focused on maternal immune activation (MIA) and fetal development, while the latter addressed the role of immune dysregulation in contributing to atypical neurodevelopment. As autism remains, foremost, a neurodevelopmental disorder, this review presents an integration of disparate modules into a \"Gut-Immune-Brain\" paradigm.

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 160 people in the world. Although there is a strong genetic heritability to ASD, it is now accepted that environmental factors can play a role in its onset. As the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is four-times higher in ASD patients, the potential implication of the gut microbiota in this disorder is being increasingly studied. A disturbed microbiota composition has been demonstrated in ASD patients, accompanied by altered production of bacterial metabolites. Clinical studies as well as preclinical studies conducted in rodents have started to investigate the physiological functions that gut microbiota might disturb and thus underlie the pathophysiology of ASD. The first data support an involvement of the immune system and tryptophan metabolism, both in the gut and central nervous system. In addition, a few clinical studies and a larger number of preclinical studies found that modulation of the microbiota through antibiotic and probiotic treatments, or fecal microbiota transplantation, could improve behavior. Although the understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in the physiopathology of ASD is only in its early stages, the data gathered in this review highlight that this role should be taken in consideration.",

Compared with control offspring, MIA male rat offspring spent less time in an active social interaction with stranger rats, displayed more anxiety-like and repetitive behavior, and had more hypomyelination in the prefrontal cortex and thalamic nucleus. A fecal microbiota analysis revealed that MIA offspring had a higher abundance of Alistipes, Fusobacterium, and Ruminococcus and a lower abundance of Coprococcus, Erysipelotrichaies, and Actinobacteria than control offspring, which is consistent with that of humans with ASD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to determine the relative importance of the microbiota, which indicated that the abundance of Alistipes and Actinobacteria was the most relevant for the profile of defective social behavior, whereas Fusobacterium and Coprococcus was associated with anxiety-like and repetitive behavior.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Maternal immune activation (MIA) is closely related to the onset of autism-like behaviors in offspring, but the mechanism remains unclear. Maternal behaviors can influence offspring\u2019s development and behaviors, as indicated in both human and animal studies. We hypothesized that abnormal maternal behaviors in MIA dams might be other factors leading to delayed development and abnormal behaviors in offspring. Methods: To verify our hypothesis, we analyzed poly(I:C)-induced MIA dam\u2019s postpartum maternal behavior and serum levels of several hormones related to maternal behavior. Pup\u2019s developmental milestones and early social communication were recorded and evaluated in infancy. Other behavioral tests, including three-chamber test, self-grooming test, open field test, novel object recognition test, rotarod test and maximum grip test, were performed in adolescence of pups. Results: Our results showed that MIA dams exhibit abnormal static nursing behavior but normal basic care and dynamic nursing behavior. The serum levels of testosterone and arginine vasopressin in MIA dams were significantly reduced compared with control dams. The developmental milestones, including pinna detachment, incisor eruption and eye opening, were significantly delayed in MIA offspring compared with control offspring, while the weight and early social communication showed no significant differences between the two groups. Behavioral tests performed in adolescence showed that only male MIA offspring display elevated self-grooming behaviors and reduced maximum grip. Discussion: In conclusion, MIA dams display abnormal postpartum static nursing behavior concomitantly with reduced serum levels of testosterone and arginine vasopressin, possibly involving in the pathogenesis of delayed development and elevated self-grooming in male offspring. These findings hint that improving dam\u2019s postpartum maternal behavior might be a potential regime to counteract delayed development and elevated self-grooming in male MIA offspring.",

        "abstract": "Infections during pregnancy are associated with increased risk for adult neuropsychiatric disease, such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder. In mouse models of maternal immune activation (MIA), different toll-like receptors (TLRs) are stimulated to initiate inflammatory responses in mother and fetus. The goal of this study was to determine sex-dependent aspects of MIA using a TLR7/8 agonist, Resiquimod (RQ), on neurodevelopment. RQ was administered to timed-pregnant mice on embryonic day (E) 12.5. At E15, maternal/fetal plasma cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Maternal cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were higher while tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-17 were lower in pregnant dams exposed to RQ. Fetal cytokines (E15) were altered at the same timepoint with fetal plasma IL-6 and IL-17 greater after RQ compared to vehicle, while IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were higher in male fetuses but not female. Other timed-pregnant dams were allowed to give birth. MIA with RQ did not alter the female to male ratio of offspring born per litter. Body weights were reduced significantly in both sexes at birth, and over the next 5\u2009weeks. Offspring from RQ-injected mothers opened their eyes 5\u2009days later than controls. Similarly, female offspring from RQ-injected mothers exhibited pubertal delay based on vaginal opening 2-3\u2009days later than control females. On the behavioral side, juvenile and adult male and female MIA offspring exhibited less social-like behavior in a social interaction test. Anhedonia-like behavior was greater in MIA adult female mice. This study provides support for sex-dependent influences of fetal antecedents for altered brain development and behavioral outputs that could be indicative of increased susceptibility for adult disorders through immune mechanisms. Future studies are needed to determine neural cellular and molecular mechanisms for such programming effects.",
