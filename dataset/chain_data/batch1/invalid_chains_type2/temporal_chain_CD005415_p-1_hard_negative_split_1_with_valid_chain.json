        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Pharmacotherapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding has been difficult to evaluate because clinical end points are infrequent and affected by other factors. AIMS To evaluate whether blood in the stomach at endoscopy reflected severity of bleeding, predicted clinical outcomes, and could be altered by therapeutic agents. METHODS We studied 414 consecutive admissions with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were randomised to receive lansoprazole 60 mg followed by 30 mg four times daily, tranexamic acid 2 g followed by 1 g four times daily, both drugs, or placebo for four days, until discharge or a clinical end point occurred. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of endoscopic changes and clinical outcomes, and to investigate the effects of drug treatments on blood in the stomach. RESULTS Of 414 patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 379 were endoscoped. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was confirmed in 316. Sixteen required surgery within 30 days and 16 died on the index admission. Trial treatments were evaluable on a per protocol basis in 228 patients. The amount of blood in the stomach was found to reflect initial risk, with significant associations with high risk categorisation (odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.5\u20139.4) for more than a trace v none/trace), age (1.5 (1.1\u20131.9) per decade), and initial pulse (1.02 (1.00\u20131.04) per beat), and to predict rebleeding (9.2 (4.6\u201318.7)) and surgery (8.2 (2.9\u201322.9)). Other stigmata were less significant in these respects. The amount of blood in the stomach at endoscopy was reduced significantly by both lansoprazole (0.22 (0.07\u20130.63)) and tranexamic acid (0.27 (0.09\u20130.81)), although there was no evidence of synergy. CONCLUSIONS Blood in the stomach reflects clinical features in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is reduced by treatment with lansoprazole and tranexamic acid.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a pilot, non-randomized trial we tested the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent fibrinolytic inhibitor, as adjunctive therapy in standard treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty consecutive patients (12 male, eight female; 63+/-8 years) with 36 episodes of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding were included in the study. In 16 episodes of bleeding TXA was used (in a dosage of 20 mg intravenously, followed for the next 4 weeks by 10 mg/kg/48 h orally), whereas in 20 other cases of bleeding, TXA was not used. The decision to use TXA was left to the attending physician's clinical judgement, resulting in all the more severe cases of bleeding being treated with TXA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment including TXA was shown to be beneficial (relative to cases not treated with TXA) in terms of decreasing the rate of early re-bleeding (in the first week, 0 vs 6, P<0.05), the rate of early and late re-bleeding (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05), the rate of repeated endoscopic procedures (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05) and the number of blood transfusions needed (in the first month, 1.4+/-1.3 vs 2.6+/-1.5 units, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this pilot study suggest that TXA can be beneficial in the treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients. This remains to be definitely confirmed in a randomized study.",

        "abstract": "Summary Some previous studies suggest that activation of the fibrinolytic system may induce platelet dysfunction in haemodialysis patients. Accordingly, inhibition of fibrinolysis may improve platelet dysfunction, and speculatively increase haemoglobin levels. We tested this hypothesis. The study group comprised 22 patients (14 male, 8 female, median age 62), who had been on maintenance haemodialysis for more than one year. Patients were treated for three months with low-dose tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent anti-fibrinolytic agent. The dosages of erythropoietin and the haemodialysis procedure were not changed significantly during the study. We primarily followed platelet function (by in vitro closure time test) and haemoglobin values. Patients were divided into those with substantially prolonged (N=9) and those with slightly delayed or normal (N=13) in vitro closure time. Treatment with TXA resulted in a significant improvement of platelet function and increased levels of haemoglobin in the first group, and no changes in either platelet function or haemoglobin values in the second group. TXA in the dosage used was biologically active, since a significant decrease in plasminogen and D-dimer were found in both groups. No significant changes in other fibrinolytic parameters or von Willebrand factor were found. No complications in terms of arterial or venous thrombosis were observed. Our pilot study suggests that long term, low-dose TXA treatment of haemodialysis patients with substantially prolonged in vitro closure time results in a significant improvement of platelet dysfunction and a significant increase in haemoglobin values. These new, promising results merit further investigation in larger studies.",

        "abstract": "We describe a successful treatment of a severe, persistent bleeding from both kidneys in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent antifibrinolytic agent. The bleeding could not be controlled by intensive conservative treatment, it became life-threatening and urgent bilateral nephrectomy was intended. Since local and systemic hyperfibrinolysis play a role in bleeding in ADPKD patients, we tried TXA treatment. In fact, the massive bleeding promptly stopped, and haematuria gradually ceased. Removal of both kidneys was prevented. After 5 days both ureters became obstructed by blood clots, but placing J-catheters in each pyelon successfully solved this complication. Our case shows that it is reasonable to try antifibrinolytic treatment with TXA in such devastating uncontrolled bleeding.",

        "abstract": "This is the first report of a case of a reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function in a patient with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) receiving rapamycin. A 42-year-old man with ADPKD and a severe persistent bleeding from his solitary left kidney was successfully treated with tranexamic acid (TXA). He also received low-dose rapamycin for 8 months, and this was associated with a 23.5% reduction in kidney volume, improvement and stabilization of renal function, and normalization of haemoglobin levels. When treatment with rapamycin was interrupted, renal function deteriorated within an 8-month period and haemodialysis (HD) became necessary. Kidney volume increased at once, and life-threatening bleeding prompted a nephrectomy 4 months after the onset of HD. These data suggest that the reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function with rapamycin could be the result of the antiangiogenic, antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.",

To address this limitation, we tested the efficacy of rapamycin in a mouse model that results from conditional inactivation of Pkd1. Mosaic deletion of Pkd1 resulted in PKD and replicated characteristic features of human PKD including aberrant mTOR activation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis, and progressive fibrosis. Treatment with rapamycin was highly effective: It reduced cyst growth, preserved renal function, inhibited epithelial cell proliferation, increased apoptosis of cyst-lining cells, and inhibited fibrosis. These data provide in vivo evidence that rapamycin is effective in a human-orthologous mouse model of PKD.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) lead to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a leading cause of renal failure for which no treatment is available. PC1 is an integral membrane protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that membrane-anchored PC1 activates STAT3 in a JAK2-dependent manner, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC1 can undergo proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation. Tail-cleavage abolishes the ability of PC1 to directly activate STAT3 but the cleaved PC1 tail now coactivates STAT3 in a mechanism requiring STAT phosphorylation by cytokines or growth factors. This leads to an exaggerated cytokine response. Hence, PC1 can regulate STAT activity by a dual mechanism. In ADPKD kidneys PC1 tail fragments are overexpressed, including a unique \u223c15-kDa fragment (P15). STAT3 is strongly activated in cyst-lining epithelial cells in human ADPKD, and orthologous and nonorthologous polycystic mouse models. STAT3 is also activated in developing, postnatal kidneys but inactivated in adult kidneys. These results indicate that STAT3 signaling is regulated by PC1 and is a driving factor for renal epithelial proliferation during normal renal development and during cyst growth.",

        "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a most common genetic cause of chronic renal failure, is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of cysts in kidneys and other organs. The cystogenic process is highly complex and involves a high proliferative rate, increased apoptosis, altered protein sorting, changed secretory characteristics, and disorganization of the extracellular matrix. ADPKD is caused by mutations in the genes encoding polycystin-1 (PC-1) or polycystin-2 (PC-2). PC-1 undergoes multiple cleavages that intervene in several signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation mechanisms. One of these cleavages releases the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PC-1. In addition, the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of PC-1 and PC-2 interact in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature that suggests that PC-1 and PC-2 may function through a common signaling pathway necessary for normal tubulogenesis. We hope that a better understanding of PC-1 and PC-2 protein function will lead to progress in diagnosis and treatment for ADPKD.",

        "title": "Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disorder With Pleiotropic Effects",
        "abstract": "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is an important cause of chronic kidney disease in children. The care of ARPKD patients has traditionally been the realm of pediatric nephrologists; however, the disease has multisystem effects, and a comprehensive care strategy often requires a multidisciplinary team. Most notably, ARPKD patients have congenital hepatic fibrosis, which can lead to portal hypertension, requiring close follow-up by pediatric gastroenterologists. In severely affected infants, the diagnosis is often first suspected by obstetricians detecting enlarged, echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios on prenatal ultrasounds. Neonatologists are central to the care of these infants, who may have respiratory compromise due to pulmonary hypoplasia and massively enlarged kidneys. Surgical considerations can include the possibility of nephrectomy to relieve mass effect, placement of dialysis access, and kidney and/or liver transplantation. Families of patients with ARPKD also face decisions regarding genetic testing of affected children, testing of asymptomatic siblings, or consideration of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for future pregnancies. They may therefore interface with genetic counselors, geneticists, and reproductive endocrinologists. Children with ARPKD may also be at risk for neurocognitive dysfunction and may require neuropsychological referral. The care of patients and families affected by ARPKD is therefore a multidisciplinary effort, and the general pediatrician can play a central role in this complex web of care. In this review, we outline the spectrum of clinical manifestations of ARPKD and review genetics of the disease, clinical and genetic diagnosis, perinatal management, management of organ-specific complications, and future directions for disease monitoring and potential therapies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review To describe the recent increase in the understanding of the clinical manifestation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene. The change in nomenclature reflects the genetic contribution to the understanding of pleiotropic disease manifestations. The term \u2018hepatorenal fibrocystic disorder\u2019 or \u2018ARPKD\u2013congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF)\u2019 addresses the major organ manifestations of the disease. Recent findings More than 300 different mutations in the PKHD1 gene have been described; however, there is no genotype\u2013phenotype correlation. Cystic phenotype in the kidneys is highly variable. Renal oligohydramnios before 28 weeks of gestation may be lethal, whereas perinatal manifestations have a better prognosis. More than 60% of neonates with pulmonary hypoplasia may survive; about 25% need postnatal dialysis. After 10 years, 60% require renal replacement therapy. Liver fibrosis is always found and cholangiodysplasia is common. The Caroli phenotype is seen in up to 80% with perinatal manifestation. Recurrent cholangitis and cirrhosis may require liver transplantation in about 10% of patients. Neurocognitive development is in the usual range of children with moderate renal failure, but deserves further research. Summary The pleiotropic manifestations of ARPKD\u2013CHF require multidisciplinary efforts to anticipate organ complications and to improve a possible good prognosis.",

        "abstract": "AIM To investigate the therapeutic potential of tesevatinib (TSV), a unique multi-kinase inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), in well-defined rodent models of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). METHODS We administered TSV in daily doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg per day by I.P. to the well characterized bpk model of polycystic kidney disease starting at postnatal day (PN) 4 through PN21 to assess efficacy and toxicity in neonatal mice during postnatal development and still undergoing renal maturation. We administered TSV by oral gavage in the same doses to the orthologous PCK model (from PN30 to PN90) to assess efficacy and toxicity in animals where developmental processes are complete. The following parameters were assessed: Body weight, total kidney weight; kidney weight to body weight ratios; and morphometric determination of a cystic index and a measure of hepatic disease. Renal function was assessed by: Serum BUN; creatinine; and a 12 h urinary concentrating ability. Validation of reported targets including the level of angiogenesis and inhibition of angiogenesis (active VEGFR2/KDR) was assessed by Western analysis. RESULTS This study demonstrates that: (1) in vivo pharmacological inhibition of multiple kinase cascades with TSV reduced phosphorylation of key mediators of cystogenesis: EGFR, ErbB2, c-Src and KDR; and (2) this reduction of kinase activity resulted in significant reduction of renal and biliary disease in both bpk and PCK models of ARPKD. The amelioration of disease by TSV was not associated with any apparent toxicity. CONCLUSION The data supports the hypothesis that this multi-kinase inhibitor TSV may provide an effective clinical therapy for human ARPKD.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling is a common therapeutic strategy in oncology, with new drugs continuously in development. In this review, we consider the experimental and clinical evidence behind the diverse nephrotoxicities associated with the inhibition of this pathway. We also review the renal effects of VEGF inhibition's mediation of key downstream signaling pathways, specifically MAPK/ERK1/2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Direct VEGFA inhibition via antibody binding or VEGF trap (a soluble decoy receptor) is associated with renal-specific thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Reports also indicate that tyrosine kinase inhibition of the VEGF receptors is preferentially associated with glomerulopathies such as minimal change disease and FSGS. Inhibition of the downstream pathway RAF/MAPK/ERK has largely been associated with tubulointerstitial injury. Inhibition of mTOR is most commonly associated with albuminuria and podocyte injury, but has also been linked to renal-specific TMA. In all, we review the experimentally validated mechanisms by which VEGFA-VEGFR2 inhibitors contribute to nephrotoxicity, as well as the wide range of clinical manifestations that have been reported with their use. We also highlight potential avenues for future research to elucidate mechanisms for minimizing nephrotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.",

        "abstract": "In light of positive efficacy and safety findings from the IMbrave150 trial of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, this novel combination has become the preferred first-line standard of care for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several additional trials are ongoing that combine an immune checkpoint inhibitor with another agent such as a multiple kinase inhibitor or antiangiogenic agent. Therefore, the range of first-line treatment options for unresectable HCC is likely to increase, and healthcare providers need succinct information about the use of such combinations, including their efficacy and key aspects of their safety profiles. Here, we review efficacy and safety data on combination immunotherapies and offer guidance on monitoring and managing adverse events, especially those associated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Because of their underlying liver disease and high likelihood of portal hypertension, patients with unresectable HCC are at particular risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and this risk may be exacerbated by treatments that include antiangiogenic agents. Healthcare providers also need to be alert to the risks of proteinuria and hypertension, colitis, hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis B or C virus infection. They should also be aware of the possibility of rarer but potentially life-threatening adverse events such as pneumonitis and cardiovascular events. Awareness of the risks associated with these therapies and knowledge of adverse event monitoring and management will become increasingly important as the therapeutic range broadens in unresectable HCC.",

In the subgroup analysis, BV plus targeted therapy had the longest median onset time of 90.5 days (IQR 34-178.5 days), while BV plus chemotherapy had the shortest of 40.5 days (IQR 14\u201390.25). BV plus chemotherapy disproportionately reported the highest percentage of death (148 deaths out of 292 cases, 50.68%). Moreover, the BV-related treatments including four subgroups in our study demonstrated the positive signals with the association of disproportionate reporting of pulmonary haemorrhage and haemoptysis. Notably, BV plus chemotherapy showed a significant higher reporting risk in pulmonary haemorrhage and haemoptysis signals of disproportionate reporting in comparison to BV monotherapy (ROR 5.35 [95% CI, 4.78\u20136.02] vs. ROR 4.19 [95% CI, 3.56\u20134.91], p = 0.0147). Conclusion: This study characterized the reporting of pulmonary haemorrhage and haemoptysis, along with the time to onset and demographic characteristics among different BV-related treatment options. It could provide valuable evidence for further studies and clinical practice of BV.",
