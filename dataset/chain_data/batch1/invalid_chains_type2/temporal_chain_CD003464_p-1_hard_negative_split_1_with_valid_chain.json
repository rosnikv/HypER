        "title": "A comparison of aspirin with placebo in patients treated with warfarin after heart-valve replacement.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite the use of warfarin, major systemic embolism remains an important complication in patients with heart-valve replacement. Although the addition of antiplatelet agents has the potential to reduce this complication, their efficacy and safety when given in combination with warfarin are uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of adding aspirin (100 mg per day) to warfarin treatment (target international normalized ratio, 3.0 to 4.5) in 370 patients with mechanical heart valves or with tissue valves plus atrial fibrillation or a history of thromboembolism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 186 patients were randomly assigned to aspirin and 184 to placebo, and they were followed for up to 4 years (average, 2.5). Major systemic embolism or death from vascular causes occurred in 6 aspirin-treated patients (1.9 percent per year) and 24 placebo-treated patients (8.5 percent per year) (risk reduction with aspirin, 77 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 44 to 91 percent; P < 0.001). Major systemic embolism, nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage, or death from hemorrhage or vascular causes occurred in 12 patients assigned to aspirin (3.9 percent per year) and 28 patients assigned to placebo (9.9 percent per year) (risk reduction, 61 per cent; 95 percent confidence interval, 24 to 80 percent; P = 0.005); major systemic embolism or death from any cause occurred in 13 patients (4.2 percent) and 33 patients (11.7 percent), respectively (risk reduction, 65 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 33 to 82 percent; P < 0.001); and death from all causes occurred in 9 patients (2.8 percent) and 22 patients (7.4 percent), respectively (risk reduction, 63 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 83 percent; P = 0.01). Bleeding occurred in 71 patients in the aspirin group (35.0 percent), as compared with 49 patients in the placebo group (22.0 percent) (increase in risk, 55 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 124 percent; P = 0.02); major bleeding occurred in 24 and 19 patients, respectively (increase in risk, 27 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -30 to 132 percent; P = 0.43).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with mechanical heart valves and high-risk patients with prosthetic tissue valves, the addition of aspirin to warfarin therapy reduced mortality, particularly mortality from vascular causes, together with major systemic embolism. Although there was some increase in bleeding, the risk of the combined treatment was more than offset by the considerable benefit.",

        "title": "Collaborative overview of randomised trials of antiplatelet therapy Prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke by prolonged antiplatelet therapy in various categories of patients",
        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To determine the effects of \u201cprolonged\u201d antiplatelet therapy (that is, given for one month or more) on \u201cvascular events\u201d (non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes, or vascular deaths) in various categories of patients. Design: Overviews of 145 randomised trials of \u201cprolonged\u201d antiplatelet therapy versus control and 29 randomised comparisons between such antiplatelet regimens. Setting: Randomised trials that could have been available by March 1990. Subjects: Trials of antiplatelet therapy versus control included about 70 000 \u201chigh risk\u201d patients (that is, with some vascular disease or other condition implying an increased risk of occlusive vascular disease) and 30 000 \u201clow risk\u201d subjects from the general population. Direct comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens involved about 10 000 high risk patients. Results: In each of four main high risk categories of patients antiplatelet therapy was definitely protective. The percentages of patients suffering a vascular event among those allocated antiplatelet therapy versus appropriately adjusted control percentages (and mean scheduled treatment durations and net absolute benefits) were: (a) among about 20 000 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 10% antiplatelet therapy v 14% control (one month benefit about 40 vascular events avoided per 1000 patients treated (2P< 0.00001)); (b) among about 20 000 patients with a past history of myocardial infarction, 13% antiplatelet therapy v 17% control (two year benefit about 40/1000 (2P<0.00001)); (c) among about 10 000 patients with a past history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 18% antiplatelet therapy v 22% control (three year benefit about 40/1000 (2P<0.00001)); (d) among about 20 000 patients with some other relevant medical history (unstable angina, stable angina, vascular surgery, angioplasty, atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, peripheral vascular disease, etc), 9% v 14% in 4000 patients with unstable angina (six month benefit about 50/1000 (2P<0.00001)) and 6% v 8% in 16 000 other high risk patients (one year benefit about 20/1000 (2P<0.00001)). Reductions in vascular events were about one quarter in each of these four main categories and were separately statistically significant in middle age and old age, in men and women, in hypertensive and normotensive patients, and in diabetic and non: diabetic patients. Taking all high risk patients together showed reductions of about one third in non-fatal myocardial infarction, about one third in non-fatal stroke, and about one sixth in vascular death (each 2P<0.00001). There was no evidence that non-vascular deaths were increased, so in each of the four main high risk categories overall mortality was significantly reduced. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was \u201cmedium dose\u201d (75-325 mg/day) aspirin. Doses throughout this range seemed similarly effective (although in an acute emergency it might be prudent to use an initial dose of 160-325 mg rather than about 75 mg). There was no appreciable evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. The optimal duration of treatment for patients with a past history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack could not be determined directly because most trials lasted only one, two, or three years (average about two years). Nevertheless, there was significant (2P<0.00001) further benefit between the end of year 1 and the end of year 3, suggesting that longer treatment might well be more effective. Among low risk recipients of \u201cprimary prevention\u201d a significant reduction of one third in non: fatal myocardial infarction was, however, accompanied by a non-significant increase in stroke. Furthermore, the absolute reduction in vascular events was much smaller than for high risk patients despite a much longer treatment period (4.4% antiplatelet therapy v 4.8% control; five year benefit only about four per 1000 patients treated) and was not significant (2P=0.09). Conclusions: Among a much wider range of patients at high risk of occlusive vascular disease than is currently treated routinely, some years of antiplatelet therapy - with aspirin 75-325 mg/day or some other antiplatelet regimen (provided there are no contraindications) - offers worthwhile protection against myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Significant benefit is evident not only among patients with unstable angina, suspected acute myocardial infarction, or a past history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, but also among many other categories of high risk patients (such as those having vascular procedures and those with stable angina or peripheral vascular disease). There is as yet, however, no clear evidence on the balance of risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapy in primary prevention among low risk subjects.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To describe the investigation and management of patients admitted to hospitals in China with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and to identify potential areas for improvement in practice. Design: A multicentre prospective survey of sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, in-hospital investigations, treatment practices and major events among patients with suspected ACS. Setting: Large urban public hospitals. Patients: Consecutive patients admitted to in-patient facilities with a diagnosis of suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina pectoris. Main outcome measures: Myocardial infarction/re-infarction, heart failure, death. Results: Between September 2004 and May 2005, data were collected prospectively from 2973 patients admitted to 51 hospitals in 18 provinces of China. An initial diagnosis of ST elevation MI, non-ST elevation MI and unstable angina was made in 43%, 11% and 46% of patients, respectively. Diagnosis was inconsistent with objective measures in up to 20% of cases. At both tertiary and non-tertiary centres, there was little evidence that clinical risk stratification was used to determine the intensity of investigation and management. The mortality rate during hospitalisation was 5% overall and similar in tertiary and non-tertiary centres, but reported in-hospital re-infarction rates (8%) and heart failure rates (16%) were substantially higher at non-tertiary centres. Conclusion: This study has identified a number of areas in the management of ACS patients, including diagnosis and risk stratification, which deviate from current guidelines. These findings will help inform the introduction of widely used quality improvement initiatives such as clinical pathways.",

        "abstract": "Background Long\u2010term use of antiplatelet agents, statins, beta\u2010blockers and angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors are proven therapies for secondary prevention in acute coronary syndrome. However, little is known of physicians\u2019 opinion about their use in China. Methods In 2010, standard questionnaires were posted to chief cardiologists in 1397 geographically diverse and representative sample of tertiary and secondary hospitals in China, collecting information about their opinions on the recommended treatments for acute coronary syndrome. Results A total of 1009 (72%) cardiologists responded with a valid questionnaire. Of them, 77% reported routine use of all the four main secondary preventive treatments, with little difference between secondary and tertiary hospitals (75% vs. 79%, P=0.16). Of the cardiologists reporting routine or selective use of aspirin, beta\u2010blockers, statins and angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors, 94%, 85%, 73% and 86% would recommend indefinite use respectively. For all the 4 treatments combined, only 63.5% reported indefinite use at the same time, with no significant difference between secondary and tertiary hospitals (62% vs. 65%, P=0.17), nor between hospitals with or without fast track for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (66% vs. 61%, P=0.50). Conclusions Although Chinese cardiologists seem well informed about the value of main secondary preventive treatments for acute coronary syndrome, there is still gap in their understanding of the need for combined and prolonged use of these treatments.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the reperfusion time in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Henan Province, China, and discuss the strategies for shortening that period. Methods: The reperfusion times of 1556 STEMI cases in 30 hospitals in Henan Province were analyzed from January 2008 to August 2012, including 736 cases from provincial hospitals, 462 cases from municipal hospitals and 358 cases from country hospitals. The following data: Time period 1 (from symptom onset to first medical contact), Time period 2 (from first medical contact to diagnosis), Time period 3 (from the diagnosis to providing consent), Time period 4 (from the time of providing consent to the beginning of treatment) and Time period 5 (from the beginning of treatment to the patency) were recorded and analyzed. Results: In patients receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention, the door-to-balloon time of provincial hospitals and municipal hospitals was 172\u00b113 minutes and 251\u00b114 minutes, respectively. The hospitals at both levels had a delay comparison of 90 minutes largely caused by the delay in the time for obtaining consent. In patients receiving thrombolysis treatment, the door-to-needle times of provincial hospitals, municipal hospitals and country hospitals were 86\u00b17, 91\u00b17 and 123\u00b111 minutes, respectively. The hospitals at all levels had delays lasting more than 30 minutes, which was mainly attributed to the delay in the time for providing consent. Compared with the time required by the guidelines, the reperfusion time of patients with STEMI in China is evidently delayed. In terms of China's national conditions, the door-to-balloon time is too general. Therefore, we suggest refining this time as the first medical contact\u2013diagnosis time, consent provision time, therapy preparation time and the start of therapy balloon time. Conclusion: Compared to the time required by the guidelines, the reperfusion time of patients with STEMI in China was obviously greater. In terms of China's national conditions, the door to balloon time is not applicable. So it is suggested to refine it as the first medical contact-diagnosis time, providing consent time, therapy prepare time and the start of therapy \u2013 balloon time.",

        "abstract": "Objective This study is to document the clinical characteristics and improvement in management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Chinese population. Results This study included 64,654 patients (23,805 patients in 2011, 40,849 patients in 2013), of which STEMI and NSTEMI account for 85.09% and 14.91%, respectively. From 2011 to 2013, significant improvement has been achieved in the recanalization rate of PCI (96.01% vs. 98.63%, P < 0.001) and in-hospital deaths (4.52% vs. 3.55%, P = 0.038). Although the time of door-to-balloon and the duration of PCI were satisfactorily controlled within 90min and 60min, respectively, the onset-to-FMC time (\u22483.5h) and door-to-thrombolysis time (\u22481.1h) limited the efficiency of management. The total cost of medical care showed no increase from 2011 to 2013, but the patient's paid Portion decreased from 20.33% to 13.96%. Materials and Methods The AMI patients admitted in the general hospitals in 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed according to the data reported to the Single Disease Quality Control Information Systemissued by Chinese Hospital Association. Conclusion Compared to the Western countries, STEMI accounted for a larger portion of AMI, and the AMI management in China basically meets the standards of the quality control of guidelines. With improvement of management, there was no increase in the total medical cost, while the patient's paid portion was actually reduced. In future, improvement of transportation strategy and the public medical education are recommended to shorten the onset-to-FMC time to further improve the outcome of AMI patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the clinical effect of aspirin combined with clopidogrel on acute myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: One hundred thirty two patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to the hospital between December 2016 and December 2017 were divided into a control group and an observation group according to random number table, 66 each group. Both groups were given emergency PCI and symptomatic treatment. The control group was given aspirin on the basis of conventional treatment before and after operation, while the observation group was given clopidogrel treatment on the basis of the treatment the same as the control group. The treatment lasted for 4 months. The clinical efficacy of the two groups was analyzed, and the cardiac function indicator, coagulation indicator and occurrence of adverse reactions were compared before and after treatment. Results: There was no thrombosis at the infarct site in coronary angiography after treatment in both groups. The efficacy in the observation group and control group were 89.4% and 81.8%, respectively; there was no significant difference between the two groups. The incidence of re-thrombosis in the two groups was 1.5% and 12.1% respectively, which was significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). The cardiac function indicator of both groups improved after treatment, especially the observation group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin activity (PA) and platelet aggregation rate (PAR) in the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). There was also no significant difference in PT and PA before and after treatment (P>0.05). The APTT and PAR were significantly different after treatment (P<0.05), and the PAR of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group was 7.58%, which was not significantly different with that of the control group (12.12%) (P<0.05). Conclusion: Aspirin combined with clopidogrel can effectively reduce the occurrence of re-thrombosis after PCI and improve the recovery of cardiac function after acute operation, moreover the safety is high. It has important clinical application values.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the effect of clopidogrel combined with aspirin in the treatment of acute progressive cerebral infarction (APCI). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 190 patients with APCI admitted to Chengdu First People\u2019s Hospital from September 2020 to April 2023. The records were divided into an aspirin group (76 cases), a clopidogrel group (72 cases), and a clopidogrel plus aspirin group (42 cases) according to the treatment records. We compared the efficacy of the three treatment outcomes by analyzing the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, and the levels of serum inflammatory factors (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2), cone like protein-1 (VILIP-1), and caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Results: The total efficacy of the combination group (97.62%) was significantly higher than those of the aspirin group (73.68%) or the clopidogrel group (79.17%) (p<0.05). After treatment, the NIHSS scores, inflammatory factor levels, serum VILIP-1 and Cav-1 levels were significantly lower than those before treatment in the three groups, but all the levels were significantly lower in the combination group (all p<0.05). Conclusions: Our results indicate that compared with aspirin alone or clopidogrel alone, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective for the treatment of APCI. The combination regimen effectively lowers serum inflammatory factors (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2), as well as the VILIP-1 and Cav-1 levels.",
