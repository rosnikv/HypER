        "abstract": "There is no known cure for Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), but a better understanding of the evidence base of both established treatments (such as enteral nutrition, corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates and immunosuppressive agents) and emerging treatments (such as the anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (anti-TNF-\u03b1) agents, infliximab and adalimumab) provides opportunities to improve and maintain the quality of life for children with the disease. This article provides an overview of the evidence base of current medical treatments that are used to induce and maintain remission in CD. Exclusive enteral nutrition is recommended as the first line of treatment for the induction of remission in paediatric CD. Corticosteroids are also effective for inducing remission but may be associated with significant adverse events. Patients with chronically active CD may benefit from immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and methotrexate. Infliximab is effective for inducing remission in patients who continue to have significant active disease despite the use of conventional treatments. Adalimumab may be indicated for patients who develop a severe allergic reaction to infliximab or those who initially respond to infliximab but subsequently lose their response. Treatments that have been shown to be effective for the maintenance of remission include azathioprine, methotrexate, infliximab and adalimumab. Recent evidence also suggests that long-term enteral nutritional supplementation with patients taking about half of their daily calorie requirements as enteral nutrition may be an effective strategy for the maintenance of remission in CD. The available evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids or 5-aminosalicylates as maintenance therapy for CD.",

Management of CGD colitis is a challenge because standard immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of infection in already immunocompromised hosts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe report the use of infliximab in 5 patients with CGD.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInfliximab administration predisposed patients to severe infections with typical CGD pathogens but not mycobacteria, as reported with infliximab in other conditions. In addition to infections, infliximab administration led to successful closure of fistulae, sometimes with other untoward consequences. Infliximab-associated complications were associated with 2 deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInfliximab use in the treatment of CGD inflammatory bowel disease requires aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis, assiduous surveillance for infection, and vigilance for untoward gastrointestinal complications. This experience suggests that infliximab therapy is effective but has untoward consequences in patients with CGD.",

Interestingly, Aspergillus (Emericella) nidulans is the second most encountered mold in CGD patients, causing almost exclusively invasive infections in this specific host, and is characterized by its aggressive behavior. A proper diagnosis is complicated by the often mild clinical presentation, the low sensitivity of the currently used diagnostic tools, and the difficulties in accurate identification of the Emericella species. According to the hitherto accepted view on the role of the NADPH-oxidase in the innate host-defense pathway, the pathogenesis of A. nidulans in CGD cannot be explained.

Fungal pathogenesis is the result of a diminished antifungal capacity and dysregulated inflammation. A deficient NADPH-oxidase complex results in defective phagolysosomal alkalization. To investigate the contribution of defective pH regulation in phagocytes among patients with CGD during fungal pathogenesis, we evaluated the effect of the acidotropic, antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) on the antifungal capacity of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and on the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Chloroquine exerted a direct pH-dependent antifungal effect on Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans; it increased the antifungal activity of PMNs from patients with CGD at a significantly lower concentration, compared with the concentration for PMNs from healthy individuals; and decreased the hyperinflammatory state of PBMCs from patients with CGD, as observed by decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 1\u03b2 release. Chloroquine targets both limbs of fungal pathogenesis and might be of great value in the clearance of invasive aspergillosis in patients with CGD.",

        "abstract": "NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms together have multiple functions that are important for normal physiology and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2) is critical for antimicrobial host defence. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder of NOX2 characterized by severe life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and by excessive inflammation, including Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NOX2 defends against microbes through the direct antimicrobial activity of reactive oxidants and through activation of granular proteases and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETosis involves the breakdown of cell membranes and extracellular release of chromatin and neutrophil granular constituents that target extracellular pathogens. Although the immediate effects of oxidant generation and NETosis are predicted to be injurious, NOX2, in several contexts, limits inflammation and injury by modulation of key signalling pathways that affect neutrophil accumulation and clearance. NOX2 also plays a role in antigen presentation and regulation of adaptive immunity. Specific NOX2-activated pathways such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional factor that induces antioxidative and cytoprotective responses, may be important therapeutic targets for CGD and, more broadly, diseases associated with excessive inflammation and injury.",

        "title": "Neutrophils: Innate Effectors of TB Resistance?",
        "abstract": "Certain individuals are able to resist Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection despite persistent and intense exposure. These persons do not exhibit adaptive immune priming as measured by tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) release assay (IGRA) responses, nor do they develop active tuberculosis (TB). Genetic investigation of individuals who are able to resist M. tuberculosis infection shows there are likely a combination of genetic variants that contribute to the phenotype. The contribution of the innate immune system and the exact cells involved in this phenotype remain incompletely elucidated. Neutrophils are prominent candidates for possible involvement as primers for microbial clearance. Significant variability is observed in neutrophil gene expression and DNA methylation. Furthermore, inter-individual variability is seen between the mycobactericidal capacities of donor neutrophils. Clearance of M. tuberculosis infection is favored by the mycobactericidal activity of neutrophils, apoptosis, effective clearance of cells by macrophages, and resolution of inflammation. In this review we will discuss the different mechanisms neutrophils utilize to clear M. tuberculosis infection. We discuss the duality between neutrophils' ability to clear infection and how increasing numbers of neutrophils contribute to active TB severity and mortality. Further investigation into the potential role of neutrophils in innate immune-mediated M. tuberculosis infection resistance is warranted since it may reveal clinically important activities for prevention as well as vaccine and treatment development.",

        "abstract": "The live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain, Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is a potent innate immune stimulator. In the C57BL/6 mouse model of tuberculosis, BCG vaccination leads to a significant reduction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis burden after aerogenic infection. Our studies indicated that BCG induced protection against pulmonary tuberculosis was independent of T cells and present as early as 7 days after vaccination. This protection showed longevity, as it did not wane when conventional T cell and TNF-\u03b1 deficient mice were infected 30 days post-vaccination. As BCG induced mycobacterial killing after 7 days, this study investigated the contributions of the innate immune system after BCG vaccination to better understand mechanisms required for mycobacterial killing. Subcutaneous BCG inoculation resulted in significant CD11b+F4/80+ monocyte subset recruitment into the lungs within 7 days. Further studies revealed that killing of mycobacteria was dependent on the viability of BCG, because irradiated BCG did not have the same effect. Although others have identified BCG as a facilitator of trained innate immunity, we found that BCG reduced the mycobacterial burden in the absence of mechanisms required for trained innate immunity, highlighting a role for macrophages and neutrophils for vaccine induced killing of M. tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis is still the leading cause of death globally from any infectious disease, despite the widespread use of the live attenuated vaccine Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG). While BCG has some efficacy against disseminated TB disease in children, protection wanes into adulthood resulting in over 1.8 million TB deaths per year. ABSTRACT Tuberculosis is still the leading cause of death globally from any infectious disease, despite the widespread use of the live attenuated vaccine Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG). While BCG has some efficacy against disseminated TB disease in children, protection wanes into adulthood resulting in over 1.8 million TB deaths per year. This has led to efforts to develop novel vaccine candidates that either replace or boost BCG, as well as to test novel delivery mechanisms to enhance BCG\u2019s efficacy. Traditional BCG vaccination is performed as an intradermal (ID) injection but delivering BCG by an alternate route may enhance the depth and breadth of protection. Previously, we demonstrated that phenotypically and genotypically disparate Diversity Outbred (DO) mice have heterogenous responses to M. tuberculosis challenge following intradermal BCG vaccination. Here, we utilize DO mice to examine BCG-induced protection when BCG is delivered systemically via intravenous (IV) administration. We find that DO mice vaccinated with IV BCG had a greater distribution of BCG throughout their organs compared to ID-vaccinated animals. However, compared to ID-vaccinated mice, M. tuberculosis burdens in lungs and spleens were not significantly reduced in animals vaccinated with BCG IV, nor was lung inflammation significantly altered. Nonetheless, DO mice that received BCG IV had increased survival over those vaccinated by the traditional ID route. Thus, our results suggest that delivering BCG by the alternate IV route enhances protection as detected in this diverse small animal model.",

        "title": "Host and pathogen genetic diversity shape vaccine-mediated protection to Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
        "abstract": "To investigate how host and pathogen diversity govern immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we performed a large-scale screen of vaccine-mediated protection against aerosol Mtb infection using three inbred mouse strains [C57BL/6 (B6), C3HeB/FeJ (C3H), Balb/c x 129/SvJ (C129F1)] and three Mtb strains (H37Rv, CDC1551, SA161) representing two lineages and distinct virulence properties. We compared three protective modalities, all of which involve inoculation with live mycobacteria: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), the only approved TB vaccine, delivered either subcutaneously or intravenously, and concomitant Mtb infection (CoMtb), a model of pre-existing immunity in which a low-level Mtb infection is established in the cervical lymph node following intradermal inoculation. We examined lung bacterial burdens at early (Day 28) and late (Day 98) time points after aerosol Mtb challenge and histopathology at Day 98. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the reduction of bacterial load afforded by these modalities at Day 28 across the combinations and noted a strong positive correlation between bacterial burden in unvaccinated mice and the degree of protection afforded by vaccination. Although we observed variation in the degree of reduction in bacterial burdens across the nine mouse/bacterium strain combinations, virtually all protective modalities performed similarly for a given strain-strain combination. We also noted dramatic variation in histopathology changes driven by both host and bacterial genetic backgrounds. Vaccination improved pathology scores for all infections except CDC1551. However, the most dramatic impact of vaccination on lesion development occurred for the C3H-SA161 combination, where vaccination entirely abrogated the development of the large necrotic lesions that arise in unvaccinated mice. In conclusion, we find that substantial TB heterogeneity can be recapitulated by introducing variability in both host and bacterial genetics, resulting in changes in vaccine-mediated protection as measured both by bacterial burden as well as histopathology. These differences can be harnessed in future studies to identify immune correlates of vaccine efficacy.",
