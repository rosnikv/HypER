        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe comparative efficacy and safety of infliximab and azathioprine therapy alone or in combination for Crohn's disease are unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluated the efficacy of infliximab monotherapy, azathioprine monotherapy, and the two drugs combined in 508 adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who had not undergone previous immunosuppressive or biologic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram of body weight at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks plus daily oral placebo capsules; 2.5 mg of oral azathioprine per kilogram daily plus a placebo infusion on the standard schedule; or combination therapy with the two drugs. Patients received study medication through week 30 and could continue in a blinded study extension through week 50.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 169 patients receiving combination therapy, 96 (56.8%) were in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 (the primary end point), as compared with 75 of 169 patients (44.4%) receiving infliximab alone (P=0.02) and 51 of 170 patients (30.0%) receiving azathioprine alone (P<0.001 for the comparison with combination therapy and P=0.006 for the comparison with infliximab). Similar numerical trends were found at week 50. At week 26, mucosal healing had occurred in 47 of 107 patients (43.9%) receiving combination therapy, as compared with 28 of 93 patients (30.1%) receiving infliximab (P=0.06) and 18 of 109 patients (16.5%) receiving azathioprine (P<0.001 for the comparison with combination therapy and P=0.02 for the comparison with infliximab). Serious infections developed in 3.9% of patients in the combination-therapy group, 4.9% of those in the infliximab group, and 5.6% of those in the azathioprine group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who were treated with infliximab plus azathioprine or infliximab monotherapy were more likely to have a corticosteroid-free clinical remission than those receiving azathioprine monotherapy.

        "title": "Preventing or Eradicating Factor VIII Antibody Formation in Patients with Hemophilia A: What Can We Learn from Other Disorders?",
        "abstract": "Abstract Eradication of factor VIII (FVIII) specific neutralizing antibodies (also known as inhibitors) by the traditional method of immune tolerance induction (ITI) is costly and unsuccessful in one out of three patients. Furthermore, effective inhibitor prevention strategies are presently lacking. An overview is given in this narrative review of antidrug antibody prevention or eradication strategies that have been used in disorders beyond hemophilia A, with the aim of analyzing what we can learn from these strategies for hemophilia A. Prevention of antidrug antibody formation using rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulins in patients with Pompe's disease seems effective but carries a high risk of adverse events. Based on studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, it seems likely that treatment with methotrexate alone would also be able to prevent inhibitor formation in hemophilia A patients. Besides side effects, it is unclear whether immune tolerance to FVIII would persist after cessation of immunomodulatory therapy with methotrexate. A combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids, used to treat antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia, could be further investigated to eradicate inhibitors in hemophilia A patients who are refractory to ITI. In summary, insights gained from research on antidrug antibody formation in other diseases could be helpful in devising alternative treatment strategies for inhibitor development.",

        "title": "Ongoing improvements in laboratory performance of coagulation factors VIII and IX: recent experience from the RCPAQAP",
        "abstract": "Coagulation factors VIII and IX are the coagulation factors most regularly tested by haemostasis laboratories, in part because Haemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) and Haemophilia B (FIX deficiency) represent the most common bleeding disorders, and in part because of their known associations with bleeding risk. The Royal College of Pathologists Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) is an international QAP with over 100 laboratories enrolled in the Coagulation Factors VIII and IX Program. The aim of the work presented here is to evaluate the assessment criteria for FVIII and FIX over a six-year period (2013\u20132018) and identify areas of benefit and weakness, in part resulting from a recent (2016) change in criteria (from assessment against factor deficient plasma reagent to plasma calibrator, as this was felt to be more relevant for determination of factor level). We identified an ongoing improvement [reduction in numbers of laboratories outside the RCPAQAP Analytical Performance Specifications (APS)] for both FVIII and FIX over this period of change in assessment criteria. FVIII outliers almost halved from 43 to 23 laboratories, and FIX outliers reduced by over 60% from 36 to 14 laboratories. It is hypothesised that the change in assessment criteria contributed to this improvement in Coagulation Factors program performance by laboratories, although other elements may have also contributed.",
