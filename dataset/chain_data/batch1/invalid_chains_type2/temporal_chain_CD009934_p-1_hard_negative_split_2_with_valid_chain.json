        "abstract": "Elevated postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress increase the risks of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Green tea catechin possesses antidiabetic properties and antioxidant capacity. In the present study, we examined the acute and continuous effects of ingestion of catechin-rich green tea on postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in healthy postmenopausal women. Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3\u00a0h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0\u00a0h) and at 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3\u00a0% lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P<\u00a00\u00b705), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed. Conversely, serum postprandial thioredoxin concentrations were 5\u00a0% higher in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). These findings indicate that an acute ingestion of catechin-rich green tea has beneficial effects on postprandial glucose and redox homeostasis in postmenopausal women.",

        "title": "Antioxidative and Antidiabetic Effects of Natural Polyphenols and Isoflavones",
        "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

        "abstract": "The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels of experts that inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The EEAP focuses on the effects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, and materials, as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa , are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas will likely experience a reduction in UV radiation as ozone- and climate-driven changes affect the amounts of UV radiation reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces detailed Quadrennial Reports every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. , 2015, 14 ,1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Update Reports of recent and relevant scientific findings. The most recent of these was for 2016 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. , 2017, 16 , 107-145). The present 2017 Update Report assesses some of the highlights and new insights about the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change. A full 2018 Quadrennial Assessment, will be made available in 2018/2019.",

        "title": "Human health in relation to exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation under changing stratospheric ozone and climate",
        "abstract": "The Montreal Protocol has limited increases in the UV-B (280\u2013315 nm) radiation reaching the Earth\u2019s surface as a result of depletion of stratospheric ozone. Nevertheless, the incidence of skin cancers continues to increase in most light-skinned populations, probably due mainly to risky sun exposure behaviour. In locations with strong sun protection programs of long duration, incidence is now reducing in younger age groups. Changes in the epidemiology of UV-induced eye diseases are less clear, due to a lack of data. Exposure to UV radiation plays a role in the development of cataracts, pterygium and possibly age-related macular degeneration; these are major causes of visual impairment world-wide. Photodermatoses and phototoxic reactions to drugs are not uncommon; management of the latter includes recognition of the risks by the prescribing physician. Exposure to UV radiation has benefits for health through the production of vitamin D in the skin and modulation of immune function. The latter has benefits for skin diseases such as psoriasis and possibly for systemic autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The health risks of sun exposure can be mitigated through appropriate sun protection, such as clothing with both good UV-blocking characteristics and adequate skin coverage, sunglasses, shade, and sunscreen. New sunscreen preparations provide protection against a broader spectrum of solar radiation, but it is not clear that this has benefits for health. Gaps in knowledge make it difficult to derive evidence-based sun protection advice that balances the risks and benefits of sun exposure.",

        "title": "Dermoscopy Image Classification Based on StyleGAN and DenseNet201",
        "abstract": "Melanoma is considered one of the most lethal skin cancers. However, skin lesion classification based on deep learning diagnostic techniques is a challenging task owing to the insufficiency of labeled skin lesion images and intraclass-imbalanced datasets. It is thus necessary to utilize data augmentation methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to assist skin lesion classification and help dermatologists reach more accurate diagnostic decisions. Moreover, insufficient samples can cause a low classification accuracy in a model by using deep learning in medical diagnosis and reduce the accuracy of skin lesion classification. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new skin lesion image classification framework based on a skin lesion augmentation style-based GAN (SLA-StyleGAN) according to the basic architecture of style-based GANs and DenseNet201. The proposed framework redesigns the structure of style control and noise input in the original generator and reconstructs the discriminator to adjust the generator to efficiently synthesize high-quality skin lesion images. We introduce a new loss function that reduces the intraclass sample distance and expands the sample distance between different classes, which can improve the balanced multiclass accuracy (BMA). The experimental results show that our classification framework performs well on the ISIC2019 dataset, and the BMA reaches 93.64%. The proposed method improves the accuracy of skin lesion image classification, assists dermatologists in determining and diagnosing different types of skin lesions, and analyzes skin lesions at different stages as well as those that are difficult to distinguish.",

        "title": "Blend of Deep Features and Binary Tree Growth Algorithm for Skin Lesion Classification",
        "abstract": "One of the most frequently identified cancers globally is skin cancer (SC). The computeraided categorization of numerous skin lesions via dermoscopic images is still a complicated problem. Early recognition is crucial since it considerably increases the survival chances. In this study, we introduce an approach for skin lesion categorization where, at first, a powerful hybrid deep-feature set is constructed, and then a binary tree growth (BTG)-based optimization procedure is implemented using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with an intention to compute the categorizing error and build symmetry between categories, for selecting the most significant features which are finally fed to a multi-class SVM for classification. The hybrid deep-feature set is constructed by utilizing two pre-trained models, i.e., Densenet-201, and Inception-v3, that are fine-tuned on skin lesion data. These two deep-feature models have distinct architectures that characterize dissimilar feature abstraction strengths. This effective deep feature framework has been tested on two publicly available challenging datasets, i.e., ISIC2018 and ISIC2019. The proposed framework outperforms many existing approaches and achieves notable {accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity} values of {98.50%, 96.60%, 97.84%, 99.59%} and {96.60%, 94.21%, 96.38%, 99.39%} for the ISIC2018 and ISIC2019 datasets, respectively. The proposed implementation of the BTG-based optimization algorithm performs significantly better on the proposed feature blend for skin lesion classification.",

        "title": "DeepAVP-TPPred: identification of antiviral peptides using transformed image-based localized descriptors and binary tree growth algorithm",
        "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Despite the extensive manufacturing of antiviral drugs and vaccination, viral infections continue to be a major human ailment. Antiviral peptides (AVPs) have emerged as potential candidates in the pursuit of novel antiviral drugs. These peptides show vigorous antiviral activity against a diverse range of viruses by targeting different phases of the viral life cycle. Therefore, the accurate prediction of AVPs is an essential yet challenging task. Lately, many machine learning-based approaches have developed for this purpose; however, their limited capabilities in terms of feature engineering, accuracy, and generalization make these methods restricted. Results In the present study, we aim to develop an efficient machine learning-based approach for the identification of AVPs, referred to as DeepAVP-TPPred, to address the aforementioned problems. First, we extract two new transformed feature sets using our designed image-based feature extraction algorithms and integrate them with an evolutionary information-based feature. Next, these feature sets were optimized using a novel feature selection approach called binary tree growth Algorithm. Finally, the optimal feature space from the training dataset was fed to the deep neural network to build the final classification model. The proposed model DeepAVP-TPPred was tested using stringent 5-fold cross-validation and two independent dataset testing methods, which achieved the maximum performance and showed enhanced efficiency over existing predictors in terms of both accuracy and generalization capabilities.
