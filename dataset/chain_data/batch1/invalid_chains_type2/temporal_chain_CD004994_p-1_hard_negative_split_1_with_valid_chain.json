        "title": "[Treatment of chronic hepatitis C by bicyclum, a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial].",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicyclum, a China made new hepatocyte protecting agent, in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-nine CHC patients matched demographically and clinically were randomized into two groups: bicyclum group (group A, n = 20) and placebo/bicyclum crossovergroup (group B, n = 19). Bicyclum 75mg/d or placebo was administered to these two groups respectively for 3 months. Then the patients in group A received bicyclum for further 3 months and were observed for 3 months after the treatment discontinued; and the patients in group B received bicyclum 75mg/d for six months and were observed for 3 months after the treatment discontinued. Investigation items included clinical manifestations,liver function, serum HCV RNA and anti-HCV.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn group A, the serum ALT was 120 +/- 43 U/L before treatment and was 57 +/- 32 U/L after treatment ( P < 0.01) In group B the baseline serum ALT was 126 U/L +/- 48 U/L. After the placebo administration the serum ALT was 127 U/L +/- 97 U/L (P > 0.05) and the clinical feature showed no improvement. After bicyclum treatment for 6 months, the serum ALT in group B was 68 +/- 45 U/L, significantly lower than that before bicyclum treatment ( P < 0.01) and clinical symptoms improved. The overall ALT normalization response rate were 64.1% and 48.7% at the end of bicyclum treatment and 3 months after the treatment discontinued respectively for the total 39 patients. The serum HCV-RNA became negative in 5 and 2 patients at end of treatment and 3 months after the treatment discontinued. Adverse drug reactions were mild and uncommon. Mild dizziness occurred in 1 patient in each group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBicyclum is effective in improving ALT and clinical manifestations of CHC patients. It is safe and well tolerated and shows few adverse reactions.",

        "title": "Bicyclol Attenuates Liver Inflammation Induced by Infection of Hepatitis C Virus via Repressing ROS-Mediated Activation of MAPK/NF-\u03baB Signaling Pathway",
        "abstract": "Treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cures most patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the real world. However, some patients, especially those with the underlying advanced liver disease, have a limited reduction of liver injury after achieving a sustained viral response (SVR). Bicyclol was widely used in clinics for the treatment of a variety of liver injuries but with an unknown mechanism for the treatment of hepatitis C. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of bicyclol in HCV-infected hepatocytes and further confirmed the putative results in a mouse hepatitis model induced by the coinjection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] and D-galactosamine (D-GalN). The results showed that the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and the subsequent increase of inflammatory factors were directly induced by HCV infection and were persistent after clearance of the virus in Huh7.5 cells. Bicyclol decreased the activation of NF-\u03baB and the levels of inflammatory factors in HCV-infected hepatocytes by inhibiting the activation of the ROS-MAPK-NF-\u03baB pathway, and the effect was synergistic with DAAs in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Bicyclol attenuated the ROS-MAPK-NF-\u03baB axis via recovering mitochondrial function without a dependence on dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and superoxide dismutases. The anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of bicyclol were verified in mouse hepatitis induced by the coinjection of poly(I:C)/D-GalN. Bicyclol directly ameliorates the chronic inflammation caused by HCV infection and might be used with DAAs or after DAA therapy for ultimately curing chronic hepatitis C.",

        "title": "A Potential Role for Mitochondrial DNA in the Activation of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Liver Disease",
        "abstract": "Mitochondria are organelles that are essential for cellular homeostasis including energy harvesting through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in liver diseases as it produces a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in turn leading to further oxidative damage to the structure and function of mitochondria and other cellular components. More severe oxidative damage occurred in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than in nuclear DNA. mtDNA dysfunction results in further oxidative damage as it participates in encoding respiratory chain polypeptides. In addition, mtDNA can leave the mitochondria and enter the cytoplasm and extracellular environment. mtDNA is derived from ancient bacteria, contains many unmethylated CpG dinucleotide repeats similar to bacterial DNA, and thus can induce inflammation to exacerbate damage to liver cells and distal organs by activating toll-like receptor 9, inflammatory bodies, and stimulator of interferon genes (STING). In this review, we focus on the mechanism by which mtDNA alterations cause liver injuries, including nonalcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, and liver cancer.",

        "title": "Static lung storage at 10\u00b0C maintains mitochondrial health and preserves donor organ function",
        "abstract": "Description Static storage of donor lungs at 10\u00b0C enhances mitochondrial protection and is a clinically feasible option to extend viable lung preservation times. Prolonging pulmonary preservation Lungs can be preserved on ice for about 6 to 8 hours before transplantation, which imparts geographic and logistical restrictions on organ use. Ali et al. used pig lungs and ex vivo lung perfusion to show that increasing the static storage temperature from 4\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C could maintain organ function while prolonging storage time. Increased storage temperature preserved mitochondrial function and led to greater abundance of mitochondrial metabolites. Human lungs stored at 10\u00b0C were successfully transplanted into five patients after storage times of about 10 to 16 hours, supporting the clinical utility of this approach. Cold static preservation on ice (~4\u00b0C) remains the clinical standard of donor organ preservation. However, mitochondrial injury develops during prolonged storage, which limits the extent of time that organs can maintain viability. We explored the feasibility of prolonged donor lung storage at 10\u00b0C using a large animal model and investigated mechanisms related to mitochondrial protection. Functional assessments performed during ex vivo lung perfusion demonstrated that porcine lungs stored for 36 hours at 10\u00b0C had lower airway pressures, higher lung compliances, and better oxygenation capabilities, indicative of better pulmonary physiology, as compared to lungs stored conventionally at 4\u00b0C. Mitochondrial protective metabolites including itaconate, glutamine, and N-acetylglutamine were present in greater intensities in lungs stored at 10\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. Analysis of mitochondrial injury markers further confirmed that 10\u00b0C storage resulted in greater protection of mitochondrial health. We applied this strategy clinically to prolong preservation of human donor lungs beyond the currently accepted clinical preservation limit of about 6 to 8 hours. Five patients received donor lung transplants after a median preservation time of 10.4 hours (9.92 to 14.8 hours) for the first implanted lung and 12.1 hours (10.9 to 16.5 hours) for the second. All have survived the first 30 days after transplantation. There was no grade 3 primary graft dysfunction at 72 hours after transplantation, and median post-transplant mechanical ventilation time was 1.73 days (0.24 to 6.71 days). Preservation at 10\u00b0C could become the standard of care for prolonged pulmonary preservation, providing benefits to both patients and health care teams.",

        "title": "The Advent of Semi-Elective Lung Transplantation\u2014Prolonged Static Cold Storage at 10\u00b0C",
        "abstract": "Since the early days of clinical lung transplantation the preservation of donor organs has become a fairly standardized procedure and most centers do follow similar processes. This includes the use of low-potassium high dextran flush solutions and static cold storage (SCS) in a cooler filled with ice. Depending on the length of SCS, organs usually arrive at the recipient hospital at a temperature of 0\u00b0C\u20134\u00b0C. The question of the optimal storage temperature for donor lung preservation has been revisited as data from large animal experiments demonstrated that organs stored at 10\u00b0C experience less mitochondrial damage. Thus, prolonged cold ischemic times can be better tolerated at 10\u00b0C\u2014even in pre-damaged organs. The clinical applicability of these findings was demonstrated in an international multi-center observational study including three high-volume lung transplant centers. Total clinical preservation times of up to 24 hrs have been successfully achieved in organs stored at 10\u00b0C without hampering primary organ function and short-term outcomes. Currently, a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is recruiting patients with the aim to compare standard SCS on ice with prolonged SCS protocol at 10\u00b0C. If, as anticipated, this RCT confirms data from previous studies, lung transplantation could indeed become a semi-elective procedure.",
