        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension.\n\n\nDESIGN\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.\n\n\nSETTING\nCommunity-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\n--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.",

        "abstract": "In 46 elderly (aged greater than or equal to 60 y) hypertensive subjects with entry systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, our specific aim in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study (two 8-wk treatment periods separated by a 3-wk washout) was to compare blood pressure-lowering effects of 9 g fish oil/d [omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid] vs 9 g corn oil/d [omega-6 (n-6) fatty acid]. After a 4-wk baseline period, 22 subjects were randomly assigned to receive fish oil and 24 to receive corn oil. For both 8-wk treatments there were no between-group differences in the change in blood pressure. There was a treatment difference for standing DBP when baseline values were compared with those after treatment 2; DBP decreased by 5.1 mm Hg in the fish-oil group vs 0.72 mm Hg in the corn-oil group (P = 0.024). Within groups during the first treatment, both fish oil and corn oil lowered all four blood pressure measures (P less than 0.05); blood pressures were not further lowered during the second treatment compared with the washout period. There were no significant between-group differences in laboratory safety tests or categorical side effects. Fish oil lowered triglycerides by 0.47 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). In elderly subjects, diet plus both omega-3 and omega-6 supplements (9 g/d) safely and effectively lower SBP and DBP.",

        "title": "Evaluation of thiazide diuretic use as preferred therapy in uncomplicated essential hypertension patients",
        "abstract": "Thiazide diuretics are effective antihypertensive medications shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and stroke. Despite being the preferred choice for uncomplicated essential hypertension, thiazide diuretics continue to be underutilized. Methods Uncomplicated essential hypertension patients taking a single antihypertensive medication were evaluated upon enrollment, diagnosis after enrollment or initiation of therapy in treatment na\u00efve patients. Clinician prescribing habits were determined for both pre-existing and newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. For the cost savings analysis, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25mg daily was selected as the preferred conversion medication. Results Four hundred seventy-eight patients were included. ACE inhibitors were the most prescribed at 35.4% (n=169), followed by dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP CCB) and thiazide diuretics, both at 20.3% (n=97). Only 12.9% (n=33) of patients with hypertension that were taking an antihypertensive medication upon enrollment were either continued or started on thiazide diuretic therapy. Newly diagnosed or treatment na\u00efve patients were prescribed a thiazide diuretic 28.8% (n=64) of the time. DHP CCB accounted for 58.8% of the total medication cost per month with thiazide diuretics responsible for 0.8% of the cost. If all patients had been prescribed HCTZ 25mg daily, 95.8% of the total medication cost per month could have been saved. Conclusions Thiazide diuretics were underutilized as preferred therapy in patients with pre-existing or newly diagnosed uncomplicated essential hypertension. While cost of therapy should not be the sole reason for medication selection, thiazide diuretics are an attractive option and should be considered as a preferred therapy in this patient population.",

        "abstract": "Prescribing pattern surveys are one of the pharmacoepidemiological techniques that provide an unbiased picture of prescribing habits. Prescription surveys permit the identification of suboptimal prescribing patterns for further evaluation. The aims of this study were to determine the prescribing trend, adherence of the prescribers to the guideline, and the impact of drug expenditure on drug utilization at the cardiac clinic of Penang Hospital, Malaysia. This was a cross-sectional study. Demographic data of the patients, diagnoses and the drugs prescribed were recorded. The average drug acquisition costs (ADAC) were calculated for each antihypertensive drug class on a daily and annual basis. Adherence to the guideline was calculated as a percentage of the total number of patients. A total of 313 individuals fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The average age of the study population was 59.30 \u00b1 10.35 years. The mean number of drugs per prescription in the study was 2.09 \u00b1 0.78. There were no significant differences in the demographic data. Antihypertensive drugs were used in monotherapy and polytherapy in 20.8% and 79.2% of the patients, respectively. Adherence to the guideline regarding prescription occurred in 85.30% of the patients. The lowest priced drug class was diuretics and the highest was angiotensin-receptor blockers. In conclusion, the total adherence to the guideline was good; the adherence percentage only slightly decreased with a co-existing comorbidity (such as diabetes mellitus). The use of thiazide diuretics was encouraged because they are well tolerated and inexpensive, and perindopril was still prescribed for diabetic patients since it is relatively cheap (generic drug) and its daily dosage is beneficial.",

        "title": "Medication Adherence in Outpatients with Arterial Hypertension",
        "abstract": "SUMMARY The degree of patient cooperation plays a key role in the success of antihypertensive drug therapy. Non-adherence is the major health and economic problem in the treatment of arterial hypertension (HTA). The aim of the study was to evaluate the degree of adherence in hypertensive patients and to study risk factors affecting adherence and the effects of non-adherence on blood pressure (BP). We performed a cross-sectional study, which involved 170 outpatients with HTA, treated in primary healthcare. Patients were divided into two groups, depending on the degree of adherence, measured using a validated survey form. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson's Chi-square and t-test. Good adherence was observed in 126 (74.12%) outpatients. Elderly patients with longer duration of HTA and larger number of drugs in the therapy showed a lower degree of adherence, with more side-effects (p<0.01). Patients younger than 65 years were found to be more likely to adhere to their medication regimen, compared to elderly patients (\u03c72=21.3; p<0.01; OR=6.0 95%, CI 2.76-13.04). Uncontrolled BP occurred in the significantly higher percentage in non-adherent patients (59.1%) compared to the adherent group (21.4%) (\u03c72=19.84; p<0.01; OR=5.30 95%, CI 2.39-11.85). The most common reason for poor adherence was non-compliance with dosage regimen (27.27%). The medication adherence rate was found to be low among elderly patients. A poor adherence was found to negatively affect BP control. Determining the factors for non-adherence and developing multidisciplinary intervention programs to address the identified factors are necessary to improve adherence to medication and BP control.",

        "title": "Assessment of medication adherence among hypertensive patients: a cross-sectional study",
        "abstract": "Background: Hypertension affects around one billion individuals worldwide and is expected to increase by 29% to reach 1.56 billion by 2025. It is usually asymptomatic, chronic disorder needing lifelong treatment. The objective of this study was to study the medication adherence among hypertensive patients using hill-bone compliance to high blood pressure therapy scale (HILL-BONE CHBPTS) and to compare medication adherence in hypertensive patients with controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted for a period of one year in the Outpatient department of Medicine in a tertiary care hospital, Navi Mumbai. A total of 129 hypertensive patients who were on at least six months on antihypertensive medications were enrolled. Blood pressure was measured and details of drug therapy were noted. Medication adherence was assessed using HILL-BONE CHBPTS and respective scores were calculated. Results: HILL-BONE CHBPTS scores were on the higher side signifying poor medication adherence among hypertensive patients. HILL-BONE CHBPTS score correlated significantly in a positive direction with diastolic blood pressure, duration of treatment and the number of medications, As per JNC 8 recommendations, 58.9% (76) hypertensive patients were having blood pressure under control, whereas 41.1% (53) were having uncontrolled blood pressure. HILL-BONE CHBPTS scores were significantly higher (reflecting lower adherence) in hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure than those having optimally controlled blood pressure. Conclusions: Overall the medication adherence was poor in hypertensive patients. Adherence to therapeutic regimens is an important factor in blood pressure control among hypertensive patients and needs priority. Health education related to medication adherence needs be improved in hypertensive patients.",
