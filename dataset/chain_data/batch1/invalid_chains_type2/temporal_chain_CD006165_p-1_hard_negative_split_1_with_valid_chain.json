        "title": "Small Doses of Subcutaneous Insulin as a Strategy for Preventing Slowly Progressive \u03b2-Cell Failure in Islet Cell Antibody\u2014Positive Patients With Clinical Features of NIDDM",
        "abstract": "We report a pilot study to determine the preventive effect of small doses of insulin injected subcutaneously on slowly progressive \u03b2-cell damage in islet cell antibody (ICA)-positive patients with apparent NIDDM. Ten NIDDM patients who were ICA+ were divided into two groups of five. In the insulin group (age: 51 \u00b1 8 years [mean \u00b1 SD], sex: 3 men and 2 women), intermediate-type insulin (3\u201316 U/day) was given once or twice daily as a subcutaneous injection. The sulfonylurea (SU) group (age: 48 \u00b1 11 years, sex: 3 men and 2 women) was initially treated with a SU agent. Changes in \u03b2-cell function, as indicated by serum C-peptide responses and blood glucose values during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test, as well as ICA and GAD antibody status, were evaluated for up to 30 months in both groups. ICA status became negative in four of five patients in the insulin group. ICA status did not become negative in any of the patients in the SU group (P = 0.047 vs. insulin group). ICA status was persistently positive in two patients whose \u03b2-cell function eventually progressed to an insulin-dependent state and fluctuated in the remaining three patients. In the insulin group, GAD antibody status became negative in one of four initially GAD antibody\u2013positive NIDDM patients. In the SU group, GAD antibody status was persistently positive in three NIDDM patients (NS vs. insulin group). The serum C-peptide response improved significantly within 6 and 12 months in the insulin group, whereas it decreased progressively in the SU group. The changes in C-peptide response were significantly different between the two groups at 6, 12, 24, and 30 months. Two-hour blood glucose and HbA1 values were unchanged in the insulin group, but they increased in the SU group. Subcutaneous small doses of insulin, resulting in a high rate of negative conversion of ICA and an improved serum C-peptide response, may be effective in treating ICA+ NIDDM patients who are at high risk for slowly progressive \u03b2-cell failure.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is associated with autoimmunity to insulin. Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is polygenic and includes the INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus which may regulate the expression of insulin in pancreas and thymus. In order to determine whether insulin autoimmunity could be attributed to a genetic susceptibility conferred by the INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus, peripheral blood T cell proliferation to human insulin and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) was measured in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes and control subjects. IAA were detected in 21 of 53 patients and in none of 25 control subjects, while T cell responses were low (stimulation index range 0.4\u20137.2) and similar in both groups. Both antibody and T cell responses were higher in younger subjects and IAA were more prevalent in patients with the HLA\u2010DR4 allele. No relationship was observed between humoral and cellular responses to insulin. No association was found between the INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2\u2010susceptible allele and insulin autoimmunity. Increased T cell responses and IAA were found in patients with either the diabetes\u2010susceptible or the diabetes\u2010protective INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus genotypes, and increased T cell responses were also found in control subjects with either susceptible or protective INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus genotypes. This study confirms that primary T cell proliferative responses to insulin are low and detectable also in control subjects. The detection of T cell proliferation and autoantibodies to insulin in subjects with and without the protective INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus genotypes does not support the hypothesis of an allele\u2010specific capacity for tolerance induction which could determine a susceptibility to develop autoimmunity against the insulin protein and subsequently diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The 9-23 amino acid region of the insulin B chain (B9-23) is a dominant epitope recognized by pathogenic T lymphocytes in nonobese diabetic mice, the animal model for type 1 diabetes. We describe herein similar (B9-23)-specific T-cell responses in peripheral lymphocytes obtained from patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and from prediabetic subjects at high risk for disease. Short-term T-cell lines generated from patient peripheral lymphocytes showed significant proliferative responses to (B9-23), whereas lymphocytes isolated from HLA and/or age-matched nondiabetic normal controls were unresponsive. Antibody-mediated blockade demonstrated that the response was HLA class II restricted. Use of the highly sensitive cytokine-detection ELISPOT assay revealed that these (B9-23)-specific cells were present in freshly isolated lymphocytes from only the type 1 diabetics and prediabetics and produced the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma. This study is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a cellular response to the (B9-23) insulin epitope in human type 1 diabetes and suggests that the mouse and human diseases have strikingly similar autoantigenic targets, a feature that should facilitate development of antigen-based therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a good model for human type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by autoreactive T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing islet beta-cells of the pancreas. The 9-23 amino acid region of the insulin B-chain [B((9-23))] is an immunodominant T-cell target antigen in the NOD mouse that plays a critical role in the disease process. By testing a series of B((9-23)) peptide analogs with single or double alanine substitutions, we identified a set of altered peptide ligands (APLs) capable of inhibiting B((9-23))-induced proliferative responses of NOD pathogenic T-cell clones. These APLs were unable to induce proliferation of these clones. However, vaccinations with the APLs induced strong cellular responses, as measured by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and Th2 cytokine production (i.e., interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-10, but not gamma-interferon [IFN-gamma]). These responses were cross-reactive with the native antigen, B((9-23)), suggesting that the APL-induced Th2 responses may provide protection by controlling endogenous B((9-23))-specific Th1 (i.e., IFN-gamma-producing) pathogenic responses. One of these APLs that contained alanine substitutions at residues 16 and 19 (16Y-->A, 19C-->A; NBI-6024) was further characterized for its therapeutic activity because it consistently induced T-cell responses (e.g., T-cell lines and clones) that were of the Th2 type and that were cross-reactive with B((9-23)). Subcutaneous injections of NBI-6024 to NOD mice administered either before or after the onset of disease substantially delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of diabetes. This study is the first to report therapeutic activity of an APL derived from an islet beta-cell-specific antigen in type 1 diabetes.",

However, little is known about the effects of APLs on already differentiated autoreactive CD8+ T cells that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. We generated a panel of APLs derived from an influenza virus hemagglutinin peptide exhibiting in vitro functions ranging from antagonism to superagonism on specific CD8+ T cells. A superagonist APL was further characterized for its therapeutic activity in a transgenic mouse model of type 1 diabetes. When injected i.v. 1 day after the transfer of diabetogenic hemagglutinin-specific CD8+ T cells into insulin promoter-hemagglutinin transgenic mice, the superagonist APL proved more effective than the native hemagglutinin peptide in blocking diabetes. This protective effect was associated with an inhibition of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in vivo and with a decreased accumulation of these cells in the pancreas, leading to a marked reduction of intrainsulitis. In conclusion, a superagonist \u201cself-peptide\u201d APL was more effective than the native peptide in treating a CD8+ T cell-mediated diabetes model.",

        "abstract": "Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells have been implicated in the regulation of autoimmune diseases. In several models of type 1 diabetes, increasing the number of iNKT cells prevents the development of disease. Because CD8 T cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, we have investigated the influence of iNKT cells on diabetogenic CD8 T cells. In the present study, type 1 diabetes was induced by the transfer of CD8 T cells specific for the influenza virus hemagglutinin into recipient mice expressing the hemagglutinin Ag specifically in their \u03b2 pancreatic cells. In contrast to previous reports, high frequency of iNKT cells promoted severe insulitis and exacerbated diabetes. Analysis of diabetogenic CD8 T cells showed that iNKT cells enhance their activation, their expansion, and their differentiation into effector cells producing IFN-\u03b3. This first analysis of the influence of iNKT cells on diabetogenic CD8 T cells reveals that iNKT cells not only fail to regulate but in fact exacerbate the development of diabetes. Thus, iNKT cells can induce opposing effects dependent on the model of type 1 diabetes that is being studied. This prodiabetogenic capacity of iNKT cells should be taken into consideration when developing therapeutic approaches based on iNKT cell manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Invariant NK T (iNKT) cells regulate immune responses, express NK cell markers and an invariant TCR, and recognize lipid Ags in a CD1d-restricted manner. Previously, we reported that activation of iNKT cells by \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) protects against type 1 diabetes (T1D) in NOD mice via an IL-4-dependent mechanism. To further investigate how iNKT cells protect from T1D, we analyzed whether iNKT cells require the presence of another subset(s) of regulatory T cells (Treg), such as CD4+CD25+ Treg, for this protection. We found that CD4+CD25+ T cells from NOD.CD1d\u2212/\u2212 mice deficient in iNKT cell function similarly in vitro to CD4+CD25+ T cells from wild-type NOD mice and suppress the proliferation of NOD T responder cells upon \u03b1-GalCer stimulation. Cotransfer of NOD diabetogenic T cells with CD4+CD25+ Tregs from NOD mice pretreated with \u03b1-GalCer demonstrated that activated iNKT cells do not influence the ability of Tregs to inhibit the transfer of T1D. In contrast, protection from T1D mediated by transfer of activated iNKT cells requires the activity of CD4+CD25+ T cells, because splenocytes pretreated with \u03b1-GalCer and then inactivated by anti-CD25 of CD25+ cells did not protect from T1D. Similarly, mice inactivated of CD4+CD25+ T cells before \u03b1-GalCer treatment were also not protected from T1D. Our data suggest that CD4+CD25+ T cells retain their function during iNKT cell activation, and that the activity of CD4+CD25+ Tregs is required for iNKT cells to transfer protection from T1D.",

Yet the functional changes of the two subsets of regulatory T cells in the development of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice remain unclear, and how NKT cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells cooperate functionally in the regulation of autoimmune diabetes is also uncertain. We provide evidence that in NOD mice, an animal model of human type 1 diabetes, the functions of both NKT cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells decrease in an age-dependent manner. We show that treatment with \u03b1-galactosylceramide increases the size of the CD4 + CD25 + Treg cell compartment in NOD mice, and augments the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor and the potency of CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells to inhibit proliferation of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells. Our data indicate that NKT cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells might cooperate in the prevention of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice treated with \u03b1-galactosylceramide.

Suppression of graft rejection is associated with the accumulation of CD1dhi-expressing CD11c+F4/80hi myeloid cells in hyperplastic skin. Blockade of CD1d, removal of NKT cells, or local inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 signaling is sufficient to restore immune-mediated graft rejection.

In this study, we examined the role of systemically derived NKT cells in regulating the rejection of skin grafts expressing viral proteins. In lymph nodes draining transplanted skin, Ag-specific CD8 T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity were impaired by NKT cells. NKT cell suppression was mediated via CD11c+ dendritic cells. Inhibition of CD8 T cell function did not require Foxp3+ regulatory T cells or NKT cell-secreted IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, or IL-17. Thus, following skin grafting or immunization with human papillomavirus-E7 oncoprotein, NKT cells reduce the capacity of draining lymph node-resident APCs to cross-present Ag to CD8 T cell precursors, as evidenced by impaired expansion and differentiation to Ag-specific CD8 T effector cells. Therefore, in the context of viral Ag challenge in the skin, systemic NKT cells limit the capacity for effective priming of adaptive immunity.",

        "abstract": "During the early stages of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, the innate immune system creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment by recruiting innate immune cells to eliminate the infected cells, initiating an effective acquired immune response. However, HPV exhibits a wide range of strategies for evading immune-surveillance, generating an anti-inflammatory microenvironment. The administration of new adjuvants, such as TLR (Toll-like receptors) agonists and alpha-galactosylceramide, has been demonstrated to reverse the anti-inflammatory microenvironment by down-regulating a number of adhesion molecules and chemo-attractants and activating keratinocytes, dendritic (DC), Langerhans (LC), natural killer (NK) or natural killer T (NKT) cells; thus, promoting a strong specific cytotoxic T cell response. Therefore, these adjuvants show promise for the treatment of HPV generated lesions and may be useful to elucidate the unknown roles of immune cells in the natural history of HPV infection. This review focuses on HPV immune evasion mechanisms and on the proposed response of the innate immune system, suggesting a role for the surrounding pro-inflammatory microenvironment and the NK and NKT cells in the clearance of HPV infections.",

Aberrant JAK/STAT signaling contributes to cancer progression and metastatic development. STAT proteins play an essential role in the development of cervical cancer, and the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway may be essential for enhancing tumor cell death. Persistent activation of different STATs is present in a variety of cancers, including cervical cancer, and their overactivation may be associated with a poor prognosis and poor overall survival. The oncoproteins E6 and E7 play a critical role in the progression of cervical cancer and may mediate the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Inhibition of STAT proteins appears to show promise for establishing new targets in cancer treatment. The present review summarizes the knowledge about the participation of the different components of the JAK/STAT pathway and the participation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) associated with the process of cellular malignancy.",

        "title": "JAK/STAT Signaling: Molecular Targets, Therapeutic Opportunities, and Limitations of Targeted Inhibitions in Solid Malignancies",
        "abstract": "JAK/STAT signaling pathway is one of the important regulatory signaling cascades for the myriad of cellular processes initiated by various types of ligands such as growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. The physiological processes regulated by JAK/STAT signaling are immune regulation, cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis and hematopoiesis of myeloid and non-myeloid cells. Dysregulation of JAK/STAT signaling is reported in various immunological disorders, hematological and other solid malignancies through various oncogenic activation mutations in receptors, downstream mediators, and associated transcriptional factors such as STATs. STATs typically have a dual role when explored in the context of cancer. While several members of the STAT family are involved in malignancies, however, a few members which include STAT3 and STAT5 are linked to tumor initiation and progression. Other STAT members such as STAT1 and STAT2 are pivotal for antitumor defense and maintenance of an effective and long-term immune response through evolutionarily conserved programs. The effects of JAK/STAT signaling and the persistent activation of STATs in tumor cell survival; proliferation and invasion have made the JAK/STAT pathway an ideal target for drug development and cancer therapy. Therefore, understanding the intricate JAK/STAT signaling in the pathogenesis of solid malignancies needs extensive research. A better understanding of the functionally redundant roles of JAKs and STATs may provide a rationale for improving existing cancer therapies which have deleterious effects on normal cells and to identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention in solid malignancies.",

        "title": "G-MDSC-derived exosomes mediate the differentiation of M-MDSC into M2 macrophages promoting colitis-to-cancer transition",
        "abstract": "Backgrounds In inflammatory bowel disease microenvironment, transdifferentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2 macrophage accumulation are crucial for the transition of colitis-to-cancer. New insights into the cross-talk and the underling mechanism between MDSCs and M2 macrophage during colitis-to-cancer transition are opening new avenues for colitis-associated cancer (CAC) prevention and treatment. Methods The role and underlying mechanism that granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) or exosomes (Exo) regulates the differentiation of monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) into M2 macrophages were investigated using immuno\ufb02uorescence, FACS, IB analysis, etc, and employing siRNA and antibodies. In vivo efficacy and mechanistic studies were conducted with dextran sulfate sodium-induced CAC mice, employed IL-6 Abs and STAT3 inhibitor. Results G-MDSCs promote the differentiation of M-MDSC into M2 macrophages through exosomal miR-93\u20135\u2009p which downregulating STAT3 activity in M-MDSC. IL-6 is responsible for miR-93\u20135\u2009p enrichment in G-MDSC exosomes (GM-Exo). Mechanistically, chronic inflammation-driven IL-6 promote the synthesis of miR-93\u20135\u2009p in G-MDSC via IL-6R/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Early use of IL-6 Abs enhances the effect of STAT3 inhibitor against CAC. Conclusions IL-6-driven secretion of G-MDSC exosomal miR-93\u20135\u2009p promotes the differentiation of M-MDSC into M2 macrophages and involves a STAT3 signaling mechanism that promote colitis-to-cancer transition. Combining STAT3 inhibitors with strategies that inhibit IL-6-mediated G-MDSC exosomal miR-93\u20135\u2009p production is beneficial for the prevention and treatment of CAC.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized primarily by gastrointestinal inflammation, predominantly manifests as Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It is acknowledged that Inflammation plays a significant role in cancer development and patients with IBD have an increased risk of various cancers. The progression from inflammation to carcinogenesis in IBD is a result of the interplay between immune cells, gut microbiota, and carcinogenic signaling pathways in epithelial cells. Long-term chronic inflammation can lead to the accumulation of mutations in epithelial cells and the abnormal activation of carcinogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, Immune cells play a pivotal role in both the acute and chronic phases of IBD, contributing to the transformation from inflammation to tumorigenesis. And patients with IBD frequently exhibit dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome. Disruption of the gut microbiota and subsequent immune dysregulation are central to the pathogenesis of both IBD and colitis associated colorectal cancer (CAC). The proactive management of inflammation combined with regular endoscopic and tumor screenings represents the most direct and effective strategy to prevent the IBD-associated cancer.",
