        "abstract": "We describe here the reliability and validity of methods to quantify involuntary muscle torque induced by non-invasive nerve stimulation. A rigid apparatus was used to hold the subject's limb in a predetermined position and confine movement to a specific direction (i.e. ankle dorsiflexion or thumb adduction). An incorporated strain gauge was used to measure isometric torque, and all data were recorded by a data acquisition program. The innervating nerves were stimulated by surface electrodes, using either single stimuli to generate a twitch, or short trains of stimuli to produce tetanic contraction of the individual muscle under study. The average peak tetanic torque generated by the dorsiflexor muscles in healthy control was 20.4 +/- 3.8 Nm and varied by 3.7% with repeated testing. The mean torque generated by the adductor pollicis muscle in controls was 1.5 +/- 0.4 Nm and varied by 4.6% with repeated testing. In patient populations significant changes in activated torque were readily quantified, and the effects of treatment can be easily assessed. Furthermore, several specific parameters of recorded isometric contractions were measured; e.g. time between stimulus and torque onset, peak rate of torque development, time to peak torque, half-relaxation time, and others (none of which are measurable when using voluntary contraction of muscle). Compared to current assessment methods, monitoring muscle torque generated by nerve stimulation improves objectivity, reliability, and quantitative capabilities. The presented method has significant potential both in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders and determining treatment efficacy.",

        "title": "Reproducibility of contractile properties of the human paralysed and non-paralysed quadriceps muscle.",
        "abstract": "This study assessed the reproducibility of electrically evoked, isometric quadriceps contractile properties in eight people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and eight able-bodied (AB) individuals. Over all, the pooled coefficients of variation (CVps) in the SCI group were significantly lower (ranging from 0.03 to 0.15) than in the AB group (ranging from 0.08 to 0.21) (P<0.05). Furthermore, in all subjects, the variability of force production increased as stimulation frequency decreased (P<0.01). In subjects with SCI, variables of contractile speed are clearly less reproducible than tetanic tension or resistance to fatigue. Contractile properties of quadriceps muscles of SCI subjects were significantly different from that of AB subjects. Muscles of people with SCI were less fatigue resistant (P<0.05) and produced force-frequency relationships that were shifted to the left, compared with AB controls (P<.01). In addition, fusion of force responses resulting from 10 Hz stimulation was reduced (P<.05) and speed of contraction (but not relaxation) was increased (P<0.05), indicating an increased contractile speed in paralysed muscles compared with non-paralysed muscles. These results correspond with an expected predominance of fast glycolytic muscle fibres in paralysed muscles. It is concluded that quadriceps dynamometry is a useful technique to study muscle function in non-paralysed as well as in paralysed muscles. Furthermore, these techniques can be reliably used, for example, to assess therapeutic interventions on paralysed muscles provided that expected differences in relative tetanic tension and fatigue resistance are larger than approximately 5% and differences in contractile speed are larger than approximately 15%.",

        "abstract": "The effects of a complete spinal cord transection (ST) on the mechanical properties of the rat soleus were assessed 3 and 6 mo post-ST and compared with age-matched controls. Maximal tetanic force was reduced by approximately 44 and approximately 25% at 3 and 6 mo post-ST, respectively. Similarly, maximum twitch force was reduced by approximately 29% in 3-mo and approximately 17% in 6-mo ST rats. ST resulted in faster twitch properties as evidenced by shorter time to peak tension (approximately 45%) and half-relaxation time (approximately 55%) at both time points. Maximum shortening velocity was significantly increased in ST rats whether measured by extrapolation from the force-velocity curve (approximately twofold at both time points) or by slack-test measurements (over twofold at both time points). A significant reduction in fatigue resistance of the soleus was observed at 3 (approximately 25%) and 6 mo (approximately 45%) post-ST. For the majority of the speed-related properties, no significant differences were detected between 3- and 6-mo ST rats. However, the fatigue resistance of the soleus was significantly lower in 6- vs. 3-mo ST rats. These data suggest that, between 3 and 6 mo post-ST, force-related properties tended to recover, speed-related properties plateaued, and fatigue-related properties continued to decline. Thus some specific functional properties of the rat soleus related to contractile force, speed, and fatigue adapted independently after ST.",

In addition, the relationship of each individual isometric measure was examined with regard to the pattern of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression. Measures of TTP, \u00bdRT, \u00bdFT and sag ratio were negatively correlated with MHCIId(x) and MHCIIb (P < 0.0001), and positively correlated with MHCI (P < 0.0001). TWf and TETf were negatively correlated with MHCI content (P < 0.0001) and positively with MHCIId(x) (P < 0.0001) and MHCIIb (P < 0.001). Comparisons of isometric measures using a paired Student's t test revealed that they were not different between the right and left legs; all measures displayed high correlations between the left and right legs (r= 0.71\u20130.85, P < 0.0001). In contrast to standard tests of statistical significance, these functional measures exhibited a considerable range of RAb when individual muscles were studied in only one hindlimb. When averaged across all muscles, however, the \u00bdFT, \u00bdRT, TWf and TTP measures possessed high overall reliability; measures of TETf and sag ratio were moderately reliable. The results of this study show that the isometric measures studied possess significant predictive value with regard to MHC isoform content; the left and right legs are interchangeable but display a considerable range of reliability when only one hindlimb is studied.",

        "title": "Diabetes Provides an Unfavorable Environment for Muscle Mass and Function after Muscle Injury in Mice",
        "abstract": "It is of common knowledge that diabetes decreases skeletal muscle contractility and induces atrophy. However, how hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency modify muscle mass and neuromuscular recovery after muscle injury is not well known. We have analyzed two models of diabetes: streptozotocin (STZ)-treated Swiss mice and Akita mice that spontaneously develop diabetes. A fast muscle, the tibialis anterior, was injured following injection of a myotoxic agent (cardiotoxin). Neuromuscular function was evaluated by examining in situ isometric contractile properties of regenerating muscles in response to nerve stimulation 14, 28 and 56 days after myotoxic injury. We found that STZ-induced diabetes reduces muscle weight and absolute maximal tetanic force in both regenerating and uninjured muscles (p = 0.0001). Moreover, it increases specific maximal tetanic force and tetanic fusion in regenerating and uninjured muscles (p = 0.04). In the Akita mice, diabetes decreases muscle weight and absolute maximal tetanic force, and increases tetanic fusion in both regenerating and uninjured muscles (p \u2264 0.003). Interestingly, STZ-induced diabetes exerts more marked effects than diabetes of genetic origin, in particular on muscle weight. This reduction in muscle mass was not due to an increased expression of the atrogenes MuRF1 and atrogin-1 during STZ-induced diabetes. The present study in mice demonstrates that both models of diabetes impair regenerating muscles as well as uninjured muscles. Regenerating fast muscles are weaker, lighter and slower in diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice.",

        "abstract": "Mechanistic studies examining the effects of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on skeletal muscle have largely relied on streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ) rodents. Unfortunately, characterization of diabetic myopathy in this model is confounded by the effects of streptozotocin on skeletal muscle independent of the diabetic phenotype. Here we define adolescent diabetic myopathy in a novel, genetic model of T1DM, Ins2(Akita+/-) mice, and contrast these findings with STZ mice. Eight weeks of diabetes resulted in significantly reduced gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus mass (control: 0.16 +/- 0.005 g; Ins2(Akita+/-): 0.12 +/- 0.003 g; STZ: 0.12 +/- 0.01g) and IIB/D fiber area in Ins2(Akita+/-) (1,294 +/- 94 microm(2)) and STZ (1,768 +/- 163 microm(2)) compared with control (2,241 +/- 144 microm(2)). Conversely, STZ type I fibers (1,535 +/- 165 microm(2)) were significantly larger than Ins2(Akita+/-) (915 +/- 76 microm(2)) but not control (1,152 +/- 86 microm(2)). Intramyocellular lipid increased in STZ (122.9 +/- 3.6% of control) but not Ins2(Akita+/-) likely resultant from depressed citrate synthase (control: 6.2 +/- 1.2 micromol.s(-1).mg(-1); Ins2(Akita+/-): 5.2 +/- 0.8 micromol.s(-1).mg(-1); STZ: 2.8 +/- 0.5 micromol.s(-1).mg(-1)) and 3-beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase (control: 4.2 +/- 0.6 nmol.s(-1).mg(-1); Ins2(Akita+/-): 5.0 +/- 0.6 nmol.s(-1).mg(-1); STZ: 2.7 +/- 0.6 nmol.s(-1).mg(-1)) enzyme activity in STZ muscle. In situ muscle stimulation revealed lower absolute peak tetanic force in Ins2(Akita+/-) (70.2 +/- 8.2% of control) while STZ exhibited an insignificant decrease (87.6 +/- 7.9% of control). Corrected for muscle mass, no force loss was observed in Ins2(Akita+/-), while STZ was significantly elevated vs. control and Ins2(Akita+/-). These results demonstrate that atrophy and specific fiber-type loss in Ins2(Akita+/-) muscle did not affect contractile properties (relative to muscle mass). Furthermore, we demonstrate distinctive contractile, metabolic, and phenotypic properties in STZ vs. Ins2(Akita+/-) diabetic muscle despite similarity in hyperglycemia/hypoinsulinemia, raising concerns of our current state of knowledge regarding the effects of T1DM on skeletal muscle.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Type 1 diabetes leads to impairments in growth, function, and regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly defined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS With the use of Ins2WT/C96Y mice (model of adolescent-onset type 1 diabetes), muscle regeneration was characterized in terms of muscle mass, myofiber size (cross-sectional area), and protein expression. Blood plasma was analyzed for glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). PAI-039, an effective inhibitor of PAI-1, was orally administered to determine if PAI-1 was attenuating muscle regeneration in Ins2WT/C96Y mice. RESULTS Ins2WT/C96Y mice exposed to 1 or 8 weeks of untreated type 1 diabetes before chemically induced muscle injury display significant impairments in their regenerative capacity as demonstrated by decreased muscle mass, myofiber cross-sectional area, myogenin, and Myh3 expression. PAI-1, a physiologic inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system and primary contributor to other diabetes complications, was more than twofold increased within 2 weeks of diabetes onset and remained elevated throughout the experimental period. Consistent with increased circulating PAI-1, regenerating muscles of diabetic mice exhibited excessive collagen levels at 5 and 10 days postinjury with concomitant decreases in active urokinase plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Pharmacologic inhibition of PAI-1 with orally administered PAI-039 rescued the early regenerative impairments in noninsulin-treated Ins2WT/C96Y mice. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these data illustrate that the pharmacologic inhibition of elevated PAI-1 restores the early impairments in skeletal muscle repair observed in type 1 diabetes and suggests that early interventional studies targeting PAI-1 may be warranted to ensure optimal growth and repair in adolescent diabetic skeletal muscle.",

        "abstract": "Background Systemic elevations in PAI-1 suppress the fibrinolytic pathway leading to poor collagen remodelling and delayed regeneration of tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in type-1 diabetic Akita mice. However, how impaired collagen remodelling was specifically attenuating regeneration in Akita mice remained unknown. Furthermore, given intrinsic differences between muscle groups, it was unclear if the reparative responses between muscle groups were different. Principal Findings Here we reveal that diabetic Akita muscles display differential regenerative responses with the TA and gastrocnemius muscles exhibiting reduced regenerating myofiber area compared to wild-type mice, while soleus muscles displayed no difference between animal groups following injury. Collagen levels in TA and gastrocnemius, but not soleus, were significantly increased post-injury versus controls. At 5 days post-injury, when degenerating/necrotic regions were present in both animal groups, Akita TA and gastrocnemius muscles displayed reduced macrophage and satellite cell infiltration and poor myofiber formation. By 10 days post-injury, necrotic regions were absent in wild-type TA but persisted in Akita TA. In contrast, Akita soleus exhibited no impairment in any of these measures compared to wild-type soleus. In an effort to define how impaired collagen turnover was attenuating regeneration in Akita TA, a PAI-1 inhibitor (PAI-039) was orally administered to Akita mice following cardiotoxin injury. PAI-039 administration promoted macrophage and satellite cell infiltration into necrotic areas of the TA and gastrocnemius. Importantly, soleus muscles exhibit the highest inducible expression of MMP-9 following injury, providing a mechanism for normative collagen degradation and injury recovery in this muscle despite systemically elevated PAI-1. Conclusions Our findings suggest the mechanism underlying how impaired collagen remodelling in type-1 diabetes results in delayed regeneration is an impairment in macrophage infiltration and satellite cell recruitment to degenerating areas; a phenomena that occurs differentially between muscle groups.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes impairs the ability to heal cutaneous wounds, leading to hospitalization, amputations, and death. Patients with diabetes experience elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), regardless of their glycemic control. It has been demonstrated that PAI-1\u2013deficient mice exhibit improved cutaneous wound healing, and that PAI-1 inhibition improves skeletal muscle repair in mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus, leading us to hypothesize that pharmacologically mediated reductions in PAI-1 using PAI-039 would normalize cutaneous wound healing in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (STZ-diabetic) mice. To simulate the human condition of variations in wound care, wounds were aggravated or minimally handled postinjury. Following cutaneous injury, PAI-039 was orally administered twice daily for 10 days. Compared with nondiabetic mice, wounds in STZ-diabetic mice healed more slowly. Wound site aggravation exacerbated this deficit. PAI-1 inhibition had no effect on dermal collagen levels or wound bed size. PAI-039 treatment failed to improve angiogenesis in the wounds of STZ-diabetic mice and blunted angiogenesis in the wounds of nondiabetic mice. Importantly, PAI-039 treatment significantly improved epidermal cellular migration and wound re-epithelialization compared with vehicle-treated STZ-diabetic mice. These findings support the use of PAI-039 as a novel therapeutic agent to improve diabetic wound closure and demonstrate the primary mechanism of its action to be related to epidermal closure.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor that promotes and inhibits cell migration, plays a complex and important role in adverse vascular remodeling. Little is known about the effects of pharmacological PAI-1 inhibitors, an emerging drug class, on migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), crucial mediators of vascular remodeling. We investigated the effects of PAI-039 (tiplaxtinin), a specific PAI-1 inhibitor, on SMC and EC migration in vitro and vascular remodeling in vivo. Approach and Results\u2014PAI-039 inhibited SMC migration through collagen gels, including those supplemented with vitronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins, but did not inhibit migration of PAI-1-deficient SMCs, suggesting that its antimigratory effects were PAI-1-specific and physiologically relevant. However, PAI-039 did not inhibit EC migration. PAI-039 inhibited phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 in SMCs, but had no discernable effect on signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 signaling in ECs. Expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor\u2013related protein 1, a motogenic PAI-1 receptor that activates Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 signaling, was markedly lower in ECs than in SMCs. Notably, PAI-039 significantly inhibited intimal hyperplasia and inflammation in murine models of adverse vascular remodeling, but did not adversely affect re-endothelialization after endothelium-denuding mechanical vascular injury. Conclusions\u2014PAI-039 inhibits SMC migration and intimal hyperplasia, while having no inhibitory effect on ECs, which seems to be because of differences in PAI-1-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptor\u2013related protein 1/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 signaling between SMCs and ECs. These findings suggest that PAI-1 may be an important therapeutic target in obstructive vascular diseases characterized by neointimal hyperplasia.",

Inflammation, Fibrinolysis and Oxidative Stress play an important role in the disruption of plaques leading to CAD. Markers that reflect this pathophysiologic mechanism may have prognostic value. Objective To estimate the serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), sialic acid (SA), vitronectin (VN), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), oxidized low density lipoprotein (OX-LDL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) with significant prognostic value in patients with CAD. Methods The markers included, hs-CRP, SA, VN, PAI-1, OX-LDL and MDA, were compared between 160 angiographically diagnosed CAD patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. The subjects were divided into 4 groups according to angiography results, and association between all risk factors of CAD was studied. Serum levels of SA, VN, PAI-1, and OX-LDL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); MDA was measured based on reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA); and hs-CRP level was estimated by immunoturbidimetry using a commercial kit. The diagnostic value of these variables was further assessed by ROC curve analysis. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the diagnostic power of the combination. Furthermore, p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results Serum levels of hs-CRP, SA, VN, PAI-1, and OX-LDL were significantly higher in patient groups compared to control group (p < 0.001). Using both normal and CAD patients as subjects, ROC analysis was performed. The cutoff for OX-LDL, MDA, PAI-1, VN, hs-CRP and SA was 2.67 (ug/mL), 5.49 (mmol/mL), 67 (ng/mL), 254 (ng/mL), 3.4 (mg/dL), 7/89 (mg/dL), respectively. Eventually, the complete diagnostic efficacy was classified as: SA, hs-CRP, PAI-1, OX-LDL, MDA and VN. Conclusion Serum levels SA, hs-CRP, VN, PAI-1, OX-LDL and MDA may be predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Interestingly, these analyses can help as diagnostic and monitoring markers in CAD patients.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the prognostic value of various serum markers, including vitronectin (VN) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), in patients with coronary artery disease. Although the source paper's findings on the regulation of vascular VN expression by PAI-1 are not directly built upon, the paper does investigate the role of these proteins in vascular disease, making it partially dependent on the source paper's findings."

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to predicting coronary artery disease (CAD). Our purpose was to utilize autoantibody isotypes against four different unmodified and malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified peptides among Taiwanese with CAD and healthy controls (HCs) for CAD prediction. In this study, levels of MDA, MDA-modified protein (MDA-protein) adducts, and autoantibody isotypes against unmodified peptides and MDA-modified peptides were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To improve the performance of ML, we used decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) coupled with five-fold cross validation and parameters optimization. Levels of plasma MDA and MDA-protein adducts were higher in CAD patients than in HCs. IgM anti-IGKC76\u201399 MDA and IgM anti-A1AT284\u2013298 MDA decreased the most in patients with CAD compared to HCs. In the experimental results of CAD prediction, the decision tree classifier achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81; the random forest classifier achieved an AUC of 0.94; the support vector machine achieved an AUC of 0.65 for differentiating between CAD patients with stenosis rates of 70% and HCs. In this study, we demonstrated that autoantibody isotypes imported into machine learning algorithms can lead to accurate models for clinical use.",

        "title": "XAI Framework for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Classification Techniques",
        "abstract": "Machine intelligence models are robust in classifying the datasets for data analytics and for predicting the insights that would assist in making clinical decisions. The models would assist in the disease prognosis and preliminary disease investigation, which is crucial for effective treatment. There is a massive demand for the interpretability and explainability of decision models in the present day. The models\u2019 trustworthiness can be attained through deploying the ensemble classification models in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework. In the current study, the role of ensemble classifiers over the XAI framework for predicting heart disease from the cardiovascular datasets is carried out. There are 303 instances and 14 attributes in the cardiovascular dataset taken for the proposed work. The attribute characteristics in the dataset are categorical, integer, and real type and the associated task related to the dataset is classification. The classification techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), bagging, logistic regression (LR), and naive Bayes, are considered for classification purposes. The experimental outcome of each of those algorithms is compared to each other and with the conventional way of implementing the classification models. The efficiency of the XAI-based classification models is reasonably fair, compared to the other state-of-the-art models, which are assessed using the various evaluation metrics, such as area under curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity, specificity, and the F1-score. The performances of the XAI-driven SVM, LR, and naive Bayes are robust, with an accuracy of 89%, which is assumed to be reasonably fair, compared to the existing models.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown great promise in detecting heart disease. However, to ensure the clinical adoption of ML models, they must not only be generalizable and robust but also transparent and explainable. Therefore, this research introduces an approach that integrates the robustness of ensemble learning algorithms with the precision of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning and the interpretability offered by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The ensemble classifiers considered include adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The experimental results on the Cleveland and Framingham datasets demonstrate that the optimized XGBoost model achieved the highest performance, with specificity and sensitivity values of 0.971 and 0.989 on the Cleveland dataset and 0.921 and 0.975 on the Framingham dataset, respectively.",
