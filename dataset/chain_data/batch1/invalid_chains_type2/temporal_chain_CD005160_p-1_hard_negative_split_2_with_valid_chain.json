        "abstract": "No effective medical therapy is available for all patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been suggested to be of benefit based on open label clinical studies. We randomized 166 patients with liver biopsy\u2013proven NASH to receive between 13 and 15 mg/kg/d of UDCA or placebo for 2 years. End points included changes in liver test results and liver histology at 2 years of therapy. The treatment groups were comparable at entry with regard to age, gender, risk factors for NASH, serum liver biochemistries, and baseline liver histology. A total of 126 patients completed 2 years of therapy. Pre\u2010 and posttreatment liver biopsies were available in 107 patients for review at the end of the study. UDCA was well tolerated and body weight was stable during the study duration. Serum liver biochemistries were stable or improved in both the UDCA and placebo\u2010treated groups. Changes in the degree of steatosis, necroinflammation, or fibrosis that occurred with therapy were not significantly different between the UDCA and placebo groups. In conclusion, 2 years of therapy with UDCA at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/d, although safe and well tolerated, is not better than placebo for patients with NASH. (HEPATOLOGY 2004;39:770\u2013778.)",

        "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of incidental elevation of liver enzymes in North America and Europe. Risk factors for NAFLD include body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater, central obesity and diabetes mellitus. The spectrum of disease is variable, ranging from simple steatosis with benign prognosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, conferring increase in morbidity and mortality. The primary abnormality or 'first hit' in patients with NAFLD is insulin resistance leading to hepatic steatosis. The second hit involves multiple proinflammatory cytokines resulting in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Treatment is aimed at aggressive risk factor control and weight loss. Currently, there are no pharmacological agents recommended in the treatment of NAFLD, although preliminary studies suggest promising agents in the future.",

        "title": "Psoriatic arthritis, methotrexate and the liver--are rheumatologists putting their patients at risk?",
        "abstract": "It seems hard to believe that in the early 1990s MTX use by a respected group of UK rheumatologists in nine hospitals only represented 3% of all DMARDs used for a cohort of patients presenting with early RA [1]. It is now the most widely used DMARD, not only for RA, but is effective for both psoriasis and PsA [2, 3]. It has also become our principal anchor drug in combination therapy, including the anti-TNF agents, where recent data suggests that their combination is our best treatment option yet in RA [4]. As a cheap, effective and usually well-tolerated drug it is not surprising that prescribing it worldwide has continued to rise exponentially and that the patients may be on it commonly for >5 yrs. Hepatotoxicity with MTX has always been a concern. In the 1970s, this was the predominant reason for MTX falling out of favour in the UK. Fortunately for patients, good long-term follow-up studies continued in the USA proving not only that it is safe but also that it may improve survival in patients with RA [5, 6]. Further data shows that it is more likely to be continued at 5 yrs than any of the traditional DMARDs and is now the most frequently prescribed in Europe too [3]. The introduction of regular folate supplementation has been a key advance, not only in reducing aphthous ulceration, hair loss and nausea, but also reducing haematological toxicity. There is also some evidence to suggest that this reduces liver toxicity too [7]. However, even without this, long-term studies have suggested that liver damage is minimal in RA patients, as long as regular monitoring of liver transaminases is undertaken. Thus, treatment of RA with MTX and folate has become widely accepted, with very little toxicity reported. Even hepatologists now use MTX to treat conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis [8]. Rheumatologists have moved on to use MTX for PsA, knowing that our dermatology colleagues have used it successfully to treat psoriasis for many years. Although effective for both conditions, the dermatologists have always had concern for its potential for liver damage. The American Academy of Dermatology guidelines still recommend that sequential liver biopsies are performed at a cumulative dose of 1.5 g (i.e. every 2 yrs at a weekly dose 15mg) [9]. The concern for liver toxicity in psoriasis has been supported by research suggesting that significant liver damage is three times more likely in these patients when compared with patients with RA at the same dosage and that liver cirrhosis may occur without significant increases in transaminase [10, 11]. Reasons suggested for this are the confounding effect of alcohol from which abstinence has been strongly emphasized in rheumatology practice; a systemic effect of psoriasis per se; more frequent and regular serial testing of liver function tests (LFTs) with dose reduction in rheumatology practice; folic acid co-prescription that reduces liver function test abnormalities; and finally antiinflammatory medication and other DMARDs, such as SSZ and steroids, which suppress fibrogenesis within the liver [12]. Rheumatologists treating PsA usually monitor their patients in the same way as RA and do not quantify cumulative dose or treatment duration. This may suggest that rheumatologists are putting their patients at risk particularly after 5 yrs treatment when there is a dearth of evidence that this is safe. Significantly, liver function tests are thought to be insensitive at predicting the development of liver fibrosis in psoriasis by dermatologists, whereas rheumatologists feel that serial monitoring of transaminases is sufficient. The caveat to this is that a referral to a gastroenterologist for liver biopsy is made if five out of nine aspartamine transferase (AST) estimations are elevated in 1 yr or if hypoalbuminaemia in the absence of active inflammatory arthritis occurs [9, 13]. From a rheumatologist\u2019s point of view this rarely occurs. A recent review of Irish practice confirms that monitoring remains very different between the two specialties when treating people with psoriasis [14]. From this two key questions arise. First, as PsA is more likely to be like psoriasis than RA, are patients with PsA on MTX in rheumatology departments at risk of long term progressive undetected liver damage. Second, can we find a reliable noninvasive way of monitoring our MTX-treated patients without having to do regular liver biopsies? With the known complications of liver biopsy, both patients and clinicians are very keen to find an answer to this [15]. Whilst there is no doubt that MTX causes hepatotoxicity, to what degree it does in the absence of other risk factors is not clear. There are numerous clinical cases of MTX-induced cirrhosis and death, though typically in the presence of confounding factors [16, 17]. An experimental rat model demonstrates hepatic necrosis with low-dose daily MTX [18] but cannot be reproduced in weekly dosages even at very high doses. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a hitherto unrecognized and largely ignored disease has become the focus of intense research as it may well be the most common form of liver disease in the western world. A proportion of cases develop inflammation, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [19]. Similar to MTX hepatotoxicity the risk factors for NASH are obesity and diabetes. The mainstay of treatment of NASH is aggressive risk factor management and weight loss [20]. Whilst difficult to quantify, MTX contributes to liver fibrosis and no doubt a proportion of reported cases of MTX-induced hepatotoxicity cases can retrospectively be ascribed to NASH. MTX can lead to NASH-like appearances on histology in the absence of obesity or diabetes [21]. Liver function tests are elevated in PsA compared with RA treated with MTX in a study in which the most likely confounding factor, alcohol consumption, was excluded, supporting the suggestion that psoriasis per se may increase the risk of hepatic fibrosis [11]. However, other risk factors for NAFLD were not considered and liver biopsies were not performed. Also selfreported alcohol consumption is unreliable evidence, particularly as the level increases [11]. It is useful to think of MTX as one in a group of risk factors for hepatic fibrosis, which includes alcohol. For the long-term use of MTX for PsA and even the switch to injected MTX, the ACR guidelines are not yet validated particularly after 5 yrs of therapy. The risk of cirrhosis from all potential risk factors ought to be reassessed and performance of liver biopsy or alternative tests of liver fibrosis are justified [15]. Certainly, in patients who are at risk of NASH, with diabetes and obesity, the rheumatologist may well find themselves monitoring liver function tests for this disease as well and a still more long-term safety data is needed in this group. The second key question concerns non-invasive liver monitoring.

        "abstract": "Objective. MTX is widely used to treat synovitis in PsA without supporting trial evidence. The aim of our study was to test the value of MTX in the first large randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) in PsA. Methods. A 6-month double-blind RCT compared MTX (15\u2009mg/week) with placebo in active PsA. The primary outcome was PsA response criteria (PsARC). Other outcomes included ACR20, DAS-28 and their individual components. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation methods. Treatments were compared using logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, sex, disease duration and, where appropriate, individual baseline scores). Results. Four hundred and sixty-two patients were screened and 221 recruited. One hundred and nine patients received MTX and 112 received placebo. Forty-four patients were lost to follow-up (21 MTX, 23 placebo). Twenty-six patients discontinued treatment (14 MTX, 12 placebo). Comparing MTX with placebo in all randomized patients at 6 months showed no significant effect on PsARC [odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95% CI 0.97, 3.23], ACR20 (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.65, 6.22) or DAS-28 (OR 1.70, 95% CI 0.90, 3.17). There were also no significant treatment effects on tender and swollen joint counts, ESR, CRP, HAQ and pain. The only benefits of MTX were reductions in patient and assessor global scores and skin scores at 6 months (P\u2009=\u20090.03, P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). There were no unexpected adverse events. Conclusions. This trial of active PsA found no evidence for MTX improving synovitis and consequently raises questions about its classification as a disease-modifying drug in PsA. Trial registration.

        "abstract": "Objective The immune inflammatory disorders rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis (Ps) share common pathologic features and show responsiveness to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents yet they are phenotypically distinct. The aim of this study was to examine if anti-TNF therapy is associated with divergent gene expression profiles in circulating cells and target tissues of patients with these diseases. Methods Peripheral blood CD14+ and CD14\u2212 cells were isolated from 9 RA, 12 PsA and 10 Ps patients before and after infliximab (IFX) treatment. Paired synovial (n\u200a=\u200a3, RA, PsA) and skin biopsies (n\u200a=\u200a5, Ps) were also collected. Gene expression was analyzed by microarrays. Results 26 out of 31 subjects responded to IFX. The transcriptional response of CD14+ cells to IFX was unique for the three diseases, with little overlap (<25%) in significantly changed gene lists (with PsA having the largest number of changed genes). In Ps, altered gene expression was more pronounced in lesional skin (relative to paired, healthy skin) compared to blood (relative to healthy controls). Marked suppression of up-regulated genes in affected skin was noted 2 weeks after therapy but the expression patterns differed from uninvolved skin. Divergent patterns of expression were noted between the blood cells and skin or synovial tissues in individual patients. Functions that promote cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in all three diseases were enriched. RA was enriched in functions in CD14\u2212 cells, PsA in CD14+ cells and Ps in both CD14+ and CD14\u2212 cells, however, the specific functions showed little overlap in the 3 disorders. Conclusion Divergent patterns of altered gene expression are observed in RA, PsA and Ps patients in blood cells and target organs in IFX responders. Differential gene expression profiles in the blood do not correlate with those in target organs.",

        "abstract": "Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) may be induced in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy with TNF inhibitors (TNFi), etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab. In the present study, 11 patients who were TNFi drug naive were started on TNFi at a time of high disease activity. Of these, all cases were positive for rheumatoid factor and 9 cases tested were positive for anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies prior to TNFi treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were collected from all patients before and after TNFi therapy. Serum was assayed for ANAs over time. Total cellular RNA was extracted from PBMCs and assessed using Illumina arrays. Gene expression profiles were examined for alterations in key effector pathways. After 3 or more months on TNFi, 6 patients converted to ANA-positivity. Analysis of transcripts from patients with RA who converted to ANA-positivity after 3 months on TNFi identified complex gene expression profiles that reflected a reduction in cell adhesion, cell stress and lipid metabolism transcripts. In summary, unique transcriptional profiles in PBMCs from patients with RA were observed after TNFi therapy. This pilot study suggests that transcriptional profiling is a precise method of measuring the impact of TNFi therapies and reveals novel pathways that likely influence the immune response.",

        "abstract": "Introdcution Through interaction with receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, TNF-\u03b1 activates a signal path, which exacerbates an inflammatory process, constituting an inseparable element of psoriasis. Aim To evaluate changes in the expression of TNF-\u03b1, TNFR1, TNFR2 during the 4-year-long adalimumab therapy in psoriatic patients, searching for the correlation between molecular and clinical markers. In addition, the role of miRNAs was analysed. Material and methods Whole blood and serum samples of psoriatic patients treated with adalimumab constituted material for the study. Changes in the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and its receptors were evaluated with the use of the RTqPCR method and MALDI ToF mass spectroscopy, PASI, BSA, DAS28 indexes were used for the clinical analysis of the patients, while the role of miRNA molecules was determined basing on microrna.org database. Results Different TNF-\u03b1 expression patterns were determined in patients with observed resistance to the medicine. We found that there is a correlation between the molecular markers of an inflammatory process and the clinical indexes. The bioinformatic analysis indicates the potential role of miRNAs in the regulation of expression of the analysed genes. Changes in the profile of TNF-\u03b1 during adalimumab therapy are significantly determined by the individual variability and susceptibility to the biological medicine or its loss. Conclusions TNF-\u03b1 seems to be a useful marker to evaluate the efficacy of therapy and occurring resistance to the medicine. A complex mechanism for the regulation of the analysed gene expression was underlined, which involved the potential role of miRNAs.",
