        "abstract": "Background: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long\u2010term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. Methods: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low\u2010fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non\u2010EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. Results: On an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non\u2010EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1\u2010year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non\u2010EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)\u20101&bgr;, IL\u20106, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr; levels significantly increased with time in the non\u2010EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL\u20101&bgr;, P = 0.02; IL\u20106, P = 0.002; TNF\u2010&agr;, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. Conclusions: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.

        "abstract": "Enteral nutrition has long been a therapeutic alternative often used in adult Crohn's disease patients to obtain remission or clinical response, especially in those not responding to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids. However, the increasing use of immunosuppressors (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.), and the advent of biotherapies (especially anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies), decreased its use in adult Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, enteral nutrition remains of interest in patients presenting concomitant malnutrition (in particular in nonobstructed patients needing surgery), or in those intolerant or who failed to other therapeutics. In addition, recent studies provide data indicating its potential interest in maintenance therapy in selected patients groups. Finally, future research (in particular in the field of immuno- or pharmaconutrition) could lead to enteral formula's improvement, with better tolerance and acceptability, as well as increased efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Dietetic intervention with polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-\u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22) represents a relatively satisfactory therapeutic modality in adult patients with mild to moderately active Crohn\u2019s disease. However, there is no information concerning long-term results of this special diet. The aim of this study was to compare the results of the administration of a special diet (Modulen IBD) rich in TGF-\u03b22 with those of the administration of mesalamine, in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Methods: Of the 83 patients initially included in the study, 76 (91.5%) [36 in the Modulen and 30 in the mesalamine arm] completed the trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either two meals (2X50g) of Modulen IBD plus two regular meals per day (43 patients) or mesalamine (800mg three times a day) (40 patients) for six months. Patients were assessed at sixth months after initiation of the trial. Relapse was defined as a Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index of greater than 150 points or at least 60 points over baseline. Various anthropometric parameters and serum estimations including ESR, CRP, platelets, albumin, vitamin B12 and folic acid were carried out at the beginning of the trial and after six months. Results: Twenty-five patients in the Modulen arm (69%) continued to be in remission after six months compared with 18(60%) receiving mesalamine (no significant differences). Among patients with relapse the mean time to relapse was 103 days for those treated with mesalamine and 123 days for those treated with Modulen (no significant differences). Conclusion:Modulen-IBD treatment reduced relapse rate to a better degree compared with mesalamine treatment, although statistical significance was not achieved.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nControlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of aminosalicylates for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease have yielded conflicting results. A systematic review was conducted to critically examine current available data on the efficacy of sulfasalazine and mesalamine for inducing remission or clinical response in patients with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the efficacy of aminosalicylates compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nSeparate MEDLINE (1966-July 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 3, 2010) and EMBASE database searches (1985-July 2010) of all relevant English and non-English language articles were performed, followed by manual searches of the reference list from potentially relevant papers and review articles, as well as proceedings from annual meetings (1991-2010) of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American College of Gastroenterology (ACG).\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of sulfasalazine or mesalamine in the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) were included.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData extraction and assessment of methodological quality of each selected study was independently performed by the investigators and any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. The primary outcome measure was a well defined clinical endpoint of induction of remission or response to treatment. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Pooled relative risks (RR) for inducing remission or clinical response and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated (random effects model) where appropriate.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSulfasalazine was more likely to induce remission (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.87; n = 263) compared to placebo with benefit confined mainly to patients with colitis. Sulfasalazine was less effective than corticosteroids (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81; n = 260). Olsalazine was less effective than placebo in a single trial. Low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) was not superior to placebo (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 0.89-2.40; n = 302) and was less effective than corticosteroids. High dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission (RR 2.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 5.45) or response (Weighted Mean Difference -19.8 points; 95% CI -46.2 to 6.7; n = 615). In a single randomized controlled trial, 5-ASA was inferior to budesonide (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78). No statistically significant difference was found between high dose mesalamine and conventional corticosteroids (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; n = 178). However, relatively few patients were available for analysis. There was a lack of good quality clinical trials comparing sulfasalazine with other mesalamine formulations.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nSulfasalazine has modest efficacy compared to placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease. Olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. High dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. High dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. In conclusion, sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the existing data show little benefit for 5-aminosalicylates.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade a large number of biological agents against tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), as well as many biochemical substances and molecules specifically for the medical treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have been developed. This enormous progress was a consequence of the significant advances in biotechnology along with the increased knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, conventional therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment for most patients. During recent years conventional and biologic IBD therapies have been optimized. Newer mesalazine formulations with a reduced pill size and only one dose per day demonstrate similar efficacy to older formulations. New corticosteroids retain the efficacy of older corticosteroids while exhibiting a higher safety profile. The role of antibiotics and probiotics has been further clarified. Significant progress in understanding thiopurine metabolism has improved the effective dose along with adjunctive therapies. Quite a large number of substances and therapies, including biologic agents other than TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, microbes and microbial products, leukocytapheresis, and other substances under investigation, could offer important benefits to our patients.

        "abstract": "The most important function of the intestinal mucosa is to form a barrier that separates luminal contents from the intestine. Defects in the intestinal epithelial barrier have been observed in several intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have identified a number of factors that contribute to development of IBD including environmental triggers, genetic factors, immunoregulatory defects and microbial exposure. The current review focuses on the influence of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on the inhibition of intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD. The development and investigation of FXR agonists provide strong support for the regulatory role of FXR in mucosal innate immunity. Activation of FXR in the intestinal tract decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1-beta, IL-2, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, thus contributing to a reduction in inflammation and epithelial permeability. In addition, intestinal FXR activation induces the transcription of multiple genes involved in enteroprotection and the prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. These data suggest that FXR agonists are potential candidates for exploration as a novel therapeutic strategy for IBD in humans.",

        "abstract": "Bile acids are the end products of cholesterol catabolism. Hepatic bile acid synthesis accounts for a major fraction of daily cholesterol turnover in humans. Biliary secretion of bile acids generates bile flow and facilitates hepatobiliary secretion of lipids, lipophilic metabolites, and xenobiotics. In the intestine, bile acids are essential for the absorption, transport, and metabolism of dietary fats and lipid-soluble vitamins. Extensive research in the last 2 decades has unveiled new functions of bile acids as signaling molecules and metabolic integrators. The bile acid\u2013activated nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, vitamin D receptor, and G protein\u2013coupled bile acid receptor play critical roles in the regulation of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism, inflammation, and drug metabolism and detoxification. Bile acid synthesis exhibits a strong diurnal rhythm, which is entrained by fasting and refeeding as well as nutrient status and plays an important role for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Recent research revealed an interaction of liver bile acids and gut microbiota in the regulation of liver metabolism. Circadian disturbance and altered gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity.

        "abstract": "The gastrointestinal microbiota plays a central role in the host metabolism of bile acids through deconjugation and dehydroxylation reactions, which generate unconjugated free bile acids and secondary bile acids respectively. These microbially generated bile acids are particularly potent signalling molecules that interact with host bile acid receptors (including the farnesoid X receptor, vitamin D receptor and TGR5 receptor) to trigger cellular responses that play essential roles in host lipid metabolism, electrolyte transport and immune regulation. Perturbations of microbial populations in the gut can therefore profoundly alter bile acid profiles in the host to impact upon the digestive and signalling properties of bile acids in the human superorganism. A number of recent studies have clearly demonstrated the occurrence of microbial disturbances allied to alterations in host bile acid profiles that occur across a range of disease states. Intestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), short bowel syndrome and Clostridium difficile infection all exhibit concurrent alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and changes to host bile acid profiles. Similarly, extraintestinal diseases and syndromes such as asthma and obesity may be linked to aberrant bile acid profiles in the host.

To understand the role of dysbiosis in cardiovascular and metabolic disease caused by OSA, we systematically study the effect of intermittent hypoxic/hypercapnic stress (IHH, mimicking OSA) on gut microbes in an animal model. We take advantage of a longitudinal study design and paired omics to investigate the microbial and molecular dynamics in the gut to ascertain the contribution of microbes on intestinal metabolism in IHH. We observe microbe-dependent changes in the gut metabolome that will guide future research on unrecognized mechanistic links between gut microbes and comorbidities of OSA. Additionally, we highlight novel and noninvasive biomarkers for OSA-linked cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. ABSTRACT Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by episodic obstruction to breathing due to upper airway collapse during sleep. Because of the episodic airway obstruction, intermittently low O2 (hypoxia) and high CO2 (hypercapnia) ensue. OSA has been associated with adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes, although data regarding potential causal pathways are still evolving. As changes in inspired O2 and CO2 can affect the ecology of the gut microbiota and the microbiota has been shown to contribute to various cardiometabolic disorders, we hypothesized that OSA alters the gut ecosystem, which, in turn, exacerbates the downstream physiological consequences. Here, we model human OSA and its cardiovascular consequence using Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet and exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH). The gut microbiome and metabolome were characterized longitudinally (using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]) and seen to covary during IHH. Joint analysis of microbiome and metabolome data revealed marked compositional changes in both microbial (>10%, most remarkably in Clostridia) and molecular (>22%) species in the gut. Moreover, molecules that altered in abundance included microbe-dependent bile acids, enterolignans, and fatty acids, highlighting the impact of IHH on host-commensal organism cometabolism in the gut. Thus, we present the first evidence that IHH perturbs the gut microbiome functionally, setting the stage for understanding its involvement in cardiometabolic disorders.

Although it is often possible to distinguish individuals with specific diseases within a study, the differences are often inconsistent across cohorts, often due to systematic variation in analytical conditions. Here we study the same intervention in two different mouse models of cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis) by profiling the microbiome and metabolome in stool specimens over time. We demonstrate that shared microbial and metabolic changes are involved in both models with the intervention. We then introduce a pipeline for finding similar results in other studies. This work will help find common features identified across different model systems that are most likely to apply in humans. ABSTRACT Studying perturbations in the gut ecosystem using animal models of disease continues to provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in various pathological conditions. However, understanding whether these changes are consistent across animal models of different genetic backgrounds, and hence potentially translatable to human populations, remains a major unmet challenge in the field. Nonetheless, in relatively limited cases have the same interventions been studied in two animal models in the same laboratory. Moreover, such studies typically examine a single data layer and time point. Here, we show the power of utilizing time series microbiome (16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and metabolome (untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]) data to relate two different mouse models of atherosclerosis\u2014ApoE\u2212/\u2212 (n\u2009=\u200924) and Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 (n\u2009=\u200916)\u2014that are exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH) longitudinally (for 10 and 6\u2009weeks, respectively) to model chronic obstructive sleep apnea. Using random forest classifiers trained on each data layer, we show excellent accuracy in predicting IHH exposure within ApoE\u2212/\u2212 and Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 knockout models and in cross-applying predictive features found in one animal model to the other. The key microbes and metabolites that reproducibly predicted IHH exposure included bacterial species from the families Mogibacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, bile acids, and fatty acids, providing a refined set of biomarkers associated with IHH. The results highlight that time series multiomics data can be used to relate different animal models of disease using supervised machine learning techniques and can provide a pathway toward identifying robust microbiome and metabolome features that underpin translation from animal models to human disease.

        "abstract": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is the prominent signature of highly prevalent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) pathophysiology, which leads to increased risk and aggravation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, whether intestinal microbiota is implicated in the mechanisms linking CIH to arteriosclerosis (AS) pathogenesis remains unclear. The association of CIH with the development of altered gut microbiota (GM) may provide the opportunity to develop preventive strategies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk reduction. Animal models of apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice treated with high-fat diet (HFD) and subjected to CIH conditions was applied to mimic the AS observed in patients with OSA. The physiological status and atherosclerotic lesion formation were confirmed by histological analysis. 16S rDNA sequencing of fecal samples was conducted to determine the changes in gut microbial composition. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that CIH caused aggravated atherosclerotic lesions and facilitated AS in apoE-/- mice treated with HFD. The gut bacteria was significantly varied in AS and AS+CIH mice compared with that in the control mice. Significantly perturbed GM profiles were detected in AS mice with and without CIH, with altered microbial \u03b1- and \u03b2- diversity and shifts in bacterial compositions at phylum and genus levels. While the difference between AS and AS+CIH was observed at different bacteria taxa levels. Aggravation of reduced Sutterella and increased Halomonas, Halomonadaceae and Oceanospirillales was noted in CIH-treated AS mice. The correlation of intestinal bacterial parameters with pathological changes in artery indicated complicated interactions under CIH-induced GM dysbiosis. Furthermore, the gut microbial functions in the potential ability of replication recombination and repair proteins, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, as well as metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were identified to be further suppressed by CIH. Our findings demonstrated a causal effect of CIH on GM alterations in AS mice and suggested that the disordered GM features in AS development were deteriorated by CIH, which may be associated with AS aggravation. Preventative strategies targeting gut microbiome are highly recommended for intervention of OSA-related AS.",

        "title": "Protective effect of Astragaloside IV on chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction through the calpain-1/SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway",
        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) is linked with the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease. Astragaloside IV (As-IV) has exhibited significant improvement for endothelial dysfunction. Nonetheless, the protective mechanism is not clear. Therefore, the present study investigated the potential mechanism of As-IV on VED. Calpain-1 knockout and wild-type C57BL/6 mice exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) were established and treated with As-IV (40, 80 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) subjected to CIH exposure were pretreated with As-IV, MDL-28170 (calpain-1 inhibitor) and SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator) for 48 h in vitro. The endothelial function, inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function were measured to evaluate VED. Our data revealed that As-IV treatment ameliorated CIH-induced endothelial-dependent vasomotion and augmented nitric oxide (NO) production. As-IV administration suppressed the secretion of inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. As-IV treatment reduced the expression of calpain-1 and restored the downregulated expression of SIRT1 and Thr172 AMPK and Ser1177 eNOS phosphorylation. The effects of calpain-1 knockout and SRT1720 were similar to the effect of As-IV on VED. These findings demonstrated that As-IV ameliorated VED induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia via the calpain-1/SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway.",

        "title": "Impact of Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia on Cognitive Function and Hippocampal Neurons in Mice: A Study of Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Pathways",
        "abstract": "Purpose Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is considered one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CIH can further lead to cognitive dysfunction by inducing processes such as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The hippocampus is primarily associated with cognitive functions such as learning and memory. This study aimed to explore the effects of CIH on cognitive function and hippocampal neurons in mice and to reveal its potential molecular mechanisms. Methods SPF-grade C57BL/6J mice (n=36) were selected as subjects and divided into control, mild CIH, and severe CIH groups (12 mice per group). Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test, and hippocampal neuron numbers and morphological changes were observed using HE staining and Nissl staining. Additionally, differential genes and pathways were revealed through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis. We examined oxidative stress-related biochemical markers in the hippocampal tissue and used Western Blot to verify changes in the expression of potential key genes. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and post hoc tests to ensure robust comparisons between groups. Results CIH mice exhibited significant cognitive impairment, including decreased learning and memory abilities. The severe CIH group had a longer escape latency compared to the mild CIH group (p < 0.001) and the control group (p < 0.01), while the mild CIH group took longer than the control group (p < 0.01). In the probe test, the severe CIH group showed a significant decrease in platform crossings (p < 0.01) and target quadrant dwell time (p < 0.05), while the mild CIH group exhibited a reduction in target quadrant dwell time (p < 0.05). Abnormal hippocampal neuron morphology was observed, with a significant reduction in hippocampal neurons (p < 0.05). RNA-seq analysis revealed numerous differentially expressed genes, mainly enriched in biological processes such as inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as multiple signaling pathways. Specifically, downregulated LepR, SIRT1, and Nrf2 genes were found to exacerbate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, impairing neuronal integrity and cognitive function. Further validation showed increased oxidative stress levels in hippocampal tissue and downregulation of key gene expression. Western blot analysis confirmed significantly reduced expression of LepR (p < 0.01), SIRT1 (p < 0.001), and Nrf2 (p < 0.001) in the severe CIH group. Conclusion While oxidative stress and inflammation are well-established mechanisms in CIH-induced cognitive impairment, our study provides novel insights by identifying the specific roles of LepR, SIRT1, and Nrf2 in this process. The downregulation of these key genes suggests potential new targets for therapeutic intervention. Importantly, the differential expression patterns observed in varying degrees of hypoxia severity highlight the potential for tailored therapeutic strategies that modulate these pathways in response to the intensity of hypoxic exposure. These findings offer unique opportunities for developing targeted therapies aimed at mitigating CIH-related cognitive decline and neural damage. However, a key limitation of this study is the exclusive use of animal models, which may not fully replicate human pathophysiology. Further studies are needed to validate these findings in clinical settings and to explore the regulatory relationships between the key genes involved.",
