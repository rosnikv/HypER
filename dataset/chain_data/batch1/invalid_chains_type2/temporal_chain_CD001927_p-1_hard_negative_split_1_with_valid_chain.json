        "title": "Fixed minidose warfarin and aspirin alone and in combination vs adjusted-dose warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite the efficacy of warfarin sodium therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, many physicians hesitate to prescribe it to elderly patients because of the risk for bleeding complications and because of inconvenience for the patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation Study was a randomized, controlled trial examining the following therapies: warfarin sodium, 1.25 mg/d; warfarin sodium, 1.25 mg/d, plus aspirin, 300 mg/d; and aspirin, 300 mg/d. These were compared with adjusted-dose warfarin therapy (international normalized ratio of prothrombin time [INR], 2.0-3.0). Stroke or a systemic thromboembolic event was the primary outcome event. Transient ischemic attack, acute myocardial infarction, and death were secondary events. Data were handled as survival data, and risk factors were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. The trial was scheduled for 6 years from May 1, 1993, but due to scientific evidence of inefficiency of low-intensity warfarin plus aspirin therapy from another study, our trial was prematurely terminated on October 2, 1996.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 677 patients (median age, 74 years). The cumulative primary event rate after 1 year was 5.8% in patients receiving minidose warfarin; 7.2%, warfarin plus aspirin; 3.6%, aspirin; and 2.8%, adjusted-dose warfarin (P = .67). After 3 years, no difference among the groups was seen. Major bleeding events were rare.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough the difference was insignificant, adjusted-dose warfarin seemed superior to minidose warfarin and to warfarin plus aspirin after 1 year of treatment. The results do not justify a change in the current recommendation of adjusted-dose warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.",

        "title": "Antithrombotic Therapy To Prevent Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation",
        "abstract": "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is an important independent risk factor for stroke. Since 1989, 16 published clinical trials have conducted 36 separate randomized comparisons of antithrombotic agents in approximately 10 000 participants with atrial fibrillation (1-17). Previously published meta-analyses and pooled analyses of individual patient data (18-20) have considered, in various combinations, the first 6 clinical trials to be published. We present a meta-analysis of all currently available trials to further characterize the comparative efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Methods Randomized trials testing long-term (>3 months) use of antithrombotic agents in patients with atrial fibrillation were sought by a computerized search of the OVID/MEDLINE databases (from 1966 to 1999, not restricted by language) and by inquiries to the Cochrane Collaboration Stroke Review Group and Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration. Studies of atrial fibrillation associated with prosthetic cardiac valves or mitral stenosis were not considered; trials reporting results for subgroups of participants with atrial fibrillation among other participants without atrial fibrillation were included (14, 16). Double-blind and nonblinded trials were included, and sensitivity analysis was used to compare pooled results, as appropriate. We excluded one randomized trial in which results for participants with atrial fibrillation (approximately half of all participants) were not reported separately (21). We have anecdotal knowledge of two additional trials that are ongoing or have not been published (Table 1). Table 1. Randomized Clinical Trials for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Two reviewers independently extracted data from published sources on the number of patients treated, total follow-up exposure, and the occurrence of five outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis: all stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and major extracranial bleeding. The criteria for each of these outcomes were those used in each individual trial; major deviations are noted in footnotes to the tables. Intracranial hemorrhage included spontaneous and traumatic subdural hematomas. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were not considered. The percentage of participants who underwent neuroimaging or autopsy to reliably distinguish between ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke varied, and this percentage was not always reported. Therefore, all stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic) was chosen as the primary outcome. Effects of antithrombotic therapy on combinations of events (for example, stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) and effects of age and sex were not consistently reported and are not considered here. Intention-to-treat results were used for the main analyses, but only results noted during treatment were available for one small trial that tested antiplatelet agents (14). Primary prevention refers to patients without previous stroke or TIA; secondary prevention refers to patients with previous stroke or TIA. Detailed consideration of the design and execution of individual trials can be found in our systematic reviews prepared for the Cochrane Collaboration Stroke Review Group (16, 22). The authors participated in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) I, II, and III clinical trials (1987 to 1999), which were funded by the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke. Meta-analyses of the results of the trials are presented as relative risk reductions and absolute risk reductions for treatment groups compared with control groups. To estimate the relative risk reduction, the combined odds ratio was computed by using the modified Mantel-Haenszel (Peto) method (23), and the estimate was then subtracted from 1. For a study in which no events were observed for a specific outcome and treatment, 0.5 was added to the empty cell. The absolute risk reduction is a weighted estimate of the difference in annualized event rates (24). Before we estimated risk reduction, we tested the assumption of the statistical homogeneity of the treatment effect (across trials and within a specific scenario) by using the QL statistic for the relative odds scale (24) or the QW statistic with unequal weights for the absolute risk scale (24). Lack of homogeneity across trials precluded estimation of the treatment effect, as noted. Homogeneity was assessed for all meta-analyses of relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction; the exact P value was reported for all main analyses and for analyses in which the P value was less than 0.2. Estimates of relative risk reduction in individual trials were computed by subtracting the estimated odds ratio from 1. We estimated absolute risk reductions in individual trials by calculating the absolute difference in annualized event rates (events per person-years of observation). A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant; all tests and CIs are two-sided. Calculations were done by using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois) and EGRET software (Cytel Software Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts). Results Sixteen randomized trials published between 1989 and 1999 included 9874 participants with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with 2239 participants assigned to placebo (Table 1) (1-16). Total reported exposure was about 16 400 person-years (mean follow-up, 1.7 years). Fourteen trials included only participants with atrial fibrillation (1-13, 15); 2 trials included participants with atrial fibrillation in larger trials of secondary stroke prevention (14, 16). Warfarin was used exclusively in 10 trials testing oral anticoagulant agents; other derivatives of coumarin were also used in 2 additional trials (9, 15). Adjusted-Dose Warfarin Compared with Placebo In six trials involving 2900 patients with a total of 186 strokes, anticoagulation with oral vitamin K antagonists was compared with placebo (in five trials [1, 3, 7-9]) or control (in one trial [6]) (Table 2). The mean age of participants at study entry was 69 years (approximately 20% of participants were>75 years of age). Twenty-nine percent of participants were women, 45% had hypertension, and 20% had previous stroke or TIA. The target range for the international normalized ratio (INR) varied (Table 2); the mean achieved INR ranged from 2.0 to 2.6 in the five primary prevention trials and was 2.9 in the single secondary prevention trial. Mean duration of follow-up ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 years (overall average, 1.6 years per participant). The rate of stroke among participants who were not assigned to receive anticoagulation averaged 4.6% per year for primary prevention and 12.3% per year for secondary prevention. Four of these six trials were stopped at an interim analysis because of treatment efficacy (1, 3, 6, 8). Table 2. Adjusted-Dose Warfarin Compared with Placebo Meta-analysis showed that therapy with adjusted-dose warfarin reduced the relative risk for stroke by 62% (95% CI, 48% to 72%). This effect was statistically significant in four individual trials (3, 6, 8, 9) (Figure). The pooled result of primary prevention trials (59% reduction) was similar to that from the secondary prevention trial (68% reduction); results from the two double-blind trials (58% reduction) (7, 8) and the four open-label trials (63% reduction) (1, 3, 6, 9) were also similar. Warfarin was associated with similar relative risk reductions in disabling stroke (59%) and nondisabling stroke (61%). The absolute risk reduction for all stroke was 2.7% per year (number needed to treat [NNT] for 1 year to prevent one stroke, 37) for primary prevention and 8.4% per year (NNT, 12) for secondary prevention. Figure. Effects on all stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) of therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation. Top. Middle. Bottom. When only ischemic strokes were considered, treatment with adjusted-dose warfarin was associated with a 65% (CI, 52% to 74%) relative risk reduction. Twice as many intracranial hemorrhages were identified in participants who were assigned to receive warfarin (six compared with three), but the difference was not statistically significant. The rate of intracranial hemorrhage averaged 0.3% per year during anticoagulation and was 0.1% per year with placebo. The rate of major extracranial hemorrhage averaged 0.6% per year in patients who received placebo. The relative risk for major extracranial hemorrhage was 2.4 (CI, 1.2 to 4.6; absolute risk increase, 0.3% per year) for participants who received warfarin (excluding one trial in which almost half of the control group took aspirin [6]). All-cause mortality decreased in participants who received warfarin (relative risk reduction, 26% [CI, 4% to 43%]; P>0.2 for homogeneity; absolute risk reduction, 1.6% per year). Antiplatelet Therapy Compared with Placebo Six trials compared antiplatelet therapy with placebo (1, 3, 9, 13, 14, 16). In these trials, 3337 participants experienced a total of 376 strokes while being randomly assigned to receive antiplatelet therapy or placebo (Table 3). In five trials (1, 3, 9, 14, 16), assignment was double-blind. Approximately 90% of total follow-up exposure during antiplatelet therapy was with aspirin alone. Aspirin dosage ranged from 25 mg twice daily to 1300 mg/d. On the basis of available data from the three largest trials (1, 3, 9), the mean age of participants was 70 years (about 33% of participants were>age 75 years). Thirty-eight percent of participants were women, 46% had hypertension, and 40% had previous stroke or TIA. Mean duration of follow-up in these trials ranged from 1.2 to 4 years (overall average, 1.5 years per participant). The average rate of stroke among participants assigned to placebo was 5.2% per year for primary prevention and 12.9% per year for secondary prevention. Table 3.

        "title": "Validation of Clinical Classification Schemes for Predicting Stroke: Results From the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation",
        "abstract": "Context Patients who have atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased risk of stroke, but their absolute rate of stroke depends on age and comorbid conditions. Objective To assess the predictive value of classification schemes that estimate stroke risk in patients with AF. Design, setting, and patients Two existing classification schemes were combined into a new stroke-risk scheme, the CHADS( 2) index, and all 3 classification schemes were validated. The CHADS( 2) was formed by assigning 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes mellitus and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Data from peer review organizations representing 7 states were used to assemble a National Registry of AF (NRAF) consisting of 1733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had nonrheumatic AF and were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge. Main outcome measure Hospitalization for ischemic stroke, determined by Medicare claims data. Results During 2121 patient-years of follow-up, 94 patients were readmitted to the hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100 patient-years). As indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5, the 2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better than chance: c of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.71) for the scheme developed by the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) and c of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.76) for the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III scheme. However, with a c statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84), the CHADS( 2) index was the most accurate predictor of stroke. The stroke rate per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7) for each 1-point increase in the CHADS( 2) score: 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) for a score of 0; 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95% CI, 3.1-5.1) for 2; 5.9 (95% CI, 4.6-7.3) for 3; 8.5 (95% CI, 6.3-11.1) for 4; 12.5 (95% CI, 8.2-17.5) for 5; and 18.2 (95% CI, 10.5-27.4) for 6. Conclusion The 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke risk index, CHADS( 2), can quantify risk of stroke for patients who have AF and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.",

The CHA2DS2-VASc (cardiac failure or dysfunction, hypertension, age 65-74 [1 point] or \u226575 years [2 points], diabetes mellitus, and stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [2 points]-vascular disease, and sex category [female]) risk score is pragmatic and widely used but has only moderate discrimination.\n\n\nObjective\nTo develop and test a cardiovascular biomarker score for indication of risk in patients with AF.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThe ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial comparing 2 once-daily edoxaban dose regimens with warfarin in 21\u202f105 patients with AF at moderate to high risk of stroke. This prespecified subanalysis was performed in 4880 patients enrolled at randomization in the biomarker substudy. Cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and d-dimer levels were measured at baseline.

        "title": "The Interplay between Fasting Glucose, Echocardiography, and Biomarkers: Pathophysiological Considerations and Prognostic Implications.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTraditional cardiovascular risk stratification tools that employ clinical risk factors are limited by their modest discriminative abilities. As such, robust cardiovascular risk assessment, including our understanding of the complex interplay between risk factors, in the primary preventive setting, remains incomplete. Phenotypical heterogeneity may be even greater among subjects with hyperglycemic conditions, i.e., prediabetes and diabetes, which is worrisome, given the dramatic global rise in mean fasting glucose levels, and the strong association with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The unmet need for refinement or restratification of risk based on these conventional prediction models is only emphasized by our entrance into the era of precision medicine. Potential tools for closing these gaps and increasing our understanding of the pathways from risk factors through subclinical changes to manifest disease include echocardiography and circulating biomarkers.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\n1) To examine whether greater fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were associated with left ventricular mass (LVM), geometric pattern, diastolic function, and concentrations of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-TnT) in apparently healthy, elderly subjects with a preserved LV ejection fraction \u00b1 50%; 2) To examine whether FPG levels modified the prognostic role of abnormal LVM, geometric pattern, diastolic dysfunction, NT-proBNP, and hs-TnT, in predicting cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; 3) To define the incremental prognostic value of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT for predicting incident cardiovascular outcomes, beyond traditional risk factors, glycemic status, and subclinical echocardiographic abnormalities; 4) To explore the associations of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT with key echocardiographic measures of LV structure and function, including the effects of FPG levels.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe thesis was based on a series of cross-sectional and prospective observational studies. The study population was derived from the echocardiography subsample (n=1,792) of the Malm\u00f6 Preventive Project Re-Examination Study (MPP-RES) (2002-2006, n=18,238), a population-based screening program that included inhabitants from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, who belonged to prespecified birth cohorts between 1921-1949. Subjects, who underwent echocardiography, were randomly chosen from the three categories defined by base-line FPG, i.e., normal fasting glucose, impaired fasting glucose, and diabetes, including use of anti-diabetic medication. Blood samples for cardiovascular biomarker assessments were drawn at the time of echocardiography and kept frozen until analysis. Outcome data were obtained through national and local registries. The original echocardiography subsample was stratified into patients and apparently healthy subjects, the latter being the focus of this thesis.\n\n\nRESULTS\n1) Subjects with diabetes had a greater prevalence of concentric LV hypertrophy (LVH), grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction, and higher hs-TnT concentrations. Subjects with impaired fasting glucose had the lowest NT-proBNP concentrations. LVMI was primarily associated with diastolic function in subjects with hyperglycemia; 2) LV diastolic dysfunction was associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular events, but did not provide discriminative im-provement. Concentric LVH and diastolic dysfunction were more strongly associated with adverse prognosis in subjects with hyper-glycemia. High concentrations of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT predicted incident cardiovascular events, with no effect modification by FPG; 3) NT-proBNP, but not hs-TnT, provided discriminative improvement beyond traditional risk factors, FPG, and LVH and/or diastolic dysfunction; 4) NT-proBNP and hs-TnT were associated with several echocardiographic parameters, but effect sizes were generally modest. Associations between biomarkers and echocardiographic measures were affected by hyperglycemia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFPG influenced the interplay between subclinical echocardiographic abnormalities, circulating biomarkers, and cardiovascular outcomes at multiple stages, in this cohort of apparently healthy, elderly subjects. Newly diagnosed diabetes, but not impaired fasting glucose, was associated with adverse subclinical changes. The associations between structural echocardiographic abnormalities and biomarker concentrations were stronger in subjects with hyperglycemia. NT-proBNP, but not echocardiographic measures or hs-TnT, provided discriminative improvement on top of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. FPG further modified the prognosis re-lated to echocardiographic alterations, but not that predicted by biomarkers. Therefore, FPG should be considered when assessing markers of subclinical cardiovascular alterations.",
