        "title": "The use of growth hormone in adults: a changing scene",
        "abstract": "GH secretion persists into adulthood although final height has been reached at the end of puberty. Episodic GH secretion over the 24-hour period continues well into the 6th and 7th decades, suggesting that G H may be ofphysiological importance during ageing. GH plays a role in maintaining body composition, exercise capacity and subjective wellbeing in adults and affects bone, lipid, glucose and thyroid hormone homeostasis as well as renal, cardiac and immune function. The finding of physiological roles for GH during adulthood and the availability of sufficient amounts of recombinant GH have resulted in clinical studies to answer three questions: (1) Do GH-deficient adults benefit from long-term GH supplementation in a dose which mimics normal GH secretion? (2) Is it possible to influence and/or delay normal ageing by the long-term use of GH, and how safe will this be? (3) Is it possible and worth while to try to overcome the catabolic effects of severe illnesses by short-term administration of pharmacological amounts of GH?",

        "title": "Advances in medical therapy for pituitary disease: treating patients with growth hormone excess and deficiency",
        "abstract": "Two recent developments in the medical treatment of patients with pituitary disease are discussed. Conventional treatment for patients with acromegaly has been surgery and/or radiotherapy. Dopamine agonist therapy may be useful. Somatostatin is a naturally occurring neuropeptide that inhibits growth hormone (GH) secretion. The development of long\u2013acting preparations has resulted in a considerable advance in the medical treatment of acromegaly, though some caution remains about the long\u2013term side\u2013effects of such therapy (e.g. cholelithiasis) and its cost/benefit analysis.",
