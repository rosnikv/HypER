        "title": "Recombinant factor VIIa for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a randomized, double-blind trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a severe and frequent complication of cirrhosis. Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been shown to correct the prolonged prothrombin time in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB. This trial aimed to determine efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in cirrhotic patients with variceal and nonvariceal UGIB.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 245 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh < 13; Child-Pugh A = 20%, B = 52%, C = 28%) with UGIB (variceal = 66%, nonvariceal = 29%, bleeding source unknown = 5%) were randomized equally to receive 8 doses of 100 microg/kg rFVIIa or placebo in addition to pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment. The primary end point was a composite including: (1) failure to control UGIB within 24 hours after first dose, or (2) failure to prevent rebleeding between 24 hours and day 5, or (3) death within 5 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics were similar between rFVIIa and placebo groups. rFVIIa showed no advantage over standard treatment in the whole trial population. Exploratory analyses, however, showed that rFVIIa significantly decreased the number of failures on the composite end point (P = 0.03) and the 24-hour bleeding control end point (P = 0.01) in the subgroup of Child-Pugh B and C variceal bleeders. There were no significant differences between rFVIIa and placebo groups in mortality (5- or 42-day) or incidence of adverse events including thromboembolic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough no overall effect of rFVIIa was observed, exploratory analyses in Child-Pugh B and C cirrhotic patients indicated that administration of rFVIIa significantly decreased the proportion of patients who failed to control variceal bleeding. Dosing with rFVIIa appeared safe. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCoagulopathy is a consequence of severe trauma, especially in massively transfused patients (>or=10 units of red blood cells in 24 hours), and is associated with increased mortality. We hypothesized that recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) administered to massive transfusion patients before transfusion of 8 units of blood (early) would reduce transfusion requirements compared with rFVIIa after 8 units (late).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed records for trauma admissions to combat support hospitals in Iraq between January 2004 and October 2005. Patients requiring a massive transfusion and receiving rFVIIa were identified. Groups were divided into those who received rFVIIa early or late.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 5,334 trauma patients (civilian and military), 365 (6.8%) required massive transfusion. Of these, 117 (32%) received rFVIIa. Complete records for blood transfusions were available for 61 patients: 90% had penetrating trauma, 17 received rFVIIa early, and 44 received it late. At admission, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale score, base deficit, hemoglobin, platelets, prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio, and Injury Severity Score were similar in both groups as were administered units of fresh frozen plasma, fresh whole blood, cryoprecipitate (cryo), and crystalloid. The early rFVIIa group required fewer units of blood during the first 24-hour period (mean 20.6 vs. 25.7, p=0.048) and fewer units of stored red blood cells (mean 16.7 vs. 21.7, p=0.049).

The turnaround time for the first shipment was less than 10 minutes, and the time between the first and second shipments was reduced from 42 to 18 minutes, compared with historical controls. The decreased use of blood products represented a savings of $2270 per patient or an annual savings of $200, 000, despite increased costs for recombinant factor VIIa. There was no difference in mortality in either group; it remained around 50%. Thromboembolic complications did not increase, despite a significant increase in the use of recombinant factor VIIa.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe MTP resulted in a reduction in the use of blood components with improved turnaround times and significant savings.

        "abstract": "The management of massively transfused trauma patients has improved with a better understanding of trauma-induced coagulopathy, the limitations of crystalloid infusion, and the implementation of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs), which encompass transfusion management and other patient care needs to mitigate the \u201clethal triad\u201d of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. MTPs are currently changing in the United States and worldwide because of recent data showing that earlier and more aggressive transfusion intervention and resuscitation with blood components that approximate whole blood significantly decrease mortality. In this context, MTPs are a key element of \u201cdamage control resuscitation,\u201d which is defined as the systematic approach to major trauma that addresses the lethal triad mentioned above. MTPs using adequate volumes of plasma, and thus coagulation factors, improve patient outcome. The ideal amounts of plasma, platelet, cryoprecipitate and other coagulation factors given in MTPs in relationship to the red blood cell transfusion volume are not known precisely, but until prospective, randomized, clinical trials are performed and more clinical data are obtained, current data support a target ratio of plasma:red blood cell:platelet transfusions of 1:1:1.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFibrinolysis contributes to coagulopathy after major trauma and surgery. We hypothesized that progressive haemodilution is responsible, at least in part, for increased fibrinolytic tendency of blood clot.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was performed in two parts. First, whole blood (WB) samples collected from six healthy, consented volunteers were diluted in vitro with either saline or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) to 40% and 15% of baseline. We quantified factor levels related to coagulation and fibrinolysis, and measured endogenous thrombin generation in undiluted control plasma samples and in samples diluted with saline or FFP. Additionally, thromboelastometry was used to assess susceptibility to fibrinolysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator in undiluted WB samples and in samples diluted with saline before and after substitution of fibrinogen or FFP. Secondly, as a model of in vivo haemodilution, we evaluated the same parameters before and after operation in nine consented patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe dilution with saline caused dose-dependent decreases in plasma levels of coagulation and antifibrinolytic factors, and in thrombin generation. In FFP-supplemented samples, factor levels and thrombin generation were maintained within normal ranges. Fibrinolytic tendency was significantly higher after haemodilution with saline independent of fibrinogen substitution compared with FFP. Similarly, increased tendency for fibrinolysis was also observed in the in vivo haemodilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that progressive haemodilution decreases endogenous antifibrinolytic proteins including alpha(2)-antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, resulting in increased fibrinolytic tendency. Therefore, early fluid replacement therapy with FFP might be advantageous after massive haemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hyperfibrinolysis (HF) has been reported to occur in a range of 2% to 34% of trauma patients. Using rapid thromboelastography (r-TEG), we hypothesized that HF is (1) rarely present at admission on patients with severe injury and (2) associated with crystalloid hemodilution. To further strengthen this hypothesis, we created an in vitro hemodilution model to improve our mechanistic understanding of the early HF. METHODS The trauma registry was queried for patients who were our highest-level trauma activations and admitted directly from the scene (October 2009\u2013October 2010). HF was defined as more than 7.5% amplitude reduction 30 minutes after maximal amplitude (LY30). Using r-TEG, we then created an in vitro hemodilution model (0.9% NS) with and without tissue injury (addition of tissue factor and tissue plasminogen activator) to identify crystalloid volumes and injury needed to achieve specific LY30 values. RESULTS Admission r-TEG values were captured on 1996 consecutive admissions. Only 41 patients (2%) had HF at admission r-TEG. The groups were similar in demographics. Compared with patients without HF, the HF group had more prehospital crystalloid (1.5 vs. 0.5 L), higher median Injury Severity Score (25 vs. 16), greater admission base deficit (20 vs. 2), and higher mortality (76% vs. 10%); all p < 0.001. Controlling for Injury Severity Score and base deficit on arrival, prehospital fluid was associated with a significant increase in likelihood of HF. In fact, each additional liter of crystalloid was associated with a 15% increased odds of HF. The in vitro model found that hemodilution to 15% of baseline and tissue factor + tissue plasminogen activator was required to achieve an LY30 of 50%. CONCLUSION Although uncommon immediately after injury, HF is associated with prehospital crystalloid administration and shock at admission and is highly lethal. Our in vitro model confirms that tissue injury and significant crystalloid hemodilution result in severe and immediate HF. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic study, level II.",

        "title": "Fibrinolysis greater than 3% is the critical value for initiation of antifibrinolytic therapy",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The acute coagulopathy of trauma is present in up to one third of patients by the time of admission, and the recent CRASH-2 and MATTERs trials have focused worldwide attention on hyperfibrinolysis as a component of acute coagulopathy of trauma. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a powerful tool for analyzing fibrinolyis, but a clinically relevant threshold for defining hyperfibrinolysis has yet to be determined. Recent data suggest that the accepted normal upper bound of 7.5% for 30-minute fibrinolysis (LY30) by TEG is inappropriate in severe trauma, as the risk of death rises at much lower levels of clot lysis. We wished to determine the validity of this hypothesis and establish a threshold value to treat fibrinolysis, based on prediction of massive transfusion requirement and risk of mortality. METHODS Patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, meeting the massive transfusion protocol (MTP) criteria at admission (n = 73), represent the most severely injured trauma population at our center (median Injury Severity Score [ISS], 30; interquartile range, 20\u201338). Citrated kaolin TEG was performed at admission blood samples from this population, stratified by LY30, and evaluated for transfusion requirement and 28-day mortality. The same analysis was conducted on available field blood samples from all non-MTP trauma patients (n = 216) in the same period. These represent the general trauma population. RESULTS Within the MTP-activating population, the cohort of patients with LY30 of 3% or greater was shown to be at much higher risk for requiring a massive transfusion (90.9% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.0008) and dying of hemorrhage (45.5% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.0014) than those with LY30 less than 3%. Similar trends were seen in the general trauma population. CONCLUSION LY30 of 3% or greater defines clinically relevant hyperfibrinolysis and strongly predicts the requirement for massive transfusion and an increased risk of mortality in trauma patients presenting with uncontrolled hemorrhage. This threshold value for LY30 represents a critical indication for the treatment of fibrinolysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic study, level III.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Postinjury hyperfibrinolysis (HF), defined as LY30 of 3% or greater on rapid thrombelastography (rTEG), is associated with high mortality and large use of blood products. We observed that some cases of HF are reversible and are associated with patients who respond to hemostatic resuscitation; however, other cases of severe HF seem to be associated with these patients\u2019 inevitable demise. We therefore sought to define this unsurvivable subtype of HF as a recognizable rTEG tracing pattern. METHODS We queried our trauma registry for patients who either died or spent at least 1 day in the intensive care unit, received at least 1 U of packed red blood cells, and had an admission rTEG. Within this group of 572 patients, we identified 42 pairs of nonsurvivors and survivors who matched on age, sex, injury mechanism, and New Injury Severity Score (NISS). We inspected the rTEG tracings to ascertain if any pattern was found exclusively within the nonsurviving group and applied these findings to the cohort of 572 patients to assess the predictive value for mortality. RESULTS Within the matched group, 17% of the patients developed HF. Within the HF subgroup, a unique rTEG pattern was present in 14 HF patients who died and in none of the survivors. This pattern was a \u201cdiamond-shaped\u201d tracing with a short time to maximum amplitude of 14 minutes or shorter and complete lysis before the LY30 point. When these criteria are applied to the 572 unmatched patients, this pattern had a 100% positive predictive value for mortality. CONCLUSION Patients displaying the \u201cdeath diamond\u201d pattern on their admission rTEG are at higher risk for mortality. Given the volume of blood products and other resources that these patients consume, this thrombelastography pattern may represent an objective criterion to discontinue efforts at hemostatic resuscitation.

Background: Admission fibrinolytic derangement is common in injured children and adults, and is associated with poor outcome. No studies examine fibrinolysis days after injury. Methods: Prospective study of severely injured children at a level 1 pediatric trauma center. Rapid thromboelastography was obtained on admission and daily for up to 7 days. Standard definitions of hyperfibrinolysis (HF; LY30 \u22653), fibrinolysis shutdown (SD; LY30 \u2a7d0.8), and normal (LY30 = 0.9\u20132.9) were applied. Antifibrinolytic use was documented. Outcomes were death, disability, and thromboembolic complications. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher exact tests were performed. Exploratory subgroups included massively transfused and severe TBI patients. Results: In all, 83 patients were analyzed with median (interquartile ranges) age 8 (4\u201312) and Injury Severity Score 22 (13\u201334), 73.5% blunt mechanism, 47% severe TBI, 20.5% massively transfused. Outcomes were 14.5% mortality, 43.7% disability, and 9.8% deep vein thrombosis. Remaining in or trending to SD was associated with death (P = 0.007), disability (P = 0.012), and deep vein thrombosis (P = 0.048). Median LY30 was lower on post-trauma day (PTD)1 to PTD4 in patients with poor compared with good outcome; median LY30 was lower on PTD1 to PTD3 in TBI patients compared with non-TBI patients. HF without associated shutdown was not related to poor outcome, but extreme HF (LY30 >30%, n = 3) was lethal. Also, 50% of massively transfused patients in hemorrhagic shock demonstrated SD physiology on admission. All with HF (fc31.2%) corrected after hemostatic resuscitation without tranexamic acid. Conclusions: Fibrinolysis shutdown is common postinjury and predicts poor outcomes. Severe TBI is associated with sustained shutdown.

Conversely, children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) tend to be hypercoagulable based on rapid thromboelastography (rTEG) parameters. Many clinicians continue to utilize INR as a treatment target. METHODS Prospective observational study of severely injured children age < 18 with rTEG on arrival and daily thereafter for up to 7 days. Standard rTEG definitions of hyperfibrinolysis (LY30 \u2265 3), fibrinolysis shutdown (SD) (LY30 \u2a7d 0.8), and normal (LY30 = 0.9-2.9) were applied. The first 24-hour blood product transfusion volumes were documented. Abbreviated Injury Scale score \u2265 3 defined severe TBI. Sustained SD was defined as two consecutive rTEG with SD and no subsequent normalization. Primary outcomes were death and functional disability, based on functional independence measure score assessed at discharge. RESULTS One hundred one patients were included: median age, 8 years (interquartile range, 4\u201312 years); Injury Severity Score, 25 (16\u201330); 72% blunt mechanism; 47% severe TBI; 16% mortality; 45% discharge disability. Neither total volume nor any single product volume transfused (mL/kg; all p > 0.1) differed between TBI and non-TBI groups. On univariate analysis, transfusion of packed red blood cells (p = 0.016), plasma (p < 0.001), and platelets (p = 0.006) were associated with sustained SD; however, in a regression model that included all products (mL/kg) and controlled for severe TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Scale score \u2265 3), admission INR, polytrauma, and clinical bleeding, only plasma remained an independent predictor of sustained SD (odds ratio, 1.17; p = 0.031). Patients with both severe TBI and plasma transfusion had 100% sustained SD, 75% mortality, and 100% disability in survivors. Admission INR was elevated in TBI patients, but did not correlate with rTEG activated clotting time (p = NS) and was associated with sustained SD (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION Plasma transfusion is independently associated with sustained fibrinolysis SD. Severe TBI is also associated with sustained SD; the combined effect of plasma transfusion and severe TBI is associated with extremely poor prognosis. Plasma transfusion should not be targeted to INR thresholds but rather to rTEG activated clotting time and clinical bleeding. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic and epidemiological study, level III.",

Recent studies conducted in \u201cpseudonormal\u201d adults, however, suggest a normal range below this level where ICP is highly dependent on body posture and decreases to negative values in sitting and standing position. Despite obvious physiological differences between children and adults, no age or body size related reference values exist for normal ICP in children. Recent guidelines for treatment of severe TBI in pediatric patients recommend ICP monitoring to guide treatment of intracranial hypertension. Decision on ICP monitoring modalities are based on local standards, the individual case, and the clinician's choice. The recommended treatment threshold is 20 mmHg for a duration of 5 min. Both prospective and retrospective observational studies applying different thresholds and treatment strategies for intracranial hypertension were included to support this recommendation. While some studies suggest improved outcome related to ICP monitoring (lower rate of mortality and severe disability), most studies identify high ICP as a marker of worse outcome. Only one study applied age-differentiated thresholds, but this study did not evaluate the effect of these different thresholds on outcome. The quality of evidence behind ICP monitoring and treatment thresholds in severe pediatric TBI is low and treatment can potentially be improved by knowledge about normal ICP from observational studies in healthy children and cohorts of pediatric \u201cpseudonormal\u201d patients expected to have normal ICP. Acceptable levels of ICP \u2212 and thus also treatment thresholds\u2014probably vary with age, disease and whether the patient has intact cerebral autoregulation. Future treatment algorithms should reflect these differences and be more personalized and dynamic.",

        "title": "Impact of Intracranial Hypertension on Outcome of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Pediatric Patients: A 15-Year Single Center Experience",
        "abstract": "Background: Intracranial hypertension (IC-HTN) is significantly associated with higher risk for an unfavorable outcome in pediatric trauma. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is widely becoming a standard of neurocritical care for children. Methods: The present study was designed to evaluate influences of IC-HTN on clinical outcomes of pediatric TBI patients. Demographic, injury severity, radiologic characteristics were used as possible predictors of IC-HTN or of functional outcome. Results: A total of 118 pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients with severe TBI (sTBI) were included. Among sTBI cases, patients with GCS < 5 had significantly higher risk for IC-HTN and for mortality. Moreover, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between IC-HTN and severity scoring systems. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis determined a significant difference for good recovery among patients who had no ICP elevations, compared to those who had at least one episode of IC-HTN (log-rank chi-square = 11.16, p = 0.001). A multivariable predictive logistic regression analysis distinguished the ICP-monitored patients at risk for developing IC-HTN. The model finally revealed that higher ISS and Helsinki CT score increased the odds for developing IC-HTN (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The present study highlights the importance of ICP-guided clinical practices, which may lead to increasing percentages of good recovery for children.",

        "title": "Is neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio a prognostic marker for traumatic brain injury in the pediatric population?",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is used for the prognosis of diseases characterized by inflammatory processes. This study aims to discuss the long-term outcomes and NLR in pediatric traumatic brain injury cases.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThis study investigated traumatic brain injury patients younger than 18 years. Patients were grouped into 5 groups according to their Glasgow outcome scores (GOS). Initial admission Glasgow coma scale (GCS) values, neurological examinations, pupil conditions, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) administration, and seizure occurrence were recorded. Neutrophil counts and lymphocyte counts, derived from complete blood count (CBC) values taken during the patient's first 8 hours of admission, were used to calculate the NLR value.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 150 patients, 54 (36%) females and 96 (64%) males, were assessed in the study. The most frequent accident type was falling from a height [84 patients (56%)]. The GCS, CPR, pupillary reflex, anisocoria, surgical procedure, and neutrophil counts were significantly different between the GOS scores. There was no statistically significant difference between the GOS and the NLR (p=0.400). There was a significant difference in NLR value according to CPR, seizures, and brain injury type (p<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNLR values are not correlated with 1-year outcome scores in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients, unlike proven parameters such as initial GCS scores and neurological status.",
