        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe antimetabolite methotrexate has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be effective in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate may also be effective in children with resistant juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but the supporting data are from uncontrolled trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCenters in the United States and the Soviet Union participated in this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of orally administered methotrexate. Patients received one of the following treatments each week for six months: 10 mg of methotrexate per square meter of body-surface area (low dose), 5 mg of methotrexate per square meter (very low dose), or placebo. The use of prednisone (less than or equal to 10 mg per day) and two nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was also allowed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 127 children (mean age, 10.1 years) had a mean duration of disease of 5.1 years; 114 qualified for the analysis of efficacy. According to a composite index of several response variables, 63 percent of the children who received low-dose methotrexate improved, as compared with 32 percent of those in the very-low-dose group and 36 percent of those in the placebo group (P = 0.013). As compared with the placebo group, the low-dose group also had significantly larger mean reductions from base line in the number of joints with pain on motion (-11.0 vs. -7.1), the pain-severity score (-19 vs. -11.5), the number of joints with limited motion (-5.4 vs. -0.7), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (-19.0 vs. -6 mm per hour). In the methotrexate groups only three children had the drug discontinued because of mild-to-moderate side effects; none had severe toxicity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate given weekly in low doses is an effective treatment for children with resistant juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and at least in the short term this regimen is safe.",

        "title": "Effect of methotrexate on the temporomandibular joint and facial morphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients.",
        "abstract": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation in one or more joints; it affects children and adolescents up to 18 years of age. This disease may cause significant skeletal joint destruction, and the temporomandibular joint, like other joints, may become severely affected resulting in aberrant mandibular growth, abnormal dentofacial development, and/or altered orofacial muscle function. Methotrexate is the most common remittive agent used in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis to modify the course of inflammatory destruction of peripheral joints. The purpose of this study was: (1) to evaluate the effect of methotrexate therapy on the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and aberration in craniofacial development in children afflicted with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; (2) to further examine the relationship between the temporomandibular joint/cephalometric findings and rheumatologic data (ie, age at onset, duration of disease); and (3) to evaluate further pauciarticular- and polyarticular-onset disease in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and facial dysmorphology. The following information was obtained from 45 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: (1) routine rheumatologic clinical examination data; (2) anamnestic temporomandibular joint evaluation data; (3) clinical temporomandibular joint examination data; (4) lateral cephalometric measurement data; (5) posteroanterior cephalometric measurement data; and (6) individually corrected axial tomographic data. The results demonstrated the following: (1) radiographic evidence of condylar degeneration was apparent in 63% of all patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pauciarticular patients showing less temporomandibular involvement than polyarticular patients; (2) polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving methotrexate showed less severe temporomandibular joint involvement than the polyarticular patients not receiving methotrexate; (3) the craniofacial structure was affected to a greater extent in the polyarticular form of the disease; (4) the craniomandibular index scores were significantly greater in the polyarticular group; (5) vertical height asymmetry and chin deviation were noted in more than 50% of the patients; and (6) there was a correlation between the severity of condylar lesions and cephalometric findings (ie, mandibular retroposition, posterior rotation, smaller ramus and mandibular dimensions) and the onset and duration of the disease. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, methotrexate therapy was effective in minimizing temporomandibular joint destruction and craniofacial dysmorphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients with the polyarticular form of the disease.",

Jaw pain or dysfunction and maximal incisal opening (MIO) distance were assessed before and after injection. Fourteen patients had followup MRI studies of the TMJ 6-12 months after injection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 13 patients with symptoms of jaw pain prior to corticosteroid treatment, 10 (77%) had complete resolution of pain (P < 0.05). Prior to corticosteroid injection, MIO in all 23 patients was below age-matched normal values. After injection, the MIO was improved by at least 0.5 cm in 10 patients (43%) (P = 0.0017). Patients under 6 years of age at the time of injection showed the best response, with a postinjection MIO similar to that in age-matched controls (P = 0.2267). There was involvement of 23 TMJs in the 14 patients who had followup MRI studies; resolution of effusions was observed in 11 (48%) of the TMJs. Other than short-term facial swelling in 2 patients, there were no side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe majority of children with symptomatic TMJ arthritis improved after intraarticular corticosteroid injection. Approximately half the patients experienced significant improvement in MIO and TMJ effusion. These data suggest that corticosteroid injection may be a useful procedure for the prevention and treatment of morbidities associated with TMJ arthritis in JIA.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThis review explores the prevalence, clinical and radiographic signs, and treatment of temporomandibular joint arthritis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Recent findingsTemporomandibular joint arthritis seems to be a more frequent manifestation in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis than previously believed, in part due to the paucity of clinical symptoms and poor sensitivity of conventional radiographs used for diagnosis. Antinuclear antibody positivity, early onset of disease, and presence of systemic or polyarticular disease are all risk factors for temporomandibular joint arthritis but may underpredict temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging enhanced with gadolinium is currently the gold standard in detection of temporomandibular joint arthritis, and treatment with intra-articular corticosteroids has been shown to be effective and safe, with minimal side effects. SummaryGiven the paucity of clinical symptoms in temporomandibular joint arthritis, detection of temporomandibular joint inflammation using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is essential for instituting appropriate therapy in a timely fashion. The use of intra-articular corticosteroids holds promise for control of temporomandibular joint inflammation and prevention of associated morbidities.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the prevalence of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease in a cohort of children with new-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrasound (US) for the detection of acute and chronic changes of TMJ arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween January 2005 and April 2007, children with newly diagnosed JIA were prospectively evaluated for TMJ arthritis. Prior to imaging, jaw pain and disability were assessed with questionnaires and physical examination. The TMJs of all patients were imaged with MRI and US within 8 weeks of diagnosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 32 patients enrolled, 78% were female, and the median age was 8.6 years (range 1.5-17.2 years). Acute TMJ arthritis was diagnosed in 75% of the children by MRI and in none by US; chronic arthritis was diagnosed in 69% by MRI and in 28% by US. Findings of both acute and chronic TMJ disease were detected by MRI in 53% of the patients. Of those with acute TMJ arthritis, 71% were asymptomatic, and 63% had normal findings on jaw examination. Fifty-six percent of patients with acute disease had an improved maximal incisal opening after corticosteroid injection. Among these responders, 56% had been asymptomatic and had normal jaw examination findings.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTMJ arthritis was present in the majority of patients with new-onset JIA. Findings on MRI along with responses to treatment among asymptomatic patients with normal jaw examination findings suggest that a history review and physical examination are not sufficient to screen for TMJ disease. Our results also suggest that MRI and US findings are not well correlated, and that MRI is preferable for the detection of TMJ disease in new-onset JIA.",

To study the validity of both rheumatological and orthodontic examinations and ultrasound (US) as screening methods for early diagnosis of TMJ arthritis against the gold standard MRI. Methods. Thirty consecutive juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients were included in this pilot study. Rheumatological and orthodontic examinations as well as US were performed within 1 month of the MRI in a blinded fashion. Joint effusion and/or increased contrast enhancement of synovium or bone were considered signs of active arthritis on MRI. Results. A total of 19/30 (63%) patients and 33/60 (55%) joints had signs of TMJ involvement on MRI. This was associated with condylar deformity in 9/19 (47%) patients and 15/33 (45%) joints. Rheumatological, orthodontic and US examinations correctly diagnosed 11 (58%), 9 (47%) and 6 (33%) patients, respectively, with active TMJ arthritis, but misdiagnosed 8 (42%), 10 (53%) and 12 (67%) patients, respectively, as having no signs of inflammation. The best predictor for active arthritis on MRI was a reduced maximum mouth opening. Conclusion. None of the methods tested was able to reliably predict the presence or absence of MRI-proven inflammation in the TMJ in our cohort of JIA patients. US was the least useful of all methods tested to exclude active TMJ arthritis.",

Twenty patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and 10 healthy control subjects underwent measurement of S100A12 serum concentrations by sandwich ELISA. Temporomandibular Joints (TMJs); clinical and post contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations were performed. MRI findings were scored. Results showed that TMJ arthritis was detected in 80% of JIA patients using MRI. Serum S100A12 levels were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. Serum concentrations of S100A12 and total MRI scores were significantly higher in JIA patients with active disease compared to those without activity. Systemic and polyarticular JIA patients showed significant increase in S100A12 levels and total MRI scores compared to those with oligoarticular JIA. The MRI TMJ abnormalities revealed significant association with clinical signs of TMJ inflammation but not with symptoms. A significant correlation was found between serum S100A12 concentrations and MRI score as well as between each of them and different clinical, laboratory disease parameters. Serum S100A12 levels showed significant positive correlation with synovial enhancement score. To conclude TMJ arthritis could be detected in most cases of JIA patients using contrast enhanced MRI. Increased S100A12 levels may point to synovial inflammation. Clinical signs of TMJ arthritis may be used as filter for MRI examination. Further studies on larger scale of JIA patients are needed for monitoring TMJ inflammation and S100A12 may be a potential target of future anti-inflammatory therapy.",

This study aims to investigate whether serum S100A12 concentrations are associated with angiographic coronary lesion complexity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We enrolled 240 CAD and 68 healthy controls. Coronary lesion complexity was assessed by coronary angiography (CAG).

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Plaque formation starts with the inflammation in fatty streaks and progresses through atheroma, atheromatous plaque, and fibroatheroma leading to development of stable plaque. Hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia are the risk factors for atherosclerosis. Inflammation, infection with viruses and bacteria, and dysregulation in the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells leads to advanced plaque formation. Death of the cells in the intima due to inflammation results in secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), alarmins (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and oxidized low-density lipoproteins), and infection with pathogens leads to secretion of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acids, and peptidoglycans. DAMPs and PAMPs further activate the inflammatory surface receptors such as TREM-1 and toll-like receptors and downstream signaling kinases and transcription factors leading to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and interferon-\u03b3 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These mediators and cytokines along with MMPs render the plaque vulnerable for rupture leading to ischemic events.

        "abstract": "Rationale: The pathophysiologic mechanisms of air pollution\u2013associated exacerbation of cardiovascular events remain incompletely understood. Objective: To assess whether ambient air pollution can be a trigger of the vulnerable plaque and heightened thrombogenicity through systemic inflammatory pathways. Methods and Results: In Beijing AIRCHD study (Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Dysfunctions in Healthy Adults Living in Beijing), 73 healthy adults (mean\u00b1SD, 23.3\u00b15.4 years) were followed up in 2014 to 2016. We estimated associations between air pollutants and biomarkers relevant to atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, thrombogenicity, and inflammation using linear mixed-effects models and elucidated the biological pathways involved using mediation analyses. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to assess the ability of each biomarker to predict ambient air pollution exposures. High average concentrations of particulate matter in diameter <2.5 &mgr;m (91.8\u00b163.8 \u00b5g/m3) were observed during the study period. Significant increases in circulating biomarkers of plaque vulnerability, namely MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases; MMP-1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9), of 8.6% (95% CI, 0.1\u201317.8) to 141.4% (95% CI, 111.8\u2013171.0) were associated with interquartile range increases in moving averages of particulate matter in diameter <2.5 &mgr;m, number concentrations of particles in sizes of 5 to 560 nm and black carbon, during the last 1 to 7 days before each participant\u2019s clinic visit. Higher air pollutant levels were also significantly associated with decreases in TIMP (tissue inhibitors of MMPs; TIMP-1 and 2), heightened thrombogenicity (shortened prothrombin time and increases in sCD40L [soluble CD40 ligand], sCD62P [soluble P-selectin], and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products), and elevations in systemic inflammation (IL-1&bgr; [interleukin-1&bgr;], CRP [C-reactive protein], MIP-1&agr;/&bgr; [macrophage inflammatory protein-1&agr;/&bgr;], sRAGE [soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products], and IGFBP [insulin-like growth factor\u2013binding protein]-1 and 3). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that several biomarkers can serve as robust pollutant-specific predictors with high versus low black carbon exposure (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.974 [95% CI, 0.955\u20130.992] for MMP-8 and 0.962 [95% CI, 0.935\u20130.988] for sRAGE). Mediation analysis further showed that systemic inflammation can mediate \u2a7d46% of the changes in MMPs and thrombogenicity associated with interquartile range increases in air pollutants. Conclusions: Our results suggest that air pollution may prompt cardiovascular events by triggering vulnerable plaque along with heightened thrombogenicity possibly through systemic inflammatory pathways.",

        "title": "Cumulative Lifetime Burden of Cardiovascular Disease From Early Exposure to Air Pollution",
        "abstract": "Abstract The disease burden associated with air pollution continues to grow. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates \u22487 million people worldwide die yearly from exposure to polluted air, half of which\u20143.3 million\u2014are attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD), greater than from major modifiable CVD risks including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. This serious and growing health threat is attributed to increasing urbanization of the world's populations with consequent exposure to polluted air. Especially vulnerable are the elderly, patients with pre\u2010existing CVD, and children. The cumulative lifetime burden in children is particularly of concern because their rapidly developing cardiopulmonary systems are more susceptible to damage and they spend more time outdoors and therefore inhale more pollutants. World Health Organization estimates that 93% of the world's children aged <15 years\u20141.8 billion children\u2014breathe air that puts their health and development at risk. Here, we present growing scientific evidence, including from our own group, that chronic exposure to air pollution early in life is directly linked to development of major CVD risks, including obesity, hypertension, and metabolic disorders. In this review, we surveyed the literature for current knowledge of how pollution exposure early in life adversely impacts cardiovascular phenotypes, and lay the foundation for early intervention and other strategies that can help prevent this damage. We also discuss the need for better guidelines and additional research to validate exposure metrics and interventions that will ultimately help healthcare providers reduce the growing burden of CVD from pollution.",

        "title": "Health Outcomes in Children Associated with Prenatal and Early-Life Exposures to Air Pollution: A Narrative Review",
        "abstract": "(1) Background: The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis links adverse fetal exposures with developmental mal-adaptations and morbidity later in life. Short- and long-term exposures to air pollutants are known contributors to health outcomes; however, the potential for developmental health effects of air pollution exposures during gestation or early-childhood have yet to be reviewed and synthesized from a DOHaD lens. The objective of this study is to summarize the literature on cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory, allergic, and neuropsychological health outcomes, from prenatal development through early childhood, associated with early-life exposures to outdoor air pollutants, including traffic-related and wildfire-generated air pollutants. (2) Methods: We conducted a search using PubMed and the references of articles previously known to the authors. We selected papers that investigated health outcomes during fetal or childhood development in association with early-life ambient or source-specific air pollution exposure. (3) Results: The current literature reports that prenatal and early-childhood exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in early life, including cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory and allergic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very few studies have investigated associations between wildfire-related air pollution exposure and health outcomes during prenatal, postnatal, or childhood development. (4) Conclusion: Evidence from January 2000 to January 2022 supports a role for prenatal and early-childhood air pollution exposures adversely affecting health outcomes during development. Future studies are needed to identify both detrimental air pollutants from the exposure mixture and critical exposure time periods, investigate emerging exposure sources such as wildfire, and develop feasible interventional tools.",

        "title": "Contrasting Health Outcomes following a Severe Smoke Episode and Ambient Air Pollution in Early Life: Findings from an Australian Data Linkage Cohort Study of Hospital Utilization",
        "abstract": "Background: Episodic spikes in air pollution due to landscape fires are increasing, and their potential for longer term health impacts is uncertain. Objective: Our objective is to evaluate associations between exposure in utero and in infancy to severe pollution from a mine fire, background ambient air pollution, and subsequent hospital care. Methods: We linked health records of births, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations of children born in the Latrobe Valley, Australia, 2012\u20132015, which included a severe pollution episode from a mine fire (9 February 2014 to 25 March 2014). We assigned modeled exposure estimates for fire-related and ambient particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5\u03bcm (PM2.5) to residential address. We used logistic regression to estimate associations with hospital visits for any cause and groupings of infectious, allergic, and respiratory conditions. Outcomes were assessed for the first year of life in the in utero cohort and the year following the fire in the infant cohort. We estimated exposure-response for both fire-related and ambient PM2.5 and also employed inverse probability weighting using the propensity score to compare exposed and not/minimally exposed children. Results: Prenatal exposure to fire-related PM2.5 was associated with ED presentations for allergies/skin rash [odds ratio (OR)=1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.76 per 240\u2009\u03bcg/m3 increase]. Exposure in utero to ambient PM2.5 was associated with overall presentations (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.33 per 1.4\u2009\u03bcg/m3) and visits for infections (ED: OR=1.13, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.29; hospitalizations: OR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.52). Exposure in infancy to fire-related PM2.5 compared to no/minimal exposure, was associated with ED presentations for respiratory (OR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.80) and infectious conditions (any: OR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.49; respiratory-related: OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.83). Early life exposure to ambient PM2.5 was associated with overall ED visits (OR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.30 per 1.4\u2009\u03bcg/m3 increase). Discussion: Higher episodic and lower ambient concentrations of PM2.5 in early life were associated with visits for allergic, respiratory, and infectious conditions. Our findings also indicated differences in associations at the two developmental stages. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12238",
