        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe mechanism by which enhanced external counterpulsation therapy exerts its beneficial effects on chronic and symptomatic stable angina is largely unknown. To clarify the mechanism of action of enhanced external counterpulsation, we used(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography to evaluate myocardial perfusion.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThis was not a randomized controlled study. Eleven patients (eight male, age: 61.6+/-9.7) with angina pectoris underwent enhanced external counterpulsation therapy for 35 1 h sessions. They underwent a treadmill exercise test and(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography, both at rest and with dipyridamole, before and after enhanced external counterpulsation therapy. Neurohumoral factors and nitric oxide were also evaluated. Myocardial perfusion increased at rest after therapy (0.69+/-0.27 to 0.85+/-0.47 ml x min(-1) x g(-1), P<0.05). In ischaemic regions, particularly the anterior region, myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and coronary flow reserve improved significantly after therapy (at rest: 0.71+/-0.26 to 0.86+/-0.31;P<0.05, with dipyridamole: 1.26+/-0.65 to 1.84+/-0.94;P<0.02, coronary flow reserve: 1.75+/-0.24 to 2.08+/-0.28;P<0.04). Exercise time was prolonged and the time to 1-mm ST depression improved markedly (P<0.01). After therapy, nitric oxide levels increased (P<0.02) and neurohumoral factors decreased.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnhanced external counterpulsation therapy improved myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and was associated with an increased exercise tolerance with(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography and increased nitric oxide levels. These results suggest that one of the enhanced external counterpulsation mechanisms is development and recruitment of collateral vessels.",

        "title": "Left Ventricular Systolic Unloading and Augmentation of Intracoronary Pressure and Doppler Flow During Enhanced External Counterpulsation",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a noninvasive, pneumatic technique that provides beneficial effects for patients with chronic, symptomatic angina pectoris. However, the physiological effects of EECP have not been studied directly. We examined intracoronary and left ventricular hemodynamics in the cardiac catheterization laboratory during EECP. Methods and Results\u2014Ten patients referred for diagnostic evaluation underwent left heart catheterization and coronary angiography from the radial artery. At baseline and then during EECP, central aortic pressure, intracoronary pressure, and intracoronary Doppler flow velocity were measured using a coronary catheter, a sensor-tipped high-fidelity pressure guidewire, and a Doppler flow guidewire, respectively. Similar to changes in aortic pressure, EECP resulted in a dramatic increase in diastolic (71\u00b110 mm Hg at baseline to 137\u00b121 mm Hg during EECP; +93%;P <0.0001) and mean intracoronary pressures (88\u00b19 to 102\u00b116 mm Hg; +16%;P =0.006) with a decrease in systolic pressure (116\u00b120 to 99\u00b126 mm Hg; \u221215%;P =0.002). The intracoronary Doppler measure of average peak velocity increased from 11\u00b15 cm/s at baseline to 23\u00b15 cm/s during EECP (+109%;P =0.001). The TIMI frame count, a quantitative angiographic measure of coronary flow, showed a 28% increase in coronary flow during EECP compared with baseline (P =0.001). Conclusions\u2014EECP unequivocally and significantly increases diastolic and mean pressures and reduces systolic pressure in the central aorta and the coronary artery. Coronary artery flow, determined by both Doppler and angiographic techniques, is increased during EECP. The combined effects of systolic unloading and increased coronary perfusion pressure provide evidence that EECP may serve as a potential mechanical assist device.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe hemodynamic effects of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) and its mechanism(s) were investigated in relation to neurohumoral factors in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTwenty-four patients with AMI were studied before, during and after EECP treatment for 60 min. Heart rate (HR), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) were determined. In addition, circulating concentrations of neurohumoral factors were determined at each time point. HR did not change following EECP treatment. However, RAP and PCWP increased significantly and CI was significantly elevated during EECP and thereafter. Blood atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration was significantly increased 15 and 60 min after the start of EECP treatment, but brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) did not change. Renin, aldosterone and catecholamine concentrations also did not change.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with EECP resulted in an increased preload because of increased venous return, and CI was increased thereafter. In patients with AMI, EECP increased blood ANP concentration, but not BNP, which suggests that an increase in ANP without an increase in BNP is an important mechanism for the effects of EECP treatment.",

        "title": "Management options for angina refractory to maximal medical and surgical interventions.",
        "abstract": "Despite the seemingly daily advances in the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for coronary artery disease, many patients will ultimately experience progression of their disease and experience angina refractory to further active treatment. In these patients, disabling angina occurs at rest or during simple activities of daily living. When this occurs, symptom management, a predominant focus of nursing, becomes the goal of care. Several medical and surgical alternatives are available to patients with refractory angina. Enhanced external counterpulsation and transmyocardial laser revascularization are Food and Drug Administration approved therapies that can be used to attempt to restore the balance of supply and demand. Modulation of sympathetic tone via procedures such as stellate ganglion blocks has also been employed. Other methods to control the pain are techniques that alter pain perception such as spinal opioids, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation. Too few patients with refractory angina are referred for any of these palliative therapies. Armed with knowledge regarding these therapies, nurses will be better prepared to provide anticipatory guidance to patients and their families and to support the patient's hope for relief as they cope with this devastating condition.",

        "abstract": "national level. Private medical institutions are flourishing in Pakistan, especially in Sind and Punjab and many postgraduate training institutions have been upgraded to university status and are getting more autonomy. The availability of up-to-date medical facilities and well remunerated highly qualified faculty helps in providing a better quality post graduate training in some of these institutions. However, training of doctors in some of the public funded postgraduate medical institutes without any remuneration and exploitation of postgraduate doctors is a well known fact. Funding for training is a major issue in Pakistani health system. There have been major changes in the health service in Pakistan over the last few years. The emphasis has shifted from tertiary care to primary and secondary care. However, due to lack of careful planning and financial restraints, funding for the teaching hospitals has reduced. The teaching hospitals are less willing to pay the salaries of the trainees. This is particularly true for new trainees who do not have longstanding posts as medical officers. Most of the trainees therefore fund themselves. Recently the College of Physicians and Surgeons have put a ban on having unpaid trainees in the training centers. This may result in future reduction of training posts.4 Majority of Pakistani doctors wish to go abroad to obtain training. Many want to continue working there due to better financial rewards and many do not want to come back to Pakistan due to inadequate facilities and poor working conditions. A significant proportion of these doctors prefer to go to UK and USA. Overseas doctors make up about one third of the junior doctors work force in United Kingdom.5 Over the past few years significant changes in the immigration and training system in UK has seriously caused concern to non-EEA International Medical Graduates (IMG) to seek training post in UK. The recent changes in the immigration rules in United Kingdom came into effect in April 2006. Accordingly all postgraduate medical and dental training positions are now defined by the Home Office as employment posts and would require work permit. To obtain a work permit, employers have to",

        "abstract": "Medical education, associated with lengthy, exhaustive pathways requisite of time, energy and efforts, restrain an individual from pursuing a career in medicine. Most students enrol in medical colleges under the influence of their family members, and only some strive to seek medicine as their own ambition. Medical students confront a number of problems in memorising huge amount of data and the various strategies are integrated in MBBS curriculum from time to time. After MBBS programme, most graduates tend to abandon studies, some migrate abroad, a few continue as general physicians and even fewer strive to get registered for postgraduate specialisation. This results in suboptimal supply of medical workforce. Inconsideration of the current ophthalmologist work ratio and growing demand for eye care services, an initiative is put forward to introduce Bachelors of Ophthalmic Surgery programme similar to Bachelor of Dental Surgery. Such initiative may facilitate effective learning, enable command in a particular area and encourage more individuals to pursue a career in ophthalmology. Using a questionnaire to undergraduate medical students, medical professors and ophthalmologists were surveyed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed initiative. The results threw a mixed response.",
