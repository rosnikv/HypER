        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor peptide derived from the endothelium. We evaluated the contribution of endothelin to blood-pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension by studying the effect of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 293 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute reduction of 5.7 mm Hg at each dose), which was similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to elevated blood pressure in such patients. The favorable effect of treatment with bosentan on blood pressure occurred without reflexive neurohormonal activation.",

        "title": "Absorption, excretion, and metabolism of the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in healthy male subjects.",
        "abstract": "The absorption, excretion, and metabolism of the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was investigated in healthy male subjects by administration of 14C-labeled compound. Four subjects received a single oral dose of 500 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq), and four other subjects received a single i.v. dose of 250 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq). Radioactivity and concentrations of bosentan and its metabolites were measured in plasma, urine, and feces samples. More than 97% of drug-related material was recovered on average within 3.5 days after oral dosing and within 5 days after i.v. dosing. More than 90% of radioactivity was found in feces after both oral and i.v. dosing. Most of the radioactivity in urine and feces represented bosentan and three metabolites. Ro 48-5033, the major metabolite in plasma, urine, and feces, is the result of hydroxylation at the t-butyl group of bosentan. The two other metabolites Ro 47-8634 and Ro 64-1056 represent minor metabolite species. Ro 47-8634 is the product of O-demethylation of the phenolic methyl ester, and Ro 64-1056 is generated by both demethylation and hydroxylation. The radioactivity in plasma could almost entirely be attributed to bosentan and the two metabolites Ro 48-5033 and Ro 47-8634, whereby both metabolites exhibited much lower plasma levels than bosentan. Hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion of the metabolites apparently represents the major pathway of elimination for bosentan in humans.",

        "title": "Bile salt transporters: molecular characterization, function, and regulation.",
        "abstract": "Molecular medicine has led to rapid advances in the characterization of hepatobiliary transport systems that determine the uptake and excretion of bile salts and other biliary constituents in the liver and extrahepatic tissues. The bile salt pool undergoes an enterohepatic circulation that is regulated by distinct bile salt transport proteins, including the canalicular bile salt export pump BSEP (ABCB11), the ileal Na(+)-dependent bile salt transporter ISBT (SLC10A2), and the hepatic sinusoidal Na(+)- taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide NTCP (SLC10A1). Other bile salt transporters include the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATPs (SLC21A) and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2 and 3 MRP2,3 (ABCC2,3). Bile salt transporters are also present in cholangiocytes, the renal proximal tubule, and the placenta. Expression of these transport proteins is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, with the former involving nuclear hormone receptors where bile salts function as specific ligands. During bile secretory failure (cholestasis), bile salt transport proteins undergo adaptive responses that serve to protect the liver from bile salt retention and which facilitate extrahepatic routes of bile salt excretion. This review is a comprehensive summary of current knowledge of the molecular characterization, function, and regulation of bile salt transporters in normal physiology and in cholestatic liver disease and liver regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Induction of hepatic phase I/II detoxification enzymes and alternative excretory pumps may limit hepatocellular accumulation of toxic biliary compounds in cholestasis. Because the nuclear xenobiotic receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulate involved enzymes and transporters, we aimed to induce adaptive alternative pathways with different CAR and PXR agonists in vivo. Mice were treated with the CAR agonists phenobarbital and 1,4\u2010bis\u2010[2\u2010(3,5\u2010dichlorpyridyloxy)]benzene, as well as the PXR agonists atorvastatin and pregnenolone\u201016\u03b1\u2010carbonitrile. Hepatic bile acid and bilirubin\u2010metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, Ugt1a1, Sult2a1), their regulatory nuclear receptors (CAR, PXR, farnesoid X receptor), and bile acid/organic anion and lipid transporters (Ntcp, Oatp1,2,4, Bsep, Mrp2\u20104, Mdr2, Abcg5/8, Asbt) in the liver and kidney were analyzed via reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Potential functional relevance was tested in common bile duct ligation (CBDL). CAR agonists induced Mrp2\u20104 and Oatp2; PXR agonists induced only Mrp3 and Oatp2. Both PXR and CAR agonists profoundly stimulated bile acid\u2013hydroxylating/detoxifying enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10. In addition, CAR agonists upregulated bile acid\u2013sulfating Sult2a1 and bilirubin\u2010glucuronidating Ugt1a1. These changes were accompanied by reduced serum levels of bilirubin and bile acids in healthy and CBDL mice and by increased levels of polyhydroxylated bile acids in serum and urine of cholestatic mice. Atorvastatin significantly increased Oatp2, Mdr2, and Asbt, while other transporters and enzymes were moderately affected. In conclusion, administration of specific CAR or PXR ligands results in coordinated stimulation of major hepatic bile acid/bilirubin metabolizing and detoxifying enzymes and hepatic key alternative efflux systems, effects that are predicted to counteract cholestasis.

        "abstract": "The discovery that various drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) stimulate their own metabolism through a mechanism coined as enzymatic induction opened up a fascinating road that eventually led to the accurate biochemical characterization of the pregnane X receptor. After numerous studies, researchers have concluded that this receptor is activated by different endogenous steroids and a number of foreign lipophile ligands. Once activated, it induces the synthesis of oxygenases and conjugating enzymes. The activating ligands identified to date include many synthetic drugs, along with a number of natural products. The present review summarizes the data relating to the origin, chemistry, and pharmacological activity of the newest natural products that have been found to interact with the pregnane X receptor.",

        "abstract": "The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to various ligands, particularly xenobiotics. In this context, the aim of this study was to shed light on the ligand affinity and functions of four NR1J1 paralogs identified in the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, employing a dual-luciferase reporter assay. To achieve this, the activation patterns of these paralogs in response to various toxins, including freshwater cyanotoxins (Anatoxin-a, Cylindrospermopsin, and Microcystin-LR, -RR, and -YR) and marine algal toxins (Nodularin, Saxitoxin, and Tetrodotoxin), alongside natural compounds (Saint John\u2019s Wort, Ursolic Acid, and 8-Methoxypsoralene) and microalgal extracts (Tetraselmis, Isochrysis, LEGE 95046, and LEGE 91351 extracts), were studied. The investigation revealed nuanced differences in paralog response patterns, highlighting the remarkable sensitivity of MgaNR1J1\u03b3 and MgaNR1J1\u03b4 paralogs to several toxins. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the intricate mechanisms of xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification, particularly focusing on the role of marine mussel NR1J1 in responding to a diverse array of compounds. Furthermore, comparative analysis with human PXR revealed potential species-specific adaptations in detoxification mechanisms, suggesting evolutionary implications. These findings deepen our understanding of PXR-mediated metabolism mechanisms, offering insights into environmental monitoring and evolutionary biology research.",
