Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P <0.0001). Mean prandial glucose and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P <0.0001) and 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P=0.0001), 40 +/- 16 pmol/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (P=0.0312), respectively. HbA1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in LAF237-treated patients (n=42) but increased in participants given placebo (n=29). The between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c after 1 year was -1.1 +/- 0.2% (P <0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nData from this study demonstrate that LAF237 effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to metformin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes.",

        "title": "Lower Baseline Glycemia Reduces Apparent Oral Agent Glucose-Lowering Efficacy",
        "abstract": "Perusal of advertisements for oral hypoglycemic agents in this and many other medical journals shows an emphasis on the absolute reduction in HbA1c (A1C). Evidence linking reduction in A1C in diabetic patients to prevention of macrovascular events is weak. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that the risk for cardiovascular disease in this group may actually begin at A1C concentrations well within the normal range (1). This association has led a number of professional organizations to recommend that A1C levels be brought to levels <6.5% (2). An important question to be asked is whether the reduction in A1C differs at lower versus higher baseline levels of A1C. Expectations for the degree of reduction to be attained with a given agent may be excessively optimistic when a person\u2019s initial A1C is already <7.5\u20138.0%.\n\nSome of the deliberations of policy advisory groups are available. The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products has published guidelines for diabetes product evaluation suggesting that the change in A1C be utilized as \u201cprimary analysis\u201d of drug efficacy, although allowing the baseline A1C to be included as a covariate (3). A meeting of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that A1C should be the primary outcome variable for diabetes drugs and suggested an absolute decrease of 0.7% as the minimal acceptable level for approval (4). This may prevent acceptance of agents that are as effective as existing treatments at A1C levels \u2026",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe aim of this investigation was to assess clinical predictors of the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) response after the addition of a thiazolidinedione (TZD) to a biguanide, a sulfonylurea, or both in subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nChart review (n = 68 physicians) was used to identify consecutive subjects started on a TZD. Qualifying subjects had been treated with pioglitazone (> or = 4 mg/day) or rosiglitazone (> or = 30 mg/day) for > or = 12 weeks. Clinical characteristics and HbA1C responses were assessed for the purpose of creating an initial predictive response model (Study 1). A separate sample from a managed care database was used to independently validate the model (Study 2).\n\n\nRESULTS\nData were collected from 4085 subjects (1365 in Study 1; 2720 in Study 2). In Study 1, baseline HbA1C was 8.2 +/- 0.1%. Forty-five percent (611 of 1365) and 55% (754 of 1365) were prescribed pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, respectively. In multivariate regression, baseline HbA1C (beta = -0.693%), age (beta = -0.006%), and use of multiple agents at baseline (referent = single agent, beta = 0.189%) were significant (P < 0.05) predictors, explaining 49% of the variance in HbA1C response in Study 1 and 44% of the variance in HbA1C response in the Study 2 sample. The model showed no material evidence of bias across the range of baseline HbA1C values.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that readily available clinical information, particularly baseline HbA1C, explains a substantial proportion of the variance in the response to TZD therapy.",

Nine patients with GG genotype and 27 with GA+AA genotype of UCP2 -866 G/A, 11 with Trp64Trp genotype and 25 with Trp64Arg genotype of ADRB3 received oral rosiglitazone as a single-agent therapy (4 mg day(-1)) for 12 weeks.

        "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate variants in UCP2 genes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Chinese population. Materials and Methods We conducted a single nucleotide polymorphism-based and haplotype-based case-control study between the variants of UCP2 and DM and between the variants of UCP2 and DR in 479 Chinese patients with type 2 DM and 479 control subjects without DM. Two SNPs (rs660339 and rs659366) were selected as genetic markers. Results The risk allele C at UCP2 rs660339 was closely associated with DM in Chinese population. There was significant difference in rs660339 between DM and controls (P\u200a=\u200a0.0016; OR [95%CI] \u200a=\u200a1.37 (1.14\u20131.65)). Subjects who were homozygous of the C allele were more likely to develop DM. The frequency of C allele was higher in DM (58%) than in control (51%). But this locus didn't have a definite effect on the onset of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (P\u200a=\u200a0.44; OR [95%CI] \u200a=\u200a0.80 (0.56\u20131.14)) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (P\u200a=\u200a1.00; OR [95%CI] \u200a=\u200a0.99 (0.74\u20131.34)) comparing to subjects with DM without retinopathy (DWR), respectively. Moreover, the UCP2 rs659366 polymorphism showed no significant difference between DM and control (P\u200a=\u200a0.66; OR [95%CI] \u200a=\u200a1.10 (0.91\u20131.32)). However, there was a significant difference between PDR and DWR (P\u200a=\u200a0.016; OR [95%CI] \u200a=\u200a0.66 (0.49\u20130.90)), but there was no difference between NPDR and DWR (P\u200a=\u200a1.00; OR [95%CI] \u200a=\u200a0.96 (0.67\u20131.37)). Participants who carried the G allele at rs659366 were more likely to develop PDR. For the haplotype, C-A was present more frequently in DM than in control (16% vs 7%), indicating that it was risky, and T-A was present less in DM than in control (29% vs 35%). Haplotype frequencies in DR and DWR showed no significant difference (P\u200a=\u200a0.068). Conclusion It was indicated that UCP2 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM and DR in Chinese population.",

The current systematic review is focused on mtDNA modification, including polymorphism and mutation/deletion, with a direct effect on DR.This systematic search was initially done through PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science without a restriction on the years of publication.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important complications of diabetes (DM) and the leading cause of blindness in adults. Bradykinin (BK) is involved in several pathophysiological processes, such as inflammation, pain, cell proliferation, and tumors. It plays a crucial role in corneal epithelial cells, corneal stromal cells, and fibroblasts. However, the role of BK in DR retinal endothelial injury remains unclear.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nHuman retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRECs) were cultured in vitro and randomly divided into 3 groups, control group in which hRECs were cultured in normal glucose concentration, high glucose group in which hRECs were cultured in the presence of high glucose, and BK group in which hRECs were cultured in the presence of high glucose with 1 \u03bcM BK. The MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was used to detect cell proliferation. Caspase-3 activity was adopted to detect Caspase-3 activity in hRECs. The colorimetric method was selected to determine lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and ROS content. Western blot was used to test HMGB-1/NF-\u03baB and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression changes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to detect the secretion of inflammatory factor tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the presence of high glucose, hRECs cells proliferation was significantly reduced, Caspase-3 activity was enhanced, LDH and ROS levels were increased, SOD activity was declined with increased expression of HMGB-1, NF-\u03baB, VEGF, as well as secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 compared with control group (p < 0.05). BK significantly inhibited the proliferation of hRECs cells, enhanced Caspase-3 activity, decreased the content of LDH and ROS, increased SOD activity, reduced the expressions of HMGB-1 and NF-\u03baB protein, attenuated the expression of VEGF, and restrained the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 compared with high glucose group (p < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBK can inhibit the growth and proliferation of retinal endothelial cells by regulating HMGB-1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby delaying DR development and progress.",
