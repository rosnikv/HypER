        "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for recurrent hepatitis C after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We therefore performed two randomized, controlled trials\u2014a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial\u2014to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a in patients who had undergone OLT. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 54 patients within 3 weeks after OLT, and the treatment trial enrolled 67 patients 6 to 60 months after OLT. In each trial, patients were randomized to treatment with once weekly injections of 180 \u03bcg peginterferon alfa\u20102a or no antiviral treatment for 48 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks thereafter. Peginterferon alfa\u20102a treated patients had significantly lower hepatitis C virus RNA levels and more favorable changes in hepatic histological features compared with untreated controls. However, only 2 treated patients in the prophylaxis trial (8%) and 3 in the treatment trial (12%) achieved a sustained virological response. In the prophylaxis trial, 8 patients (31%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 9 (32%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely; whereas in the treatment trial, 10 patients (30%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 6 (19%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely. The incidence of acute rejection was similar in the treated and untreated groups in both the prophylaxis (12% vs. 21%; P = .5) and treatment (12% vs. 0%; P = .1) trials. In conclusion, peginterferon alfa\u20102a treatment for 48 weeks is safe and tolerable and offers some efficacy in the post\u2010OLT setting. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients who have undergone OLT. (HEPATOLOGY 2005;41:289\u2013298.)",

        "title": "Steatosis and fibrosis progression in patients with recurrent hepatitis C infection: Complex interactions providing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges",
        "abstract": "The relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and hepatic steatosis is complex and involves a number of interrelated mechanisms that regulate viral replication, insulin resistance (IR), and lipid metabolism in the liver. The situation becomes even more complex in HCV-positive patients undergoing liver transplantation, largely because of the effects of immunosuppression. In this issue of Liver Transplantation, Brandman et al. from the University of California San Francisco report an investigation of a number of the components of this complex and multifactorial relationship. In the nontransplant setting, HCV infection is recognized as an important risk factor for IR and hepatic steatosis. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, an important result of severe IR, is significantly greater in patients with chronic HCV infection (20%50%) than in those with other chronic liver diseases (approximately 10%). Likewise, steatosis is seen in 40% to 86% of liver biopsy samples from patients with chronic HCV infection, and this rate is considerably higher than the frequency observed in patients with other chronic liver diseases or in the general population. The development of hepatic steatosis can be viewed as a mechanism that promotes viral replication: the HCV core protein is targeted to lipid droplets, which act as intracellular storage organelles and are also required for virus assembly. Two main pathways for HCV-induced hepatic steatosis have been proposed: metabolic and viral. The first involves a number of HCV-mediated mechanisms that result in IR and is seen in individuals infected with a non-3 genotype (particularly genotype 1). The factors involved in the pathogenesis of HCVinduced IR are complex and include (1) direct effects on insulin signaling pathways, (2) altered glucose uptake by hepatocytes, and (3) the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor a and reactive oxygen species (both appear to promote IR through mechanisms that are incompletely understood). HCV infections also appear to promote truncal obesity, which is an important mechanism in the development of hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In this setting, the severity of steatosis correlates with risk factors for metabolic syndrome rather than viral RNA levels. In contrast, in genotype 3\u2013infected individuals, there is a direct correlation between the HCV RNA levels and the severity of steatosis, which diminishes in patients who achieve a sustained virological response to antiviral therapy; this suggests a direct effect of the virus on lipid metabolism. The pathogenesis of viral-induced steatosis likely involves a number of effects of HCV on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes; these include increased lipid production by the up-regulation of",

        "abstract": "Early allograft dysfunction (EAD) after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with inferior graft survival. EAD is more prevalent in grafts from donation after circulatory death (DCD). However, accurate prediction of liver function remains difficult because of the lack of specific biomarkers. Recent experimental and clinical studies highlight the potential of hepatocyte\u2010derived microRNAs (miRNAs) as sensitive, stable, and specific biomarkers of liver injury. The aim of this study was to determine whether miRNAs in graft preservation fluid are predictive for EAD after clinical LT and in an experimental DCD model. Graft preservation solutions of 83 liver grafts at the end of cold ischemia were analyzed for miRNAs by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Of these grafts, 42% developed EAD after transplantation. Results were verified in pig livers (n = 36) exposed to different lengths of warm ischemia time (WIT). The absolute miR\u2010122 levels and miR\u2010122/miR\u2010222 ratios in preservation fluids were significantly higher in DCD grafts (P = 0.001) and grafts developing EAD (P = 0.004). In concordance, the miR\u2010122/miR\u2010222 ratios in perfusion fluid correlate with serum transaminase levels within the first 24 hours after transplantation. Longterm graft survival was significantly diminished in grafts with high miR\u2010122/miR\u2010222 ratios (P = 0.02). In the porcine DCD model, increased WIT lead to higher absolute miR\u2010122 levels and relative miR\u2010122/miR\u2010222 ratios in graft perfusion fluid (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). High miR\u2010122/miR\u2010222 ratios in pig livers were also associated with high aspartate aminotransferase levels after warm oxygenated reperfusion. In conclusion, both absolute and relative miR\u2010122 levels in graft preservation solution are associated with DCD, EAD, and early graft loss after LT.

        "abstract": "Background Delayed graft function (DGF), a common complication after transplantation of deceased donor kidneys, affects both short- and long-term outcomes. Currently available biomarkers during graft preservation lack sensitivity in predicting risk for DGF. The aim of this study is to identify cell-free micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) biomarkers in graft preservation fluid predictive of DGF after kidney transplantation. Methods Vascular bed preservation fluid was collected from 48 kidney grafts from donation after circulatory death (DCD) or donation after brain death (DBD) donors. miRNA profiles were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array (n = 8) and validated by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (n = 40). Graft function posttransplantation was defined as immediate good function (IF) or DGF. Results A total of 223 miRNAs fulfilled the preset parameters (Ct < 40 in 3 or more samples) and were included in the analysis. Thirty-two miRNAs were significantly different between DGF and IF kidney grafts (P < 0.05) but, after correction for multiple testing, only miR-505-3p remained significant. The significant association of high miR-505-3p levels with DGF was confirmed in an independent validation cohort using conventional reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. Multivariate analyses showed miR-505-3p as an independent predictor for DGF (odds ratio, 1.12; P = 0.028). If stratified for donor type, miR-505-3p levels remained significantly different between IF and DGF in DCD grafts (P < 0.01), but not in DBD grafts. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a high sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve, 0.833). Conclusions In DCD grafts, high levels of miR-505-3p in preservation fluid are associated with increased risk of DGF after kidney transplantation. Further study is required to confirm the utility of cell-free miR-505-3p as prognostic biomarker for DGF.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common finding in kidney donors and recipients. AKI in kidney donor, which increases the risk of delayed graft function (DGF), may not by itself jeopardize the short- and long-term outcome of transplantation. However, some forms of AKI may induce graft rejection, fibrosis, and eventually graft dysfunction. Therefore, various strategies have been proposed to identify conditions at highest risk of AKI-induced DGF, that can be treated by targeting the donor, the recipient, or even the graft itself with the use of perfusion machines. AKI that occurs early post-transplant after a period of initial recovery of graft function may reflect serious and often occult systemic complications that may require prompt intervention to prevent graft loss. AKI that develops long after transplantation is often related to nephrotoxic drug reactions. In symptomatic patients, AKI is usually associated with various systemic medical complications and could represent a risk of mortality. Electronic systems have been developed to alert transplant physicians that AKI has occurred in a transplant recipient during long-term outpatient follow-up. Herein, we will review most recent understandings of pathophysiology, diagnosis, therapeutic approach, and short- and long-term consequences of AKI occurring in both the donor and in the kidney transplant recipient.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects about half of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and worsens their short- and long-term outcomes. Apparently self-limiting AKI episodes initiate a progression toward chronic kidney disease (CKD) through cellular and molecular mechanisms that are yet to be explained. In particular, persistent AKI, defined in 2016 by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative as an AKI which lasts more than 48 h from its onset, has been correlated with higher morbidity and mortality, and with a higher progression to acute kidney disease (AKD) and CKD than transient AKI (i.e. AKI with a reversal within 48 h). This classification has been also used in the setting of solid organ transplantation, demonstrating similar outcomes. Due to its incidence and poor prognosis and because prompt interventions seem to change its course, persistent AKI should be recognized early and followed-up also after its recovery. However, while AKI and CKD are well-described syndromes, persistent AKI and AKD are relatively new entities. The purpose of this review is to highlight the key phases of persistent AKI in ICU patients in terms of both clinical and mechanistic features in order to offer to clinicians and researchers an updated basis from which to start improving patients\u2019 care and direct future research.",
