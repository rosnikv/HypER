        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe ovaries provide approximately half the circulating testosterone in premenopausal women. After bilateral oophorectomy, many women report impaired sexual functioning despite estrogen replacement. We evaluated the effects of transdermal testosterone in women who had impaired sexual function after surgically induced menopause.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy-five women, 31 to 56 years old, who had undergone oophorectomy and hysterectomy received conjugated equine estrogens (at least 0.625 mg per day orally) and, in random order, placebo, 150 microg of testosterone, and 300 microg of testosterone per day transdermally for 12 weeks each. Outcome measures included scores on the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women, the Psychological General Well-Being Index, and a sexual-function diary completed over the telephone.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) serum free testosterone concentration increased from 1.2+/-0.8 pg per milliliter (4.2+/-2.8 pmol per liter) during placebo treatment to 3.9+/-2.4 pg per milliliter (13.5+/-8.3 pmol per liter) and 5.9+/-4.8 pg per milliliter (20.5+/-16.6 pmol per liter) during treatment with 150 and 300 microg of testosterone per day, respectively (normal range, 1.3 to 6.8 pg per milliliter [4.5 to 23.6 pmol per liter]). Despite an appreciable placebo response, the higher testosterone dose resulted in further increases in scores for frequency of sexual activity and pleasure-orgasm in the Brief index of Sexual Functioning for Women (P=0.03 for both comparisons with placebo). At the higher dose the percentages of women who had sexual fantasies, masturbated, or engaged in sexual intercourse at least once a week increased two to three times from base line. The positive-well-being, depressed-mood, and composite scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index also improved at the higher dose (P=0.04, P=0.03, and P=0.04, respectively, for the comparison with placebo), but the scores on the telephone-based diary did not increase significantly.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn women who have undergone oophorectomy and hysterectomy, transdermal testosterone improves sexual function and psychological well-being.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of adding testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily to estrogen replacement on sexual function, psychological well-being and self-esteem in surgically postmenopausal women. Methods: A letter of invitation to participate in the study was mailed to women who had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for benign disorders during 1990-98. Fifty women, 45-60 years old, were consecutively recruited and randomly assigned to oral treatment with testosterone undecanoate 40 mg plus estradiol valerate 2 mg daily or placebo plus estradiol valerate 2 mg daily for 24 weeks. A double-blind design was chosen, with cross-over to the other regimen for another 24 weeks of treatment. Forty-four women completed the study. Outcome included scores on McCoy's sex scale questionnaire, the Psychological General Well-Being index and a self-esteem questionnaire, at baseline and after 24 weeks of either treatment. Serum concentrations of total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were analyzed at baseline and after 24 weeks of both treatment regimens. Results: After 24 weeks, both treatment regimens had significantly improved some of the sexual variables. The addition of testosterone had a significantly better effect on the sex variables 'enjoyment of sex', 'satisfaction with frequency of sexual activity' and 'interest in sex'. The total McCoy score was significantly increased by both treatments, but there was a stronger effect when testosterone was also given. Although both regimens improved psychological well-being and self-esteem, we found no significant differences between testosterone-estrogen or estrogen alone at 24 weeks. Serum levels of all androgens, with considerable individual variation, increased significantly from baseline after 24 weeks of testosterone-estrogen treatment. Supraphysiological levels were achieved in a significant proportion of the women. Increases in estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin were less marked when testosterone was also given. Both treatments reduced gonadotropin levels. Conclusions: The addition of testosterone undecanoate improved specific aspects of sexual function more than treatment with estrogen alone. Improvements in well-being and self-esteem were similar for both treatments. If testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily should be used for clinical treatment, regular monitoring of androgen serum levels is needed.",

        "abstract": "Testosterone (T) is not administered orally, because it has been reported to be rapidly metabolized by the liver. We hypothesized that sufficient doses of T or T enanthate (TE), administered orally in oil, would result in clinically useful elevations in serum T. We also hypothesized that coadministration of dutasteride (D) with T or TE would minimize increases in serum DHT seen previously with oral administration. Therefore, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of oral T and TE in oil, with and without concomitant D, in normal men whose T production had been temporarily suppressed by the GnRH antagonist acyline. Thirteen healthy men (mean age, 24 +/- 6 yr) were enrolled and assigned to oral T (n = 7) and oral TE (n = 6) groups and were administered 200, 400, or 800 mg of either T or TE in sesame oil in the morning on 3 successive days 24 h after receiving acyline. Blood samples for measurement of serum T and dihydrotestosterone were obtained before T or TE administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after administration. Subjects were then administered D for 4 d before repeating the sequence of T or TE doses with D. Serum T was significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion with the administration of oral T or TE in oil. Coadministration of D with oral T or TE significantly increased the 24-hr average serum T levels compared with administration of T or TE alone [average serum T after 400 mg dose, 8.7 +/- 3.0 nmol/l (T) and 8.3 +/- 5.7 nmol/l (TE) vs. 16.1 +/- 5.8 nmol/l (T +D) and 15.0 +/- 8.8 nmol/l (TE + D); P < 0.05 for T vs. T and D]. The administration of oral T or TE in oil combined with D results in unexpected and potentially therapeutic increases in serum T. Additional studies of this combination as a novel form of oral androgen therapy are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Oral administration of 400 mg of testosterone (T) in oil, when combined with the 5alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride (D), elevates serum T in medically castrated men to the normal range. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of 1) finasteride (F) and 2) food intake on the serum T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels observed after the oral administration of T in oil. Therefore, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of oral T in oil, alone or with D or F, in the fasting and fed states in normal men whose endogenous T production was suppressed by the GnRH antagonist acyline. After acyline administration, 7 healthy men (mean age 31 +/- 8 years) were sequentially administered five 400-mg doses of oral T in sesame oil once daily. The first dose of oral T (T-alone) in oil was given while fasting without F or D. The second (fasting) and third (fed) doses were administered after pretreatment with F (T + F). Four days later, the fourth (fasting) and fifth (fed) doses were administered after pretreatment with D (T + D). Blood samples for measurement of serum T and DHT were obtained before T dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after each administration. In the fasting state, 24-hour area-under-the-curve of serum T after oral T administration was significantly greater with coadministration of either D or F compared with T-alone (126 +/- 36 nmol-h/L [T-alone] vs 287 +/- 98 nmol-h/L [T + F] vs 236 +/- 82 nmol-h/L [T + D]; P < .05 for T + F and T + D vs T-alone). Administration of the T with food nonsignificantly decreased serum T levels compared with fasting administration. The administration of oral T in oil combined with either F or D results in serum T levels adequate to treat men with testicular failure. Additional studies of the combination of oral T in oil with 5alpha-reductase inhibitors as a novel form of oral T therapy are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Oral administration of testosterone enanthate (TE) and dutasteride increases serum testosterone and might be useful for male hormonal contraception. To ascertain the contraceptive potential of oral TE and dutasteride by determining the degree of gonadotropin suppression mediated by 4 weeks of oral TE plus dutasteride, 20 healthy young men were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of either 400 mg oral TE twice daily or 800 mg oral TE once daily in a double-blinded, controlled fashion at a single site. All men received 0.5 mg dutasteride daily. Blood for measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, dihydrotesterone (DHT), and estradiol was obtained prior to treatment, weekly during treatment, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the morning dose on the last day of treatment. FSH was significantly suppressed throughout treatment with 800 mg TE once daily and after 4 weeks of treatment with 400 mg TE twice daily. LH was significantly suppressed after 2 weeks of treatment with 800 mg TE, but not with 400 mg TE. Serum DHT was suppressed and serum estradiol increased during treatment in both groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was suppresed during treatment, but liver function tests, hematocrit, creatinine, mood, and sexual function were unaffected. The administration of 800 mg oral TE daily combined with dutasteride for 28 days significantly suppresses gonadotropins without untoward side effects and might have utility as part of a male hormonal contraceptive regimen.",

        "abstract": "Oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) is used to treat testosterone deficiency; however, oral TU treatment elevates dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which may be associated with an increased risk of acne, male pattern baldness and prostate hyperplasia. Co-administration of 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors with other formulations of oral testosterone suppresses DHT production and increases serum testosterone. We hypothesized that finasteride would increase serum testosterone and lower DHT during treatment with oral TU. Therefore, we studied the steady-state pharmacokinetics of oral TU, 200 mg equivalents of testosterone twice daily for 7 days, alone and with finasteride 0.5 and 1.0 mg po twice daily in an open-label, three-way crossover study in 11 young men with experimentally induced hypogonadism. On the seventh day of each dosing period, serum testosterone, DHT and oestradiol were measured at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 and 24 h after the morning dose. Serum testosterone and DHT were significantly increased into and above their normal ranges similarly by all three treatments. Co-administration of finasteride at 0.5 and 1.0 mg po twice daily had no significant effect on either serum testosterone or DHT. Oral TU differs from other formulations of oral testosterone in its response to concomitant inhibition of 5\u03b1-reductase, perhaps because of its unique lymphatic route of absorption.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of dietary fat on the testosterone (T) pharmacokinetics in hypogonadal men following administration of a self-emulsifying capsule formulation of oral T undecanoate (TU). In an open-label, 2-center, 5-way crossover study, a single oral dose of TU containing 300-mg equivalents of T (maximum anticipated human dose per administration) was administered to 16 hypogonadal men with a washout period of at least 5 days between doses. All participants were randomized to receive the TU capsules fasting or 30 minutes after an approximately 800-calorie meal containing 10%, 20%, 30%, or 50% fat. Serial blood samples were collected from 2 hours predose to 25 hours postdose to determine serum T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Administering TU with a meal increased serum T concentrations, with the magnitude of the increase being directly dependent on the amount of fat in the meal. Average and peak serum T concentrations and area under the curve increased as the fat content of the meal was increased. Neither the high-fat meal (50% fat) nor the lower-fat meal (20% fat) showed a significant food effect relative to the normal-fat (Western diet) meal (30% fat). However, administering TU while fasting resulted in 50% or less of the cumulative exposure obtained when administered with 20%- to 50%-fat meals (albeit still substantial). A very-low-fat meal (10% fat) showed a significant food effect relative to the normal meal, but still exceeded the fasting condition by approximately 50%. Serum DHT concentrations showed corresponding increases to the serum T. As expected with the maximum anticipated clinical dose of TU (300 mg T), oral administration of this new formulation with food containing 20% to 50% dietary fat produced T levels at or above the upper range of adult men, and T levels trended higher as dietary fat content increased. Only with a very-low-fat diet (10%) or in a fasted state did a clinically significant food effect occur, but even then sufficient TU was absorbed with the self-emulsifying TU formulation to produce average serum T concentration predicted to be in the normal reference range (10 to 35 nmol/L).",

Our objective was to examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of single, escalating doses of DMAU (powder in capsule formulation) administered orally with or without food in healthy men.

In vivo, dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) is hydrolyzed to DMA. We showed previously that single oral doses of DMAU powder in capsule taken with food are well tolerated and effective at suppressing both LH and testosterone (T), but absorption was low. We compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two new formulations of DMAU, in castor oil and in self\u2010emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS), with the previously tested powder formulation. DMAU was dosed orally in healthy adult male volunteers at two academic medical centers. For each formulation tested in this double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study, 10 men received single, escalating, oral doses of DMAU (100, 200, and 400 mg) and two subjects received placebo. All doses were evaluated for both fasting and with a high fat meal. All three formulations were well tolerated without clinically significant changes in vital signs, blood counts, or serum chemistries. For all formulations, DMA and DMAU showed higher maximum (p < 0.007) and average concentrations (p < 0.002) at the 400 mg dose, compared with the 200 mg dose. The powder formulation resulted in a lower conversion of DMAU to DMA (p = 0.027) compared with both castor oil and SEDDS formulations. DMAU in SEDDS given fasting resulted in higher serum DMA and DMAU concentrations compared to the other two formulations. Serum LH and sex hormone concentrations were suppressed by all formulations of 200 and 400 mg DMAU when administered with food, but only the SEDDS formulation was effectively suppressed serum T when given fasting. We conclude that while all three formulations of oral DMAU are effective and well tolerated when administered with food, DMAU in oil and SEDDS increased conversion to DMA, and SEDDS may have some effectiveness when given fasting. These properties might be advantageous for the application of DMAU as a male contraceptive.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe advent of new methods of male contraception would increase contraceptive options for men and women and advance male contraceptive agency. Pharmaceutical R&D for male contraception has been dormant since the 1990's. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has supported a contraceptive development program since 1969 and supports most ongoing hormonal male contraceptive development. Non-hormonal methods are in earlier stages of development.\n\n\nCONTENT\nSeveral hormonal male contraceptive agents have entered clinical trials. Novel single agent products being evaluated include Dimethandrolone Undecanoate (DMAU), 11\u03b2-methyl-nortestosterone dodecylcarbonate (11\u03b2-MNTDC), and 7\u03b1-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT). A contraceptive efficacy trial of Nestorone\u00ae (NES)/testosterone (T) gel is underway. Potential non-hormonal methods are at preclinical stages of development. Many non-hormonal male contraceptive targets that affect sperm production, sperm function, or sperm transport have been identified.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nNICHD supports development of reversible male contraceptive agents. Other organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Population Council, and The Male Contraception Initiative are pursuing male contraceptive development, but industry involvement remains limited.",

        "title": "Investigation of selective retinoic acid receptor alpha antagonist ER\u201050891 and related analogs for male contraception",
        "abstract": "Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1) antagonist ER\u201050891 and 15 analogs were prepared and tested in vitro for potency and selectivity at RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3 using transactivation assays. Minor modifications to the parent molecule such as the introduction of a C4 tolyl group in place of the C4 phenyl group on the quinoline moiety slightly increased the RAR\u03b1 selectivity but larger substituents significantly decreased the potency. Replacement of the pyrrole moiety of ER\u201050891 with triazole, amides, or a double bond produced inactive compounds. ER\u201050891 was found to be stable in male mouse liver microsomes and was tested in male mice to assess its effects on spermatogenesis. Characteristic, albeit modest and transient, effects on spermatogenesis were observed.",

        "abstract": "Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are a class of nuclear receptors that play an important role in spermatogenesis. Blocking RAR-\u03b1 activity is an effective method of contraception. In this study, we used in silico methods to design and evaluate new thiadiazole-based RAR-\u03b1 antagonists. We performed molecular docking, ADME studies, molecular dynamics, and Binding free energy calculations to determine binding affinities, oral bioavailability, and stability. From the twenty designed compounds, three compounds, BVSSS14, BVSSS09, and BVSSS10, exhibit promising interactions and docking scores of -12.3, -11.6, and -10.1\u2009kcal/mol, respectively. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidated the conformational stability of these three compounds within the RAR-\u03b1 binding pocket. Furthermore, MMGBSA analysis provided insights into binding free energies, proving the efficacy of BVSSS14, BVSSS09, and BVSSS10. In silico approach highlights the potential of BVSSS14, BVSSS09, and BVSSS10 as promising compounds to inhibit RAR-\u03b1, and these compounds are effective candidates as contraceptive agents, laying the groundwork for future experimental validation.",
