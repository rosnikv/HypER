        "title": "Effects of Nortriptyline on Depression and Glycemic Control in Diabetes: Results of a Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Objective Depression is a prevalent and chronic condition in diabetes and is associated with poor glucose regulation and poor compliance with diabetes treatment. This investigation evaluated the effects of nortriptyline on depression and glycemic control to see whether depression in diabetes is treatable and whether restoring mental health contributes to improved medical outcome. Method: Sixty-eight diabetic patients with poor glycemic control, 28 of whom had active major depression (DSM-IIIR), completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 8 weeks of treatment with nortriptyline targeted to therapeutic plasma levels (50-150 ng/ml). Depression improvement was determined with the Beck Depression Inventory; glucose control was measured by glycated hemoglobin levels. Compliance behavior was assessed using medication dispensing devices and glucometers equipped with electronic memory. Results: The reduction in depression symptoms was significantly greater in depressed patients treated with nortriptyline compared with those receiving placebo (-10.2 vs -5.8, p =.03). Nortriptyline was not statistically superior to placebo in reducing glycated hemoglobin of the depressed subjects (p =.5). However, path analysis indicated that the direct effect of nortriptyline was to worsen glycemic control whereas depression improvement had an independent beneficial effect on glycated hemoglobin. These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to weight change (r = -0.21, p =.31) or depression improvement to compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p =.97). Conclusions: Major depression in diabetic patients can be effectively treated with nortriptyline at the expense of a direct hyperglycemic effect. Path analysis demonstrated a treatment-independent effect of depression improvement on glycemic control, suggesting that a more ideal antidepressant agent may both restore mental health and improve medical outcome.",

        "abstract": "D EPRESSIVE DISORDER AND depressive symptoms remain important factors in recovery from general medical illness. I A recent study by Nielson and Williams reported that primary care physicians fail to diagnose depression in halfofpatients who are later found to be depressed.2 A substantial body of research has suggested that people with diabetes have higher levels of psychological disturbance, especially depression, than exist in the general population.3 Peyrotand Ruben found a 41.3% prevalence of depressive symptoms in adult diabetics enrolled in a one-week outpatient diabetes program. This incidence of depression is higher than the expected rates of 16 to 21 % seen in primary care groups. Risk factors associated with higher rates of depression include gender, education, marital status, and age.3 Incidence is inversely related to educational achievement. Persons not graduating from high school have a 50% greater risk than those graduating from college. Women appear twice as likely as men to have symptoms ofdepression. Middle-aged persons present higher rates of depressive symptoms than persons in the older age groups. Several factors may account for the high rates of depressive symptoms in people with diabetes as noted by Peyrot and Rubin. In the study, rates were based on patient reported",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the importance of treating depression in diabetic patients, which is related to the source paper's topic of treating depression in diabetic patients with nortriptyline. However, this paper does not directly build upon or use the findings of the source paper, so it is not considered highly relevant."

        "abstract": "The occurrence of depression with diabetes mellitus has been intensively researched for a num\u2010 ber of decades now. It was Thomas Willis (1621 \u2013 1675) who introduced the phrase diabetes mellitus (before then called Willis\u2019s disease) and associated it with what had already been known for decades \u2013 that patients with diabetes have glycosuria (sweet urine). He also noted that \u201csadness or excessive melancholy, similar to fits or other depressions and breakdowns of the animal spirit, give rise to or instigate this diseased condition (diabetes)\u201d. His follower J. C. Brunner (1653 \u2013 1727) is known because of several studies with the pancreas. The large number of epidemiological studies documents the increasing interest in this problem. Evidence of a bidirectional relationship between depression and diabetes has also been re\u2010 cently documented in large prospective studies. Comorbid depression is associated with an increased risk of poor glycaemic control, diabetes complications have also been found to be risk factors for subsequent development of depressive episodes",

        "abstract": "Examining diabetes, Depression and Suicide in Middle-Aged and Older Adults Kimberly Morton Rates of suicide in the United States are highest in middle-aged and older adults compared to younger age groups. These rates are alarming and point to the need for suicide prevention research in middle-aged and older adult populations. Depression is the most well-established independent risk factor for death by suicide. Some health conditions are also associated with risk of suicide above and beyond depression. Diabetes is often co-morbid with depression (clinical and subclinical depression). However, research examining diabetes and risk of suicide is less clear. In the current study, the first aim was to examine diabetes, vision impairment and depressive symptoms. Controlling for age, gender, marital status, weight and education, diabetes predicted depressive symptoms in a multiple linear regression. Impaired vision partially explained the association between diabetes and depressive symptoms. Additionally, marital status and gender both had an interaction effect in the relation between diabetes and depressive symptoms. The second aim examined diabetes and risk of suicide; however, due to low power, the findings could not be interpreted. Future studies should examine diabetes and risk of suicide with a larger U.S. sample of middle-aged and older adults. The diabetes-depressive symptoms findings are important when considering practice and policy related to mental health in middleaged and older adult populations who are diagnosed with diabetes.
