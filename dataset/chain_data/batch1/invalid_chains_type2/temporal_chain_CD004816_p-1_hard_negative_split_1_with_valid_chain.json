        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIncreased levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein predict cardiovascular events. Since statins lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as well as cholesterol, we hypothesized that people with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels but without hyperlipidemia might benefit from statin treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg per liter or higher to rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, or placebo and followed them for the occurrence of the combined primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum, 5.0). Rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 50% and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 37%. The rates of the primary end point were 0.77 and 1.36 per 100 person-years of follow-up in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio for rosuvastatin, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.69; P<0.00001), with corresponding rates of 0.17 and 0.37 for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.70; P=0.0002), 0.18 and 0.34 for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.79; P=0.002), 0.41 and 0.77 for revascularization or unstable angina (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.70; P<0.00001), 0.45 and 0.85 for the combined end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.69; P<0.00001), and 1.00 and 1.25 for death from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97; P=0.02). Consistent effects were observed in all subgroups evaluated. The rosuvastatin group did not have a significant increase in myopathy or cancer but did have a higher incidence of physician-reported diabetes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this trial of apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

        "title": "Statin Treatment-Induced Development of Type 2 Diabetes: From Clinical Evidence to Mechanistic Insights",
        "abstract": "Statins are the gold-standard treatment for the prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite the safety and relative tolerability of statins, observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses indicate an increased risk of developing new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after long-term statin treatment. It has been shown that statins can impair insulin sensitivity and secretion by pancreatic \u03b2-cells and increase insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. The mechanisms involved in these processes include, among others, impaired Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, down-regulation of GLUT-4 in adipocytes and compromised insulin signaling. In addition, it has also been described that statins\u2019 impact on epigenetics may also contribute to statin-induced T2DM via differential expression of microRNAs. This review focuses on the evidence and mechanisms by which statin therapy is associated with the development of T2DM. This review describes the multifactorial combination of effects that most likely contributes to the diabetogenic effects of statins. Clinically, these findings should encourage clinicians to consider diabetes monitoring in patients receiving statin therapy in order to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate management.",

        "abstract": "The article presents epidemiological data on the high prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia comorbidity in the general population, as well as shows the leading role of these key cardiovascular risk factors in the development of cardiovascular events. At the same time, within the primary prevention, the adherence of patients to the lipid-lowering therapy remains low. Fixed-dose combinations (Lipertans) based on antihypertensive (amlodipine, perindopril) and lipid-lowering drugs (atorvastatin) can significantly increase the effectiveness of therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective. The aim is to study antihypertensive and lipid-lowering effects of polypill therapy in patients with arterial hypertension (HTN) grade 1\u20132 and dyslipidemia, who had a novel coronavirus infection. Design and methods. We enrolled 65 patients with HTN and dyslipidemia after COronaVIrus Disease-2019, of which 60 people (92,3 %) completed observation. During 24 weeks patients took polypill therapy, including indapamide, perindopril and rosuvastatin. Office blood pressure (BP) measurements using the Korotkov method and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) were performed; level of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol were assessed. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2013C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were calculated. Results. After 24 weeks of polypill therapy 54 patients (90 %) reached target BP levels. According to 24-hour ABPM data, there was a significant decrease in the average daily, average day and night BP values, reduction in blood pressure load and BP variability (p < 0,001). By the end of treatment, there was an increase in the number of patients with normal daily profile (dipper) (\u0440 < 0,05). After 24 weeks, an improvement of lipid profile indicators was recorded, target level of LDL\u2013C was achieved in 28 (84,8 %) patients at high risk and 15 (55,6 %) patients at very high risk. Chances of simultaneous achievement of target values for BP and LDL\u2013C in the high risk group were 4 times higher than in the very high risk group (odds ratio 4,2 [95 % confidence interval 1,3\u201313,4]; p = 0,028). Conclusions. According to 24-hour ABPM data, 24-week polypill therapy including indapamide, perindopril and rosuvastatin leads to a significant reduction in average daily BP values and contributes to the normalization of the daily profile. After 6-months therapy, target BP and LDL\u2013C levels were achieved in 68,3 % patients with HTN and dyslipidemia who have had COVID-19.",
