        "title": "Warfarin plus Aspirin after Myocardial Infarction or the Acute Coronary Syndrome: Meta-Analysis with Estimates of Risk and Benefit",
        "abstract": "Context Continued thrombin generation persists for several months after acute cardiac events. Contribution Data from 10 randomized trials involving 5938 patients with the acute coronary syndrome who were not stented showed that, compared with aspirin alone, warfarin plus aspirin decreased annual rates of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and revascularization and increased major bleeding rates. In patients with low or average bleeding risks, numbers of cardiovascular events prevented by warfarin plus aspirin exceeded numbers of major bleeding episodes caused by it. Implications Benefits of warfarin plus aspirin may exceed harms in patients with the acute coronary syndrome who are not stented and do not have high bleeding risks. The Editors Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of illness and death in the United States (1). Patients with a history of myocardial infarction are at increased risk for recurrent infarction, stroke, and death (2, 3). Several interventions have proven beneficial in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, including -blockers (4), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (5), lipid-lowering therapy (6), and aspirin (7). In addition, after acute cardiac events, a marked thrombin generation persists for months after clinical stabilization (8), suggesting a role for anticoagulation beyond the initial use of low-molecular-weight heparin (9). Although some studies have shown that addition of warfarin to aspirin decreases subsequent risk for cardiovascular events (10-14), other studies have not (15, 16). In a meta-analysis, Anand and Yusuf (17) suggested that only moderate- to high-intensity anticoagulation, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) more than 2.0, decreased cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone. A large randomized trial conducted in a primary care setting showed that adding warfarin to aspirin decreased combined cardiovascular end points of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death by 29% (12). Despite these findings, warfarin use has not been widely adopted, perhaps because of concern that the increased bleeding risk may counter the cardiovascular benefit (18) or that the benefits are too small to justify the inconvenience (19). The risks and benefits that are probably associated with warfarin therapy are not equally distributed. Patients at the highest risk for recurrent cardiovascular events should derive the most benefit, which may be offset in those with increased bleeding risk. To better quantify the risks and benefits of warfarin therapy for individuals, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials and then calculated the expected benefit for groups at varying risk for cardiovascular disease and bleeding. Methods Study Selection We searched MEDLINE using the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and text words: anticoagulant or anticoagulation or warfarin and aspirin, combined with myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary arteriosclerosis, or coronary artery disease. We limited our search to original, English-language articles published between 1 January 1990 and 1 October 2004; earlier trials were not likely to reflect current standards of care for secondary prevention, including lipid therapy and -blockers. Two reviewers scanned the titles independently for relevant randomized trials. We checked abstracts and then manuscripts of all potentially appropriate references. We included studies if they were randomized, controlled trials of warfarin and aspirin in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. We excluded studies of percutaneous coronary stenting (for which warfarin is generally not considered appropriate therapy) (20) and low-intensity warfarin therapy (target INR < 2.0). We assessed studies for proper randomization, blinding of patients and investigators to treatment allocation, and completeness of follow-up. Data Extraction The 2 reviewers extracted the following data independently: study size and duration; aspirin dose; target INR; and demographic characteristics of trial participants, including age, sex, number of patients with diabetes, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and whether the patient had a Q-wave infarction or received thrombolysis. We evaluated 7 end points: myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, death, minor bleeding, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Each study's authors defined major and minor bleeding, and most studies reported all 7 end points. When results were presented only as combined end points or were ambiguous, we contacted the study authors to obtain primary data. In the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS) study (13), a multicenter, international trial, investigators noted 35 days into the trial that compliance as measured by achievement of target INR was better in some countries than in other countries and designated a subset analysis of countries with good compliance before data collection was complete. We included only the compliant countries in our analysis. We contacted the OASIS authors for select data on compliant countries from OASIS (13) and individual end points from the OASIS pilot study (21), which were published only as combined end points. We contacted the authors of Huynh and colleagues' study (22), because the published results for all end points were incorrect. Statistical Analysis We used Stata, version 8.2 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas), for all analyses. We calculated the rate ratios and 95% CIs for recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding (major or minor) for each study. We used a half-integer correction if no events occurred in 1 group of the study. We pooled rate ratios by using random-effects models that used weighting based on the inverse-variance model according to DerSimonian and Laird (23). We used the MantelHaenszel test to evaluate heterogeneity among trial outcomes. We considered statistical significance at a P value less than 0.05. We performed an influence analysis in which we computed the summary rate ratio, omitting the largest trial (Warfarin, Aspirin, Reinfarction Study [WARIS II] [12]), to assess for any single study dominance in the analysis. We used the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test (24) and the Egger regression asymmetry test (25) to evaluate publication bias. Weighing Risks and Benefits To demonstrate the relative benefits of warfarin plus aspirin for individual patients at different degrees of risk, we calculated the number of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and major bleeding episodes expected to result from aspirin therapy, with or without warfarin, for 9 combinations of cardiovascular and bleeding risk. We calculated events in each risk group taking warfarin plus aspirin by multiplying the rate for the corresponding group of patients taking aspirin by the rate ratio derived from the meta-analysis. The absolute differences between these rates represent the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes prevented by adding warfarin to aspirin. Because the timing of events may be important in treatment decisions, we calculated outcomes at 3 months and 1 year. On the basis of 5059 patients in the Combination Hemotherapy and Mortality Prevention (CHAMP) study (16), we estimated that 51% of myocardial infarctions, 54% of strokes, and 50% of bleeding episodes in the first year after acute myocardial infarction would occur in the first 3 months. Event rates for all 3 outcomes continue to decrease over time. Thus, considering events in the first 2 years after an acute coronary syndrome, approximately 70% of all outcomes occur in the first year. To directly compare event rates across studies of differing duration, we converted all results into first-year rates by using the proportions just described. Cardiovascular Risk Many published instruments are available for determining short- and long-term risk for reinfarction, stroke, and mortality. To demonstrate the clinical usefulness of estimating both cardiovascular and bleeding risk before prescribing warfarin, we chose clinical examples of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. We derived our estimates of the rates for recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke for patients receiving aspirin by using the computed hazard ratios from a large population-based study of 2700 patients surviving hospitalization after a first myocardial infarction and followed for an average of 3.4 years (26). We chose this study for its large size, long follow-up period, emphasis on easily measured clinical predictors, and inclusion of stroke as an outcome. The following variables were associated with increased risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke: age, treated diabetes, chronic congestive heart failure, angina, and serum creatinine level greater than 123.76 mol/L (>1.4 mg/dL). We created examples of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients by applying the hazard ratios for specific risk variables to a baseline risk of 49 per 1000 patient-years of observation. Infarction rates per 1000 patient-years were 40 for a low-risk patient (no risk factors), 82 for a medium-risk patient (for example, diabetes and serum creatinine level >123.76 mol/L [>1.4 mg/dL]), and 188 for a high-risk patient (for example, diabetes and congestive heart failure). Stroke rates for the same patients were 13, 32, and 79, respectively. Other risk stratification tools, based on the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI II) (27), Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico (GISSI) (28), Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT) (29), or Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) (30) studies, produce similar ranges of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. A detailed calculator based on the GRACE model is available at www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace. Bleeding Risk Several instruments are also available for predicting bleeding risk for patients taking warfarin (31-",

An age- and sex-matched control group with similar disease presentation (unstable or stable symptoms) was selected from the study period. Primary endpoint was defined as the occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 12 months. Warfarin treatment was an independent predictor of both primary endpoint (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0, P = 0.05) and major bleeding (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.3, P = 0.02). Triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was the most common (48%) option in stented patients in warfarin group, and there was a significant (P = 0.004) difference between the drug combinations in stent thrombosis with the highest (15.2%) incidence in patients receiving warfarin plus aspirin combination.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study shows that the prognosis is unsatisfactory in warfarin-treated patients irrespective of the drug combination used.

        "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended after coronary stenting (PCI-S). There is scant evidence defining optimal post-PCI-S antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom oral anticoagulation (OAC) is mandated. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the antithrombotic strategies for this population, we conducted a systematic review of the available evidence in patients treated with OAC undergoing PCI-S. AF was the most frequent indication for OAC. Post-PCI-S management was highly variable, and triple therapy with warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel was the most frequent and effective combination. Warfarin plus aspirin alone was not sufficiently effective in the early period after PCI-S and should not be prescribed. While acknowledging that the optimal antithrombotic treatment for patients with AF at medium or high thromboembolic risk undergoing PCI-S is currently undefined, triple therapy of warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel is currently recommended, although associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. Restrictive use of drug-eluting stent is also recommended, due to the need for prolonged multiple-drug antithrombotic therapy which may increase the bleeding risk. Whether the combination of warfarin and clopidogrel (without aspirin) will preserve efficacy and produce less bleeding is an important issue still needing to be addressed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with atrial fibrillation (AF) often require anticoagulation and platelet inhibition, but data are limited on the bleeding risk of combination therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a cohort study using nationwide registries to identify all Danish patients surviving first-time hospitalization for AF between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2006, and their posthospital therapy of warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and combinations of these drugs. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risks of nonfatal and fatal bleeding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 82,854 of 118,606 patients (69.9%) surviving AF hospitalization had at least 1 prescription filled for warfarin, aspirin, or clopidogrel after discharge. During mean (SD) follow-up of 3.3 (2.6) years, 13,573 patients (11.4%) experienced a nonfatal or fatal bleeding. The crude incidence rate for bleeding was highest for dual clopidogrel and warfarin therapy (13.9% per patient-year) and triple therapy (15.7% per patient-year). Using warfarin monotherapy as a reference, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for the combined end point was 0.93 (0.88-0.98) for aspirin, 1.06 (0.87-1.29) for clopidogrel, 1.66 (1.34-2.04) for aspirin-clopidogrel, 1.83 (1.72-1.96) for warfarin-aspirin, 3.08 (2.32-3.91) for warfarin-clopidogrel, and 3.70 (2.89-4.76) for warfarin-aspirin-clopidogrel.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with AF, all combinations of warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel are associated with increased risk of nonfatal and fatal bleeding.

        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe impact of some risk factors for stroke and bleeding, and the value of stroke and bleeding risk scores, in atrial fibrillation (AF), has been debated, as clinical trial cohorts have not adequately tested these. Our objective was to investigate risk factors for stroke and bleeding in AF, and application of the new CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED schemes for stroke and bleeding risk assessments, respectively.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe used the Swedish Atrial Fibrillation cohort study, a nationwide cohort study of 182 678 subjects with a diagnosis of AF at any Swedish hospital between 1 July 2005 and 31 December 2008, who were prospectively followed for an average of 1.5 years (260 000 years at risk). With the use of the National Swedish Drug Registry, all patients who used an oral anticoagulant anytime during follow-up were identified. Most of the analyses were made on a subset of 90 490 patients who never used anticoagulants. Risk factors for stroke, the composite thromboembolism endpoint (stroke, TIA, or systemic embolism), and bleeding, and the performance of published stroke and bleeding risk stratification schemes were investigated. On multivariable analysis, significant associations were found between the following 'new' risk factors and thromboembolic events; peripheral artery disease [hazard ratio (HR) 1.22 (95% CI 1.12-1.32)], 'vascular disease' [HR 1.14 (1.06-1.23)], prior myocardial infarction [HR 1.09 (1.03-1.15)], and female gender [HR 1.17 (1.11-1.22)]. Previous embolic events, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), hypertension, diabetes, and renal failure were other independent predictors of the composite thromboembolism endpoint, while thyroid disease (or hyperthyroidism) was not an independent stroke risk factor. C-statistics for the composite thromboembolic endpoint with the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc schemes were 0.66 (0.65-0.66) and 0.67 (0.67-0.68), respectively. On multivariable analysis, age, prior ischaemic stroke or thromboembolism, prior major bleeding events, and hypertension were significant predictors of ICH and major bleeding. Heart failure, diabetes, renal failure, liver disease, anaemia or platelet/coagulation defect, alcohol abuse, and cancer were other significant predictors for major bleeding, but not ICH. The ability for predicting ICH and major bleeding with both bleeding risk schemes (HEMORR(2)HAGES, HAS-BLED) were similar, with c-statistics of ~0.6.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSeveral independent risk factors (prior ICH, myocardial infarction, vascular disease, and renal failure) predict ischaemic stroke and/or the composite thromboembolism endpoint in AF, but thyroid disease (or hyperthyroidism) was not an independent risk factor for stroke. There is a better performance for CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc over CHADS(2) schemes for the composite thromboembolism endpoint. While both tested bleeding risk schemes have similar predictive value, the HAS-BLED score has the advantage of simplicity.",

Methods and Results\u2014 We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients aged \u226565 years admitted to a hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AF, in Quebec and Ontario, Canada from 1998 to 2007. The AF cohort was grouped into dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and nondialysis patients and into warfarin and no-warfarin users according to the first prescription filled for warfarin within 30 days after AF hospital discharge. We determined the association between warfarin use and the risk for stroke and bleeding in dialysis and nondialysis patients. The cohort comprised 1626 dialysis patients and 204 210 nondialysis patients. Among dialysis patients, 46% (756/1626) patients were prescribed warfarin. Among dialysis patients, warfarin users had more congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus, but fewer prior bleeding events in comparison with the no-warfarin users. Among dialysis patients, warfarin use, in comparison with no-warfarin use, was not associated with a lower risk for stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.78\u20131.67) but was associated with a 44% higher risk for bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.13\u20131.85) after adjusting for potential confounders.

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted for studies evaluating VTE and bleeding outcomes with DOAC use in CKD and dialysis patients. Searches conducted through EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to September 22, 2020. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series with \u226510 patients included. Data Synthesis: From 7286 studies, nine studies met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and warfarin for reducing recurrent VTE and bleeding events in moderate CKD patients. The risk of overall major bleeding increased when the degree of kidney impairment increased. There was no significant difference between apixaban and warfarin for VTE outcomes in dialysis patients. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: There continues to be a controversial debate whether it may be more beneficial to use DOACs versus warfarin in CKD/dialysis patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk vs benefit of using DOACs in the CKD/ESKD population should continue to be evaluated for each individual patient. Conclusion: Apixaban may be used cautiously as an alternative in acute VTE treatment in severe CKD patients. Insufficient evidence is available to suggest the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in this patient population. The benefit of using DOACs in this population for VTE treatment should be weighed against the potential bleeding risk in patients with CKD.",
