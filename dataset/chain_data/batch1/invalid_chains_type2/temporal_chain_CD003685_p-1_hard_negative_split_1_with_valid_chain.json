        "title": "Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEach year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.",

        "title": "Variability among nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTraditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding/perforation, but the magnitude of this effect for coxibs in the general population and the degree of variability between individual NSAIDs is still under debate. This study was undertaken to assess the risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation among users of individual NSAIDs and to analyze the correlation between this risk and the degree of inhibition of whole blood cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2 in vitro.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review of observational studies on NSAIDs and upper GI bleeding/perforation published between 2000 and 2008. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) estimates of upper GI bleeding/perforation for individual NSAIDs. Additionally, we verified whether the degree of inhibition of whole blood COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro by average circulating concentrations predicted the RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation was 4.50 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.82-5.31) for traditional NSAIDs and 1.88 (95% CI 0.96-3.71) for coxibs. RRs lower than that for NSAIDs overall were observed for ibuprofen (2.69 [95% CI 2.17-3.33]), rofecoxib (2.12 [95% CI 1.59-2.84]), aceclofenac (1.44 [95% CI 0.65-3.2]), and celecoxib (1.42 [95% CI 0.85-2.37]), while higher RRs were observed for ketorolac (14.54 [95% CI 5.87-36.04]) and piroxicam (9.94 [95% CI 5.99-16.50). Estimated RRs were 5.63 (95% CI 3.83-8.28) for naproxen, 5.57 (95% CI 3.94-7.87) for ketoprofen, 5.40 (95% CI 4.16-7.00) for indomethacin, 4.15 (95% CI 2.59-6.64) for meloxicam, and 3.98 (95% CI 3.36-4.72) for diclofenac. The degree of inhibition of whole blood COX-1 did not significantly correlate with RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation associated with individual NSAIDs (r(2) = 0.34, P = 0.058), but a profound and coincident inhibition (>80%) of both COX isozymes was associated with higher risk. NSAIDs with a long plasma half-life and with a slow-release formulation were associated with a greater risk than NSAIDs with a short half-life.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of our analysis demonstrate that risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation varies between individual NSAIDs at the doses commonly used in the general population. Drugs that have a long half-life or slow-release formulation and/or are associated with profound and coincident inhibition of both COX isozymes are associated with a greater risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation.",

        "abstract": "Conventional medical treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis includes the use of NSAIDs (traditional and selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase [COX]-2), because they provide unmistakable and significant health benefits in the treatment of pain and inflammation. However, they are associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) adverse events. Both beneficial and adverse effects are due to the same mechanism of action, which is inhibition of COX-dependent prostanoids. Since CV and GI risk are related to drug exposure, a reduction in the administered dose is recommended. However, this strategy will not eliminate the hazard owing to a possible contribution of individual genetic background. Further studies will be necessary to develop genetic and/or biochemical markers predictive of the CV and GI risk of NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Further understand the safety profile of celecoxib and provide safety information for important adverse events (AEs). Methods: Analysis of randomized controlled trials from the Pfizer clinical trial repository (final study reports completed by 31 July 2011) in which celecoxib was compared with placebo or non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) for treatment of pain or inflammation in adults. Safety end points comprised 18 terms that had been identified as important AEs among all NSAIDs. Results: There was a greater risk of edema (risk difference (95% confidence interval) 0.77% (0.45, 1.09)); hypertension (0.28% (-0.01, 0.57)); angioedema (0.16% (-0.06, 0.39) and allergic reactions (0.15% (-0.10, 0.40)) with celecoxib than with placebo, while a greater risk of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage (-0.15% (-0.47, 0.16)) was seen with placebo. There was a greater risk of GI hemorrhage (-0.53% (-0.72, -0.33)), GI ulceration (-0.46% (-0.60, -0.33)), edema (-0.62% (-0.89, -0.35)) and hypertension (-0.57% (-0.82, -0.33)) with nsNSAIDs than with celecoxib. Conclusions: The magnitude of risks associated with NSAIDs is small and similar in celecoxib-, nsNSAID- and placebo-treated patients. This analysis provides safety information that will allow physicians to make informed treatment decisions for patients who are appropriate candidates for celecoxib use.",

Methods: We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.11), PubMed (1966-2017.11), Embase (1980-2017.11), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.11), and the Cochrane Library (1900-2017.11) for randomized clinical trials comparing the use of methylprednisolone to treat knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores and WOMAC function scores. Each outcome was combined and calculated using the statistical software STATA 12.0. Fixed/random effect model was adopted based on the heterogeneity tested by I2 statistic. Results: A total of 739 patients were analyzed across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the WOMAC pain scores at 4 weeks (WMD = \u22121.384, 95% CI: \u22121.975 to \u22120.793, P\u200a=\u200a.000), 12 weeks (WMD\u200a=\u200a\u22121.587, 95% CI: \u22122.489 to \u22120.685, P\u200a=\u200a.001), and 24 weeks (WMD\u200a=\u200a\u22121.563, 95% CI: \u22122.245 to \u22120.881, P\u200a=\u200a.000).

Objectives The aims of the study were to clarify the evidence on the magnitude and duration of treatment effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis compared with placebo, to evaluate a treatment effect by steroid type, and to describe the reported adverse effects. Design Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. The risk of systematic bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s domain-based evaluation framework. Results The final sample included eight randomized controlled studies with follow-ups from 1 to 26 wks. The risk of systematic bias was considered low in five and high in three studies. The pooled standardized mean difference was \u22120.58 (95% confidence interval = \u22120.88 to \u22120.27) and number needed to treat 5.1 (95% confidence interval = 10.0 to 3.7). The heterogeneity was considerable. The pooled effect size approached the level of statistical insignificance at 4 mos.

        "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting the adult population. OA is no longer thought to come from a purely biomechanical origin but rather one that has been increasingly recognized to include a persistent low-grade inflammatory component. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACSI) have become a widely used method for treating pain in patients with OA as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, as the disease progresses, IACSI become ineffective. FKBP51 is a regulatory protein of the glucocorticoid receptor function and have been shown to be dysregulated in several pathological scenario\u2019s including chronic inflammation. Despite of these facts, to our knowledge, there are no previous studies of the expression and possible role of FKBP51 in OA. We investigated by double and triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy the cellular and subcellular expression of FKBP51 and its relations with inflammation factors in osteoarthritic knee joint tissues: specifically, in the tibial plateau knee cartilage, Hoffa\u2019s fat pad and suprapatellar synovial tissue of the knee. Our results show co-expression of FKBP51 with TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CD31 and CD34 in OA chondrocytes, synovial membrane cells and adipocytes in Hoffa\u2019s fat pad. FKBP51 is also abundant in nerve fibers within the fat pad. Co-expression of FKBP51 protein with these markers may be indicative of its contribution to inflammatory processes and associated chronic pain in OA.",

        "abstract": "The immunophilin FKBP51, the angiomotin AmotL2, and the scaffoldin IQGAP1 are overexpressed in many types of cancer, with the highest increase in leucocytes from patients undergoing oxaliplatin chemotherapy. Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of nephrotoxicity induced by platinum analogs. Cilastatin prevents renal damage caused by cisplatin. This functional and confocal microscopy study shows the renal focal-segmental expression of TNF\u03b1 after cisplatin administration in rats, predominantly of tubular localization and mostly prevented by co-administration of cilastatin. FKBP51, AmotL2 and IQGAP1 protein expression increases slightly with cilastatin administration and to a much higher extent with cisplatin, in a cellular- and subcellular-specific manner. Kidney tubule cells expressing FKBP51 show either very low or no expression of TNF\u03b1, while cells expressing TNF\u03b1 have low levels of FKBP51. AmotL2 and TNF\u03b1 seem to colocalize and their expression is increased in tubular cells. IQGAP1 fluorescence increases with cilastatin, cisplatin and joint cilastatin-cisplatin treatment, and does not correlate with TNF\u03b1 expression or localization. These data suggest a role for FKBP51, AmotL2 and IQGAP1 in cisplatin toxicity in kidney tubules and in the protective effect of cilastatin through inhibition of dehydropeptidase-I.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nRhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (RIAKI) can interrupt physical training and increase mortality in injured warfighters. The legal performance-enhancing drugs caffeine and ibuprofen, which can cause renal injury, are widely used by service members. Whether caffeine or ibuprofen affects RIAKI is unknown. Cilastatin treatment was recently identified as an experimental treatment to prevent RIAKI at injury. To determine potential interacting factors in RIAKI treatment, we test the hypothesis that caffeine and ibuprofen worsen RIAKI and interfere with treatment.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn mice, RIAKI was induced by glycerol intramuscular injection. Simultaneously, mice received caffeine (3\u2009mg/kg), ibuprofen (10\u2009mg/kg), or vehicle. A second cohort received volume resuscitation (PlasmaLyte, 20\u2009mL/kg) in addition to caffeine or ibuprofen. In a third cohort, cilastatin (200\u2009mg/kg) was administered concurrently with drug and glycerol administration. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output (UOP), renal pathology, and renal immunofluorescence for kidney injury molecule 1 were quantified after 24\u2009hours.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCaffeine did not worsen RIAKI; although BUN was modestly increased by caffeine administration, 24-hour GFR, UOP, and renal histopathology were similar between vehicle-treated, caffeine-treated, and caffeine\u2009+\u2009PlasmaLyte-treated mice. Ibuprofen administration greatly worsened RIAKI (GFR 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u200919.5 vs. 577.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009454.6\u2009\u00b5L/min/100\u2009g in control, UOP 0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 in ibuprofen-treated mice vs. 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\u2009mL/24\u2009h in control, and BUN 264\u2009\u00b1\u2009201 in ibuprofen-treated mice vs. 66\u2009\u00b1\u200921\u2009mg/dL in control, P\u2009<\u2009.05 for all); PlasmaLyte treatment did not reverse this effect. Cilastatin with or without PlasmaLyte did not reverse the deleterious effect of ibuprofen in RIAKI.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCaffeine does not worsen RIAKI. The widely used performance-enhancing drug ibuprofen greatly worsens RIAKI in mice. Standard or experimental treatment of RIAKI including the addition of cilastatin to standard resuscitation is ineffective in mice with RIAKI exacerbated by ibuprofen. These findings may have clinical implications for the current therapy of RIAKI and for translational studies of novel treatment.",
