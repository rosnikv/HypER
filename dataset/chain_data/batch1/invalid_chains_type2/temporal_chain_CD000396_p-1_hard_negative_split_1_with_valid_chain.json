A concomitant double-blind investigation of the effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam was performed. The results measured by visual analog scale and Roland's functional tests showed a satisfactory improvement throughout the 4 weeks of observation. The piroxicam-treated group had same results as the control group. Based on questionnaires at months 3 and 12 approximately 30% of the patients still complained about back trouble and 19.5% were out of work after 1 year.

        "abstract": "The primary role of intervertebral disc as the tissue related to low back pain was confirmed 60 years ago when disc prolapses were described. Recent studies are providing more information on what other types of changes in discs can cause low back pain and how pain and clinical findings are related to disc herniations. This differs greatly from what the scientific community has generally accepted in the past and so it is evident that the new knowledge will change both diagnostic and treatment procedures. These new studies give very little, if any, support to the old methods of physical medicine in treating back pain as being anything more than palliative. However, the increased understanding of how cartilaginous tissues maintain, lose, or even improve their loading capacity supports active, dynamic rehabilitation which has led to good clinical results.",

Wedge compression fractures in vertebrae of children have been considered insignificant, but this has not been verified in the literature.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFourteen patients 8.8 to 20.8 years of age (mean, 15.5 years) with a history of wedge-shaped vertebral compression fracture at least 1 year previously (mean, 3.8 years) and asymptomatic healthy control subjects were studied by thoracolumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging. The patients also underwent a clinical examination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEight (57%) of the 14 patients had disc degeneration, and seven of them had it at the trauma level. Of these 7 subjects, 6 also had endplate damage at this level. The association between endplate damage and adjacent intervertebral disc degeneration was significant (P < 0.01). Only 2 of the patients were symptomatic. In the control group, only 1 subject had disc degeneration with endplate changes and disc herniation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe patients had more disc degeneration than did those in the control group. Endplate injury was strongly associated with disc degeneration. No correlation between previous vertebral fracture and back pain was seen in this study.",

ADC values and T2 relaxation times of both degenerated and normal intervertebral discs were compared to the values of 20 healthy young asymptomatic control subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the degenerated discs of patients, the ADCx and ADCy values were decreased compared to earlier determined values of healthy controls. ADC values in the z-direction in degenerated discs did not differ significantly from the values of controls. T2 relaxation times were shorter in the degenerated discs of patients compared to the values of controls. The greatest changes in both these values were observed in degenerated discs followed by discs with normal signal intensity adjacent to primary trauma area and secondary trauma area.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe suggest that decreased ADC values reflect the lost integrity of the intervertebral disc. ADC measurements at MR may prove sensitive depicting of early degenerative changes in vertebral discs.",

        "abstract": "The anisotropic, inhomogeneous, multiply collagenous architecture of the annulus reflects the complex pattern of mainly tensile stresses developed in this region of the disc during normal function. Structural and mechanical responses of fully hydrated in\u2010plane sections taken from within single lamellae of the outer annulus of healthy bovine caudal discs have been investigated using a micromechanical technique in combination with simultaneous high\u2010resolution differential interference contrast optical imaging. Responses both along and across (i.e. transverse to) the primary direction of the mono\u2010array of collagen fibres were studied. Stretching along the alignment direction revealed a biomechanical response consistent with the behaviour of an array whose overall strength is governed primarily by the strength of embedding of the fibres in the vertebral endplates, rather than from interfibre cohesion along their length. The mono\u2010aligned array, even when lacerated, is highly resistant to any further tearing across the alignment direction. Although not visible in the relaxed mono\u2010arrays, transverse stretching revealed a highly complex set of interconnecting structures embodying hierarchical relationships not previously revealed. It is suggested that these structures might play an important role in the containment under pressure of the nuclear contents. The dramatic differences in rupture behaviour observed along vs. across the primary fibre direction are consistent with the known clinical consequences arising from varying degrees of annular wall damage, and might also explain various types of disc herniation. The lamellar architecture of the healthy disc revealed by this investigation provides an important reference framework for exploring structural changes associated with disc trauma and degeneration.",

        "abstract": "The distribution of microfibrils was studied immunohistochemically in intervertebral discs taken from young normal human surgical cases and from the bovine tail. Co\u2010localization of microfibrils and elastin fibres was examined by dual immunostaining of fibrillin\u20101 and elastin. Collagen fibre network orientation was studied by using polarized filters. A similar microfibrillar network was seen in both bovine and human discs with network organization being completely different from region to region. In the outer annulus fibrosus (OAF), abundant microfibrils organized in bundles were mainly distributed in the interterritorial matrix. In addition, the microfibril bundles were orientated parallel to each other and co\u2010localized highly with elastin fibres. Within each lamella, co\u2010localized microfibrils and elastin fibres were aligned in the same direction as the collagen fibres. In the interlamellar space, a dense co\u2010localized network, staining for both microfibrils and elastin fibres, was apparent; immunostaining for both molecules was noticeably stronger than within lamellae. In the inner annulus fibrosus, the microfibrils were predominantly visible as a filamentous mesh network, both in the interterritorial matrix and also around the cells. The microfibrils in this region co\u2010localized with elastin fibres far less than in the OAF. In nucleus pulposus, filamentous microfibrils were organized mainly around the cells where elastin fibres were hardly detected. By contrast, sparse elastin fibres, with a few of microfibrils, were visible in the interterritorial matrix. The results of this study suggest the microfibrillar network of the annulus may play a mechanical role while that around the cells of the nucleus may be more involved in regulating cell function.",

        "abstract": "The highly organized structure and composition of the annulus fibrosus provides the tissue with mechanical behaviors that include anisotropy and nonlinearity. Mathematical models are necessary to interpret and elucidate the meaning of directly measured mechanical properties and to understand the structure-function relationships of the tissue components, namely, the fibers and extrafibrillar matrix. This study models the annulus fibrosus as a combination of strain energy functions describing the fibers, matrix, and their interactions. The objective was to quantify the behavior of both nondegenerate and degenerate annulus fibrosus tissue using uniaxial tensile experimental data. Mechanical testing was performed with samples oriented along the circumferential, axial, and radial directions. For samples oriented along the radial direction, the toe-region modulus was 2x stiffer with degeneration. However, no other differences in measured mechanical properties were observed with degeneration. The constitutive model fit well to samples oriented along the radial and circumferential directions (R(2)> or =0.97). The fibers supported the highest proportion of stress for circumferential loading at 60%. There was a 70% decrease in the matrix contribution to stress from the toe-region to the linear-region of both the nondegenerate and degenerate tissue. The shear fiber-matrix interaction (FMI) contribution increased by 80% with degeneration in the linear-region. Samples oriented along the radial and axial direction behaved similarly under uniaxial tension (modulus=0.32 MPa versus 0.37 MPa), suggesting that uniaxial testing in the axial direction is not appropriate for quantifying the mechanics of a fiber reinforcement in the annulus. In conclusion, the structurally motivated nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive model helps to further understand the effect of microstructural changes with degeneration, suggesting that remodeling in the subcomponents (i.e., the collagen fiber, matrix and FMI) may minimize the overall effects on mechanical function of the bulk material with degeneration.",

        "abstract": "Optic nerve head (ONH) deformations may be involved in the onset or further development of glaucoma, including in patients with relatively normal intraocular pressures (IOPs). Characterizing posterior scleral deformations over physiological pressures may provide a better understanding of how changes in IOP lead to changes in the mechanical environment of the ONH and possibly retinal ganglion cell death. Pressure inflation measurement test protocols are commonly used to measure deformation of the peripapillary sclera with full-field noncontact optical methods. The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a new sequential 3D digital image correlation (S-DIC) approach for quantification of posterior scleral pressure induced deformation that improves z (in-depth) resolution of the DIC measurement without losing in-plane sensitivity, while also being able to contour and map deformations of the complex-shaped ONH. Our approach combines two orthogonal axes of parallax with standard 3D DIC methods using a single high-resolution camera. The enhanced capabilities of S-DIC with respect to standard 3D DIC has been demonstrated by carrying out a complete benchmark for shape, deformation, and strain measurement on an object of known complex geometry. Our S-DIC method provided a reconstruction accuracy of 0.17% and an uncertainty in z-position measurement of 8\u2009\u03bcm. The developed methodology has also been applied to a human posterior scleral shell, including the full peripapillary sclera and optic nerve. The relatively inexpensive S-DIC approach may provide new information on the biomechanical deformations of the optic nerve head and, thus, the death of retinal ganglion cells in primary open angle glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Objective The biomechanical behavior of the sclera determines the level of mechanical insult from intraocular pressure to the axons and tissues of the optic nerve head, as is of interest in glaucoma. In this study, we measure the collagen fiber structure and the strain response, and estimate the material properties of glaucomatous and normal human donor scleras. Methods Twenty-two posterior scleras from normal and diagnosed glaucoma donors were obtained from an eyebank. Optic nerve cross-sections were graded to determine the presence of axon loss. The specimens were subjected to pressure-controlled inflation testing. Full-field displacement maps were measured by digital image correlation (DIC) and spatially differentiated to compute surface strains. Maps of the collagen fiber structure across the posterior sclera of each inflated specimen were obtained using synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Finite element (FE) models of the posterior scleras, incorporating a specimen-specific representation of the collagen structure, were constructed from the DIC-measured geometry. An inverse finite element analysis was developed to estimate the stiffness of the collagen fiber and inter-fiber matrix. Results The differences between glaucoma and non-glaucoma eyes were small in magnitude. Sectorial variations of degree of fiber alignment and peripapillary scleral strain significantly differed between normal and diagnosed glaucoma specimens. Meridional strains were on average larger in diagnosed glaucoma eyes compared with normal specimens. Non-glaucoma specimens had on average the lowest matrix and fiber stiffness, followed by undamaged glaucoma eyes, and damaged glaucoma eyes but the differences in stiffness were not significant. Conclusion The observed biomechanical and microstructural changes could be the result of tissue remodeling occuring in glaucoma and are likely to alter the mechanical environment of the optic nerve head and contribute to axonal damage.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Scleral stiffening has been proposed as a treatment for glaucoma to protect the lamina cribrosa (LC) from excessive intraocular pressure\u2013induced deformation. Here we experimentally evaluated the effects of moderate stiffening of the peripapillary sclera on the deformation of the LC. Methods An annular sponge, saturated with 1.25% glutaraldehyde, was applied to the external surface of the peripapillary sclera for 5 minutes to stiffen the sclera. Tissue deformation was quantified in two groups of porcine eyes, using digital image correlation (DIC) or computed tomography imaging and digital volume correlation (DVC). In group A (n = 14), eyes were subjected to inflation testing before and after scleral stiffening. Digital image correlation was used to measure scleral deformation and quantify the magnitude of scleral stiffening. In group B (n = 5), the optic nerve head region was imaged using synchrotron radiation phase-contrast microcomputed tomography (PC \u03bcCT) at an isotropic spatial resolution of 3.2 \u03bcm. Digital volume correlation was used to compute the full-field three-dimensional deformation within the LC and evaluate the effects of peripapillary scleral cross-linking on LC biomechanics. Results On average, scleral treatment with glutaraldehyde caused a 34 \u00b1 14% stiffening of the peripapillary sclera measured at 17 mm Hg and a 47 \u00b1 12% decrease in the maximum tensile strain in the LC measured at 15 mm Hg. The reduction in LC strains was not due to cross-linking of the LC. Conclusions Peripapillary scleral stiffening is effective at reducing the magnitude of biomechanical strains within the LC.

Methods We extended a previously published numerical model of the ONH to include 24 factors representing tissue anatomy and mechanical properties, all three pressures, and constraints on the optic nerve (CON). A total of 8340 models were studied to predict factor influences on 98 responses in a two-step process: a fractional factorial screening analysis to identify the 16 most influential factors, followed by a response surface methodology to predict factor effects in detail. Results The six most influential factors were, in order: IOP, CON, moduli of the sclera, lamina cribrosa (LC) and dura, and CSFP. IOP and CSFP affected different aspects of ONH biomechanics. The strongest influence of CSFP, more than twice that of IOP, was on the rotation of the peripapillary sclera. CSFP had similar influence on LC stretch and compression to moduli of sclera and LC. On some ONHs, CSFP caused large retrolamina deformations and subarachnoid expansion. CON had a strong influence on LC displacement. BP overall influence was 633 times smaller than that of IOP. Conclusions Models predict that IOP and CSFP are the top and sixth most influential factors on ONH biomechanics. Different IOP and CSFP effects suggest that translaminar pressure difference may not be a good parameter to predict biomechanics-related glaucomatous neuropathy. CON may drastically affect the responses relating to gross ONH geometry and should be determined experimentally.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To measure the deformation of the human optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary tissue (PPT) in response to acute intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. Methods The ONH and PPT of 14 human donor globes were imaged with high-frequency ultrasonography during inflation testing from 5 to 30 mm Hg. A correlation-based speckle tracking algorithm was used to compute tissue displacements, and the through-thickness, in-plane, and shear strains were calculated by using least-squares strain estimation methods. The ONH and PPT were segmented along the anterior-posterior direction and the nasal-temporal direction. Regional displacements and strains were analyzed and compared. Results The ONH displaced more posteriorly than the PPT in response to an acute IOP increase. Scleral canal expansion was minimal but correlated with ONH posterior displacement at all IOP levels. Through-thickness compression was concentrated in the anterior of both the ONH and the PPT. Shear was concentrated in the vicinity of the canal with higher shear in the peripheral ONH than the central ONH and higher shear in the PPT near the scleral canal than that further away from the canal. Conclusions High-resolution ultrasound speckle tracking showed a displacement mismatch between the ONH and the PPT, larger compressive strains in the direction of IOP loading in the anterior ONH and PPT, and higher shear strains in the periphery of ONH in response to acute IOP elevation in the human eye.

        "title": "Modeling the Biomechanics of the Lamina Cribrosa Microstructure in the Human Eye",
        "abstract": "Glaucoma is among the leading causes of blindness worldwide that is characterized by irreversible damage to the retinal ganglion cell axons in the lamina cribrosa (LC) region of the optic nerve head (ONH), most often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The LC is a porous, connective tissue structure that provides mechanical support to the axons as they exit the eye and the biomechanics of the LC microstructure likely play a crucial role in protecting the axons passing through it. There is a limited knowledge of the IOP-driven biomechanics of the LC microstructure, primarily due to its small size and the difficulty with imaging the LC both in vitro and in vivo. We present finite element (FE) models of three human eye posterior poles that include the LC microstructure and interspersed neural tissues (NT) composed of retinal axons that are constructed directly from segmented, binary images of the LC. These models were used to estimate the stresses and strains in the LC and NT for an acute IOP elevation from 0 to 45 mmHg and compared with identical models except that the LC was represented as a homogenized continuum material with either homogeneous isotropic neo-Hookean properties or heterogeneous properties derived from local connective tissue volume fraction (CTVF) and predominant LC beam orientation. Stresses and strains in the LC and NT microstructure were investigated, and results were compared against those from the models wherein the LC was represented as a homogenized continuum. The regionalized volumetric average stresses and strains showed that the microstructural model yielded similar patterns to our prior approach using an LC continuum representation with mapped LC CTVF/anisotropy, but the microstructural modeling approach allows analysis of the stresses and strains in the LC and NT separately. As expected, the LC beams carried most of the IOP load in the microstructural models but exhibited less strain, while the encapsulated NT exhibited lower stresses and much higher strains. Results also revealed that the continuum models underestimate the maximum strains in the LC beams and NT by a factor of 2-3. Microstructural modeling should provide greater insight into the biomechanical factors driving damage to the axons (NT) and LC connective tissue remodeling that occur in glaucoma. The methods presented are ideal for modeling any structure with a complex microstructure composed of different materials, such as trabecular bone, lung, and tissue engineering scaffolds such as decellularized LC. Matlab code for mesh generation from a segmented image stack of the microstructure is included as Supplemental Material.",

The paper's focus on the lamina cribrosa microstructure and its response to IOP elevation is partially dependent on the understanding of the mechanical deformation of the ONH and peripapillary tissue presented in the source paper."

        "abstract": "Purpose The laminar region of the optic nerve head (ONH), thought to be the site of damage to the retinal ganglion cell axons in glaucoma, is continuously loaded on its anterior and posterior surfaces by dynamic intraocular pressure (IOP) and orbital cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), respectively. Thus, translaminar pressure (TLP; TLP = IOP-CSFP) has been proposed as a glaucoma risk factor. Methods Three eye-specific finite element models of the posterior human eye were constructed, including full 3D microstructures of the load-bearing lamina cribrosa (LC) with interspersed laminar neural tissues (NTs), and heterogeneous, anisotropic, hyperelastic material formulations for the surrounding peripapillary sclera and adjacent pia. ONH biomechanical responses were simulated using three combinations of IOP and CSFP loadings consistent with posture change from sitting to supine. Results Results show that tensile, compressive, and shear stresses and strains in the ONH were higher in the supine position compared to the sitting position (P < 0.05). In addition, LC beams bear three to five times more TLP-driven stress than interspersed laminar NT, whereas laminar NT exhibit three to five times greater strain than supporting LC (P < 0.05). Compared with CSFP, IOP drove approximately four times greater stress and strain in the LC, NT, and peripapillary sclera, normalized per mm Hg pressure change. In addition, IOP drove approximately three-fold greater scleral canal expansion and anterior-posterior laminar deformation than CSFP per mm Hg (P < 0.05). Conclusions Whereas TLP has been hypothesized to play a prominent role in ONH biomechanics, the IOP and CSFP effects are not equivalent, as IOP-driven stress, strain, and deformation play a more dominant role than CSFP effects.",

        "title": "Biomechanical Strain Responses in the Optic Nerve Head Region in Glaucoma Patients After Intraocular Pressure Lowering",
        "abstract": "Objective To measure strain values and their association with intraocular pressure (IOP) change across five posterior eye regions in glaucoma patients. Design Cohort study. Participants Glaucoma patients who were imaged with optical coherence tomography (OCT) prior to and after laser suturelysis following trabeculectomy surgery (29 image pairs, 26 persons) Intervention Noninvasive imaging of the eye. Main Outcomes Strain values in eye regions. Results Mean strains were lowest in the retina and highest in the prelaminar neural tissue (PLNT) for Emax, {Gamma}max, and Ezz. The values of Emax in the anterior lamina cribrosa (ALC) and sclera were significantly related (P=0.0094, linear regression). Higher axial strain (Ezz) was significantly associated with greater IOP decrease in the ALC, PLNT, and retina (P<0.05). Higher {Gamma}max and Emax strains were significantly associated with greater IOP decreases across all 5 eye regions. ALC and PLNT had negative median radial (Err) compliance, while sclera had positive Err compliance (P=0.017). Emax and {Gamma}max strains of the ALC were significantly and positively associated with these strains in the other 4 regions (P<0.005). Likewise, the Ezz of ALC had a significant positive relationship with the other 4 regions (P<0.05). Conclusions Regional strains in the optic nerve head zone can be effectively measured using OCT and are related to the magnitude of IOP change. Strains were largest in PLNT and ALC and were smallest in retina. The sclera and choroid on average expand radially and circumferentially indicating a volume increase with IOP lowering.",
