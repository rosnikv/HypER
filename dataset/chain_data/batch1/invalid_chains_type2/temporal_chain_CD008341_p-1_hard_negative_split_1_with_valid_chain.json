        "title": "Non-infectious pulmonary complications of newer biological agents for rheumatic diseases--a systematic literature review.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewAdvances in genetics and clinical diagnostics, along with recently described clinical entities and refined classification schemes, have improved our understanding of diffuse and interstitial lung diseases in children. This review presents recent updates in these disorders in the context of systemic inflammatory conditions. Recent findingsClassification of childhood diffuse lung disease (DLD) using adult paradigms is not useful. Distinct clinical\u2013pathologic entities exist in children. Infants are more likely to present with genetic and developmental disorders, and older children with inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions. A combination of clinical evaluation, high-resolution computed tomography scanning, pulmonary function testing and serology, with bronchoscopy and surgical lung biopsy in selected cases, is most useful in the evaluation of DLD in the context of rheumatologic conditions. Common causes of DLD, such as infection, especially in the setting of immunodeficiency, must be ruled out. Optimal therapy for specific disorders will require careful analysis of data from national registries. Emerging use of biomarkers and high-throughput molecular analysis will yield novel insight into these disorders. SummaryIn the setting of known or suspected rheumatologic disorders, diagnosis and management of DLD are challenging, and require close collaboration among rheumatologists, pulmonologists, and other specialists.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the characteristics and risk factors of a novel parenchymal lung disease (LD), increasingly detected in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Methods In a multicentre retrospective study, 61 cases were investigated using physician-reported clinical information and centralised analyses of radiological, pathological and genetic data. Results LD was associated with distinctive features, including acute erythematous clubbing and a high frequency of anaphylactic reactions to the interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab. Serum ferritin elevation and/or significant lymphopaenia preceded LD detection. The most prevalent chest CT pattern was septal thickening, involving the periphery of multiple lobes \u00b1 ground-glass opacities. The predominant pathology (23 of 36) was pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), with atypical features including regional involvement and concomitant vascular changes. Apparent severe delayed drug hypersensitivity occurred in some cases. The 5-year survival was 42%. Whole exome sequencing (20 of 61) did not identify a novel monogenic defect or likely causal PAP-related or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-related mutations. Trisomy 21 and young sJIA onset increased LD risk. Exposure to IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors (46 of 61) was associated with multiple LD features. By several indicators, severity of sJIA was comparable in drug-exposed subjects and published sJIA cohorts. MAS at sJIA onset was increased in the drug-exposed, but was not associated with LD features. Conclusions A rare, life-threatening lung disease in sJIA is defined by a constellation of unusual clinical characteristics. The pathology, a PAP/ELP variant, suggests macrophage dysfunction. Inhibitor exposure may promote LD, independent of sJIA severity, in a small subset of treated patients. Treatment/prevention strategies are needed.",

        "title": "Effectiveness and Safety of JAK Inhibitors in Autoinflammatory Diseases: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Introduction Autoinflammatory diseases (AID) are rare diseases presenting with episodes of sterile inflammation. These involve multiple organs and can cause both acute organ damage and serious long-term effects, like amyloidosis. Disease-specific anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies are established for some AID. However, their clinical course frequently includes relapsing, uncontrolled conditions. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) block key cytokines of AID pathogenesis and can be a potential option. Methods A systematic review of the literature in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Three databases (MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for publications regarding the use of JAKi for AID. Data from the included publications was extracted and a narrative synthesis was performed. Criteria for defining treatment response were defined and applied. Results We report data from 38 publications with a total of 101 patients describing the effects of JAKi in AID. Data on Type I Interferonopathies, Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD), Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), and Beh\u00e7et's Syndrome (BS) was identified. From a total of 52 patients with type I interferonopathies, in seven patients (7/52, 13.5%) a complete response was achieved, most (35/52, 67.3%) showed a partial response and a minority (10/52, 19.2%) showed no treatment response. For AOSD, a complete or a partial response was achieved by eleven (11/26, 42.3%) patients each. Two sJIA patients achieved complete response (2/4, 50%) and in two cases (2/4, 50%) a partial response was reported. Half of FMF patients showed a complete response and the other half had a partial one (3/6, 50.0%). Amongst BS patients most achieved a partial response (8/13, 61.5%). Five patients showed no response to therapy (5/13, 38.5%). Overall, the most frequent AEs were upper respiratory tract infections (17), pneumonia (10), BK virus viremia (10) and viruria (4), herpes zoster infection (5), viral gastroenteritis (2) and other infections (4). Conclusion The results from this systematic review show that JAKi can be beneficial in certain AID. The risk of AEs, especially viral infections, should be considered. To accurately assess the risk benefit ratio of JAKi for AID, clinical trials should be conducted.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of targeted therapies for cytokine-dependent diseases has led to the discovery of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, a promising class of drugs. Among them, CPL409116, a selective dual JAK and rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (ROCK), has demonstrated potential for treating conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated the feasibility of delivering CPL409116 via inhalation, with the aim of minimizing the systemic adverse effects associated with oral administration. Two micronization methods, jet milling and spray drying, were assessed for CPL409116, with spray drying chosen for its ability to produce an amorphous form of the compound. Moreover, parameters such as the mixing energy, drug load, and force control agent significantly influenced the fine particle fraction (FPF), a critical parameter for pulmonary drug delivery. This study provides insights into optimizing the formulation parameters to enhance the delivery efficiency of CPL409116 to the lungs, offering potential for improved therapeutic outcomes in cytokine-dependent pulmonary diseases.",
