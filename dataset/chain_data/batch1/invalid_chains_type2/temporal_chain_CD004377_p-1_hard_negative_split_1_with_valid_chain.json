Thirty-two patients with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis and wrist involvement were evaluated. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was better than the placebo in relieving pain at rest and while gripping. In addition, grip strength, measured as power and work done, immediately improved following transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation but returned almost to initial values between assessments. No significant improvement was shown for the placebo group.",

        "title": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment outcome in long-term users.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPrevious reviewers of the literature on transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) outcome have concluded the following: (a) there are few long-term TENS follow-up studies, and (b) fewer studies have addressed the effect of long-term TENS use on outcome variables other than pain (e.g., function). DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/OUTCOME MEASURES: From a population of 2,003 chronic pain patients (CPPs) who bought a TENS device for pain management, 506 patients were randomly selected and interviewed by telephone long enough after purchase to allow at least 6 months of TENS use. The interview process used a structured \"skip\" questionnaire designed to assess the CPPs' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of TENS for a variety of outcome variables. Of the 506 CPPs interviewed, 376 (74.3%) had used their TENS device for 6 months or longer and were defined as long-term users. The responses of this group of CPPs to the telephone questionnaire were then subjected to statistical analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPaired t-tests, correlated z-tests, SS Wilks, and chi-square tests demonstrated statistically significant change or improvement (p < 0.05) that paralleled the introduction of TENS use in the following outcome variables: less pain interference with work, home, and social activities; increased activity level and pain management; decreased use of other therapies (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, chiropractic); decreased use of narcotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that TENS is associated with improvement on multiple outcome variables in addition to pain relief for CPPs who are long-term users. Also, for some CPPs, long-term TENS use continues to be effective.",

        "title": "Long-term transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) use: impact on medication utilization and physical therapy costs.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nA study was conducted to assess a variety of treatment outcomes in long-term users of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) who suffer from chronic pain. Key components of the study examined the effects of long-term TENS therapy on pain-related medications and physical/occupational therapy (PT/OT) use.\n\n\nDESIGN\nFrom a population of 2,(X)3 chronic pain patients (CPPs) who acquired a TENS device (Epix XL, Empi, Inc., St. Paul, MN, U.S.A.) for pain management, a randomly selected sample of 376 patients who used TENS were interviewed by telephone by an independent research firm. The survey assessed a variety of outcome variables including changes in medication use, number of pain-related medications, and use of PT/OT prior to TENS and after a minimum 6 months of TENS treatment. The data were subjected to a paired t test analysis. A cost simulation model was then applied to the medication and PT/OT data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean duration of pain, for which TENS was prescribed, was 40 +/- 60 months. As compared with the period prior to TENS use, this long-term TENS user group reported a statistically significant reduction in the following types of pain medications: opiate analgesics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids. PT/OT use was also significantly reduced. Cost simulations of pain medications and PT/OT are presented.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term use of TENS is associated with a significant reduction in the utilization of pain medication and PT/OT. In this study population, cost simulations of medication and PT/OT indicate that with long-term TENS use, costs can be reduced up to 55% for medications and up to 69% for PT/OT. The potential for TENS associated improvement, combined with reduced medication-related complications and costs, are important points that clinicians should consider when constructing a treatment plan for chronic pain patients. Finally, cost simulation techniques provide a useful tool for assessing outcomes in pain treatment and research.",

The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, using them as a sub-hypothesis to explore the economic implications of long-term TENS use."

        "title": "Non-surgical chronic pain treatment outcome: a review",
        "abstract": "Meta-analyses (MAs) of non-surgical chronic pain treatment studies were systematically reviewed to determine effectiveness. Twenty-four MAs were found relating to non-surgical, non-malignant, non-headache chronic pain treatment. Two natural groupings, pain facility treatment and specific pain treatments, were created. In addition, a number of the MAs examined the same treatments including pain facility treatments, manipulation, capsaicin, acupuncture, antidepressants, back school, physical therapy, and cognitive behavior treatments. MAs addressing the same treatments were reviewed for replicate variability or reliability of results, thereby allowing some conclusions about the consistency of this type of data. The following treatments were consistently effective demonstrating replicate non-variability or reliability: pain facility treatment, capsaicin, anti-depressants, physical therapy, topical NSAIDs, and cognitive behavioral treatments. Only one MA demonstrated the effectiveness of anticonvulsants and psychoeducational. Potential problems with the reviewed MAs and cost effectiveness of treatment are discussed. Finally, potential future initiatives in this area of research are presented. Although pain facility treatment and a number of specific pain treatments are consistently demonstrated to be effective, at the present time, it is impossible to isolate a set of 'effective treatments' within the pain facility treatment package.",
