        "abstract": "Deconditioning is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The physiology of vascular adaptation to deconditioning has not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of bed rest deconditioning on vascular dimension and function of leg conduit arteries. In addition, the effectiveness of resistive vibration exercise as a countermeasure for vascular deconditioning during bed rest was evaluated. Sixteen healthy men were randomly assigned to bed rest (BR-Ctrl) or to bed rest with resistive vibration exercise (BR-RVE). Before and after 25 and 52 days of strict horizontal bed rest, arterial diameter, blood flow, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation were measured by echo Doppler ultrasound. In the BR-Ctrl group, the diameter of the common femoral artery decreased by 13 +/- 3% after 25 and 17 +/- 1% after 52 days of bed rest (P < 0.001). In the BR-RVE group this decrease in diameter was significantly attenuated (5 +/- 2% after 25 days and 6 +/- 2% after 52 days, P < 0.01 vs. BR-Ctrl). Baseline blood flow did not change after bed rest in either group. After 52 days of bed rest, FMD and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation of the superficial femoral artery were increased in both groups, possibly by increased nitric oxide sensitivity. In conclusion, bed rest deconditioning is accompanied by a reduction in the diameter of the conduit arteries and by an increased reactivity to nitric oxide. Resistive vibration exercise effectively attenuates the diameter decrease of leg conduit arteries after bed rest.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background/Objective: Orthostatic hypotension is a well-defined clinical consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly in those with tetraplegia. The etiology of orthostatic hypotension is thought to be loss of sympathetic vasomotor control, although other factors may play a role. There is evidence of up-regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity after hind-limb suspension in rats, a condition of antigravity that may have similar vascular effects as shown in persons with tetraplegia caused by paralysis. The study objective was to determine the effect of a NOS inhibitor (nitro-L-arginine methyl ester [L-NAME]) on supine mean arterial pressure in persons with chronic tetraplegia compared with non-SCI controls. Methods: Fourteen individuals participated (7 with tetraplegia and 7 controls). Subjects visited the laboratory twice for placebo on day 1 and L-NAME (1 mg/kg) on day 2; both were infused intravenously over 60 minutes. Blood pressure was monitored for 3 hours after infusion at the brachial artery using a standard manual cuff. Results: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lower at baseline (P < 0.05) and after placebo administration (P < 0.0001) in the tetraplegia group compared with the control group. L-NAME increased MAP in both groups; however, the relative increase was greater in the tetraplegia group compared with the control group, such that group differences for MAP were eliminated. Supine MAP was normalized with L-NAME, and there was an increased sensitivity to NOS inhibition in the group with tetraplegia. Conclusions: These findings indicate that blood pressure dysregulation in persons with tetraplegia may reflect increased vascular NO and suggest a novel treatment of hypotension using NOS inhibition in this population.",

        "title": "Effect of Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibition on Intrarenal Oxygenation as Evaluated by Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Magnetic Resonance Imaging",
        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the feasibility of studying renal effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibition (NOSi) in humans by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Nitric oxide (NO) is known to play a key role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and previous reports suggest reduced bioavailability of NO in the kidneys of hypertensive rats and hence show reduced response to NOSi using BOLD MRI. Ability to perform similar studies in humans could potentially lead to detection of early changes before development of symptoms, and to monitor novel interventions targeted toward improved NO bioavailability. The specific goals for this study were: (1) to examine whether lower doses and dose rate of administration of NOSi such as those previously used in humans can be detected by BOLD MRI in rat kidneys, (2) to compare changes in R2* to direct measures of renal medullary oxygen levels and blood flow using invasive probes (OxyLite/OxyFlo), and (3) to examine for the first time the effect of NOSi on intrarenal oxygenation in humans. Material and Methods:In rat kidneys, acute changes in renal tissue oxygenation induced by different doses (2, 4, and 10 mg/kg) of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester were studied in 36 Sprague Dawley rats, which were equally divided into BOLD MRI and OxyLite/OxyFlo groups. Similarly in humans, acute changes in renal oxygenation were induced by 2 different NOS inhibitors NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (4.25 mg/kg) in 7 volunteers and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) in 6 healthy young volunteers. A multiple gradient echo sequence was used in both rats (TE = 4.4\u201357.8 milliseconds with 3.6 milliseconds interecho spacing) and humans (TE = 6.4\u201340.8 milliseconds with a 2.3 milliseconds interecho spacing) to acquire 16 T2*-weighted images. R2* maps were constructed by fitting a single exponential decay to the image data on pixel by pixel basis. R2* measurements in the cortex and medulla were performed by regions of interest analysis. Measurements were performed before and during infusion of NOSi. Results:In rats, NOSi decreased medullary pO2 and blood flow in a dose-dependent manner, and BOLD MRI showed an increase in medullary R2* consistent with the invasive pO2 measurements. In humans, BOLD MRI similarly showed an increase in medullary and cortical R2* after NOSi in a dose-dependent manner. In both rats and humans, the R2* values fell back toward baseline before the end of the infusion period. Conclusion:Comparison of BOLD MRI measurements with those using invasive probes suggests that changes in blood flow are at least partly responsible for observed changes with BOLD MRI. Monitoring changes after NOSi by renal BOLD MRI in vivo in human kidneys are feasible, and preliminary findings are consistent with observations in rat kidneys. Future studies are warranted to fully understand the apparent reversal in R2* changes during the infusion of NOSi.",

        "abstract": "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a consequence of kidney hypoperfusion or temporary interruption of blood flow is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). There is an unmet need to better understand the mechanisms operative during the initial phase of ischemic AKI. Non-invasive in vivo parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may elucidate spatio-temporal pathophysiological changes in the kidney by monitoring the MR relaxation parameters T2* and T2, which are known to be sensitive to blood oxygenation. The aim of our study was to establish the technical feasibility of fast continuous T2*/T2 mapping throughout renal I/R. MRI was combined with a remotely controlled I/R model and a segmentation model based semi-automated quantitative analysis. This technique enabled the detailed assessment of in vivo changes in all kidney regions during ischemia and early reperfusion. Significant changes in T2* and T2 were observed shortly after induction of renal ischemia and during the initial reperfusion phase. Our study demonstrated for the first time that continuous and high temporal resolution parametric MRI is feasible for in-vivo monitoring and characterization of I/R induced AKI in rats.

        "abstract": "ObjectivesThis study was designed to detail the relation between renal T2* and renal tissue pO2 using an integrated approach that combines parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative physiological measurements (MR-PHYSIOL). Materials and MethodsExperiments were performed in 21 male Wistar rats. In vivo modulation of renal hemodynamics and oxygenation was achieved by brief periods of aortic occlusion, hypoxia, and hyperoxia. Renal perfusion pressure (RPP), renal blood flow (RBF), local cortical and medullary tissue pO2, and blood flux were simultaneously recorded together with T2*, T2 mapping, and magnetic resonance\u2013based kidney size measurements (MR-PHYSIOL). Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out on a 9.4-T small-animal magnetic resonance system. Relative changes in the invasive quantitative parameters were correlated with relative changes in the parameters derived from MRI using Spearman analysis and Pearson analysis. ResultsChanges in T2* qualitatively reflected tissue pO2 changes induced by the interventions. T2* versus pO2 Spearman rank correlations were significant for all interventions, yet quantitative translation of T2*/pO2 correlations obtained for one intervention to another intervention proved not appropriate. The closest T2*/pO2 correlation was found for hypoxia and recovery. The interlayer comparison revealed closest T2*/pO2 correlations for the outer medulla and showed that extrapolation of results obtained for one renal layer to other renal layers must be made with due caution. For T2* to RBF relation, significant Spearman correlations were deduced for all renal layers and for all interventions. T2*/RBF correlations for the cortex and outer medulla were even superior to those between T2* and tissue pO2. The closest T2*/RBF correlation occurred during hypoxia and recovery. Close correlations were observed between T2* and kidney size during hypoxia and recovery and for occlusion and recovery. In both cases, kidney size correlated well with renal vascular conductance, as did renal vascular conductance with T2*. Our findings indicate that changes in T2* qualitatively mirror changes in renal tissue pO2 but are also associated with confounding factors including vascular volume fraction and tubular volume fraction. ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that MR-PHYSIOL is instrumental to detail the link between renal tissue pO2 and T2* in vivo. Unravelling the link between regional renal T2* and tissue pO2, including the role of the T2* confounding parameters vascular and tubular volume fraction and oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve, requires further research. These explorations are essential before the quantitative capabilities of parametric MRI can be translated from experimental research to improved clinical understanding of hemodynamics/oxygenation in kidney disorders.",

Materials and MethodsThe study included 15 matched pairs of renal transplant donors and recipients. Arterial spin labeling and BOLD MRI of the kidneys were performed on donors before transplant surgery (baseline) and on both donors and recipients at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after transplant. After 3 months, 7 of the 15 recipients were prescribed 25 to 50 mg/d losartan for the remainder of the study. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate perfusion, R2*, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and fractional excretion of sodium for changes across time or associated with losartan treatment. ResultsIn donors, cortical perfusion in the remaining kidney decreased by 50 \u00b1 19 mL/min per 100 g (11.8%) between baseline and 2 years (P < 0.05), while cortical R2* declined modestly by 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 s\u22121 (5.6%; P < 0.05). In transplanted kidneys, cortical perfusion decreased markedly by 141 \u00b1 21 mL/min per 100 g (34.2%) between baseline and 2 years (P < 0.001), while medullary R2* declined by 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 s\u22121 (8.3%; P = 0.06). Single-kidney estimated glomerular filtration rate increased between baseline and 2 years by 17.7 \u00b1 2.7 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (40.3%; P < 0.0001) in donors and to 14.6 \u00b1 4.3 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (33.3%; P < 0.01) in recipients. Cortical perfusion at 1 and 2 years in recipients receiving 25 to 50 mg/d losartan was 62 \u00b1 24 mL/min per 100 g higher than recipients not receiving the drug (P < 0.05). No significant effects of losartan were observed for any other markers of renal function. ConclusionsThe results suggest an important role for noninvasive functional monitoring with ASL and BOLD MRI in kidney transplant recipients and donors, and they indicate a potentially beneficial effect of losartan in recipients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRenal flow abnormalities are believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of nephropathy and in primary and secondary hypertension, but are difficult to measure in humans. Handgrip exercise is known to reduce renal arterial flow (RAF) by means of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo monitor medullary and cortical oxygenation under handgrip exercise-reduced perfusion, we used contrast- and radiation-free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure regional changes in renal perfusion and blood oxygenation in ten healthy normotensive individuals during handgrip exercise. We used phase-contrast MRI to measure RAF, arterial spin labeling to measure perfusion, and both changes in transverse relaxation time (T2*) and dynamic blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging to measure blood oxygenation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHandgrip exercise induced a significant decrease in RAF. In the renal medulla, this was accompanied by an increase of oxygenation (reflected by an increase in T2*) despite a significant drop in medullary perfusion; the renal cortex showed a significant decrease in both perfusion and oxygenation. We also found a significant correlation (R 2=0.8) between resting systolic BP and the decrease in RAF during handgrip exercise.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRenal MRI measurements in response to handgrip exercise were consistent with a sympathetically mediated decrease in RAF. In the renal medulla, oxygenation increased despite a reduction in perfusion, which we interpreted as the result of decreased GFR and a subsequently reduced reabsorptive workload. Our results further indicate that the renal flow response's sensitivity to sympathetic activation is correlated with resting BP, even within a normotensive range.",

By applying a vibratory force, tissue shear wave stiffness can be measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) that may correlate with progression of kidney fibrosis. Since decreased kidney perfusion decreases tissue turgor and stiffness, we combined newly available three-dimensional MRE shear stiffness measurements with MR arterial spin labeling (ASL) kidney blood flow rates to evaluate fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty individuals with diabetes and Stage 0-5 CKD and 13 control individuals without CKD underwent noncontrast MRE with concurrent ASL blood flow measurements.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMRE cortical shear stiffness at 90\u2009Hz was decreased significantly below controls in all CKD stages of diabetic nephropathy. Likewise, ASL blood flow decreased progressively from 480\u2009\u00b1\u2009136\u2009mL/min/100\u2009g of cortical tissue in controls to 302\u2009\u00b1\u200995, 229\u2009\u00b1\u20097 and 152\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u2009mL/min/100\u2009g in Stages 3, 4 and 5 CKD, respectively.

        "abstract": "Background: Renal fibrosis is a key driver of progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques have shown promising results for the noninvasive assessment of renal fibrosis. However, the specificity and accuracy of these techniques are controversial because they indirectly assess renal fibrosis. This limits fibrosis assessment by imaging in CKD for clinical practice. To validate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment for fibrosis, we derived representative models by mapping histology-proven renal fibrosis and imaging in CKD. Methods: Ninety-seven adult Chinese CKD participants with histology were studied. The kidney cortex interstitial extracellular matrix volume was calculated by the Aperio ScanScope system using Masson\u2019s trichrome slices. The kidney cortex microcirculation was quantitatively assessed by peritubular capillary density using CD34 staining. The imaging techniques included intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) imaging. Relevant analyses were performed to evaluate the correlations between MRI parameters and histology variables. Multiple linear regression models were used to describe the relationships between a response variable and other variables. The best-fit lines, which minimize the sum of squared residuals of the multiple linear regression models, were generated. Results: MRE values were negatively associated with the interstitial extracellular matrix volume (Rho = \u22120.397, p < 0.001). The best mapping model of extracellular matrix volume with the MRE value and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) we obtained was as follows: Interstitial extracellular matrix volume = 218.504 \u2013 14.651 \u00d7 In(MRE) \u2013 18.499 \u00d7 In(eGFR). DWI-fraction values were positively associated with peritubular capillary density (Rho = 0.472, p < 0.001). The best mapping model of peritubular capillary density with DWI-fraction value and eGFR was as follows: Peritubular capillaries density = 17.914 + 9.403 \u00d7 (DWI \u2013 fraction) + 0.112 \u00d7 (eGFR). Conclusions: The study provides histological evidence to support that MRI can effectively evaluate fibrosis in the kidney.

Mean magnetic resonance elastography\u2013derived stiffness displays high interpatient variability, even in allografts without significant fibrosis, suggesting a strong influence of confounding factors. Visual Abstract Background Fibrosis progression is a major prognosis factor in kidney transplantation. Its assessment requires an allograft biopsy, which remains an invasive procedure at risk of complications. Methods We assessed renal stiffness by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) as a surrogate marker of fibrosis in a prospective cohort of kidney transplant recipients compared with the histologic gold standard. Interstitial fibrosis was evaluated by three methods: the semi-quantitative Banff ci score, a visual quantitative evaluation by a pathologist, and a computer-assisted quantitative evaluation. MRE-derived stiffness was assessed at the superior, median, and inferior poles of the allograft. Results We initially enrolled 73 patients, but only 55 had measurements of their allograft stiffness by MRE before an allograft biopsy. There was no significant correlation between MRE-derived stiffness at the biopsy site and the ci score (\u03c1=\u20130.25, P=0.06) or with the two quantitative assessments (pathologist: \u03c1=\u20130.25, P=0.07; computer assisted: \u03c1=\u20130.21, P=0.12).

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a slowly progressive condition characterized by decreased kidney function, tubular injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation. CKD is a leading global health burden that is asymptomatic in early stages but can ultimately cause kidney failure. Its etiology is complex and involves dysregulated signaling pathways that lead to fibrosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is a central mediator in promoting transdifferentiation of polarized renal tubular epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, resulting in irreversible kidney injury. While current therapies are limited, the search for more effective diagnostic and treatment modalities is intensive. Although biopsy with histology is the most accurate method of diagnosis and staging, imaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and shear wave elastography ultrasound are less invasive ways to stage fibrosis. Current therapies such as renin-angiotensin blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors aim to delay progression. Newer antifibrotic agents that suppress the downstream inflammatory mediators involved in the fibrotic process are in clinical trials, and potential therapeutic targets that interfere with TGF-\u03b2 signaling are being explored. Small interfering RNAs and stem cell-based therapeutics are also being evaluated. Further research and clinical studies are necessary in order to avoid dialysis and kidney transplantation.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses fibrosis in chronic kidney disease, its pathophysiology, and therapeutic targets. Although it doesn't directly build upon the source paper, it shares a common theme of fibrosis, which is relevant to the source paper's investigation of interstitial fibrosis in kidney transplantation. However, it does not explicitly use the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis or inspiration for its hypothesis."
