        "abstract": "No effective medical therapy is available for all patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been suggested to be of benefit based on open label clinical studies. We randomized 166 patients with liver biopsy\u2013proven NASH to receive between 13 and 15 mg/kg/d of UDCA or placebo for 2 years. End points included changes in liver test results and liver histology at 2 years of therapy. The treatment groups were comparable at entry with regard to age, gender, risk factors for NASH, serum liver biochemistries, and baseline liver histology. A total of 126 patients completed 2 years of therapy. Pre\u2010 and posttreatment liver biopsies were available in 107 patients for review at the end of the study. UDCA was well tolerated and body weight was stable during the study duration. Serum liver biochemistries were stable or improved in both the UDCA and placebo\u2010treated groups. Changes in the degree of steatosis, necroinflammation, or fibrosis that occurred with therapy were not significantly different between the UDCA and placebo groups. In conclusion, 2 years of therapy with UDCA at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/d, although safe and well tolerated, is not better than placebo for patients with NASH. (HEPATOLOGY 2004;39:770\u2013778.)",

        "title": "Correlation of paired liver biopsies in morbidly obese patients with suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease",
        "abstract": "In the absence of surrogate markers, the evaluation of suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly dependent on histological examination. The extent of sampling variability affecting the reliability of a single liver biopsy in patients with suspected NAFLD is poorly characterized. This prospective study aimed to correlate precise histological findings in paired biopsies\u2014right and left lobe\u2014in the diagnosis of NAFLD in morbidly obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery employing both Brunt and Matteoni classifications and the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). We also aimed to determine whether the composite histopathological findings of the two biopsies would improve diagnostic accuracy. Consecutive subjects had an intraoperative biopsy from both right and left lobes, evaluated and scored in a blinded manner. Intraobserver agreement was also assessed. Kappa coefficients of agreement were calculated. Forty\u2010one subjects had acceptable biopsies. Agreement for steatosis was excellent and moderate for fibrosis. Concordance was only fair for most features of necroinflammation. Intraobserver agreement was only moderate for lobular inflammation. Excellent agreement was seen for the diagnosis of NASH using Brunt criteria and good agreement when using Matteoni and NAS scoring systems. Composite biopsy data particularly improved identification of hepatocyte ballooning. The diagnostic accuracy also improved substantially when composite features were compared with single\u2010sided biopsy features, especially for the Matteoni and NAS scoring systems. In conclusion, significant sampling variability occurs in NAFLD, particularly for features of necroinflammation. This should be factored into the design of clinical trials and studies of the natural history of the disease. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:874\u2013880.)",

        "title": "Occult Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Candidates for Liver Transplant With Cryptogenic Cirrhosis",
        "abstract": "Background Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a new entity described by the presence of HCV-RNA in liver biopsy and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) specimens, and undetectable levels or absence of HCV-RNA and in the absence or presence of anti HCV antibodies in plasma by current laboratory methods. Objectives To evaluate the detection of HCV-RNA in PBMC specimens of the liver transplant candidates with cryptogenic cirrhosis by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR). Patients and Methods From November 2007 to March 2013, 45 patients from Liver Transplant Center of Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, were enrolled in this cross sectional study. PBMC specimens were separated from the peripheral blood sample. After extraction of RNA from plasma and PBMC specimens, HCV-RNA status was tested by RT-nested PCR. The 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) genotyping of HCV-RNA amplified from PBMC specimens was performed by a standard methodology with the INNO-LiPATM HCV II kit. The PCR products of 5\u2032-UTR were sequenced after cloning into the pJET1.2 / blunt cloning vector. Results Of 45 patients, 4 (8.9% [95% CI: 4.4-15.6]) had detectable genomic HCV-RNA in their PBMC specimens. HCV genotypes were determined in the PBMCs of these subjects showed that 2 (50.0%) subjects with occult HCV infection had HCV subtype 3a, and 2 (50.0%) had HCV subtype 1b. Conclusions This study found that 8.9 % of the Iranian candidates for liver transplant with cryptogenic cirrhosis had occult HCV infection. Therefore, designing prospective studies focusing on the diagnosis of occult HCV infection in these subjects prior to liver transplantation could be valuable.",

        "title": "Occult HCV Infection in Hemodialysis Patients with Elevated Liver Enzymes",
        "abstract": "Background: Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is defined as the presence of HCVRNA in liver or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the absence of detectable hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) or HCV-RNA in the serum. Although occult HCV infection is less aggressive than classic chronic HCV infection, nevertheless it is important in management of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Occult HCV infection has been described in two different clinical settings: in patients with normal liver enzymes or in patients with abnormal values of liver enzymes. The aim of this study was to detect the occult HCV infection in hemodialysis patients with elevated liver enzymes. Patients& Methods: This cross sectional study was performed in hemodialysis patients referring to 3 dialysis units in Tehran. In 30 anti-HCV negative HD patients with elevated liver enzymes, presence of HCV-RNA in plasma samples was tested by Reverse Transcriptase-Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-nested PCR). In cases with negative anti-HCV and plasma HCVRNA, HCV-RNA was checked in PBMC specimens by RT-nested PCR. Results: A total of 30 HD patients with mean age 54.4\u00b1 14.1years and mean dialysis duration 81.2 \u00b164.4 months were enrolled in the study. All HD subjects were negative for HCV-RNA in plasma and occult HCV infection with RT-nested PCR method. Conclusion: Occult HCV infection was rare in HD patients with elevated levels of liver enzymes.",
