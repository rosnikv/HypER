        "title": "Supplementation with Folic Acid during Methotrexate Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "The folic acid antagonist methotrexate (n-10-methyl-aminopterin) is useful in low doses (2.5 to 20 mg/wk) for treating chronic inflammatory diseases [1-7]. Many trials have established the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis [7-13]. Compared with other disease-modifying drugs, methotrexate has the highest probability of drug continuation at 10 years. Dose response-related toxic effects have been reported in 30% to 90% of patients given methotrexate [13]. Toxic effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic abnormalities, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity [14-22]. Some side effects of methotrexate administration, such as gastrointestinal intolerance, mimic complicated folate deficiency [23]. Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; further, folate stores are decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate, suggesting that impaired folate status is related to toxicity [24-26]. Folic acid supplementation has been reported anecdotally to lessen toxicity in patients receiving methotrexate treatment [27, 28]. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7 mg of folic acid weekly (1 mg/d or 2265 nmol/d) decreased methotrexate toxicity without affecting efficacy [29]. This was confirmed by Stewart and colleagues [30] in a retrospective chart review. Folinic acid (leucovorin, citrovorum factor) is a one-carbon-substituted, fully reduced folate that has also been administered during methotrexate therapy [31-36]. Low doses of the vitamin (1 to 7 mg/wk) have decreased methotrexate toxicity [35, 36]. Higher doses negate efficacy and lessen toxicity [31, 32]. Thus, the folinic acid dose may critically affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The influence of the folic acid dose on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy remains controversial, and the effects of different doses of folic acid are not known [37, 38]. Some investigators argue that if toxic effects occur, the most rational approach is to reduce the dose of methotrexate rather than to provide folic acid supplements [37]. We designed a larger and longer study to evaluate different doses of folic acid, assuming that toxicity could be reduced without changing the efficacy of methotrexate. Methods Participants Patients aged 19 to 78 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology's revised criteria for rheumatoid arthritis consented to participate in the trial [39]. Enrollment criteria included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed more than 6 months previously, onset after the age of 16 years, and at least three of the following signs or symptoms: 3 or more swollen joints, 6 or more tender joints, at least 45 minutes of morning stiffness, and a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h. Referring rheumatologists and the principal investigator did the screening. Exclusion criteria included serious concomitant medical illnesses, liver enzyme levels twice the upper limit of normal, leukocyte counts less than 3.5 109/L or platelet counts less than 150 109/L, and use of methotrexate within the past 6 months. Gold salts were stopped for at least 10 days before the trial. This short washout period mirrors actual rheumatology practice. Patients remained under the care of their rheumatologists, abstained from alcohol use, did not become pregnant, and received stable doses of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If prednisone was taken at entry, the dose could not exceed 10 mg/d. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was allowed during the study. Study Design Figure 1 shows the trial design. To maintain the double-blind status of the trial, the statistician carried out the randomization using a computer program in which the algorithm was transparent and a coded vial number represented the treatment assignment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups by a sequential treatment assignment process designed to balance the sample with respect to baseline features, including age, sex, folate-containing vitamin use, rheumatoid factor status, and prednisone use [40]. Patients agreed to discontinue therapy with folate-containing vitamins during the trial. Rheumatoid factor was considered positive if the level was more than 30 IU/mL or if the titer was more than 1:160. Patients received either visually identical placebo or 5 mg (low-dose folic acid group) or 27.5 mg folic acid (high-dose folic acid group) each week, prepared by the Hospital Investigational Drug Service. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the mean SD folic acid content was 1 0.15 mg (2.3 0.3 mol) and 5.5 0.3 mg (12.5 0.7 mol) per capsule in the low-dose and high-dose folic acid groups, respectively. Lederle Laboratories provided the methotrexate (Rheumatrex; Pearl River, New York), which was started in a median oral dose of 16.5 mol (7.5 mg) per week and increased in 5.5-mol (2.5 mg) increments at the rheumatologist's discretion. Methotrexate was taken either in an undivided or a divided dose (that is, every 12 hours for three doses). The methotrexate dosing regimens were identical among the study groups. Folic acid supplements were given 5 days per week when methotrexate was not ingested. Compliance with the regimen was reinforced using a digital reminder cap (Counter Cap; Senetics, Boulder, Colorado). All participants and investigators were blinded to vitamin capsule content until the study was complete. Figure 1. Study design for the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical Assessment Patients were evaluated immediately before methotrexate initiation at a mean of 13, 26, 39, and 53 weeks (Figure 1). Each patient was assessed by the same physician-nutritionist (SLM). Two research assistants (JSA or WHV) did the joint evaluations. In most cases, patients were examined by the same observer throughout the study. The joint counts for tenderness and swelling were not significantly different between the two observers (P = 0.6 for tenderness; P = 0.9 for swelling). The following variables were evaluated at each visit: 1) number of the 58 diarthrodial joints with swelling; 2) number of the 60 joints with tenderness on pressure or with pain on passive motion (or both); 3) joint swelling and tenderness indices, expressed as a sum, with each joint graded for swelling as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 [severe]; 4) mean grip strength (three measurements) for both hands expressed in mm Hg; 5) duration of morning stiffness expressed in hours; 6) patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity graded as 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (very severe); 7) current medications and doses; 8) a 1-day dietary recall using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software, Food Database version 6A, Nutrient Database version F21 [41]; 9) eight activities of daily living assessed and averaged at baseline and at 12 months using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and scored on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) [42]; and 10) presence, duration, intensity, and severity of toxic effects at every follow-up visit and every 3 weeks by telephone interview (done by SLM). Laboratory Assessments At the initial visit, complete blood cell count, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzyme (aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase), rheumatoid factor by nephelometry, and serum creatinine values were obtained. The complete blood cell count, creatinine, and liver function tests were repeated at all visits. If laboratory values were obtained more frequently than stipulated in the protocol, they were recorded and became part of the toxicity score. Blood for plasma and erythrocyte folate levels, using a methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay, was drawn at all visits [43]. At baseline, blood was drawn for a vitamin panel (plasma and erythrocyte folate, vitamins B12, A, C, and E, carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, pyridoxine) [44-51]. If patients had abnormal values for any of the vitamins, other than folate, the abnormality was treated with single vitamin supplements. Radiographic Assessment Hand and wrist radiographs taken within 6 months of entering the trial were assessed by one of the rheumatologists (GSA) without knowledge of study status. Joint erosions and space narrowing were determined by the modified method of Sharp [52]. Results were expressed as the mean raw scores for joint erosion and joint space narrowing. Toxicity: Frequency and Severity Toxic effects and discontinuation of therapy with study medications due to toxicity were considered primary outcomes. We determined a toxicity score, modified from the one previously used, for each patient at each visit or until methotrexate therapy was discontinued [29] (Appendix). Efficacy We determined patient response to treatment using a modification of the criteria used in our previous folic acid supplementation trial and by others [8, 29, 53]. We defined marked improvement in the joint swelling index and the joint tenderness and pain index as a net decrease of 50% or more in value at any follow-up visit compared with visit 1. We defined moderate improvement as a 30% to 49% net decrease in the index, and no change as the index value remaining within 30% of the original value. We defined worsening as an increase in the index value of 30% or more. We examined the effects of folic acid supplementation on changes in physician and patient global assessments, grip strength, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, findings of the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, complete blood cell counts, blood folate levels, and dietary folate and vitamin B12 intake.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo review the limited published experience with methotrexate treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, to examine the proposed anti-inflammatory and immune-modifying mechanism of action and pharmacologic properties of methotrexate, and to detail its limiting toxicities.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA comprehensive synopsis of methotrexate is presented to aid physicians who treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMethotrexate and its polyglutamate metabolites are folic acid analogues with inhibitory activity against many enzymes in the metabolic pathway of folic acid. Long-term low-dose methotrexate therapy (25 mg or less once a week) inhibits production of thymidylate, purines, and methionine and leads to accumulation of adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory substance. These actions inhibit cellular proliferation, decrease formation of antibodies, and decrease production of mediators of inflammation such as interleukins and eicosanoids. Three uncontrolled trials and two controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy of low-dose methotrexate therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease and have also suggested possible benefit for ulcerative colitis and for remission maintenance indications in both diseases. Although methotrexate is generally well tolerated for long-term use at a low dose, several serious toxicities potentially limit its use.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethotrexate is a promising new agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Methotrexate is currently used as a treatment for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. This study sought to evaluate the hepatic effects of long-term methotrexate therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to determine whether the established guidelines for monitoring methotrexate-related hepatotoxicity with surveillance liver biopsy in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis are applicable to these patients.METHODS:Thirty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving cumulative methotrexate doses of \u22651500 mg were studied. Liver chemistry tests were obtained before and during therapy. Twenty patients underwent liver biopsies as recommended for methotrexate-treated patients with psoriasis; the biopsies were reviewed and graded according to Roenigk's criteria for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity (a grading system for methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis patients) by a liver pathologist blinded to the methotrexate dose.RESULTS:In patients who had liver biopsies, the mean cumulative methotrexate dose was 2633 mg (range, 1500\u20135410 mg), given for a mean of 131.7 wk (range, 66\u2013281 wk). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had mild histological abnormalities (Roenigk's grade I and II), and one patient had hepatic fibrosis (Roenigk's grade IIIB). Abnormal liver chemistry tests, present in 6 of 20 (30%) patients, did not identify the patient with Roenigk's grade IIIB hepatotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS:Cumulative methotrexate doses up to 5410 mg given up to 281 wk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are associated with little hepatotoxicity. Surveillance liver biopsies based on cumulative methotrexate doses are not warranted in these patients.",

        "title": "Pharmacological monitoring of azathioprine therapy.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nStudies on azathioprine (Aza) treatment in Crohn disease have indicated a positive correlation between clinical remission and a concentration in erythrocytes of the metabolites 6-thioguanine nucleotides (E-6-TGN) above 230 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC. A concentration of the methylated Aza metabolites (E-6-MMP) above 5000 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC has been correlated to hepatotoxicity. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible for the formation of methylated metabolites and lower E-TGN levels, and TPMT genotyping has been proposed as guidance for dosage. In a cross-sectional study we investigated relationships between the clinical outcome and Aza dose, the TPMT genotype and the Aza metabolite levels among patients with Crohn disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTPMT genotype (PCR assay), azathioprine metabolite levels (HPLC analysis) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activity were determined once in 71 randomly selected Crohn patients on an unaltered Aza dose for at least 3 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNone of the doses of Aza, TPMT genotype, E-6-TGN-, E-6-MMP levels or XO activity were significantly related to disease activity (H-B score), (P = 0.18, P = 0.69, P = 0.90, P = 0.54, P = 0.29, respectively). Leucopenia and/or hepatotoxicity were not demonstrated in any patient. Four patients had a heterozygous TPMT genotype (6.1%; 95% CI: 1.68%-14.80%). The 4 TPMT heterozygous patients had higher E-6-TGN levels than did the 67 remaining patients (P = 0.008).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo explore the applicability of TPMT genotyping, E-6-TGN and E-6-MMP levels for therapeutic drug monitoring, large prospective studies with patient entry at the start of Aza therapy are needed. Until the results of such studies are available, the dose adjustments of Aza should be guided primarily by clinical response and blood counts; metabolite level measurements can only be applied to identify therapeutic non-compliance.",

In this study we examined the influence of TPMT gene polymorphisms on azathioprine dose 1 year after renal transplantation. TPMT coding and promoter genotypes were determined using PCR-based assays. Azathioprine dose, white cell count, and intercurrent events throughout the first year after renal transplantation were ascertained from contemporaneous clinical notes. All patients analysed (n=172) received an initial azathioprine dose of 1.5\u00a0mg/kg per day. Twelve individuals with one variant TPMT coding allele were detected (*3A n=11, *3C n=1).

        "abstract": "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme that catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, and azathioprine. TPMT activity exhibits an interindividual variability, mainly as a result of genetic polymorphism. Patients with intermediate or deficient TMPT activity are at risk for toxicity after receiving standard doses of thiopurine drugs. It has previously been reported that 3 variant alleles: TPMT*2, *3A, and *3C are responsible for over 95% cases of low enzyme activity. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between these polymorphisms and the occurrence of azathioprine adverse effects in 112 renal transplant recipients undergoing triple immunosuppressive therapy including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. TPMT genetic polymorphism was determined using PCR-RFLP and allele-specific PCR methods. Azathioprine dose, leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet counts, graft rejection episodes, as well as cyclosporine levels were analyzed throughout the first year after organ transplantation. We found the frequency of leukopenia episodes (WBC < 4.0 \u00d7 109/L) significantly higher in heterozygous patients (53.8%) compared with those with TPMT wild-type genotype (23.5%). One patient, who was a compound homozygote (3A/*3C), experienced severe azathioprine-related myelotoxicity each time after receiving the standard drug dose. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in TPMT gene may be responsible for approximately 12.5% of all leukopenia episodes in renal transplant recipients treated with azathioprine. Genotyping for the major TPMT variant alleles may be a valuable tool in preventing AZA toxicity and optimization of immunosuppressive therapy.",

        "abstract": "Only a few studies have addressed the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetics interventions in healthcare. Lack of health economics data on aspects of pharmacogenetics is perceived as one of the barriers hindering its implementation for improving drug safety. Thus, a recent Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) study, entitled \u2018Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics: state-of-the-art and potential socio-economic impact in the EU\u2019 included an explorative cost-effectiveness review for a pharmacogenetic treatment strategy compared with traditional medical practice. The selected case study examined the costeffectiveness of thiopurine methyltransferase (TMPT) genotyping prior to thiopurine treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Information for the costeffectiveness model parameters was collected from literature surveys and interviews with experts from four European countries (Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK). The model has established that TPMT testing in ALL patients has a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. This conclusion was based on parameters collected for TPMT genotyping costs, estimates for frequency of TMPT deficiency, rates of thiopurine-mediated myelosuppression in TPMT-deficient individuals, and myelosuppression-related hospitalization costs in each of the four countries studied. The mean calculated cost per life-year gained by TPMT genotyping in ALL patients in the four study countries was \u20ac2100 (or \u20ac4800 after 3% discount) based on genotyping costs of \u20ac150 per patient. Cost per life-year gained is expected to further improve following the introduction of the wider use of TMPT genotyping and the availability of lower cost genotyping methods. Our analysis indicates that TPMT genotyping should be seriously considered as an integral part of healthcare prior to the initiation of therapy with thiopurine drugs. Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics (collectively termed PGx) could positively impact the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, facilitating drug development and a system of medical care where drugs could be used in a safer and more effective manner. However, many expectations surrounding the clinical application of PGx remain unfulfilled due to several barriers, including: \u2022 The slow development of the evidence base for genotype\u2013phenotype correlations for many genes related to drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nThiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) metabolizes thiopurine medications, including azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Absent TPMT activity (i.e., in individuals homozygous for a variant TPMT allele) is associated with an increased risk of myelosuppression in patients taking thiopurine drugs. However, it is not clear if there is also an increased risk for patients with intermediate TPMT activity (i.e., in individuals heterozygous for a variant TPMT allele).\n\n\nAIMS\nTo quantify the increased risk of myelosuppression for patients with intermediate TPMT activity.\n\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS\nA systematic review identified published studies, up to 29 September 2008, that explored the relationship between TMPT and hematological adverse drug reactions to thiopurines. Following a critical appraisal of the quality of published studies, a meta-analysis calculated the odds ratio of myelosuppression for patients with intermediate TPMT activity compared with wild-type.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 67 studies were identified, the majority retrospective cohort in design. Patients with two TPMT variant alleles who are TPMT deficient have a substantial increase in their risk of myelotoxicity (86% of deficient patients developed myelosuppression). The increase in odds ratio of developing leukopenia for patients with intermediate TPMT activity or one TPMT variant allele compared with wild-type was 4.19 (95% CI: 3.20-5.48).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis meta-analysis suggests that individuals with both intermediate and absent TPMT activity have an increased risk of developing thiopurine-induced myelosuppression, compared with individuals with normal activity. However, there is significant variability in the quality of the reported studies and large prospective studies to clarify the size of the effect of TPMT variant alleles on the risk of myelosuppression should be conducted. Accurate risk assessments will provide important data to inform clinical guidelines.",

ADRs were more common in older patients (p = 0.01). There was no increase in stopping azathioprine due to ADRs in TPMT heterozygotes compared with wild-type individuals. The single individual with TPMT variant homozygosity experienced severe neutropenia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur work supports the strong evidence that individuals with TPMT variant homozygosity are at high risk of severe neutropenia, whereas TPMT heterozygotes are not at increased risk of ADRs at standard doses of azathioprine.",

        "title": "TPMT genetic variants are associated with increased rejection with azathioprine use in heart transplantation",
        "abstract": "Objectives Azathioprine (AZA) is an important immunosuppressant drug used in heart transplantation (HTX). Consensus guidelines recommend that patients with thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic variants be started on lower AZA dose because of higher active metabolite levels and risk of adverse events. However, in-vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays performed in participants with inactive TPMT alleles have suggested that AZA use may result in decreased immunosuppressant efficacy as compared with wild-type (WT) individuals. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the effect of TPMT genetic variation on AZA efficacy or prevention of rejection in HTX recipients treated with AZA. Participants and methods We genotyped 93 HTX recipients treated with AZA and measured erythrocyte TPMT enzyme activity. Acute rejection was monitored by routine endomyocardial biopsies. Results There were 83 WT and 10 heterozygote (HZ) HTX recipients. TPMT activity level was lower in HZ compared with WT (13.1\u00b12.8 vs. 21\u00b14.5 U/ml red blood cell, P<0.001). Despite similar AZA dose, HZ developed severe rejection earlier (P<0.001), and the total rejection score was higher (P=0.02) than WT. AZA was discontinued more frequently in HZ (P=0.01) because of rejection. The incidence of leukopenia was similar between the groups (40 vs. 43%, P=1.0). Conclusion HTX recipients with TPMT genetic variant alleles who are treated with AZA develop acute rejection earlier, more frequently, and of greater severity. These patients, despite having lower TPMT enzymatic activity, should be monitored carefully for possible increased risk of acute rejection.",

        "abstract": "503 In recent years, outcomes for pediatric cardiac transplantation (PCTx) have steadily improved, with current 5-year overall survival rates estimated at 83%. This progress may be attributed to improvements in pretransplantation management, selection of donor hearts, surgical technique, prevention and treatment of rejection, and minimization of treatment-related adverse events. Despite these advances, children who receive cardiac transplants experience significant morbidity and mortality, and there is considerable variability in outcomes, much of which cannot be explained by known clinical risk factors. One source of interindividual variability is genetic variation in the host. There is growing evidence that genomic variation leads to differences in immune response, response to therapies, and susceptibility to adverse outcomes such as malignancy and infection. This review will focus on the effect of variation in genes that encode enzymes, transporters, and drug target molecules that influence drug response. After review of the foundational principles of pharmacogenomics, evidence for the pharmacogenomic effects on cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus will be reviewed and clinical implications of these findings discussed. Given the limited nature of evidence from studies of PCTx patients, support will also be drawn from non-PCTx research and pediatric renal transplantation. Genetic studies of nonpharmacogenes such as those in immunomodulatory pathways and variation in the donor genotype may contribute to risk prediction but are beyond the scope of this review.",

Findings In this cohort study of 172 pediatric patients, pharmacogenomic testing of 6 pharmacogenes (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, TPMT, and VKORC1) provided results that warranted deviation from standard treatment regimens in approximately 40% of patients in the point-of-care evaluation of targeted drugs and 80% of patients in the preemptive evaluation of a broader range of drugs for potential therapy. Meaning The study\u2019s findings suggest that a pharmacogenomic program using both point-of-care targeted drug\u2013guided testing and preemptive whole-genome sequencing\u2013guided testing enhances the knowledge necessary for patient care decision-making, providing informed rationales for drug selection and dosing options.",

        "abstract": "Understanding patterns of drug\u2010gene interactions (DGIs) is important for advancing the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics (PGx) into routine practice. Prior studies have estimated the prevalence of DGIs, but few have confirmed DGIs in patients with known genotypes and prescriptions, nor have they evaluated clinician characteristics associated with DGI\u2010prescribing. This retrospective chart review assessed prevalence of DGI, defined as a medication prescription in a patient with a PGx phenotype that has a clinical practice guideline recommendation to adjust therapy or monitor drug response, for patients enrolled in a research genetic biorepository linked to electronic health records (EHRs). The prevalence of prescriptions for medications with pharmacogenetic (PGx) guidelines, proportion of prescriptions with DGI, location of DGI prescription, and clinical service of the prescriber were evaluated descriptively. Seventy\u2010five percent (57,058/75,337) of patients had a prescription for a medication with a PGx guideline. Up to 60% (n = 26,067/43,647) of patients had at least one DGI when considering recommendations to adjust or monitor therapy based on genotype. The majority (61%) of DGIs occurred in outpatient prescriptions. Proton pump inhibitors were the most common DGI medication for 11 of 12 clinical services. Almost 25% of patients (n = 10,706/43,647) had more than one unique DGI, and, among this group of patients, 61% had a DGI with more than one gene. These findings can inform future clinical implementation by identifying key stakeholders for initial DGI prescriptions, helping to inform workflows. The high prevalence of multigene interactions identified also support the use of panel PGx testing as an implementation strategy.",

        "title": "A practical assessment protocol for clinically relevant P-glycoprotein-mediated drug-drug interactions",
        "abstract": "Background Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may influence the effectiveness and safety of medication treatment, which may require additional monitoring, dose adjustment or avoidance of certain drugs. DDIs involving P-glycoprotein (P-gp) affect many drugs, but current official product information is often insufficient to guide the management of these DDIs in clinical practice. The aim of this paper is to describe a protocol to assess DDIs involving P-gp and to develop and implement practice recommendations for clinically relevant P-gp-mediated DDIs that affect clinical outcomes through changes in systemic drug exposure. Methods A combined literature review and expert opinion approach will be used according to the following seven steps: set up an expert panel (step 1), establish core concepts and definitions (step 2), select potential P-gp-modulators (i.e., P-gp-inducers and -inhibitors) and P-gp-substrates to be evaluated (step 3), select and extract evidence-based data, and present findings in standardized assessment reports (step 4), discuss and adopt classifications and practice recommendations with the expert panel (step 5), publish and integrate information and alerts in clinical decision support systems (CDSS) (step 6), (re)assessments of DDIs and potential new DDIs when new information is available or when initiated by healthcare providers (step 7). Anticipated results The expert panel will classify potential P-gp-modulators and -substrates as clinically relevant P-gp-inducer, -inhibitor and/or -substrate and draw conclusions about which combinations of classified modulators and substrates will lead to clinically relevant DDIs. This may include the extrapolation of conclusions for DDIs where limited or no data are available, based on the pharmacological characteristics of these drugs. For (potential) DDIs that are considered to be clinically relevant, practice recommendations will be developed. Discussion This protocol describes a standardized, evidence- and expert opinion-based assessment of P-gp-mediated DDIs that affect clinical outcomes. This approach will generate alerts with practice recommendations for clinically relevant DDIs and transparent rationales for DDIs that are considered to be irrelevant. These recommendations will improve individual patient care by supporting healthcare professionals to make consistent decisions on how to manage P-gp mediated DDIs.",
