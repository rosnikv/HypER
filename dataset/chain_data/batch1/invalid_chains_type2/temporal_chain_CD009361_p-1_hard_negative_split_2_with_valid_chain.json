        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\u2014Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for microvascular complications and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study tested the LDL cholesterol\u2013lowering agent colesevelam HCl (colesevelam) as a potential novel treatment for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea-based therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was carried out between August 2004 and August 2006 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colesevelam for reducing A1C in adults with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate (A1C 7.5\u20139.5%) with existing sulfonylurea monotherapy or sulfonylurea in combination with additional oral antidiabetes agents. In total, 461 patients were randomized (230 given colesevelam 3.75 g/day and 231 given placebo). The primary efficacy measurement was mean placebo-corrected change in A1C from baseline to week 26 in the intent-to-treat population (last observation carried forward). RESULTS\u2014The least squares (LS) mean change in A1C from baseline to week 26 was \u22120.32% in the colesevelam group and +0.23% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of \u22120.54% (P < 0.001). The LS mean percent change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 26 was \u221216.1% in the colesevelam group and +0.6% in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of \u221216.7% (P < 0.001). Furthermore, significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol, non\u2013HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were demonstrated in the colesevelam relative to placebo group at week 26. CONCLUSIONS\u2014Colesevelam improved glycemic control and reduced LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving sulfonylurea-based therapy.",

        "title": "A Review of the Response to Oral Antidiabetes Agents in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Abstract In patients with type 2 diabetes, a progressive decline in glycemic control exacerbates the microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) and macrovascular (cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease) complications associated with this disease. In a consensus statement, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes stated that the main goal of antidiabetes therapy is to achieve glycemic control, defined as a glycated hemoglobin of < 7%, although goals should be individualized to each patient, especially in patients at highest risk of cardiovascular disease events. However, because type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, the response to oral antidiabetes (OAD) agents declines over time and the majority of patients are unable to maintain glycemic control, thus necessitating additional therapy. This requirement for additional antidiabetes therapies as the disease progresses suggests that more aggressive and earlier use of synergistic therapies may help achieve and prolong glycemic control. This review examines the efficacy of OAD therapies to address the unmet need for prompt and maintained glycemic control to the recommended goal in patients with type 2 diabetes, the factors that can affect the glycemic response to the various classes of OAD agents, and ways in which the management of hyperglycemia can be improved in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Background The present study investigated the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin-metformin treatment compared to those of glimepiride-metformin treatment for type 2 diabetes. Methods In a randomized, open-label, comparative study, 106 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. The primary endpoint was a reduction in HbA1c from baseline and secondary endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour postprandial glucose (2h-PPG) reduction from baseline, as well as HbA1c responder rate and HbA1c reduction according to baseline HbA1c category. Results Comparable HbA1c reduction was observed with a mean\u00b1standard deviation change from baseline to the 32-week endpoint of -0.94\u00b11.15% in the vildagliptin group and -1.00\u00b11.32% in the glimepiride group. A similar reduction in 2h-PPG (vildagliptin group 3.53\u00b14.11 mmol/L vs. the glimepiride group 3.72\u00b14.17 mmol/L) was demonstrated, and the decrements in FPG (vildagliptin group 1.54\u00b12.41 mmol/L vs. glimepiride group 2.16\u00b12.51 mmol/L) were not different between groups. The proportion of patients who achieved an HbA1c less than 7% at week 32 was 50.1% in the vildagliptin group and 56.0% in the glimepiride group. An average body weight gain of 2.53\u00b11.21 kg in the glimepiride group was observed in contrast with the 0.23\u00b10.69 kg weight gain noted in the vildagliptin group. A 10-fold lower incidence of hypoglycemia was demonstrated in the vildagliptin group, in addition to an absence of severe hypoglycemia. Conclusion Vildagliptin-metformin treatment provided blood glucose control efficacy comparable to that of glimepiride-metformin treatment and resulted in better adverse event profiles with lower risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain.",

        "title": "Discovery of DiPeptidyl Peptidase-4 Gene Variants and the Associations with Efficacy of Vildagliptin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes - A Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "Background: The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors have become widely used antidiabetic medication. They control glycemia by interacting with serum DPP4 to interfere catalyzation of incretins. The aim of this pilot study was to discover the DPP4 polymorphisms that could affect the efficacy of vildagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor in diabetic patients. \nMethods: Genetic variations in DPP4 were identified in 48 patients with type 2 diabetes who received vildagliptin treatment at least 12 weeks following metformin monotherapy. Luciferase assay was performed to estimate the effect of the regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on expression of DPP4. \nResults: Eight tagging SNPs were genotyped in a sample of 24 patients. Additional sample of 24 patients was used to discover further regulatory SNPs and coding SNPs. In all 48 patients, responders (degree of HbA1c and/or fasting glucose level decrease greater than 10% of baseline after 12 weeks of vildagliptin add-on treatment) did not show any significant difference in selected six DPP4 polymorphisms from non-responders. DPP4 expression was not different according to g.-234A/C in luciferase assay. \nConclusion: Our pilot study could not find any significant genetic variant which is associated with vildagliptin response in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies in large population are warranted.",

        "title": "A genetic variant in GLP1R is associated with response to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes",
        "abstract": "AbstractIncretin hormone-based therapy in type 2 diabetes has been widely used, and dipepdityl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which prevent incretin degradation, have become popular oral hypoglycemic agents. The efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors varies from individuals, and factors determining responses to DPP-4 inhibitors have not been fully established. We aimed to investigate whether genetic variations in glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor are associated with responses to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes.Genetic variations of rs3765467 in GLP-1 receptor were explored in 246 patients with type 2 diabetes who received DPP-4 inhibitors treatment for 24 weeks in addition to previous medication. Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 7% and who were naive to any DPP-4 inhibitors were enrolled. Responders were defined as those who showed a > 10% reduction in HbA1c after DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.DPP-4 inhibitors improved glycemic parameters and lipid profiles. Compared to the major genotype (GG), a larger proportion of patients with the minor allele genotype (GA/AA) were responders (P\u200a=\u200a0.018), and also showing greater HbA1c reductions (1.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.1 vs 0.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.2%; P\u200a=\u200a0.022). This genetic effect remained significant even after adjustment for other confounding factors (OR\u200a=\u200a2.00, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.03\u20133.89).Polymorphism in the GLP-1 receptor may influence DPP-4 inhibitor response. Further studies in larger population will help determine the association between genetic variation and interindividual differences in DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.",

        "abstract": "We investigated ethnicity-specific exonic variants of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its related clinical phenotypes in an East Asian population. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 917 T2D case and control subjects, and the findings were validated by exome array genotyping in 3,026 participants. In silico replication was conducted for seven nonsynonymous variants in an additional 13,122 participants. Single-variant and gene-based association tests for T2D were analyzed. A total of 728,838 variants were identified by whole-exome sequencing. Among nonsynonymous variants, PAX4 Arg192His increased risk of T2D and GLP1R Arg131Gln decreased risk of T2D in genome-wide significance (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, P = 4.47 \u00d7 10\u221216 and OR 0.84, P = 3.55 \u00d7 10\u22128, respectively). Another variant at PAX4 192 codon Arg192Ser was nominally associated with T2D (OR 1.62, P = 5.18 \u00d7 10\u22124). In T2D patients, PAX4 Arg192His was associated with earlier age at diagnosis, and GLP1R Arg131Gln was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. In control subjects without diabetes, the PAX4 Arg192His was associated with higher fasting glucose and GLP1R Arg131Gln was associated with lower fasting glucose and HbA1c level. Gene-based analysis revealed that SLC30A8 was most significantly associated with decreased risk of T2D (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124). In summary, we have identified nonsynonymous variants associated with risk of T2D and related phenotypes in Koreans.",

        "abstract": "Background Most loci associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) discovered to date are within noncoding regions of unknown functional significance. By contrast, exonic regions have advantages for biological interpretation. Methods We analyzed the association of exome array data from 14,026 Koreans to identify susceptible exonic loci for T2DM. We used genotype information of 50,543 variants using the Illumina exome array platform. Results In total, 7 loci were significant with a Bonferroni adjusted P=1.03\u00d710\u22126. rs2233580 in paired box gene 4 (PAX4) showed the highest odds ratio of 1.48 (P=1.60\u00d710\u221210). rs11960799 in membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 3 (MARCH3) and rs75680863 in transcobalamin 2 (TCN2) were newly identified loci. When we built a model to predict the incidence of diabetes with the 7 loci and clinical variables, area under the curve (AUC) of the model improved significantly (AUC=0.72, P<0.05), but marginally in its magnitude, compared with the model using clinical variables (AUC=0.71, P<0.05). When we divided the entire population into three groups\u2014normal body mass index (BMI; <25 kg/m2), overweight (25\u2264 BMI <30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m2) individuals\u2014the predictive performance of the 7 loci was greatest in the group of obese individuals, where the net reclassification improvement was highly significant (0.51; P=8.00\u00d710\u22125). Conclusion We found exonic loci having a susceptibility for T2DM. We found that such genetic information is advantageous for predicting T2DM in a subgroup of obese individuals.",

        "abstract": "Background Using long-term data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, we defined poor glycemic control and investigated possible risk factors, including variants related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, we evaluated interaction effects among risk factors for poor glycemic control. Methods Among 436 subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes, poor glycemic control was defined based on glycosylated hemoglobin trajectory patterns by group-based trajectory modeling. For the variants related to T2DM, genetic risk scores (GRSs) were calculated and divided into quartiles. Risk factors for poor glycemic control were assessed using a logistic regression model. Results Of the subjects, 43% were in the poor-glycemic-control group. Body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride (TG) were associated with poor glycemic control. The risk for poor glycemic control increased by 11.0% per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI and by 3.0% per 10 mg/dL increase in TG. The risk for GRS with poor glycemic control was sex-dependent (Pinteraction=0.07), and a relationship by GRS quartiles was found in females but not in males. Moreover, the interaction effect was found to be significant on both additive and multiplicative scales. The interaction effect was evident in the variants of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like (CDKAL1). Conclusion Females with risk alleles of variants in CDKAL1 associated with T2DM had a higher risk for poor glycemic control than males.",

Many factors increase the risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes such as age, sex, BMI, educational attainment, and marital status.Objectives: The study aimed to analyze clinical outcomes based on patient demographics.Methods: This method was cross-sectional and was conducted at Antapani Medika Clinic, Bandung. Inclusion criteria for this study were diabetic patients who had complete medical records, and who were receiving oral antidiabetic therapy for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria for study were patients with diabetes who were on insulin therapy, patients with tuberculosis, and pregnant and lactating women. Data on demographic characteristics were analyzed descriptively. Chi-square and likelihood ratio tests were used to analyze differences in clinical outcomes based on therapy achievement on patient demographics.Results: The results showed that HbA1c target levels were achieved by patients who were 65 years of age or older (68%), had a BMI in non-obese category (80.8%), had diabetes for six years or more (80.8%), were married (62.9%), attended college (68.4%), exercised 3 to 6 times per week (64.9%), did not smoke (61.9%), and had no comorbidities (65.3%). This study concludes that there is an association between BMI and duration of diabetes and achievement HbA1c target (p<0.05).Conclusion: The clinical implications of this study are as a guide for health workers in Indonesia in management of diabetes so that they can provide services to patients according to the medical needs of patients.",
