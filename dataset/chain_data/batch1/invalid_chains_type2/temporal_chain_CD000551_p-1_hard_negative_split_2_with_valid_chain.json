        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn primary biliary cirrhosis the hepatic lesions may result, at least in part, from the intracellular accumulation of potentially toxic endogenous bile acids. Preliminary work suggests that the administration of ursodiol (also called ursodeoxycholic acid), a hydrophilic bile acid without hepatotoxicity, leads to improvement in the condition of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a two-year, multicenter, double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of ursodiol with that of placebo. Patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis were randomly assigned to receive either ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (n = 73) or placebo (n = 73). Treatment failure was defined as a doubling of bilirubin levels to more than 70 mumol per liter or the occurrence of a severe complication (ascites or variceal bleeding) or an adverse reaction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment failed in 6 patients in the ursodiol group, as compared with 13 in the placebo group (P less than 0.01 by Cox regression model). A single patient in each group withdrew because of minor adverse effects. After two years of treatment, the proportion of patients with clinically overt disease decreased only in the ursodiol group (P less than 0.02). The patients treated with ursodiol had significant improvements in serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, and IgM (all P less than 0.001); the antimitochondrial-antibody titer (P less than 0.01); and the Mayo risk score (P less than 0.001). Follow-up analysis of 95 liver-biopsy specimens showed a significant improvement in the mean histologic score (P less than 0.002) and in all the characteristic histologic features except fibrosis only in the group given ursodiol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUrsodiol is a safe and effective treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis.",

        "abstract": "One hundred fifty\u2010one patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) grouped into four strata based on entry serum bilirubin (<2 mg/dL vs. 2 mg/dL or greater) and liver histology (stages I, II vs. stages III, IV\u2013Ludwig criteria) were randomized within each stratum to ursodiol or placebo given in a single dose of 10 to 12 mg/kg at bedtime for 2 years. Placebo\u2010 (n = 74) and ursodiol\u2010treated (n = 77) patients were well matched at baseline for demographic and prognostic factors. Ursodiol induced major improvements in biochemical tests of the liver in strata 1 and 2 (entry bilirubin <2), but had less effect on laboratory tests in patients with entry serum bilirubin of \u2a7e2 (strata 3 and 4). Histology was favorably affected by ursodiol in patients in strata 1 and 2 but not in strata 3 and 4. Ursodiol enrichment in fasting bile obtained at the conclusion of the trial was approximately 40% and comparable in all strata. Thus, differences in ursodiol enrichment of the bile acid pool do not explain better responses of laboratory tests and histology found in patients with less advanced PBC. Patients treated with ursodiol tended to develop a treatment failure less frequently than those who received placebo, particularly in strata 1 and 2 (ursodiol 42%, placebo 60%, P = .078). Development of severe symptoms (fatigue/pruritus) and doubling of serum bilirubin were reduced significantly in ursodiol\u2010treated patients. Major complications of liver disease, progression to liver transplantation or death, occurred in 10.5% and 76.6%, respectively, in patients who had an entry serum bilirubin of <2 or \u2a7e2 mg/dL. The incidence of these complications was comparable in ursodiol\u2010 and placebo\u2010treated patients. Treatment failure occurred sooner in placebo than in ursodiol\u2010treated patients in strata 1 and 2 but at the same rate in similarly treated patients in strata 3 and 4. Patients with advanced disease are unlikely to benefit from ursodiol. Trials longer than 2 years will likely be needed to determine whether ursodiol reduces major complications of liver disease in patients with milder disease. (Hepatology 1995;22:759\u2013766.)",

        "title": "Ursodiol for Hepatobiliary Disorders",
        "abstract": "Table. SI Units and Drugs Ursodeoxycholate is a naturally occurring dihydroxy bile salt that comprises approximately 1% of the total bile salt pool in humans [1-3]. It is the 7 -epimer (Figure 1) of chenodeoxycholate, one of the major endogenous bile salts. Although oral administration of either ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) or chenodiol (chenodeoxycholic acid) desaturates bile and contributes to the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, ursodiol is better tolerated and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that ursodiol may be an effective therapy in various chronic liver diseases, especially cholestatic disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis. Figure 1. Biochemical structure of bile acids. left right We describe the pharmacology of ursodiol, explain the rationale for its use in the treatment of patients with cholesterol gallstones and chronic liver diseases, and describe the results obtained in clinical trials of ursodiol therapy. Pharmacology Oral administration of ursodiol (Actigall; Summit Pharmaceuticals, Summit, New Jersey) leads to enrichment of bile in a dose-dependent manner such that, at pharmacologic doses (10 to 15 mg/kg per day), it becomes the predominant biliary bile acid. About 30% to 60% of an oral dose of ursodiol is absorbed, although the percentage absorbed decreases with increasing dose [4, 5]. The proportion of ursodiol in bile plateaus at doses exceeding 10 to 12 mg/kg per day because of epimerization to chenodeoxycholic acid and because ursodiol does not inhibit hepatic synthesis of the primary bile salts [6]. Ursodiol is absorbed along the length of the jejunum and ileum by nonionic passive diffusion and is absorbed in the ileum by active transport mechanisms [4, 7]. Colonic absorption is also substantial and may account for as much as 20% of an ingested dose [8]. Even in patients who have had ileal resections, high oral doses (4 g/d) of ursodiol can increase the biliary concentration of ursodiol tenfold [9]. Once absorbed, ursodiol is efficiently taken up by the liver with first-pass clearance of more than 60% of the absorbed dose [2]. Therefore, in the absence of cholestasis or substantial liver disease, minimal levels of ursodiol appear in plasma [10]. In the liver, ursodiol is conjugated with either glycine or taurine and is rapidly secreted into bile. Peak bile concentrations of ursodiol are seen 1 to 3 hours after an oral dose [4]. Ursodiol excreted from the biliary tract is resorbed through the enterohepatic circulation or is metabolized to insoluble bile salts that are excreted in the feces. The biological half-life of ursodiol is 3.5 to 5.8 days in humans [2]. With discontinuation of the drug, serum and bile levels decline exponentially [10]. Other medications, such as cholestyramine, colestipol, charcoal, sucralfate, and antacids may impair the absorption of ursodiol, thereby decreasing its bioavailability. Cholesterol Gallstones Formation of Cholesterol Gallstones The pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones involves the failure to maintain cholesterol in solution in the bile [11-16]. Biliary cholesterol is normally solubilized by micelles and unilamellar cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles [11-15]. A prerequisite for the formation of cholesterol gallstones is bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol. In addition to supersaturation, an excess of nucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors or both lead to nucleation of solid cholesterol crystals [11-13, 17-19]. Gallbladder mucin, free calcium ions, and gallbladder stasis may also contribute to cholesterol crystal nucleation and stone growth [11-13, 15-17]. Bile Salt Therapy for Gallstones Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gallstones. For patients at high operative risk and for patients who wish to avoid surgery for personal reasons, the most widely used of the nonsurgical treatments is the bile salt ursodiol. Chenodiol (Chenix; Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Marietta, Georgia) was the first bile salt reported to dissolve gallstones [11, 20-22]. It was extensively evaluated in the 1970s, particularly in the National Cooperative Gallstone Study [23] in which more than 900 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, low-dose chenodiol (375 mg/d), or high-dose chenodiol (750 mg/d) for up to 2 years [23]. In the high-dose group, 13.5% complete dissolution was noted, less than the 20% to 40% complete dissolution other investigators [24] achieved with higher doses. The major drawbacks of chenodiol are the dose-related side effects of diarrhea and an increase in serum aminotransferase levels. Chenodiol was not widely prescribed in the United States, and with the introduction of ursodiol in the late 1980s, it is now rarely used as monotherapy. Ursodiol has also been studied as a gallstone dissolution agent [2, 3]. Its safety and ease of administration have made ursodiol the most common therapeutic alternative to cholecystectomy [21, 22, 25]. Ursodiol is also used after shock-wave lithotripsy to dissolve residual stone fragments in the gallbladder [22, 26, 27]. Ursodiol dissolves gallstones by solubilizing cholesterol from the stone surface. Ursodiol results in the conversion of supersaturated bile to unsaturated bile [21]. This desaturation of bile enhances the transport capacity of bile for cholesterol. Ursodiol results in biliary desaturation through several mechanisms, most of which are incompletely understood [21]. Despite somewhat conflicting results, decreased intestinal absorption of cholesterol probably occurs during ursodiol administration [2, 3]. This could be related to less effective micelle formation or to less efficient intestinal absorption from liquid crystals. Ursodiol may also decrease hepatic cholesterol synthesis by decreasing the activity of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis [21]. Lastly, there is little, if any, negative feedback inhibition of hepatic bile salt synthesis by ursodiol, such that cholesterol continues to be converted to bile salts [21, 28]. In addition to biliary desaturation, ursodiol also has the unique property of promoting the formation of a liquid crystal mesophase of phospholipid plus cholesterol [21, 29]. Such liquid crystals can form even in the presence of bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol, which probably accounts for the observation that ursodiol may dissolve gallstones in the presence of supersaturated bile. Proper patient selection is critical for optimizing gallstone dissolution with ursodiol. As already noted, cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gallstones. Patients with mild or infrequent episodes of biliary pain are the most appropriate candidates for ursodiol treatment. Asymptomatic patients with gallstones are not suitable candidates for therapy [30-32]. Ursodiol should not be used in the management of patients with acute gallstone complications, such as acute cholecystitis, bile duct obstruction, cholangitis, or gallstone pancreatitis. Candidates for ursodiol therapy must have radiolucent gallstones and a patent cystic duct [22]. Although dissolution with ursodiol may occur in patients with nonvisualization of the gallbladder as determined by oral cholecystographic techniques, such instances have involved small numbers of patients and have not clearly defined the cause for nonvisualization. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder during the course of ursodiol therapy is, however, associated with a very low dissolution rate [22]. After the initiation of ursodiol therapy in patients with gallstones, the proportion of total biliary bile salts comprised by ursodiol increases within 1 to 2 weeks from 1% to a maximum of approximately 60% [21]. Although doses as low as 3 to 5 mg/kg per day have resulted in gallstone dissolution, the optimal dose is 8 to 10 mg/kg per day. Doses exceeding 10 mg/kg per day do not result in increased dissolution rates [2, 6, 21, 33-36]. Interestingly, with ursodiol therapy, symptoms such as pain, nausea, bloating, and vomiting may improve in some patients before actual gallstone dissolution [37-41]. The decrease in symptoms may be attributed to changes in gallbladder dimensions and to a resultant decrease in the likelihood of gallstones becoming impacted in the cystic duct [42]. Ursodiol leads to a reversible, dose-dependent increase in gallbladder volume within 2 days of starting treatment [42-44]. In addition, ursodiol therapy results in a decrease in gallbladder mucin, perhaps decreasing bile viscosity and improving bile flow [45]. The overall success rate for ursodiol in dissolving gallstones up to 20 mm in diameter ranges from 30% to 50% [2, 6, 33-36]. A meta-analysis of randomized trials with ursodiol [46] found that the dissolution rate was 37% for patients treated with ursodiol at doses of more than 7 mg/kg per day or of more than 500 mg/d for at least 6 months. The mean rate of decrease in gallstone diameter during oral bile salt therapy is 1.0 mm/mo, whereas the median rate is 0.7 mm/mo [47]. The diameter of the stones is a more important determinant of dissolution than is the number of stones; the size of the largest stone is rate-limiting [2, 6, 33-36]. In the meta-analysis by May and colleagues [46], dissolution with ursodiol was observed in 48.5% of patients with stones smaller than 10 mm and in 28.8% of those with larger stones. Factors other than gallstone size have been shown to affect the success of dissolution therapy. Stone buoyancy on oral cholecystography is highly correlated with successful dissolution [33, 35]. About 15% of gallstones are buoyant using oral cholecystographic techniques, and dissolution rates of up to 70% have been achieved with these types of stones [36]. Only cholesterol stones are buoyant, and these stones have a substantially lower content of calcium salts than do nonfloating cholesterol stones [48, 4",

        "abstract": "Bile acids, which are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, are important in the production of bile flow, excretion of cholesterol, and intestinal digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Increases and/or alterations in concentrations of bile acids in serum are specific and sensitive indicators of hepatobiliary disorders. Synthesis of bile acids in hepatocytes involves steps in endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Other important hepatocellular processes involving bile acids include active uptake by the basolateral membrane, intracellular transport, P-450-mediated conjugations and hydroxylations, and canalicular secretion. Hydrophobic bile acids produce hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In experimental and epidemiologic studies, some of these forms have been identified as causative agents in the development of colon and liver (experimental only) cancer. Conversely, several hydrophilic forms, primarily ursodeoxycholic acid, have demonstrated cytoprotective properties in a variety of clinical and experimental hepatobiliary diseases and disorders. Because bile acids can have dramatically different properties and effects, determination of mechanisms of action of these compounds has become an active area of research. Primary isolated hepatocytes provide an opportunity to investigate bile acid-related functions and effects in well-designed, carefully controlled studies. Short-term cultures have been used to study a variety of issues related to bile acids, including cytotoxicity, synthesis, and hepatocellular processing. With these systems, however, many functions of mature hepatocytes, including those pertaining to bile acids, can be lost when cultures are maintained for more than several days. Recent developments in culture techniques permit long-term maintenance of functionally stable, differentiated cells. Pertaining to bile acid research, these systems remain to be fully characterized but, in appropriate situations, they should provide important alternatives to in vivo studies and short-term in vitro assays.",

        "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in the development of a hepatocyte bioreactor for the treatment of acute hepatic failure; however, little is known about the effect of hepatocyte byproducts on the viability of the cells in the bioreactor environment. We investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of bile on the growth and viability of the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 and on the cytochrome P-450 content and dependent mixed function oxidase (MFO) activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Our purpose was to determine whether or not it would be necessary to pretreat the plasma from patients with acute liver failure to remove elevated bile concentrations which might be toxic to the hepatocytes in an artificial liver device. Bile was found to inhibit Hep G2 cell growth at concentrations as low as 0.1% and to decrease viability at concentrations above 0.5%. The cytochrome P-450 and GSH contents and the activities of the MFO system and of GST were decreased in the primary cultures of hepatocytes following 24 h treatment with concentrations of bile at and above 0.5%. The MFO activities associated with different cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes decreased to different extents in the presence of bile with the O-dealkylation of pentoxyresorufin being more labile than that of ethoxyresorufin. Our data indicate that elevated bile concentrations are cytotoxic to liver cells, and it may be necessary to pretreat patient plasma to decrease its bile content to protect the cells during the clinical operation of a hepatocyte bioreactor device.",

        "abstract": "Liver failure resulting from different causes and its concomitant complications represent difficult-to-treat conditions with high mortality rates, despite improved therapeutic modalities in intensive care medicine. The accumulation of albumin-bound metabolites that are normally cleared by the liver, such as bilirubin and bile acids, contributes substantially to the development of multiorgan dysfunction in these clinical situations. The molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) represents a cell-free, extracorporeal, liver assistance method for the selective removal of albumin-bound substances. Moreover, it enables the removal of excess water and water-soluble substances via an inbuilt dialysis step. Since 1993, >400 patients have been treated in 53 centers in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Diseases treated with MARS included acute exacerbation of chronic hepatic failure, hepatorenal syndrome, acute hepatic failure, and primary nonfunction/poor function after liver transplantation and major liver resection. Treatments were well tolerated. No severe adverse events were observed. Six- to 8-h MARS treatments resulted in significant (P < 0.05) removal of bilirubin, bile acids, tryptophan, short- and middle-chain fatty acids, aromatic amino acids, and ammonia. Clearance rates for strongly albumin-bound substances were between 10 and 60 ml/min. The removal of albumin-bound toxins resulted in decreases in hepatic encephalopathy, increases in mean arterial pressure, and improvements in kidney and liver function. In the first randomized clinical trial of the MARS method for treatment of the hepatorenal syndrome, significant prolongation of survival was observed for the MARS-treated group. It is concluded that the MARS method can contribute to the treatment of critically ill patients with liver failure and different underlying diseases.",

The effects of the basal medium and supplementation with oncostatin M (OSM) on the proliferation and differentiation of mouse FLCs were examined in both 3\u2010D culture and conventional monolayer dish culture. Compared with monolayer culture, cell numbers and hepatic function of FLCs were better maintained by 3\u2010D culture. When two kinds of basal media were tested in this study, Williams' medium E (WE) was superior to minimum essential medium alpha (\u03b1MEM) in expressing hepatic function of FLCs in both 3\u2010D and monolayer cultures, although higher cell densities were obtained with \u03b1MEM. OSM potently stimulated both cell growth and metabolic activity, especially in 3\u2010D culture. When WE supplemented with OSM was used for 3\u2010D culture, albumin secretion by FLCs increased dramatically after day 5, and a high level of secretion was maintained until the end of culture. During a period of over 1 month, no decrease of albumin secretion was observed.

Conventional static two-dimensional culture models seem to be inadequate tools. We focus on dynamic three-dimensional perfusion technologies and developed a scaled-down bioreactor, providing decentralized mass exchange with integral oxygenation. Human fetal liver cells were embedded in a hyaluronan hydrogel within the capillary system to mimic an in vivo matrix and perfusion environment. Metabolic performance was monitored daily, including glucose consumption, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and secretion of alpha-fetoprotein and albumin. At culture termination cells were analyzed for proliferation and liver-specific lineage-dependent cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4/3A7) gene expression. Occurrence of hepatic differentiation in bioreactor cultures was demonstrated by a strong increase in CYP3A4/3A7 gene expression ratio, lower alpha-fetoprotein, and higher albumin secretion than in conventional Petri dish controls. Cells in bioreactors formed three-dimensional structures. Viability of cells was higher in bioreactors than in control cultures. In conclusion, the culture model implementing three-dimensionality, constant perfusion, and integral oxygenation in combination with a hyaluronan hydrogel provides superior conditions for liver cell survival and differentiation compared to conventional culture.",

        "abstract": "Although hepatic cell transplantation (CT) holds the promise of bridging patients with end\u2010stage chronic liver failure to whole liver transplantation, suitable cell populations are under debate. In addition to hepatic cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are being considered as alternative cell sources for initial clinical cell work. Fetal liver (FL) tissue contains potential progenitors for all these cell lineages. Based on the collagenase incubation of tissue fragments, traditional isolation techniques yield only a fraction of the number of available cells. We report a 5\u2010step method in which a portal vein in situ perfusion technique is used for tissue from the late second trimester. This method results in the high viabilities known for adult liver vascular perfusion, addresses the low cell yields of conventional digestion methods, and reduces the exposure of the tissue to collagenase 4\u2010fold. We used donated tissue from gestational weeks 18 to 22, which yielded 1.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 109 cells with an average viability of 78%. Because HSC transplantation and MSC transplantation are of interest for the treatment of hepatic failure, we phenotypically confirmed that in addition to hepatic progenitors, the resulting cell preparation contained cells expressing typical MSC and HSC markers. The percentage of FL cells expressing proliferation markers was 45 times greater than the percentage of adult hepatocytes expressing these markers and was comparable to the percentage of immortalized HepG2 liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells; this indicated the strong proliferative capacity of fetal cells. We report a case of human FL CT with the described liver cell population for clinical end\u2010stage chronic liver failure. The patient's Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score improved from 15 to 10 within the first 18 months of observation. In conclusion, this human FL cell isolation protocol may be of interest for further clinical translation work on the development of liver cell\u2013based therapies.

Major limitations for the procedure include donor organ shortage, high cost, high level of required expertise, and long-term consequences of immune suppression. Alternative cell-based liver therapies could potentially greatly expand the number of patients provided with effective treatment. Investigative research into augmenting or replacing liver function extends into three general strategies. Bioartificial livers (BALs) are extracorporeal devices that utilize cartridges of primary hepatocytes or cell lines to process patient plasma. Injection of liver cell suspensions aims to foster organ regeneration or provide a missing metabolic function arising from a genetic defect. Tissue engineering recreates the organ in vitro for subsequent implantation to augment or replace patient liver function. Translational models and clinical trials have highlighted both the immense challenges involved and some striking examples of success.",

Shortage of donor liver and increased waiting time for liver transplantation necessitate the development of an organ culture system by which livers can be cultured and maintained ex situ for a prolonged period of time. The aim of this work is to test whether cell culture condition in vitro could be used to culture whole livers ex situ without the use of erythrocytes. Twelve castrated male land race/farm young porcine livers were exposed to 30 min warm ischemia and 30 min cold perfusion. Livers were isolated and connected to an Ex situ liver culture system using a standard culture medium RPMI1640 supplied with 10% of fetal bovine serum and sufficient dissolved oxygen under a normothermic condition for 6 hours. Metabolic biomarkers, bile and urea production, hepatic cell viability and histology analysis of biopsies were examined and newly proliferated hepatic cells labeled by BrdU were analyzed after 6 hours ex situ culture. The results from biochemical assays and histology analysis indicate that livers after the organ culture still maintain the full function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data demonstrate that the liver culture system established in this work can be used to culture whole livers ex situ in the absence of erythrocytes.",

        "title": "Control of Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Liver Transplantation: Potentials for Increasing the Donor Pool",
        "abstract": "Background: Organ shortage is a growing problem, with a rising number of organs being harvested from extended criteria donors, and this trend will further continue to increase as organ donors are getting older and have more comorbidities. Since this fact is immutable, efforts have been made to reduce the extent of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) as well as of direct and indirect harvest-related graft injury which affects all organs in a more or less distinct way. Methods: In liver transplantation (LT), the activation of Kupffer cells during organ reperfusion, thus provoking microcirculatory disturbances, hypoxia, and endothelial cell injury, is one of the key mechanisms causing graft dysfunction. Multiple approaches have been taken in order to find efficient preconditioning methods by pharmacological pretreatment, controlled induction of ischemia, controlled denervation of donor organs, and reconditioning with machine perfusion to prevent IRI, whereas marginal organs (i.e. steatotic grafts) are especially vulnerable. Results: The above-mentioned approaches have been pursued in experimental and clinical settings. At this time point, however, there is not yet enough clinical evidence available to recommend any particular drug pretreatment or any other intervention for organ preconditioning prior to transplantation. Conclusion: The multifactorial pathophysiology in the setting of IRI in LT requires a multimodal therapeutic approach with the integration of pharmacological and technical means being applied to the donor, the organ per se, and the recipient. Currently, there is no consensus on standardized pretreatment of donor organs in order to improve the transplant outcome.",

        "abstract": "As a cause of postoperative complications and early hepatic failure after liver transplantation, liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) still has no effective treatment during clinical administration. Although the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for liver IRI has been previously shown, the underlying mechanisms are not completely clear. It is accepted that MSC\u2010derived extracellular vesicles (MSC\u2010EVs) are newly uncovered messengers for intercellular communication. Herein, it is reported that umbilical cord\u2010derived MSCs (UC\u2010MSCs) improve liver IRI in mice through their secreted EVs. It is also visualized that UC\u2010MSC\u2010EVs mainly concentrate in liver after 6 h of reperfusion. Furthermore, UC\u2010MSC\u2010EVs are found to significantly modulate the membranous expression of CD154 of intrahepatic CD4+ T cells, which is an initiation of inflammatory response in liver and can aggravate liver IRI. Mechanistically, protein mass spectrum analysis is performed and it is revealed that Chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 2 (CCT2) enriches in UC\u2010MSC\u2010EVs, which regulates the calcium channels to affect Ca2+ influx and suppress CD154 synthesis in CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of UC\u2010MSC\u2010EVs in attenuating liver IRI. This finding suggests that CCT2 from UC\u2010MSC\u2010EVs can modulate CD154 expression of intrahepatic CD4+ T cells during liver IRI through the Ca2+\u2010calcineurin\u2010NFAT1 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Liver dysfunctions are classified into acute and chronic diseases, which comprise a heterogeneous group of pathological features and a high mortality rate. Liver transplantation remains the gold\u2010standard therapy for most liver diseases, with concomitant limitations related to donor organ shortage and lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. A concept in liver therapy intends to overcome these limitations based on the secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs; microvesicles and exosomes) by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). A significant number of studies have shown that factors released by MSCs could induce liver repair and ameliorate systemic inflammation through paracrine effects. It is well known that this paracrine action is based not only on the secretion of cytokines and growth factors but also on EVs, which regulate pathways associated with inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, integrin\u2010linked protein kinase signaling, and apoptosis. Herein, we extensively discuss the differential effects of MSC\u2010EVs on different liver diseases and on cellular and animal models and address the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic potential of EVs. In addition, we cover the crucial information regarding the type of molecules contained in MSC\u2010EVs that can be effective in the context of liver diseases. In conclusion, outcomes on MSC\u2010EV\u2010mediated therapy are expected to lead to an innovative, cell\u2010free, noninvasive, less immunogenic, and nontoxic alternative strategy for liver treatment and to provide important mechanistic information on the reparative function of liver cells.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic hemorrhagic shock (THS) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide in severely injured patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess immunomodulatory properties and tissue repair potential mainly through a paracrine pathway mediated by MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role during the inflammatory response, with a broad range of effects on innate and adaptive immunity, preventing damage to the host and maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. However, the function and mechanism of IL-10 in MSC-mediated protective effect in THS remain obscure. Here, we show that MSCs significantly attenuate hepatic injury and inflammation from THS in mice. Notably, these beneficial effects of MSCs disappeared when IL-10 was knocked out in EVs or when recombinant IL-10 was administered to mice. Mechanistically, MSC-EVs function to carry and deliver IL-10 as cargo. WT MSC-EVs restored the function of IL-10 KO MSCs during THS injury. We further demonstrated that EVs containing IL-10 mainly accumulated in the liver during THS, where they were captured by Kupffer cells and induced the expression of PTPN22. These effects subsequently shifted Kupffer cells to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and mitigated liver inflammation and injury. Therefore, our study indicates that MSC-EVs containing IL-10 alleviate THS-induced hepatic injury and may serve as a cell-free therapeutic approach for THS.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although increasing preclinical studies have emphasized the benefits of exosome-related therapies, the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) for liver injury is unclear. In this work, a pooled analysis was conducted to explore the overall effect of MSC-EV in animal models. Methods: A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was performed, from initiation to February 2022, for preclinical studies with liver disease models. The treatment outcomes were evaluated based on liver function, histological analysis, and inflammatory cytokines. Results: After screening, 39 studies were included. Pooled analyses demonstrated that MSC-EV therapy significantly improved liver functions (ALB, ALT, AST, ALP, and \u03b3-GT), promoted the repair of injured liver tissue (damaged area, Ishak\u2019s score), reduced inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3), and increased an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) compared to the placebo control group. Subgroup analyses indicated that MSC-EV had therapeutic effects on liver fibrosis (n = 16), acute liver injury (n = 11), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 3), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4), and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (n = 6). Additionally, the therapeutic effect of EV was comparable to that of MSCs. Conclusion: MSC-EV have therapeutic potential for acute and chronic liver diseases.",
