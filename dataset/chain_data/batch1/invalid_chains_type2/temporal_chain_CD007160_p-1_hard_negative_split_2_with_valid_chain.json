        "title": "Hypoxaemia and Supplemental Oxygen Therapy in the First 24 Hours after Myocardial Infarction: The Role of Pulse Oximetry",
        "abstract": "Objective To assess the incidence and degree of hypoxaemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate the nation-wide perception and usage of oxygen therapy. Design Postal survey of all coronary care units (CCU) in England of their use of prescribed oxygen and pulse oximetry. Prospective randomised study of 50 patients presenting within 24 hours of onset of myocardial infarction, half of whom received oxygen therapy. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) as continuously measured by pulse oximetry, and arrhythmias and ST segment changes were recorded on simultaneous 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitors. Results In 53% of UK coronary care units oxygen is not routinely prescribed but in only 3% is a pulse oximeter used to aid management. In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction the incidence of hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 90%) was 70% and severe hypoxaemia 35% in those not given oxygen, compared with only 27% and 4% in patients given oxygen therapy. The only patient to receive oxygen on clinical grounds had an oxygen saturation of 71%. Severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 80%) occurred significantly less often (1 and 7 patients, p < 0.05) in patients given oxygen. There were no differences in arrhythmias or ST segment changes between groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemia occurs frequently in patients in the first 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction. It is effectively and easily treated with supplemental oxygen which can be guided by pulse oximetry. This is rarely done. Measurements of oxygen saturation are therefore justified in all patients to guide oxygen therapy unless there is a decision to give all patients supplemental oxygen: this we believe to be unnecessary.",

Treatment of acute myocardial infarction has not escaped this general, though unfortunate, rule. Thus, in the past, lidocaine has been used systematically in patients with acute myocardial infarction because of its antiarrhythmic properties, until serious doubt was raised about a potentially toxic effect that might result in increased mortality.1 It is to the credit of Wijesinghe and colleagues that they have looked thoroughly at the evidence available for the clinical effects of oxygen therapy, a commonly used treatment at the acute stage of myocardial infarction ( see page 198 ).2\n\nThe first cause of surprise in their report is their observation of the extraordinary discrepancy between the high incidence of myocardial infarction, affecting millions of people each year, and the paucity of scientific data on one of its most widely used methods of treatment.

        "abstract": "Background Although the haemodynamic effects of oxygen in healthy subjects are well documented, there have been no well-controlled studies of the effects of oxygen in patients with heart failure (HF). Aims To non-invasively evaluate haemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of oxygen in patients with HF at rest. Methods and results 13 men with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) were randomised in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to receive medical air or oxygen (40% and high concentration via Hudson non-rebreathing mask). Haemodynamic measurements were made with applanation tonometry, impedance cardiography and venous occlusion plethysmography. Plasma C-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and A-type natriuretic peptide were measured. Data were analysed with paired t tests. Cardiac output fell by \u22120.58 (0.62)\u2005l/min on high-flow oxygen compared with \u22120.02 (0.58)\u2005l/min on air, p=0.031. Oxygen caused a reduction in heart rate (\u22124.02 (4.21) vs 0.41 (5.35)\u2005beats/min, respectively, p=0.021) and a trend towards increased systemic vascular resistance (875 (1174) vs 235 (321)\u2005dyne/s/m5, p=0.050). Oxygen led to a paradoxical increase in forearm blood flow (0.513 (0.391) vs 0.024 (0.246)\u2005ml/min/100\u2002ml forearm volume on air, p=0.01). Natriuretic peptides were unchanged with oxygen.

        "title": "Peripheral Muscle Microcirculatory Alterations in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: A Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary microcirculation abnormalities are the main determinants of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pathophysiology. We hypothesized that PAH patients have peripheral tissue microcirculation alterations that might benefit from hyperoxic breathing. We evaluated peripheral muscle microcirculation with near-infrared spectroscopy, before and after hyperoxic breathing. METHODS: Eight PAH subjects, 8 healthy subjects (controls) matched for age, sex, and body mass index, and 16 subjects with chronic heart failure and matched for functional capacity with the PAH subjects underwent near-infrared spectroscopy. Tissue O2 saturation, defined as the hemoglobin saturation (%) in the microvasculature compartments, was measured on the thenar muscle. Then the 3-min brachial artery occlusion technique was applied before, during, and after 15 min of breathing 100% O2. We calculated the oxygen consumption rate (%/min), the reactive hyperemia time, and the time needed for tissue O2 saturation to reach its baseline value after the release of the occlusion. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the PAH subjects had a significantly lower resting tissue O2 saturation (65.8 \u00b1 14.9% vs 82.1 \u00b1 4.0%, P = .005), a trend toward a lower oxygen consumption rate (35.3 \u00b1 9.1%/min vs 43.4 \u00b1 19.7%/min, P = .60), and a significantly higher reactive hyperemia time (3.0 \u00b1 0.6 min vs 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 min, P < .001). The PAH subjects also had lower tissue O2 saturation (P = .08), lower peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (P = .01), and higher reactive hyperemia time (P = .02) than the chronic heart failure subjects. After hyperoxic breathing, the PAH subjects had increased tissue O2 saturation (65.8 \u00b1 14.9% to 71.4 \u00b1 14.5%, P = .01), decreased oxygen consumption rate (35.3 \u00b1 9.1%/min to 25.1 \u00b1 6.6%/min, P = .01), and further increased reactive hyperemia time (3.0 \u00b1 0.6 min to 4.2 \u00b1 0.7 min, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: The PAH subjects had substantial impairments of peripheral muscle microcirculation, decreased tissue O2 saturation (possibly due to hypoxemia), slower reactive hyperemia time, (possibly due to endothelium dysfunction), and peripheral systemic vasoconstriction. Acute hyperoxic breathing improved resting tissue O2 saturation (an expression of higher oxygen delivery) and decreased the oxygen consumption rate and reactive hyperemia time during reperfusion, possibly due to increased oxidative stress and evoked vasoconstriction.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by significant exercise intolerance, which is multifactorial and involves skeletal muscle alterations. There is growing evidence that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in PAH pathogenesis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nWe hypothesized that miR-126, an endothelial-specific, proangiogenic miR, is down-regulated in the peripheral muscles of patients with PAH, which would account for skeletal muscle microcirculation loss and exercise intolerance.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nPatients with PAH displayed decreases in exercise capacity ([Formula: see text]o2max) and microcirculation loss on quadriceps muscle biopsy (in CD31(+) immunofluorescence experiments) compared to control subjects. Exercise capacity correlated with muscle capillarity (r = 0.84, P < 0.01). At the cellular level, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 expression were similar in both groups. Conversely, PAH was associated with a 60% decrease in miR-126 expression in a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiment (P < 0.01), resulting in up-regulation of its targeted protein, Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (SPRED-1), and a marked decrease in the downstream effectors of the VEGF pathway, p-Raf/Raf and p-ERK/ERK, as determined by immunoblot analysis. Using freshly isolated CD31(+) cells from human quadriceps biopsies, we found that the down-regulation of miR-126 in PAH triggered the activation of SPRED-1, impairing the angiogenic response (Matrigel assay). These abnormalities were reversed by treating the PAH cells with miR-126 mimic, whereas inhibition of miR-126 (antagomir) in healthy CD31(+) cells fully mimicked the PAH phenotype. Finally, miR-126 down-regulation in skeletal muscle of healthy rats decreased muscle capillarity in immunofluorescence assays (P < 0.05) and exercise tolerance in treadmill tests (P < 0.05), whereas miR-126 up-regulation increased them in monocrotaline PAH rats.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrate for the first time that exercise intolerance in PAH is associated with skeletal muscle microcirculation loss and impaired angiogenesis secondary to miR-126 down-regulation.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Right ventricular (RV) failure is the most important factor of both morbidity and mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the underlying mechanisms resulting in the failed RV in PAH remain unknown. There is growing evidence that angiogenesis and microRNAs are involved in PAH-associated RV failure. We hypothesized that microRNA-126 (miR-126) downregulation decreases microvessel density and promotes the transition from a compensated to a decompensated RV in PAH. Methods and Results\u2014 We studied RV free wall tissues from humans with normal RV (n=17), those with compensated RV hypertrophy (n=8), and patients with PAH with decompensated RV failure (n=14). Compared with RV tissues from patients with compensated RV hypertrophy, patients with decompensated RV failure had decreased miR-126 expression (quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction; P<0.01) and capillary density (CD31+ immunofluorescence; P<0.001), whereas left ventricular tissues were not affected. miR-126 downregulation was associated with increased Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (SPRED-1), leading to decreased activation of RAF (phosphorylated RAF/RAF) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); (phosphorylated MAPK/MAPK), thus inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. In vitro, Matrigel assay showed that miR-126 upregulation increased angiogenesis of primary cultured endothelial cells from patients with decompensated RV failure. Furthermore, in vivo miR-126 upregulation (mimic intravenous injection) improved cardiac vascular density and function of monocrotaline-induced PAH animals. Conclusions\u2014 RV failure in PAH is associated with a specific molecular signature within the RV, contributing to a decrease in RV vascular density and promoting the progression to RV failure. More importantly, miR-126 upregulation in the RV improves microvessel density and RV function in experimental PAH.",

        "title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension",
        "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease that is precipitated by hypertrophic pulmonary vascular remodeling of distal arterioles to increase pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in the absence of left heart, lung parenchymal, or thromboembolic disease. Despite available medical therapy, pulmonary artery remodeling and its attendant hemodynamic consequences result in right ventricular dysfunction, failure, and early death. To limit morbidity and mortality, attention has focused on identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant pulmonary artery remodeling to identify pathways for intervention. While there is a well-recognized heritable genetic component to PAH, there is also evidence of other genetic perturbations, including pulmonary vascular cell DNA damage, activation of the DNA damage response, and variations in microRNA expression. These findings likely contribute, in part, to dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways akin to what is observed in cancer; changes in cellular metabolism, metabolic flux, and mitochondrial function; and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition as key signaling pathways that promote pulmonary vascular remodeling. This review will highlight recent advances in the field with an emphasis on the aforementioned molecular mechanisms as contributors to the pulmonary vascular disease pathophenotype.",

        "title": "Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis",
        "abstract": "Background: An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments. Methods: Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry\u2013based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry. Results: We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1&bgr; expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results. Conclusions: In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\u2014 In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the Warburg effect (glycolytic shift) and mitochondrial fission are determinants of phenotype alterations characteristic of the disease, such as proliferation, apoptosis resistance, migration, endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix stiffness. Current therapies, focusing largely on vasodilation and antithrombotic protection, do not restore these aberrant phenotypes suggesting that additional pathways need be targeted. The multifactorial nature of PAH suggests epigenetic changes as potential determinants of vascular remodeling. Transgenerational epigenetic changes induced by hypoxia can result in permanent changes early in fetal development increasing PAH risk in adulthood. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic changes are pharmacologically reversible, making them an attractive target as therapeutic strategies for PAH. This review offers a landscape of the most current clinical, epigenetic-sensitive changes contributing to PAH vascular remodeling both in early and later life, with a focus on a network medicine strategy. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of the application (from morphogenesis to disease onset) of molecular network-based algorithms to dissect PAH molecular pathobiology. Additionally, we suggest an integrated network-based program for clinical disease gene discovery that may reveal novel biomarkers and novel disease targets, thus offering a truly innovative path toward redefining and treating PAH, as well as facilitating the trajectory of a comprehensive precision medicine approach to PAH.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease whose molecular mechanism is unknown. The trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone 3 (H3K36me3) catalyzed by SETD2 and the modification of N6-methyladenine (m6A) mRNA mediated by METTL14 play important roles in a variety of normal and pathological biological processes. However, the role of these epigenetic controls in the pathogenesis of PAH remains unclear. In this study, the expression of SETD2 and METTL14 was elevated in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) of hypoxia-induced PAH mice. We further constructed a mouse model with SETD2 specific knockout in smooth muscle cells (SETD2SM22\u03b1 Cre). Our results suggest that the lack of SETD2 in SMCs protected mice from hypoxia-induced PAH and significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricular/left ventricular plus septum [RV/(LV+S)] weight ratio, and pulmonary median width. In addition, the absence of SETD2 in SMCs alleviates the level of METTL14 expression and the m6A RNA methylation level in PAH SMCs. These results obtained from mice suggest that strategies that target the inhibition of SETD2/METTL14 activity may be a viable treatment for PAH in a clinical setting.",

The development of PAH involves N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. However, the functional role of m6A regulators in PAH and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unknown so far. Methods: Microarray data (GSE149713) for monocrotaline induced PAH (MCT-PAH) rat models were downloaded and screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and m6A regulators. Next, we screened for differentially expressed m6A regulators in endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts, interstitial macrophages, NK cells, B cells, T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) using scRNA sequencing data. The target DEGs of m6A regulators in ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and Tregs were functionally annotated using the Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. In addition, the cellular interaction analysis was performed to reveal the receptor\u2014ligand pairs regulated by m6A regulators. Pseudo-time trajectory analyses were performed and a ceRNA network of lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs was constructed in SMCs. Furthermore, the RNA transcriptome sequencing data for the SMCs isolated from idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients (GSE144274) were validated for differentially expressed m6A regulators. Moreover, the HNRNPA2B1 levels in the lung samples from PAH patients and MCT-PAH were determined using immunohistochemistry. Results: The m6A regulators were observed to be dysregulated in PAH. HNRNPA2B1expression level was increased in the PASMCs of scRNAs and IPAH patients. The target DEGs of HNRNPA2B1 were enriched in the regulation of muscle cell differentiation and vasculature development in PASMCs. The HNRNPA2B1 expression levels determined were consistent with the proliferation-related and collagen synthesis-related gene COL4A1. Moreover, the predicted transcription factors (TFs) foxd2/3 and NF\u03baB could be involved in the regulation of HNRNPA2B1. HNRNPA2B1 might be regulating SMCs proliferation and phenotypic transition via rno-miR-330\u20133p/TGF\u03b2R3 and rno-miR-125a-3p/slc39a1. In addition, HNRNPA2B1 was observed to be highly expressed in the lung samples from MCT-PAH rat models and patients with PAH.

This study is the first to explore the expression profile of circRNAs in human lung tissues with definite diagnosis of COPD-PH and validate the differentially expressed circRNAs(DECs) utilizing human serum, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells(HPAECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells(HPASMCs). A total of 136 circRNAs(39 up-regulated and 97 down-regulated) were differentially expressed between the COPD-PH group and the control group. Following quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) validation, two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0007608 and hsa_circ_0064656) were believed to be involved in the pathogenesis. GO and KEGG pathway analysis suggested these two DECs were mainly related to the celluar proliferation, migration and EndoMT. PPI network revealed 11 pairs of key mRNAs. VCAM1, VCAN and THBS1, three hub mRNAs with the highest reliability among all, were validated and proven to be up-regulated in COPD-PH. We innovatively found that VCAN may be involved in COPD-PH.
