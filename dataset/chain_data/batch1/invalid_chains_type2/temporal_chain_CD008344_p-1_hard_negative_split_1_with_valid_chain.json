        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nResection of hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Since intensive nutritional support can reduce the catabolic response and improve protein synthesis and liver regeneration, we performed a prospective study to investigate whether perioperative nutritional support could improve outcome in patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 124 patients undergoing resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Sixty-four patients (39 with cirrhosis, 18 with chronic active hepatitis, and 7 with no associated liver disease) were randomly assigned to receive perioperative intravenous nutritional support in addition to their oral diet, and 60 patients (33 with cirrhosis, 12 with chronic active hepatitis, and 15 with no associated liver disease) were randomly assigned to a control group. The perioperative nutritional therapy consisted of a solution enriched with 35 percent branched-chain amino acids, dextrose, and lipid emulsion (50 percent medium-chain triglycerides) given intravenously for 14 days perioperatively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a reduction in the overall postoperative morbidity rate in the perioperative-nutrition group as compared with the control group (34 percent vs. 55 percent; relative risk, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.96), predominantly because of fewer septic complications (17 percent vs. 37 percent; relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.96). There were also a reduction in the requirement for diuretic agents to control ascites (25 percent vs. 50 percent; relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.87), less weight loss after hepatectomy (median loss, 0 kg vs. 1.4 kg, P = 0.01), and less deterioration of liver function as measured by the change in the rate of clearance of indocyanine green (-2.8 percent vs. -4.8 percent at 20 minutes, P = 0.05). These benefits were seen predominantly in the patients with underlying cirrhosis who underwent major hepatectomy. There were five deaths during hospitalization in the perioperative-nutrition group, and nine in the control group (P not significant).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPerioperative nutritional support can reduce complications after major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in the United States, primarily due to hepatitis C\u2013related liver disease. Nearly 85%\u201390% of patients with HCC have underlying chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Advanced tumor burden or prohibitive hepatic dysfunction precludes operative resection in most patients with HCC. Surgical resection is a treatment option with curative intent in patients with HCC not associated with cirrhosis or in patients with well-compensated liver disease. Tumor extent and hepatic function must be assessed preoperatively to avoid postresection hepatic failure, an often fatal condition that may require urgent liver transplantation. Appropriately selected candidates for liver resection have 5-year postoperative survival rates of 40%\u201370%, but recurrence rates approach 70%, especially in patients with cirrhosis. For this reason, the best resection for patients with HCC and cirrhosis is orthotopic liver transplantation, which has 5-year posttransplant survival rates of 65%\u201380% in well-selected candidates.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To compare the long-term outcomes of surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Summary Background Data: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising, emerging therapy for small HCC. Whether it is as effective as surgical resection (RES) for long-term outcomes is still indefinite. Methods: Two hundred thirty HCC patients who met the Milan criteria and were suitable to be treated by either RES or RFA entered into a randomized controlled trial. The patients were regularly followed up after treatment for 5years (except for those who died). The primary end point was overall survival; the secondary end points were recurrence-free survival, overall recurrence, and early-stage recurrence. Results: The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year overall survival rates for the RFA group and the RES group were 86.96%, 76.52%, 69.57%, 66.09%, 54.78% and 98.26%, 96.52%, 92.17%, 82.60%, 75.65%, respectively. The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates for the 2 groups were 81.74%, 59.13%, 46.08%, 33.91%, 28.69% and 85.22%, 73.92%, 60.87%, 54.78%, 51.30%, respectively. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were significantly lower in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall recurrence rates were 16.52%, 38.26%, 49.57%, 59.13%, and 63.48% for the RFA group and 12.17%, 22.60%, 33.91%, 39.13%, and 41.74% for the RES group. The overall recurrence was higher in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.024). Conclusions: Surgical resection may provide better survival and lower recurrence rates than RFA for patients with HCC to the Milan criteria.",

        "abstract": "Liver resection (LR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the first\u2010line treatment in transplantable patients followed by \u201csalvage transplantation\u201d (ST) in case of recurrence is an attractive concept. The aim was to identify patients who gain benefit from this approach in an intention\u2010to\u2010treat study. From 1998 to 2008, among 329 potential candidates for liver transplantation (LT) with HCC within the Milan criteria (MC), 138 with good liver function were resected (LR group) from a perspective of ST in case of recurrence, and 191 were listed for LT first (LT group). The two groups were compared on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis with special reference to management of recurrences and transplantability after LR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify resected patients who developed recurrence beyond MC. Five\u2010year overall and disease\u2010free survival was similar in both groups: LT versus LR group, 60% versus 77% and 56% versus 40%, respectively. Among the 138 patients in the LR group, 20 underwent LT before recurrence, 39 (28%) had ST, and 51 (37%) with recurrence were not transplanted including 21 within MC who were excluded for advanced age, acquired comorbidities, or refusal and 30 (22%) with recurrence beyond MC. Predictive factors for nontransplantability due to recurrence beyond MC included microscopic vascular invasion (hazard ratio [HR] 2.38 [range, 1.10\u20107.29]), satellite nodules (HR 2.46 [range, 1.01\u20106.68]), tumor size > 3 cm (HR 1.34 [range, 1.03\u20103.12]), poorly differentiated tumor (HR 3.18 [range, 1.31\u20107.70]), and liver cirrhosis (HR 1.90 [range, 1.04\u20103.12]). Conclusion: The high risk of failure of ST after initial LR for HCC within MC suggests the use of tissue analysis as a selection criterion. The salvage LT strategy should be restricted to patients with favorable oncological factors. (HEPATOLOGY 2012;;55:132\u2013140)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe reliable prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence patterns potentially allows for the prioritization of patients for liver resection (LR) or transplantation.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study was to analyse clinicopathological factors and preoperative Milan criteria (MC) status in predicting patterns of HCC recurrence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDuring 1992-2012, 320 patients undergoing LR for HCC were categorized preoperatively as being within or beyond the MC, as were recurrences.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 47 months, 183 patients developed recurrence, giving a 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence of 62.5%. Patients with preoperative disease within the MC had better survival outcomes than those with preoperative disease beyond the MC (median survival: 102 months versus 45 months; P < 0.001). Overall, 31% of patients had preoperative disease within the MC and 69% had preoperative disease beyond the MC. Estimated rates of recurrence-free survival at 5 years were 61.8% for all patients and 53.8% for patients with initial beyond-MC status. Independent factors for recurrence beyond-MC status included preoperative disease beyond the MC, the presence of microsatellite or multiple tumours and lymphovascular invasion (all: P < 0.001). A clinical risk score was used to predict survival and the likelihood of recurrence beyond the MC; patients with scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3 had 5- year incidence of recurring beyond-MC of 9.0%, 29.5%, 48.8% and 75.4%, respectively (P < 0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRegardless of initial MC status, at 5 years the majority of patients remained disease-free or experienced recurrence within the MC after LR, and thus were potentially eligible for salvage transplantation (ST). Incorporating clinicopathological parameters into the MC allows for better risk stratification, which improves the selection of patients for ST and identifies patients in need of closer surveillance.",

        "title": "Prophylactic liver transplantation for high-risk recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma",
        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. Radical treatment of HCC in early stages results in a long disease-free period and improved overall survival. The choice of optimal management strategy for HCC mainly depends on the severity of the underlying liver disease. For patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and HCC within Milan criteria (MC), liver transplant (LT) is the choice of treatment. However, for patients with good residual liver reserve and HCC within MC, selection of other curative treatments such as liver resection (LR) or radiofrequency ablation may be a reasonable alternative. For patients without cirrhosis, LR can result in an overall survival similar to that provided by LT. Therefore, it is an accepted alternative to LT especially in areas with organ shortage. However, the cumulative 5-year recurrence rate of HCC post LR might be as high as 70%. For initial transplant-eligible (within MC) patients with recurrent HCC post LR, salvage liver transplant (SLT) was first proposed in 2000. However, most patients with recurrent HCC considered for SLT are untransplantable cases due to HCC recurrence beyond MC or comorbidity. Thus, the strategy of opting for SLT results in the loss of the opportunity of LT for these patients. Some authors proposed the concept of \u201cde principe liver transplant\u201d (i.e., prophylactic LT before HCC recurrence) to prevent losing the chance of LT for these potential candidates. Factors associated with the failure of SLT will be dissected and discussed in three parts: Patient, tumor, and underlying liver disease. Regarding patient-related factors, the rate of transplantability depends on patient compliance. Patients without regular follow-up tend to develop HCC recurrence beyond MC at the time of tumor detection. Advancing age is another factor related to severe comorbidities when LT is considered for HCC recurrence, and these elderly candidates become ineligible as time goes by. Regarding tumor-related factors, histopathological features of the resected specimen are used mostly for determining the prognosis of early HCC recurrences. Such prognostic factors include the presence of microvascular invasion, poor tumor differentiation, the presence of microsatellites, the presence of multiple tumors, and the presence of the gene-expressing signature associated with aggressive HCC. These prognostic factors might be used as a selection tool for SLT or prophylactic LT, while remaining mindful of the fact that most of them are also prognostic factors for post-transplant HCC recurrence. Regarding underlying liver disease-related factors, progression of chronic viral hepatitis and high viral load may contribute to the development of late (de novo) HCC recurrence as a consequence of sustained inflammatory reaction. However, correlation between the severity of liver fibrosis and tumor recurrence is still controversial. Some prognostic scoring systems that integrate these three factors have been proposed to predict recurrence patterns after LR for HCC. Theoretically, after excluding patients with high risk of post-transplant HCC recurrence, either by observation of a cancer-free period or by measurement of biological factors (such as alpha fetoprotein), prophylactic LT following curative resection of HCC could be considered for selected patients with high risk of recurrence to provide longer survival.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic resection (HR) is considered a treatment of choice for a single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \u22645 cm in patients with preserved liver function. However, it is possible for these patients to develop a severe form of recurrence (beyond Milan recurrence [BMR] criteria). This recurrence could have been avoided if liver transplantation (LT) was performed primarily, as LT is believed to yield a more favorable oncological outcome compared with HR. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for BMR after HR and to verify whether primary LT can provide a more favorable outcome in patients with BMR risk factors. Data from 493 patients who underwent HR for HCC \u22645 cm between 1995 and 2016 were analyzed. Among them, 74 patients (15%) experienced BMR. The 10\u2010year survival rate of patients with BMR was significantly low compared with that of patients without BMR (22.6% versus 79.8%; P < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, calculated hepatic venous pressure gradient \u22657 mm Hg and microvascular invasion were identified as the risk factors for BMR (P < 0.05). During the same period, 63 eligible patients underwent LT as a primary treatment for HCC \u22645 cm. No significant difference in long\u2010term survival rate was observed when no risk factor for BMR was present in the HR and LT groups (85.5% versus 100%; P = 0.39). However, 10\u2010year survival was poorer in the HR group in the presence of risk factors for BMR (60.6% versus 91.8%; P < 0.001). Among the patients with HCCs \u22645 cm, which are resectable and transplantable, LT is indicated when calculated hepatic venous pressure gradient \u22657 mm Hg and/or microvascular invasion is present.",

Patients and Methods A total of 194 pathologically confirmed AFP-negative HCC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to screen the independent risk factors associated with RFS, and a nomogram prediction model for RFS was established according to the independent risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the C-index were used to evaluate the accuracy and the efficacy of the model prediction. The correction curve was used to assess the calibration of the prediction model, and decision curve analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical application value of the prediction model. Results PALBI score, MVI, and tumor size were independent risk factors for postoperative tumor recurrence (P < 0.05). A nomogram prediction model based on the independent predictive factors was developed to predict RFS, and it achieved a good C-index of 0.704 with an area under the ROC curve of 0.661 and the sensitivity was 73.2%. Patients with AFP-negative HCC could be divided into the high-risk group or the low-risk group by the risk score calculated by the nomogram, and there was a significant difference in RFS between the two groups (P < 0.05). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the nomogram increased the net benefit in predicting the recurrence of AFP-negative HCC and exhibited a wider range of threshold probabilities than the independent risk factors (PALBI score, MVI, and tumor size) by risk stratification. Conclusion The nomogram based on the PALBI score can predict RFS after curative resection in AFP-negative HCC patients and can help clinicians to screen out high-risk patients for early intervention.",

        "abstract": "Purpose We developed a nomogram based on the liver function, nutrition, inflammation, and immunity (LFNII) score to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) post-resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibiting alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) negativity (AFP \u226420 ng/mL). Patients and Methods Clinical data of 661 patients diagnosed with alpha-fetoprotein-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (AFP-NHCC) who underwent surgical resection at two medical centers between 2012 and 2021 were collected. A total of 462 and 199 patients served as the training and validation sets, respectively. Pre-operative blood markers were collected and analyzed for LFNII. The LFNII score was formulated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model. A nomogram model was developed using the training set to incorporate other relevant clinicopathological indicators and predict postoperative recurrence. Model discrimination was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration was evaluated using a calibration curve, and clinical applicability was assessed using clinical decision curve analysis. A comparison with liver cancer staging was performed using the nomogram model. Finally, a cohort study was conducted to validate our findings. Results We derived the LFNII scores from nine indicators. Elevated LFNII scores correlated with unfavorable clinicopathological features. The LFNII score area under the curve revealed superior predictive efficacy at 1-, 2-, and 5-year RFS intervals, with values of 0.675, 0.658, and 0.633, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that a high LFNII score independently increased RFS risk in patients with AFP-NHCC. The C-index of the LFNII-nomogram model was 0.686 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.651\u20130.721). The nomogram model\u2019s clinical application value surpassed that of standard HCC staging systems.
