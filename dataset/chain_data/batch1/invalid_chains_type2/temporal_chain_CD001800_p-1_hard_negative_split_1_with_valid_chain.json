        "abstract": "A survey in general practice1 has shown that 90% of patients with previously identified coronary heart disease have at least one and usually two or more lifestyle related cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. These risk factors are likely to have contributed to their heart disease and, following a myocardial infarction (MI), may inhibit recovery and increase the chance of reinfarction. It is easy to be unduly pessimistic about lifestyle change. Many people change their lifestyle for health reasons. There are more ex-smokers than smokers in the UK and most of these ex-smokers stopped without professional help. On the other hand a sizeable proportion of the population are aware of the dangers of a high fat diet without apparently being either willing or able to do much about it.\n\nIt has been know for some time that many smokers stop smoking after an MI; perhaps as many as 45% of patients, which is between two and four times the success rate of antismoking clinics for the public in general. However the position is less satisfactory for other risk factors. Patients might become less active after an MI (partly because of the consequent physical impairments and change in work patterns). While there is some evidence that patients reduce self reported saturated fat intake in the year following an MI these changes can be small and are often not reflected in changes in lipid levels. Despite this, immediately after an MI is a good time to attempt to change behaviour. People change their behaviour because of some significant change in their life or their thinking. An MI is for most patients a major life threatening event that \u2026",

Main assessments were performed before randomization and after the intervention. Patients offered behavioral rehabilitation showed improved selfreported healthy diet habits and exercise frequency, and higher internal locus of control. Although blood lipids, exercise capacity, body mass, anxiety, depression, and Type A scores were changed in the expected direction, no significant difference emerged between active intervention and the standard care condition. Standard care of today appears to have great potential in particular if supplemented with some kind of stress management.",

        "abstract": "Background: The relative contribution of health behaviors to coronary risk factors in multicomponent secondary coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention programs is largely unknown.Purpose: Our purpose is to evaluate the additive and interactive effects of 3-month changes in health behaviors (dietary fat intake, exercise, and stress management) on 3-month changes in coronary risk and psychosocial factors among 869 nonsmoking CHD patients (34% female) enrolled in the health insurance-based Multisite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program.Methods: Analyses of variance for repeated measures were used to analyze health behaviors, coronary risk factors, and psychosocial factors at baseline and 3 months. Multiple regression analyses evaluated changes in dietary fat intake and hours per week of exercise and stress management as predictors of changes in coronary risk and psychosocial factors.Results: Significant overall improvement in coronary risk was observed. Reductions in dietary fat intake predicted reductions in weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and interacted with increased exercise to predict reductions in perceived stress. Increases in exercise predicted improvements in total cholesterol and exercise capacity (for women). Increased stress management was related to reductions in weight, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for men), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (in patients with diabetes), and hostility.Conclusions: Improvements in dietary fat intake, exercise, and stress management were individually, additively and interactively related to coronary risk and psychosocial factors, suggesting that multicomponent programs focusing on diet, exercise, and stress management may benefit patients with CHD.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Heightened body awareness can be adaptive and maladaptive. Improving body awareness has been suggested as an approach for treating patients with conditions such as chronic pain, obesity and post-traumatic stress disorder. We assessed the psychometric quality of selected self-report measures and examined their items for underlying definitions of the construct. Data sources PubMed, PsychINFO, HaPI, Embase, Digital Dissertations Database. Review methods Abstracts were screened; potentially relevant instruments were obtained and systematically reviewed. Instruments were excluded if they exclusively measured anxiety, covered emotions without related physical sensations, used observer ratings only, or were unobtainable. We restricted our study to the proprioceptive and interoceptive channels of body awareness. The psychometric properties of each scale were rated using a structured evaluation according to the method of McDowell. Following a working definition of the multi-dimensional construct, an inter-disciplinary team systematically examined the items of existing body awareness instruments, identified the dimensions queried and used an iterative qualitative process to refine the dimensions of the construct. Results From 1,825 abstracts, 39 instruments were screened. 12 were included for psychometric evaluation. Only two were rated as high standard for reliability, four for validity. Four domains of body awareness with 11 sub-domains emerged. Neither a single nor a compilation of several instruments covered all dimensions. Key domains that might potentially differentiate adaptive and maladaptive aspects of body awareness were missing in the reviewed instruments. Conclusion Existing self-report instruments do not address important domains of the construct of body awareness, are unable to discern between adaptive and maladaptive aspects of body awareness, or exhibit other psychometric limitations. Restricting the construct to its proprio- and interoceptive channels, we explore the current understanding of the multi-dimensional construct and suggest next steps for further research.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing body awareness has been described as a key element or a mechanism of action for therapeutic approaches often categorized as mind-body approaches, such as yoga, TaiChi, Body-Oriented Psychotherapy, Body Awareness Therapy, mindfulness based therapies/meditation, Feldenkrais, Alexander Method, Breath Therapy and others with reported benefits for a variety of health conditions. To better understand the conceptualization of body awareness in mind-body therapies, leading practitioners and teaching faculty of these approaches were invited as well as their patients to participate in focus groups. The qualitative analysis of these focus groups with representative practitioners of body awareness practices, and the perspectives of their patients, elucidated the common ground of their understanding of body awareness. For them body awareness is an inseparable aspect of embodied self awareness realized in action and interaction with the environment and world. It is the awareness of embodiment as an innate tendency of our organism for emergent self-organization and wholeness. The process that patients undergo in these therapies was seen as a progression towards greater unity between body and self, very similar to the conceptualization of embodiment as dialectic of body and self described by some philosophers as being experienced in distinct developmental levels.",

        "abstract": "Background How a patient is connected with one's body is core to rehabilitation of somatoform disorder but a common model to describe body-relatedness is missing. The aim of our study was to investigate the components and hierarchical structure of body-relatedness as perceived by patients with severe somatoform disorder and their therapists. Methods Interviews with patients and therapists yielded statements about components of body-relatedness. Patients and therapists individually sorted these statements according to similarity. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to these sortings. Analysis of variance was used to compare the perceived importance of the statements between patients and therapists. Results The hierarchical structure included 71 characteristics of body-relatedness. It consisted of three levels with eight clusters at the lowest level: 1) understanding, 2) acceptance, 3) adjustment, 4) respect for the body, 5) regulation, 6) confidence, 7) self-esteem, and 8) autonomy. The cluster \u2018understanding\u2019 was considered most important by patients and therapists. Patients valued \u2018regulating the body\u2019 more than therapists. Conclusion According to patients with somatoform disorders and their therapists, body-relatedness includes awareness of the body and self by understanding, accepting and adjusting to bodily signals, by respecting and regulating the body, by confiding and esteeming oneself and by being autonomous. This definition and structure of body-relatedness may help professionals to improve interdisciplinary communication, assessment, and treatment, and it may help patients to better understand their symptoms and treatment.

This paper reports the utilisation of Dohsa-hou with a patient who had a history of outpatient and inpatient treatment for depression-related psychiatric symptoms. At the start of treatment, the patient had difficulty in releasing tension because of the harsh rigidity of her body; further, the patient did not know how to regulate tension. As the Dohsa-hou therapy progressed, the patient became aware of her tenseness and learned to self-regulate her bodily rigidity. Her severe depressive symptoms were alleviated along with the change in her physical rigidity.

Some patients develop psychiatric issues, such as depressive, obsessive-compulsive, or psychotic-like disorders, in their late adolescence or young adulthood. Furthermore, these individuals may experience moderate to severe emotional and psychological distress. Development of a psychosocial treatment to address these issues is needed in addition to psychotropic medication. The current study reports two cases of young adults with Down syndrome, who presented psychiatric symptoms and marked disruption in their daily lives. These individuals participated in a Dohsa-hou treatment program. Following treatment, adaptive levels, maladaptive behaviors, and internalizing problems were evaluated by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. Participants showed improvement in maladaptive behaviors and internalizing problems; however, improvement in these areas may be influenced by baseline severity of the problems.

        "abstract": "Hemodialysis patients suffer from long-term pain that drains their energy and contributes to behavioral interference and other negative effects on their daily lives that result in or exacerbate functional limitations. In addition, they deal with dietary restrictions, symptoms such as itching, lack of energy, and psychological stressors like the loss of self-concept and self-esteem. Self-regulation involves the capacity to notice, inform, and modulate responses and behavior, and research indicates that it promotes rehabilitation in chronic pain patients. Research on the aspects of self-regulation afforded by the Japanese psychotherapy Dohsa-hou correspond to psychological processes tied to the sense of self-control that clients realize over their body movements. This study pilot tested a hospital-integrated implementation of Dohsa-hou relaxation tasks as a chronic pain management behavioral intervention for five female hemodialysis patients between the ages of 59\u201362 years. We conducted an ABABABA single-case design to compare baseline A-phases (treatment-as-usual: TAU) taken at recurring 1 week intervals (three sessions per week for a total of 4 weeks, 12 total recordings) with an intervention of Dohsa-hou B-phases every 4 weeks (three sessions per week for 12 weeks, 36 total recordings) over the span of 4 months to compare effectiveness. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores between phases were taken and self-regulatory progress was tracked and summarized from a series of semi-structured interviews. Visual analysis of scores for each participant as single cases indicated decreases for the Dohsa-hou phase compared to baseline treatment-as-usual. As a result, participants reported using Dohsa-hou to reduce pain and experienced improvements in quality of life associated with greater self-regulatory capacity to attend to personal care and domestic activities. These preliminary findings suggest that Dohsa-hou body movement relaxation tasks were feasible as a coping skill in a hospital-integrated setting and at home and show promise for promoting quality of life vis-a-vis the management of severe and chronic bodily pain associated with end-stage renal disease and its treatment, particularly by improving aspects of pain-mediated self-regulatory fatigue.",

We investigated whether self-regulatory fatigue and trait self-control influence dietary adherence among Chinese patients with peritoneal dialysis. Methods A total of 192 Chinese patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis were recruited at two peritoneal dialysis centers. The dietary adherence, trait self-control and self-regulatory fatigue of these patients were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Clinical data were extracted from the hospital medical records. The significance of several social demographic factors on dietary adherence was analyzed using One-way ANOVA was used to analyze, whereas the association between dietary adherence and self-regulatory fatigue as well as trait self-control were analyzed using Pearson correlation. The independence association between dietary adherence and other influencing factors was assessed using Multivariable linear regression analyses. Results We found that peritoneal dialysis patients only moderately adhere to dietary prescriptions. The top three least adherences were observed for salt intake (1.89\u00b10.36), face of difficulty (2.86\u00b10.26) and fluid restriction adherence intake (2.97\u00b10.30).

        "abstract": "Background Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms among patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). However, only a few studies have addressed the prevalence of fatigue and its influencing factors within this population in Thailand. Objective This study aimed to explore the prevalence of fatigue and its influencing factors, including duration of CAPD initiation, body mass index, insomnia, social support, functional status, and depression among patients undergoing CAPD. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 136 participants from the outpatient department of a general hospital in Thailand. Data were collected from January to March 2023, utilizing validated self-reported questionnaires, which included the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Functional Status Scale, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation, and Stepwise multiple regressions. Results The study achieved a 100% participation rate among the selected participants. The prevalence of fatigue among patients undergoing CAPD was 55.88%, including mild fatigue (20.59%), moderate fatigue (19.85%), and severe fatigue (15.44%). Bivariate analysis indicated that fatigue-related factors were insomnia, depression, body mass index, social support, and functional status. However, the multiple regression analysis revealed that only insomnia (\u03b2 = 0.399, p <0.001), social support (\u03b2 = -0.302, p <0.001), depression (\u03b2 = 0.201, p = 0.003), and functional status (\u03b2 = -0.149, p = 0.021) jointly influenced fatigue among patients undergoing CAPD, explaining 50.10 percent of the variance (R2 = 0.501, F(4, 131) = 32.871, p <0.001). Conclusion The findings indicated that more than half of the participants experienced fatigue. Insomnia, social support, depression, and functional status emerged as significant predictive factors of fatigue. Therefore, it is advisable for nurses and other healthcare providers to evaluate fatigue and its associated factors routinely. Nursing interventions to alleviate fatigue should prioritize improvements in sleep quality, reduction of depression, preservation of functional status, and promotion of family engagement.",

The symptom network and node characteristics were assessed by network analysis, and symptom clusters were explored by factor analysis. Results In this study of 602 PD patients (mean age 47.8 \u00b1 16.8 years, 47.34% male), most had less than 2 years of dialysis experience. Five symptom clusters were obtained from factor analysis, which were body symptom cluster, gastrointestinal symptom cluster, mood symptom cluster, sexual disorder symptom cluster, and skin-sleep symptom cluster. Itching and decreased interest in sex may be sentinel symptoms, and being tired or lack of energy and feeling anxious are core symptoms in PD patients. Conclusions This study emphasizes the importance of recognizing symptom clusters in PD patients for better symptom management.
