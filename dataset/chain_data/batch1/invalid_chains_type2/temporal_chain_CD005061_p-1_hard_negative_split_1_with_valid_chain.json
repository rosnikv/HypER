        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf extract (MLE) was investigated as a potent plant-derived \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor with low \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. MLE was prepared by heating in an autoclave at 121 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, and its in vitro and in vivo antihyperglycemic activities were investigated. The adverse side effects of MLE were analyzed by measuring the weight and volume of the cecum, stool color, starch content in the cecum, and the integrity of intestinal transporting capacity. The in vitro inhibitory activity of MLE on intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase was potent and that on intestinal \u03b1-amylase was very weak compared with acarbose. Sugar loading tests with starch, maltose, and sucrose showed that MLE may reduce postprandial increases in blood glucose by acting as an intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Feeding tests suggested that MLE may exhibit fewer adverse side effects than other \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, such as abdominal flatulence and meteorism, which are attributed to the impaired digestion of starch by strong inhibition of intestinal \u03b1-amylase. These results suggest that MLE could be used in the development of pharmaceutical foods to control the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients by inhibiting intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase with reduced side effects.",

        "title": "Comparison of inhibitory activities and mechanisms of five mulberry plant bioactive components against \u03b1-glucosidase.",
        "abstract": "The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of five bioactive components, namely 1-deoxynojirimycin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol contained in mulberry (Morus, Moraceae) plants have been compared. Spectroscopy methods were employed to compare their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory mechanisms. The results revealed that 1-deoxynojirimycin (competitive), resveratrol and oxyresveratrol (noncompetitive) were stronger inhibitors than acarbose, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (mix competitive and noncompetitive) showed modest activities. 1-Deoxynojirimycin, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol could quench the fluorescence spectra statically by forming stable complexes, while the quenching of cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside belonged to dynamic quenching by the collision of molecules. The interactions between ligands and \u03b1-glucosidase were mainly driven by hydrophobic force, or hydrogen bonding consequently induced conformational changes and reduced surface hydrophobicity. Docking results suggested that they could bind to \u03b1-glucosidase at different sites. This work provides useful information for the understanding of the ligands-\u03b1-glucosidase interactions and identifies oxyresveratrol as a potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nMulberry (genus Morus) is a significant source of polyphenols, which can promote positive effects on human health. China has various mulberry cultivars, however, many Chinese mulberry cultivars have been only minimally studied. To solve this lack of research, 8 mulberry cultivars (Da10, Tang10, Yueshen74, Yuefenshen, Longsang, Ningxia1hao, Taiwanguosang, and Baiyuwang) from 4 regions of China were assessed to determine their polyphenol profiles using HPLC-MS/MS and then tested for their antioxidant and anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activities in vitro. A total of 18 nonanthocyanins and 4 anthocyanins were quantified in mulberry cultivars; among these polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside were confirmed as the major phenolic acid, flavonol derivative, and anthocyanin, respectively. Two types of stilbene compounds, piceid, and piceatannol, were detected for the 1st time in all mulberry cultivars. Moreover, the methanolic extracts of different mulberry cultivars showed disparate antioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities, and this discrepancy was mainly attributed to varying the anthocyanin content. Based on our results, Taiwanguosang is proposed to be a good candidate suitable for further process due to its high level of anthocyanins.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION\nThe polyphenols of mulberry cultivars are vital for human health and are relevant to the further development of mulberry-based products. China has a wide range of mulberry cultivar resources, and many of these cultivars have not yet been studied. Our research concentrated on the polyphenol profiles, antioxidant, and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities of various mulberry cultivars from different regions of China to provide basic information for mulberry cultivar selection and mulberry-based food production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The compositions of phenolic compounds in 10 cultivars of two mulberry species (Morus atropurpurea Roxb. and Morus alba Linn.) grown in four regions of China were analysed using HPLC-TOF-MS. Results showed that a total of 27 phenolic compounds were identified in these mulberry cultivars. The Taiwan cultivar from the Jiangsu region showed the highest concentration of hydroxycinnamic acids, quercetin derivatives, and anthocyanins. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that six mulberry cultivars grown in the region of Jiangsu, Ningxia, and Guangdong were differentiated regarding their species feature and regional characteristics. Cyanidin rhamnosylglucoside, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, dihydroquercetin, and quercetin were further screened out to be the key compounds for the differentiation of these cultivars. The correlation between the regional climate feature (including rainfall, humidity, and temperature) and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in these mulberry cultivars was established.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory properties of corn gluten peptides. In total, 400 dipeptides and 8000 tripeptides were first virtually screened by molecular docking and 30 potential sEH inhibitory peptides were selected. Among them, WEY, WWY, WYW, YFW, and YFY showed the highest sEH inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 55.41 \u00b1 1.55, 68.80 \u00b1 7.72, 70.66 \u00b1 9.90, 96.00 \u00b1 7.5, and 94.06 \u00b1 12.86 \u03bcM, respectively. These five peptides all behaved as mixed-type inhibitors and were predicted to form hydrogen bond interactions mainly with Asp333, a key residue located in the catalytic active site of sEH. Moreover, it was found that the corn gluten hydrolysates of Alcalase, Flavourzyme, pepsin and pancreatin all exhibited high sEH inhibitory activities, with IC50 values of 1.07 \u00b1 0.08, 1.19 \u00b1 0.24, and 1.46 \u00b1 0.31 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, the sEH inhibitory peptides WYW, YFW, and YFY were successfully identified from the corn gluten hydrolysates by Alcalase using nano-LC-MS/MS. This study demonstrated the sEH inhibitory capacity of peptides for the first time and corn gluten might be a promising food protein source for discovering novel natural sEH inhibitory peptides.",

        "abstract": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) contributes to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases by decreasing the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids/dihydroeicosatrienoic acids ratio and influencing the anti-inflammatory system. Thus, sEH inhibition\u00a0reduces systemic inflammation, particularly in the brain. This study investigated sEH inhibition by a tetrapeptide, YMSV, and its mechanism of action. Enzyme inhibition kinetics demonstrated that YMSV is a mixed-competitive inhibitor of sEH, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 179.5 \u00b1 0.92 \u00b5M. Secondary structural analysis of sEH by circular dichroism showed that YMSV decreased the \u03b1-helices by 7.7% and increased the \u03b2-sheets and random coils by 11.4% and 22%, respectively. Molecular docking simulation indicated that YMSV formed a hydrogen bond with the Asp333 residue of the hydrolase pocket of sEH in addition to the binding of non-active site residues. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of sEH inhibition by YMSV and its potential as a peptide-based anti-depressant nutraceutical.",
