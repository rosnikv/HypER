        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of early postoperative tube feeding on outcomes of liver transplant recipients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty transplant patients were randomized prospectively to receive enteral formula via nasointestinal feeding tubes (tube-feeding [TF] group) or maintenance i.v. fluid until oral diets were initiated (control group). Thirty-one patients completed the study. Resting energy expenditure, nitrogen balance, and grip strength were measured on days 2, 4, 7, and 12 after liver transplantation. Calorie and protein intakes were calculated for 12 days posttransplant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTube feeding was tolerated in the TF group (n = 14). The TF patients had greater cumulative 12-day nutrient intakes (22,464 +/- 3554 kcal, 927 +/- 122 g protein) than did the control patients (15,474 +/- 5265 kcal, 637 +/- 248 g protein) (p < .002). Nitrogen balance was better in the TF group on posttransplant day 4 than in the control group (p < .03). There was a rise in the overall mean resting energy expenditure in the first two posttransplant weeks from 1487 +/- 338 to 1990 +/- 367 kcal (p = .0002). Viral infections occurred in 17.7% of control patients compared with 0% of TF patients (p = .05). Although other infections tended to occur more frequently in the control group vs the TF group (bacterial, 29.4% vs 14.3%; overall infections, 47.1% vs 21.4%), these differences were not statistically significant. Early posttransplant tube feeding did not influence hospitalization costs, hours on the ventilator, lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, rehospitalizations, or rejection during the first 21 posttransplant days.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly posttransplant tube feeding was tolerated and promoted improvements in some outcomes and should be considered for all liver transplant patients.",

Starting 6 hours after operation, the first group received a standard enteral formula (standard group; n = 87); the second, the same enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA (immunonutrition group; n = 87); and the third, total parenteral nutrition (parenteral group; n = 86). The 3 regimens were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. The nutritional goal was 105 kJ/kg per day.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nImmune response by phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor levels, and delayed hypersensitivity response; protein synthesis by IL-6 and prealbumin; tolerance of enteral feeding; incidence of postoperative complications; and length of hospital stay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe immunonutrition group had a significantly better recovery of the immune parameters on postoperative day 8 compared with the other groups. Linear regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between IL-6 and preambulin levels (r = 0.766) only in the immunonutrition group. Only 11 patients (6.3%) in both enteral groups did not reach the nutritional goal. Postoperative infection rate was 14.9% (13/87) in the immunonutrition group, 22.9% (20/87) in the standard group, and 27.9% (24/86) in the parenteral group (P = .06). Mean +/- SD length of hospital stay was 16.1 +/- 6.2, 19.2 +/- 7.9, and 21.6 +/- 8.9 days in the immunonutrition, standard, and parenteral groups, respectively (P = .01 vs standard group; P = .004 vs parenteral group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly postoperative enteral feeding is a valid alternative to parenteral feeding in patients undergoing major surgery. Immunonutrition enhances the host response, induces a switch from acute-phase to constitutive proteins, and improves outcome.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNumerous factors may impede the delivery of enteral tube feedings (ETF) in the intensive care unit (ICU). We designed a prospective study to determine whether the use of an infusion protocol could improve the delivery of ETF in the ICU.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prior prospective study, we monitored all patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) or cardiac care unit (CCU) who were made nil per os and placed on ETF (control group). We found that critically ill patients received only 52% of their goal calories, primarily due to physician underordering (66% of goal), frequent cessations of ETF (22% of the time), and slow advancement (14% at goal by 72 hours). Based on these findings, we developed an ETF protocol that incorporated standardized physician ordering and nursing procedures, rapid advancement, and limited ETF interruption. After extensive educational sessions, the ETF protocol was begun. Again, all patients admitted to the MICU or CCU who were made nil per os and placed on ETF were prospectively followed (protocol group).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-one patients in the protocol group were followed during 312 days of ETF and compared with the control group (44 patients with 339 days of ETF). Despite efforts by the nutritional support team, the infusion protocol was used in only 18 patients (58%). The main reasons for noncompliance with the protocol were physician preference and system failure (ETF order sheet not placed in chart). When used, the infusion protocol improved physician ordering (control 66% of goal volume, noncompliant 68%, compliant 82%, p < .05); delivery of calories (control 52% of goal, noncompliant 55%, compliant 68%, p < .05); and advancement of ETF (control 14% at goal by 72 hours, noncompliant 31%, compliant 56%, p < .05). Although significant reduction in ETF cessation due to nursing care was noted, it represented only a fraction of the total time ETF were stopped. Cessation due to residual volumes, patient tolerance, and procedure continued to be a frequent occurrence and was often avoidable.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn evidence-based infusion protocol improved the delivery of ETF in the ICU, primarily because of better physician ordering and more rapid advancement. The nursing staff rapidly assimilated these changes. However, physicians' reluctance to use the protocol limited its efficacy and will need continued educational efforts.",

        "title": "The Limitations of Using Gastric Residual Volumes to Monitor Enteral Feedings: A Mathematical Model",
        "abstract": "A variety of methods are used to estimate whether a gastric residual volume is excessive during enteral feedings. In this study, mathematical models of gastric volume during continuous or bolus feedings were developed to evaluate the relevance of measuring residual volumes. The validity of common threshold values of residual volumes that are used to monitor the safety of enteral feeding in infants and adults was tested. A mathematical representation of gastric volume was established using standard integration methods. Assuming an exponential rate of gastric emptying, continuous feedings result in a steady state volume that is proportional to the half-emptying time of the stomach and the rate of addition of endogenous and exogenous fluids. During bolus feedings, a steady state volume will be achieved that is proportional to the volume of the bolus and a rate constant calculated using the half-emptying time and the bolus interval. Based on these models, it can be predicted that threshold values commonly use...",

        "abstract": "A study in human volunteers has been designed to evaluate the influence of different food regimes on the gastric emptying of 3 mm and 10 mm diameter tablets. Dextrose and beef drinks were used as liquid food; a mixture of minced beef and mashed potato (shepherd's pie) was used as a solid meal. The gastric emptying of these foods was monitored simultaneously with electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and gamma\u2010scintigraphy (GS), and was quantified in terms of the time before gastric emptying started, the lag time, the mean gastric residence time (MGRT) and its variance (VGRT), and the time for complete emptying. The gastric emptying time of the tablets was established by monitoring the position of the tablets, which had been labelled with suitable radio isotopes, by GS. The two systems for monitoring gastric emptying of the foods did not provide equivalent results: times obtained with EIT were generally shorter than those obtained with GS for the liquid foods, but were longer for the solid meal. There was only a slight difference in the emptying times of the two liquid foods, whereas values for MGRT, VGRT and the time for complete emptying were considerably longer for the solid meal. In nearly all instances the tablets emptied after the foods had emptied completely from the stomach. Gastric emptying times were longer for the 3 mm tablets than the 10 mm tablets, whatever food they were taken with. The difference between the median emptying times was significant when the meal was either a dextrose solution or a beef drink, but not when the meal was shepherd's pie. The increase in gastric emptying time of tablets induced by solid food was greater than that associated with the differences in tablet size. By providing a protocol that did not allow the administration of further food until after the tablets had emptied from the stomach, no tablet emptying times exceeded 6 h.",

        "title": "Physiological parameters for oral delivery and in vitro testing.",
        "abstract": "Pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms must undergo dissolution in the intestinal fluids of the gastrointestinal tract before they can be absorbed and reach the systemic circulation. Therefore, dissolution is a critical part of the drug-delivery process. The rate and extent of drug dissolution and absorption depend on the characteristics of the active ingredient as well as properties of the dosage form. Just as importantly, characteristics of the physiological environment such as buffer species, pH, bile salts, gastric emptying rate, intestinal motility, and hydrodynamics can significantly impact dissolution and absorption. While significant progress has been made since 1970 when the first compendial dissolution test was introduced (USP apparatus 1), current dissolution testing does not take full advantage of the extensive physiologic information that is available. For quality control purposes, where the question is one of lot-to-lot consistency in performance, using nonphysiologic test conditions that match drug and dosage form properties with practical dissolution media and apparatus may be appropriate. However, where in vitro-in vivo correlations are desired, it is logical to consider and utilize knowledge of the in vivo condition. This publication critically reviews the literature that is relevant to oral human drug delivery. Physiologically relevant information must serve as a basis for the design of dissolution test methods and systems that are more representative of the human condition. As in vitro methods advance in their physiological relevance, better in vitro-in vivo correlations will be possible. This will, in turn, lead to in vitro systems that can be utilized to more effectively design dosage forms that have improved and more consistent oral bioperformance.",

        "title": "A Formulation Case Study Comparing the Dynamic Gastric Model with Conventional Dissolution Methods",
        "abstract": "Even in the 21st century, conventional compendial dissolution testing remains a key cornerstone of the drug development process and quality control testing. However, opportunities exist with respect to in vitro technology developments that provide the potential for formulation and analytical scientists to exceed the capabilities of the conventional dissolution test toward a more biorelevant testing regime. This work presents a product development case study in which bioequivalence was observed between an immediate-release (IR) innovator product and a comparative singlelayer reference product. Despite this, when the constituent granule of the comparative single-layer reference product was formulated in a bilayer formulation with a nondisintegrating second layer, bioequivalence versus the innovator was not achieved. The use of USP Apparatus 2 dissolution testing failed to predict the bioequivalence failure, and hence an investigation was undertaken to develop a mechanistic understanding of in vivo behavior. Using both USP Apparatus 4 dissolution in the open-loop configuration and the dynamic gastric model (a novel in vitro model designed to mimic the human stomach), an understanding of the dissolution and disintegration properties of the reference product was established. The insights gained using novel technology facilitated the redesign and subsequent improvement in pharmacokinetic parameters of a complex pharmaceutical dosage form. INTRODUCTION The correlation of in vitro performance to in vivo behavior is a critically important and cost-effective objective for the drug development process within the pharmaceutical industry (1). It is imperative to work toward the development of a mechanistic understanding of the conditions of the gastrointestinal environment and its influence on drug liberation phenomena from the various oral pharmaceutical dosage forms (2). While fully characterizing the complexity of the gastrointestinal tract may remain an elusive goal (3), understanding the key parameters that can facilitate the prediction of dosage form behavior in vivo may be achieved. A key contributor to developing an understanding is the development of dissolution technologies that are designed to mimic the in vivo environment more closely. The noncompendial dissolution methods have been detailed in an excellent recent review (4). These include multicompartmental models such as the artificial stomach duodenal model (ASD), which has been used to evaluate the effect of gastric emptying on drug dissolution, solubilization, and precipitation in separate duodenal compartment in several studies (5\u20138). In addition, models exist that are designed to simulate GI physical stress forces such as the novel stress dissolution tester (9, 10) or the modified Apparatus 2 by Burke et al. (11). Systems that mimic absorption have been described, from the simple partitioning approach using USP apparatus with organic solvents (12\u201314) to the more complex models like the FloVitro Dissolution Testing system provided by Rohm and Haas (15). In addition, the human gastric simulator (HGS) is a recent technological advance that has been used to study the gastric digestion of foods (16), although this has yet to be applied in the pharmaceutical development space. The next evolutionary stage of dissolution technology comprises complex systems that are multicompartmental, not only mimicking the hydrodynamics and composition of media but also incorporating mechanical processing, digestion of real food, and gastric emptying. Examples of these systems are the TNO TIM\u20131 system (17) and the dynamic gastric model (DGM). The DGM, developed by the Institute of Food Research in Norwich, UK, is designed to simulate the human gastric compartment of the fundus and antrum (18, 19). It is the first \u201cdynamic\u201d in vitro model that replicates both the complex biochemical conditions and the array of gastric hydrodynamics, critical for the prediction of digestive processes and the bioperformance of pharmaceutical agents and dosage forms. The DGM is gaining increasing utility not only as a general biopharmaceutics tool for the evaluation of dosage form disposition and drug release characteristics, but also for the evaluation of (1) food effect potential, (2) dosage form integrity (especially the propensity for dose dumping), and (3) bespoke drug\u2013alcohol interactions. This work reports a formulation development case study that utilized noncompendial in combination with traditional in vitro tools. The study has proved useful in gaining insight into the in vivo mechanisms of success and failure of the pharmaceutical product development of a complex multilayer pharmaceutical dosage form. *Corresponding author. e-mail: james_mann@merck.com dx.doi.org/10.14227/DT190412P14",

        "title": "Differential digestion of human milk proteins in a simulated stomach model.",
        "abstract": "A key element in understanding how human milk proteins support the health and development of the neonate is to understand how individual proteins are affected during digestion. In the present study, a dynamic gastric model was used to simulate infant gastric digestion of human milk, and a subsequent proteomic approach was applied to study the behavior of individual proteins. A total of 413 human milk proteins were quantified in this study. This approach demonstrated a high degree of variability in the susceptibility of human milk proteins to gastric digestion. Specifically this study reports that lipoproteins are among the class of slowly digested proteins during gastric processes. The levels of integral lysozyme C and partial lactadherin in milk whey increase over digestion. Mucins, ribonuclease 4, and macrophage mannose receptor 1 are also resistant to gastric digestion. The retention or enhancement in whey protein abundance can be ascribed to the digestive release of milk-fat-globule-membrane or immune-cell enclosed proteins that are not initially accessible in milk. Immunoglobulins are more resistant to digestion compared to total milk proteins, and within the immunoglobulin class IgA and IgM are more resistant to digestion compared to IgG. The gastric digestion of milk proteins becomes more apparent from this study.",

        "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches have largely facilitated our systemic understanding of cellular processes and biological functions. Cutoffs in protein expression fold changes (FCs) are often arbitrarily determined in MS-based quantification with no demonstrable determination of small magnitude changes in protein expression. Therefore, many biological insights may remain veiled due to high FC cutoffs. Herein, we employ the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line Caco-2 as a model system to demonstrate the dynamicity of tandem-mass-tag (TMT) labeling over a range of 5-40% changes in protein abundance, with the variance controls of \u00b1 5% FC for around 95% of TMT ratios when sampling 9-12 biological replicates. We further applied this procedure to examine the temporal proteome of Caco-2 cells upon exposure to human whey proteins (WP). Pathway assessments predict subtle effects due to WP in moderating xenobiotic metabolism, promoting proliferation and various other cellular functions in differentiating enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells. This demonstration of a sensitive MS approach may open up new perspectives in the system-wide exploration of elusive or transient biological effects by facilitating scrutiny of narrow windows of proteome abundance changes. Furthermore, we anticipate this study will encourage more investigations of WP on infant gastrointestinal tract development.",

        "title": "Role of Bioactive Peptide Sequences in the Potential Impact of Dairy Protein Intake on Metabolic Health",
        "abstract": "For years, there has been an increasing move towards elucidating the complexities of how food can interplay with the signalling networks underlying energy homeostasis and glycaemic control. Dairy foods can be regarded as the greatest source of proteins and peptides with various health benefits and are a well-recognized source of bioactive compounds. A number of dairy protein-derived peptide sequences with the ability to modulate functions related to the control of food intake, body weight gain and glucose homeostasis have been isolated and characterized. Their being active in vivo may be questionable mainly due to expected low bioavailability after ingestion, and hence their real contribution to the metabolic impact of dairy protein intake needs to be discussed. Some reports suggest that the differential effects of dairy proteins\u2014in particular whey proteins\u2014on mechanisms underlying energy balance and glucose-homeostasis may be attributed to their unique amino acid composition and hence the release of free amino acid mixtures enriched in essential amino acids (i.e., branched-chain-amino acids) upon digestion. Actually, the research reports reviewed in this article suggest that, among a number of dairy protein-derived peptides isolated and characterized as bioactive compounds in vitro, some peptides can be active in vivo post-oral administration through a local action in the gut, or, alternatively, a systemic action on specific molecular targets after entering the systemic circulation. Moreover, these studies highlight the importance of the enteroendocrine system in the cross talk between food proteins and the neuroendocrine network regulating energy balance.",

        "abstract": "Beta-casein makes up about 30% of the total protein contained in milk and can be present in cows' milk in two distinct forms (A1 or A2) or as a combination of the two. The only difference between these two variants of \u03b2-casein (\u03b2-CN) is a single amino acid substitution. This results in a different behavior of the protein upon enzymatic cleavage, following human consumption or due to microbial action. In most of the commercially available milk containing A1 or A1/A2 \u03b2-CN variants, the \u03b2-casomorphin-7 peptide (BCM-7) is released upon digestion and during cheese manufacturing/ripening, while this does not happen with A2 milk. BCM-7 is a known \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist that may influence the gastro-intestinal physiology directly and may also exert effects elsewhere in the body, such as on the cardiovascular, neurological and endocrine systems. The present article is aimed at a revision of prior review papers on the topic, with a focus on the impact of ingestion of A1 \u03b2-CN milk and A2 \u03b2-CN milk on any health-related outcomes and on the impact of A1 or A2 \u03b2-CN variant on technological properties of cows' milk. When systematic reviews were considered, it was possible to conclude that A2 \u03b2-CN exerts beneficial effects at the gastrointestinal level compared with A1 \u03b2-CN, but that there is no evidence of A1 \u03b2-CN having negative effects on human health. Physicochemical differences among cows' milk containing either \u03b2-CN A2 or \u03b2-CN A1 and their effects on technological properties are discussed.",

We aimed to determine whether lactose maldigesters who chronically consumed two cups of A1/A2 milk (containing 75% A1 \u03b2-casein and 25% A2 \u03b2-casein) would adapt to have fewer intolerance symptoms, lower serum inflammatory markers, and/or altered glutathione levels similar to those consuming A2 milk (containing 100% A2 \u03b2-casein). A double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial was conducted. Sixteen confirmed lactose maldigesters consumed 250 mL of A1/A2 milk and A2 milk twice daily with meals for two weeks. At the end of the adaptation period on day 15, lactose maldigestion was measured after a challenge with the same milk used for adaptation (0.5 g of lactose per kg of body weight) with a hydrogen breath test. Fecal urgency was higher during the two-week consumption of A1/A2 milk compared to A2 milk (p = 0.04, n = 16). Bloating (p = 0.03, n = 16) and flatulence (p = 0.02, n = 16) were also higher on the 15th day with A1/A2 milk compared to A2 milk challenge. However, day-to-day symptoms, hydrogen, serum inflammatory markers, and antioxidant concentrations were not different after A1/A2 and A2 milk consumption adaptation periods. Adaptation over two weeks did not improve lactose digestion or tolerance of A1/A2 milk to match that of A2 milk.",
