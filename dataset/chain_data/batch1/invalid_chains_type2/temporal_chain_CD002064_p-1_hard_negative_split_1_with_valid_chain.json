        "title": "Subcutaneous IGF-1 is not beneficial in 2-year ALS trial",
        "abstract": "Background: Previous human clinical trials of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been inconsistent. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to address whether IGF-1 benefited patients with ALS. Methods: A total of 330 patients from 20 medical centers were randomized to receive 0.05 mg/kg body weight of human recombinant IGF-1 given subcutaneously twice daily or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome measure was change in their manual muscle testing score. Secondary outcome measures included tracheostomy-free survival and rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale. Intention to treat analysis was used. Results: There was no difference between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcome measures after the 2-year treatment period. Conclusions: Insulin-like growth factor type I does not provide benefit for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. GLOSSARY: ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-r = revised ALS functional rating scale; AUC = area under the curve; DVT = deep venous thromboses; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor type I; MMT = manual muscle testing; PE = pulmonary embolisms.",

        "title": "The natural history of ALS is changing: Improved survival",
        "abstract": "In the past two decades new practice parameters for clinical care in ALS were developed and several clinical trials were performed. We sought to review information in these prospective datasets and assess whether natural history of ALS has changed over time. Survival and the rate of functional decline were compared across the placebo arms of efficacy trials conducted from 1999 to 2005 by the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS). Similar data from the placebo arms of 12 other published efficacy ALS trials conducted between 1990 and 2008 were compared descriptively. In the three NEALS clinical trials, survival improved over time in the placebo cohort (p=0.05) while the rate of change in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) (p=0.15), ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) (p=0.6) and vital capacity (%VC) (p=0.5) was unchanged. No differences were observed in the mean rates of decline of these outcome measures in the published clinical trials. However, survival improved in the more recently conducted trials. Survival improved over time in placebo controlled participants enrolled in clinical trials in ALS since 1990. However, the decline in measures of function appears unchanged since then. These changes in natural history reflect improvements in symptomatic care of ALS.",

        "title": "Toward more efficient clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
        "abstract": "Abstract More than 30 phase II or III clinical trials have been carried out in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Only riluzole, however, has been shown to extend survival and/or time to tracheostomy. Many early ALS trials lacked solid pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data for the treatment being tested, challenging the interpretation of the efficacy and pathway relevance. Understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of ALS has improved considerably in the past decade, but biomarkers of disease activity remain lacking. A more efficient approach to early phase clinical trials is needed to accelerate the identification of useful agents for ALS. Here we summarize our current thinking about phase II design options and the potential benefits of a clinical trial network for phase II trials in ALS.",

        "title": "Need for a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches to CNS injury",
        "abstract": "Irreversible damage to the nervous system can result from many causes including trauma, disruption of blood supply, pathogen infection or neurodegenerative disease. Common features following CNS injury include a disruption of axons, neuron death and injury, local B-cell and microglial activation, and the synthesis of pathogenic autoantibodies. CNS injury results in a pervasive inhibitory microenvironment that hinders regeneration. Current approaches to eliminate the inhibitory environment have met with limited success. These results argue for a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches to CNS injury. Targeting CNS cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) themselves may drive CNS repair. For example, our group and others have demonstrated that autoreactive antibodies can participate in aspects of CNS regeneration, including remyelination. We have developed recombinant autoreactive natural human IgM antibodies with the therapeutic potential for CNS repair in several neurologic diseases",

        "title": "Sphingolipidomics investigation of the temporal dynamics after ischemic brain injury.",
        "abstract": "Sphingolipids (SPL) have been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for strokes, but no reports have ever profiled the changes of the entire range of SPLs after stroke. This study applied sphingolipidomic methods to investigate the temporal and individual changes in the sphingolipidome including the effect of atorvastatin after ischemic brain injury. We conducted sphingolipidomic profiling of mouse brain tissue by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry at 3 hour (hr) and 24 hr after 1 hr of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and SPL levels were compared with those of the Sham control group. At 3 hr post MCAO, ceramides (Cers) exhibited an increase in levels of long-chain Cers but a decrease in very-long-chain Cers. Moreover, sphingosine, the precursor of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) decreased and S1P increased at 3 hr after MCAO. In contrast to 3 hr, both long-chain and very-long-chain Cers showed an increased trend at 24 hr post MCAO. Most important, the administration of atorvastatin improved the neurological function of the mice and significantly reversed the SPL changes resulting from the ischemic injury. Furthermore, we used plasma samples from non-stroke control and stroke patients at time points of 72 hr after stroke, and found a similar trend of Cers as in the MCAO model. This study successfully elucidated the overall effect of ischemic injury on SPL metabolism with and without atorvastatin treatment. The network of SPL components that change upon ischemic damage may provide novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.",

        "title": "A Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Gradient Is Linked to the Cerebral Recruitment of T Helper and Regulatory T Helper Cells during Acute Ischemic Stroke",
        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests a complex relationship between sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling and stroke. Here, we show the kinetics of S1P in the acute phase of ischemic stroke and highlight accompanying changes in immune cells and S1P receptors (S1PR). Using a C57BL/6 mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we assessed S1P concentrations in the brain, plasma, and spleen. We found a steep S1P gradient from the spleen towards the brain. Results obtained by qPCR suggested that cells expressing the S1PR type 1 (S1P1+) were the predominant population deserting the spleen. Here, we report the cerebral recruitment of T helper (TH) and regulatory T (TREG) cells to the ipsilateral hemisphere, which was associated with differential regulation of cerebral S1PR expression patterns in the brain after MCAO. This study provides insight that the S1P-S1PR axis facilitates splenic T cell egress and is linked to the cerebral recruitment of S1PR+ TH and TREG cells. Further insights by which means the S1P-S1PR-axis orchestrates neuronal positioning may offer new therapeutic perspectives after ischemic stroke.",

        "title": "Association of Plasma Metabolic Biomarker Sphingosine-1-Phosphate With Cerebral Collateral Circulation in Acute Ischemic Stroke",
        "abstract": "Background: The contribution of metabolic profile to the cerebral collateral circulation in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has not been fully outlined. In this study, we conducted a metabolomic study to assess the relationship between the metabolic biomarkers and the collateral status of AIS. Methods: A two-stage study was conducted from September 2019 to June 2021 in our hospital. There were 96 subjects including 66 patients with AIS and 30 healthy controls in the discovery stage and 80 subjects including 53 patients with AIS and 27 healthy controls in the validation stage. Collateral circulation was assessed by the Tan score based on computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify differential metabolic markers. Then, an ELISA was employed to detect the plasma levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Results:There were 114 differential metabolites between patients with AIS and control groups and 37 differential metabolites between good collateral circulation (GCC) and poor collateral circulation (PCC) groups. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that arginine biosynthesis was the only statistically significant pathway between AIS and control groups and sphingolipid metabolism was the only statistically significant pathway between GCC and PCC groups. The differential metabolites sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P) and S1P belong to the sphingolipid metabolism. In the discovery stage, when the GCC group was compared with the PCC group, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that plasma SA1P relative levels demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.582\u20130.834), and S1P levels demonstrated an AUC of 0.701 (95% CI: 0.567\u20130.819). In addition, both plasma SA1P and S1P relative levels showed significant negative correlations with the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. In the validation sample, higher plasma S1P levels were independent predictors of GCC (p = 0.014), and plasma S1P levels demonstrated an AUC of 0.738 (95% CI: 0.599\u20130.849) to differentiate patients with GCC from patients with PCC. In addition, plasma S1P levels also showed significant negative correlations with the 90-day mRS score. Conclusion: We first illustrated the association between plasma metabolic profiles and cerebral collateral circulation in patients with AIS. Plasma S1P levels might be a potential diagnostic biomarker for predicting collateral circulation status in patients with AIS.",

        "title": "Targeted metabolomics reveals serum changes of amino acids in mild to moderate ischemic stroke and stroke mimics",
        "abstract": "Background The pathophysiological processes linked to an acute ischemic stroke (IS) can be reflected in the circulating metabolome. Amino acids (AAs) have been demonstrated to be one of the most significant metabolites that can undergo significant alteration after a stroke. Methods We sought to identify the potential biomarkers for the early detection of IS using an extensive targeted technique for reliable quantification of 27 different AAs based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A cohort with 216 participants was enrolled, including 70 mild to moderate ischemic stroke patients (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale < 15, MB group), 76 stroke mimics (MM group) and 70 healthy controls (NC group). Results It was found that upon comparing MB and MM to control patients, AAs shifts were detected via partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and pathway analysis. Interestingly, MB and MM exhibited similar AAs pattern. Moreover, ornithine, asparagine, valine, citrulline, and cysteine were identified for inclusion in a biomarker panel for early-stage stroke detection based upon an AUC of 0.968 (95% CI 0.924\u20130.998). Levels of ornithine were positively associated with infract volume, 3\u2009months mRS score, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in MB. In addition, a metabolites biomarker panel, including ornithine, taurine, phenylalanine, citrulline, cysteine, yielded an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.966\u20131) which can be employed to effectively discriminate MM patients from control. Conclusion Overall, alternations in serum AAs are characteristic metabolic features of MB and MM. AAs could serve as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis of MB patients since mild to moderate IS patients were enrolled in the study. The metabolism of AAs can be considered as a key indicator for both the prevention and treatment of IS.",

        "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and permanent disability in the world. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are crucial for reducing its consequences on individuals and societies. Therefore, identifying reliable biomarkers for early detection, prognostics, and therapy can facilitate the early prediction and prevention of stroke. Metabolomics has been shown as a promising tool for biomarker discovery since many post-ischemic metabolites can be found in the plasma or serum of the patient. In this research, we performed a comparative targeted metabolomic analysis of stroke thrombi, stroke patient serums, and healthy control serums in order to determine the alteration in the patients\u2019 metabolomes, which might serve as biomarkers for early prediction or stroke prevention. The most statistically altered metabolites characterized in the patient serums compared with the control serums were glutamate and serotonin, followed by phospholipids and triacylglycerols. In stroke thrombi compared with the patients\u2019 serums, the most significantly altered metabolites were classified as lipids, with choline-containing phospholipids and sphingomyelins having the highest discriminatory score. The results of this preliminary study could help in understanding the roles of different metabolic changes that occur during thrombosis and cerebral ischemia and possibly suggest new metabolic biomarkers for ischemic stroke.",
