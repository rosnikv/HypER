        "title": "Pill Count, Self-Report, and Pharmacy Claims Data to Measure Medication Adherence in the Elderly",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare medication adherence calculated from four different data sources including a pill count and self-report obtained during a home medication history, as well as calculations based on refill frequency derived from a provincial prescription claims database (manual and electronic). DESIGN: Baseline medication adherence was collected as part of a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Mean medication adherence results obtained from the four data sources were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple range test. SETTING: A pharmacy consultation service located at an interdisciplinary wellness center for noninstitutionalized elderly. PATIENTS: 65 years or older, noninstitutionalized, taking one or more prescribed or nonprescribed medications. Clients would either present to the wellness center or be referred by the Provincial Home Care program. RESULTS: When calculated from self-report or manual or electronic prescription claims data, mean percent adherence by drug was high and not statistically different (95.8% \u00b1 17.1%, 107.6% \u00b1 40.3%, and 94.6% \u00b1 24.0%, respectively), whereas the pill count adherence was significantly lower at 74.0% \u00b1 41.5% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An unexpected finding was that the pill count technique used in this study of elderly clients using chronic, repeat medications appeared to underestimate medication adherence. Numerous other limitations of pill count, self-report, and a province-wide prescription claims database in estimating medication adherence are presented. When using medication adherence as a process measure, the researcher and practitioner should be aware of the limitations unique to the data source they choose, and interpret data cautiously.",

        "title": "Use of rhDNase Therapy and Costs of Respiratory-Related Care in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between level of use of recombinant deoxyribonuclease I (rhDNase) therapy and costs of respiratory-related care in patients with cystic fibrosis. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study using healthcare claims data from a large New England health insurer. PATIENTS: All cystic fibrosis patients five years of age and older who began therapy with rhDNase in 1994 (the year it was first marketed in the US). Healthcare claims were compiled for six months prior to first receipt of rhDNase (pretreatment) and for 30 months subsequently (follow-up). Patients were stratified according to their level of rhDNase use during follow-up, based on whether it was above or below the median number of therapy days for the sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of rhDNase, all antibiotics, and all respiratory-related outpatient (physician, home health, hospital outpatient) and inpatient care were included. All costs were expressed on an annualized basis. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with cystic fibrosis who began treatment with rhDNase in 1994 met all entry criteria; the median number of therapy days over a 30-month period was 355. Among patients with low (i.e., below the median) rhDNase use (n = 12), mean \u00b1 SD annualized costs of respiratory-related care increased by almost $17000 between pretreatment and follow-up, from $29251 \u00b1 $37919 to $46109 \u00b1 $40944. Among high-use patients (n = 12), costs decreased by approximately $2500, from $37178 \u00b1 $48476 to $34592 \u00b1 $22591. The change in both groups was accounted for primarily by a change in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged use of rhDNase may reduce costs of respiratory-related care in patients with cystic fibrosis; further study is required, however, to confirm these findings.",

        "title": "Effects of hypertonic saline, alternate day and daily rhDNase on healthcare use, costs and outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis",
        "abstract": "Background: Daily recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) is an established but expensive treatment in cystic fibrosis (CF). An alternative lower cost therapy is hypertonic saline (HS), which has been shown to improve lung function in short term studies. This study compares the costs and consequences of daily rhDNase with alternate day rhDNase and HS in children with CF. Methods: In an open, randomised, crossover trial, 48 children with CF were allocated consecutively to 12 weeks of once daily 2.5 mg rhDNase, alternate day 2.5 mg rhDNase, and twice daily 5 ml 7% HS. Outcomes assessed included forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and quality of life. All healthcare resource use was prospectively recorded for each patient. Unit costs were collected and combined with resource use data to give the total health service costs per patient for each treatment strategy. Results: Daily rhDNase resulted in a significantly greater increase in mean FEV1 than HS (8%, 95% CI 2 to 14) but there was no significant difference in FEV1 between daily and alternate day rhDNase (2%, 95% CI \u20134 to 9). Over a 12 week period the mean incremental costs of daily rhDNase compared with HS was \u00a31409 (95% CI \u00a3440 to \u00a32318), and the incremental cost of using daily rather than alternate day rhDNase was \u00a3513 (95% CI \u2013\u00a3546 to \u00a31510). Conclusions: Daily rhDNase is more effective than 5 ml 7% HS twice daily delivered by jet nebuliser, but significantly increases healthcare costs. Administering rhDNase on an alternate day rather than a daily basis is as effective, with a potential for cost savings.",

        "abstract": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by ultrastructural defects of the cilia, which result in impaired mucociliary clearance. Although the incidence of PCD is low, early recognition and prompt management are important in order to prevent unnecessary morbidity, the progression of bronchiectasis and the deterioration of lung function. As the underlying defect in PCD cannot be corrected, the mainstay of therapy remains effective clearance of airway secretions and antibiotic therapy of respiratory tract infections. This paper highlights new developments in the field that have implications for the future management of PCD. These include \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, arginine, uridine-5\u2019-triphosphate, hypertonic saline and recombinant human DNase. It is to be hoped that these treatment modalities will have a therapeutic role in PCD.",

        "title": "Identification of drugs that restore primary cilium expression in cancer cells",
        "abstract": "The development of cancer is often accompanied by a loss of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular protrusion that functions as a cellular antenna and that puts a break on cell proliferation. Hence, restoration of the primary cilium in cancer cells may represent a novel promising approach to attenuate tumor growth. Using a high content analysis-based approach we screened a library of clinically evaluated compounds and marketed drugs for their ability to restore primary cilium expression in pancreatic ductal cancer cells. A diverse set of 118 compounds stimulating cilium expression was identified. These included glucocorticoids, fibrates and other nuclear receptor modulators, neurotransmitter regulators, ion channel modulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors, antibacterial compounds, protein inhibitors, microtubule modulators, and COX inhibitors. Certain compounds also dramatically affected the length of the cilium. For a selection of compounds (Clofibrate, Gefitinib, Sirolimus, Imexon and Dexamethasone) their ability to restore ciliogenesis was confirmed in a panel of human cancer cell line models representing different cancer types (pancreas, lung, kidney, breast). Most compounds attenuated cell proliferation, at least in part through induction of the primary cilium, as demonstrated by cilium removal using chloral hydrate. These findings reveal that several commonly used drugs restore ciliogenesis in cancer cells, and warrant further investigation of their antineoplastic properties.",

        "abstract": "Primary cilia (PC) are antenna\u2010like organelles that protrude from most mammalian cells. They are essential for the regulation of several signaling pathways such as Hedgehog and WNT. It is therefore not surprising that a dysfunction of PC is frequently associated with pathologies. Originally, PC were found to be involved in a variety of diseases commonly referred to as ciliopathies including cystic kidney diseases. Evidence is accumulating that PC play also an important role in cancer formation and regulation, which is the focus of this review.",

        "abstract": "Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that are typically present on cells during the G0 or G1-S/G2 phases of the cell cycle. Recent studies of glioblastoma (GBM) biopsies, a brain tumor that is notorious for its aggressive growth and resistance to treatment, show that many cells in the tumor lack cilia. At this point, it remains unclear whether primary cilia promote or suppress glioma tumorigenesis. In this review, we will discuss the different roles that have been proposed for primary cilia in glioma and how cilia may contribute to the resistance of these tumors to current therapies.",

        "title": "Cilium Expression Score Predicts Glioma Survival",
        "abstract": "The accurate classification, prognostication, and treatment of gliomas has been hindered by an existing cellular, genomic, and transcriptomic heterogeneity within individual tumors and their microenvironments. Traditional clustering is limited in its ability to distinguish heterogeneity in gliomas because the clusters are required to be exclusive and exhaustive. In contrast, biclustering can identify groups of co-regulated genes with respect to a subset of samples and vice versa. In this study, we analyzed 1,798 normal and tumor brain samples using an unsupervised biclustering approach. We identified co-regulated gene expression profiles that were linked to proximally located brain regions and detected upregulated genes in subsets of gliomas, associated with their histologic grade and clinical outcome. In particular, we present a cilium-associated signature that when upregulated in tumors is predictive of poor survival. We also introduce a risk score based on expression of 12 cilium-associated genes which is reproducibly informative of survival independent of other prognostic biomarkers. These results highlight the role of cilia in development and progression of gliomas and suggest potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for these highly aggressive tumors.",
