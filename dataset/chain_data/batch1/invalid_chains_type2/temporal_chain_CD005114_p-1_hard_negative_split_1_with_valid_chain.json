        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine if dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is beneficial in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 28 female patients with mild to moderate SLE were given DHEA 200 mg/day or placebo for 3 months. Outcomes included the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, patient's and physician's overall assessments of disease activity, and concurrent corticosteroid dosages (which were adjusted as clinically indicated).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the patients who were receiving DHEA, the SLEDAI score, patient's and physician's overall assessment of disease activity, and concurrent prednisone dosage decreased, while in the patients taking placebo, small increases were seen. The difference in patient's assessment between the groups was statistically significant (P = 0.022, adjusted). Lupus flares occurred more frequently in the placebo group (P = 0.053). Mild acne was a frequent side effect of DHEA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDHEA may be useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE. Further studies of DHEA in the treatment of SLE are warranted.",

        "abstract": "e recent extensive biomedical and lay public interest in T\" dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) stems from the frequent suggestion that the marked age-related decline in the plasma level of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in humans, discussed in this review, amounts to the development of a deficiency state for this hormone. Thus it has been proposed that replacement therapy with DHEA to restore youthful levels of DHEAS in older individuals might have beneficial effects on a variety of age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases, diabetes, immune dysfunction, muscular weakness, and depression. Moreover, numerous effects of DHEA supplementation have, in fact, been documented; they are quite wide-ranging, and it is difficult to discern a single molecular mechanism that might account for all of them.",
