        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe mechanism by which enhanced external counterpulsation therapy exerts its beneficial effects on chronic and symptomatic stable angina is largely unknown. To clarify the mechanism of action of enhanced external counterpulsation, we used(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography to evaluate myocardial perfusion.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThis was not a randomized controlled study. Eleven patients (eight male, age: 61.6+/-9.7) with angina pectoris underwent enhanced external counterpulsation therapy for 35 1 h sessions. They underwent a treadmill exercise test and(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography, both at rest and with dipyridamole, before and after enhanced external counterpulsation therapy. Neurohumoral factors and nitric oxide were also evaluated. Myocardial perfusion increased at rest after therapy (0.69+/-0.27 to 0.85+/-0.47 ml x min(-1) x g(-1), P<0.05). In ischaemic regions, particularly the anterior region, myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and coronary flow reserve improved significantly after therapy (at rest: 0.71+/-0.26 to 0.86+/-0.31;P<0.05, with dipyridamole: 1.26+/-0.65 to 1.84+/-0.94;P<0.02, coronary flow reserve: 1.75+/-0.24 to 2.08+/-0.28;P<0.04). Exercise time was prolonged and the time to 1-mm ST depression improved markedly (P<0.01). After therapy, nitric oxide levels increased (P<0.02) and neurohumoral factors decreased.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnhanced external counterpulsation therapy improved myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and was associated with an increased exercise tolerance with(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography and increased nitric oxide levels. These results suggest that one of the enhanced external counterpulsation mechanisms is development and recruitment of collateral vessels.",

        "title": "Treatment of Inoperable Coronary Disease and Refractory Angina: Spinal Stimulators, Epidurals, Gene Therapy, Transmyocardial Laser, and Counterpulsation",
        "abstract": "Intractable angina from refractory coronary disease is a severe form of myocardial ischemia for which revascularization provides no prognostic benefit. Inoperable coronary disease is also accompanied by a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of myocardial dystrophy from a chronic alteration of the cardiac sympathetic tone and sensitization of damaged cardiac tissues. Several adjunctive treatments have demonstrated efficacy when revascularization is either unsuccessful or contraindicated. Spinal cord stimulation modifies the neurologic input and output of the heart by delivering a very low dose of electrical current to the dorsal columns of the high thoracic spinal cord. Neural fibers then release CGRP and other endogenous peptides to the coronary circulation reducing myocardial oxygen demand and enhancing vasodilation of collaterals to improve the myocardial blood flow of the most diseased regions of the heart. Randomized study has shown the survival data at five years is comparable to bypass for high-risk patients. Transmyocardial laser revascularization creates small channels into ischemic myocardium in an effort to enhance flow though studies have shown no improvement in prognosis over medical therapy alone. Enhanced external counterpulsation uses noninvasive pneumatic compression of the legs to improve diastolic filling of the coronary vessels and promote development of collateral flow. The compressor regimen requires thirty-five hours of therapy over a seven-week treatment period. Therapeutic angiogenesis requires injection of cytokines to promote neovascularization and improve myocardial perfusion into the regions affected by chronic ischemia. Phase 3 trials are pending. High thoracic epidural blockade produces a rapid and potent sympatholysis, coronary vasodilation and reduced myocardial oxygen demand in refractory coronary disease. This technique can be used as an adjunct to bypass surgery or medical therapy in chronic or acute unstable angina. Epidurals are easy to perform and often available for outpatient or inpatient use. The rapid anti-ischemic effect may complement therapeutic angiogenesis or other interventions with delayed onset to clinical benefit. A new era for interventional and implant cardiology is beginning to emerge as more clinicians, including cardiologists, gradually learn new procedures to safely provide more therapeutic options for patients suffering refractory angina.",

The hypothesis that pretreatment with angiogenic therapy induced by transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) might improve ischemic myocardial function, followed by cell transplantation was tested.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAfter the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, rats were treated with TMR. Two weeks, embryonic stem cells were transplanted into an injured heart. Four weeks after cell transplantation, cardiac function was assessed by homodynamic measurements. Capillary density and infarct size in the infarct myocardium were measured by using a previous experimental method. Graft histology and morphology was also evaluated. Four weeks after the operation, myocardial infarct (MI) rats treated with TMR and cell transplantation showed significantly higher cardiac function in hemodynamic measurements (p < 0.01) than that of MI rats receiving cell transplantation or TMR alone. A significant increase in capillary density and reduction in infarct size was observed in the MI rats that received a combined therapy (p < 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPretreatment of an infarct region of the heart with angiogenesis induced by TMR can enhance the efficacy of a cell graft and attenuate the progression of cardiac dysfunction in the rat model.",

        "abstract": "We hypothesized that pretreatment of an infarcted heart by mechanical transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) before transplantation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) or BMC-expressing angiogenic growth factors would increase transplanted BMC survival and enhance myocardial repair. Female Lewis rats underwent coronary ligation 3 wk before creation of 10 needle TMR channels (3 groups) or no TMR (3 groups), followed by transplantation of 3 x 10(6) male donor BMCs, BMC transfected with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (BMC + VBI), or medium alone. At 1, 3, and 7 days, we evaluated transplanted cell survival, vascular densities, and left ventricular (LV) function (N = 4 per group x 6 groups x 3 time points). At 3 days, vascular densities in the scar were increased by TMR + BMC + VBI and by BMC + VBI (P < 0.05), and at 7 days, vascular densities were greatest in rats receiving TMR + BMC + VBI (P < 0.05). Transplanted cell survival at 3 and 7 days was increased by TMR and by BMC + VBI. Combined therapy with TMR + BMC + VBI resulted in the greatest cell survival at 3 days (P < 0.05) versus BMC. After 7 days, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was lowest in rats receiving neither BMC nor TMR and greatest in rats receiving TMR + BMC + VBI (P = 0.004). We concluded that mechanical pretreatment of infarcted myocardium by TMR enhances the effect of subsequent cell-based gene therapy on transplanted cell survival, angiogenesis, and LV function. Scar pretreatment with TMR combined with cell-based multigene therapy may maximize myocardial repair.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: The regenerative potential of the heart is insufficient to fully restore functioning myocardium after injury, motivating the quest for a cell-based replacement strategy. Bone marrow\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity for cardiac repair that appears to exceed their capacity for differentiation into cardiac myocytes. Objective: Here, we test the hypothesis that bone marrow derived MSCs stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs) as part of their regenerative repertoire. Methods And Results: Female Yorkshire pigs (n=31) underwent experimental myocardial infarction (MI), and 3 days later, received transendocardial injections of allogeneic male bone marrow\u2013derived MSCs, MSC concentrated conditioned medium (CCM), or placebo (Plasmalyte). A no-injection control group was also studied. MSCs engrafted and differentiated into cardiomyocytes and vascular structures. In addition, endogenous c-kit+ CSCs increased 20-fold in MSC-treated animals versus controls (P<0.001), there was a 6-fold increase in GATA-4+ CSCs in MSC versus control (P<0.001), and mitotic myocytes increased 4-fold (P=0.005). Porcine endomyocardial biopsies were harvested and plated as organotypic cultures in the presence or absence of MSC feeder layers. In vitro, MSCs stimulated c-kit+ CSCs proliferation into enriched populations of adult cardioblasts that expressed Nkx2\u20135 and troponin I. Conclusions: MSCs stimulate host CSCs, a new mechanism of action underlying successful cell-based therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are an attractive cell type for tissue regeneration, and autologous CDCs are being tested clinically. However, autologous therapy necessitates patient-specific tissue harvesting and cell processing, with delays to therapy and possible variations in cell potency. The use of allogeneic CDCs, if safe and effective, would obviate such limitations. We compared syngeneic and allogeneic CDC transplantation in rats from immunologically-mismatched inbred strains. Methods and Results\u2014 In vitro, CDCs expressed major histocompatibility complex class I but not class II antigens or B7 costimulatory molecules. In mixed-lymphocyte cocultures, allogeneic CDCs elicited negligible lymphocyte proliferation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. In vivo, syngeneic and allogeneic CDCs survived at similar levels in the infarcted rat heart 1 week after delivery, but few syngeneic (and even fewer allogeneic) CDCs remained at 3 weeks. Allogeneic CDCs induced a transient, mild, local immune reaction in the heart, without histologically evident rejection or systemic immunogenicity. Improvements in cardiac structure and function, sustained for 6 months, were comparable with syngeneic and allogeneic CDCs. Allogeneic CDCs stimulated endogenous regenerative mechanisms (cardiomyocyte cycling, recruitment of c-kit+ cells, angiogenesis) and increased myocardial vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and hepatocyte growth factor equally with syngeneic CDCs. Conclusions\u2014 Allogeneic CDC transplantation without immunosuppression is safe, promotes cardiac regeneration, and improves heart function in a rat myocardial infarction model, mainly through stimulation of endogenous repair mechanisms. The indirect mechanism of action rationalizes the persistence of benefit despite the evanescence of transplanted cell survival. This work motivates the testing of allogeneic human CDCs as a potential off-the-shelf product for cellular cardiomyoplasty.",

However, whether the cells of the newly formed myocardium originate from the proliferation of adult cardiomyocytes or from the differentiation of endogenous stem cells remains unknown. Using genetic fate mapping to mark resident myocytes in combination with long\u2010term BrdU pulsing, we investigated the origins of postnatal cardiomyogenesis in the normal, infarcted and cell\u2010treated adult mammalian heart. In the normal mouse heart, cardiomyocyte turnover occurs predominantly through proliferation of resident cardiomyocytes at a rate of \u223c1.3\u20134%/year. After MI, new cardiomyocytes arise from both progenitors as well as pre\u2010existing cardiomyocytes. Transplantation of CDCs upregulates host cardiomyocyte cycling and recruitment of endogenous progenitors, while boosting heart function and increasing viable myocardium.

        "abstract": "Background The regenerative potential of cardiosphere\u2010derived cells (CDCs) for ischemic heart disease has been demonstrated in mice, rats, pigs, and a recently completed clinical trial (CADUCEUS). CDCs are CD105+ stromal cells of intrinsic cardiac origin, but the antigenic characteristics of the active fraction remain to be defined. CDCs contain a small minority of c\u2010kit+ cells, which have been argued to be cardiac progenitors, and a variable fraction of CD90+ cells whose bioactivity is unclear. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the CADUCEUS trial and a prospective mouse study to elucidate the roles of c\u2010kit+ and CD90+ cells in human CDCs. Here, we show, surprisingly, that c\u2010kit expression has no relationship to CDCs' therapeutic efficacy in humans, and depletion of c\u2010kit+ cells does not undermine the structural and functional benefits of CDCs in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). In contrast, CD90 expression negatively correlates with the therapeutic benefit of CDCs in humans (ie, higher CD90 expression associated with lower efficacy). Depletion of CD90+ cells augments the functional potency of CDCs in murine MI. CD90\u2212 CDCs secrete lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion The majority population of CDCs (CD105+/CD90\u2212/c\u2010kit\u2212) constitutes the active fraction, both in terms of therapeutic efficacy and in the ability to undergo cardiomyogenic differentiation. The c\u2010kit+ fraction is neither necessary for, nor contributory to, the regenerative efficacy of CDCs.",

        "title": "Cardiosphere-Derived Cells and Ischemic Heart Failure.",
        "abstract": "After a myocardial infarction, heart tissue becomes irreversibly damaged, leading to scar formation and inevitably ischemic heart failure. Of the many available interventions after a myocardial infarction, such as percutaneous intervention or pharmacological optimization, none can reverse the ischemic insult on the heart and restore cardiac function. Thus, the only available cure for patients with scarred myocardium is allogeneic heart transplantation, which comes with extensive costs, risks, and complications. However, multiple studies have shown that the heart is, in fact, not an end-stage organ and that there are endogenous mechanisms in place that have the potential to spark regeneration. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential tool to tap into and activate this endogenous framework. Particularly promising are stem cells derived from cardiac tissue itself, referred to as cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs). CDCs can be extracted and isolated from the patient's myocardium and then administered by intramyocardial injection or intracoronary infusion. After early success in the animal model, multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of autologous CDC therapy in humans. Clinical trials with allogeneic CDCs showed early promising results and pose a potential \"off-the-shelf\" therapy for patients in the acute setting after a myocardial infarction. The mechanism responsible for CDC-induced cardiac regeneration seems to be a combination of triggering native cardiomyocyte proliferation and recruitment of endogenous progenitor cells, which most prominently occurs via paracrine effects. A further understanding of the mediators involved in paracrine signaling can help with the development of a stem cell-free therapy, with all the benefits and none of the associated complications.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nExtracellular vesicles secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCev) polarize macrophages toward a distinctive phenotype with enhanced phagocytic capacity (MCDCev). These changes underlie cardioprotection by CDCev and by the parent CDCs, notably attenuating the no-reflow phenomenon following myocardial infarction, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that MCDCev are especially effective at scavenging debris from dying cells (ie, efferocytosis) to attenuate irreversible damage post-myocardial infarction. Approach and Results: In vitro efferocytosis assays with bone marrow-derived macrophage, and in vivo transgenic rodent models of myocardial infarction, demonstrate enhanced apoptotic cell clearance with MCDCev. CDCev exposure induces sustained MerTK expression in MCDCev through extracellular vesicle transfer of microRNA-26a (via suppression of Adam17); the cardioprotective response is lost in animals deficient in MerTK. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed phagocytic pathway activation in MCDCev, with increased expression of complement factor C1qa, a phagocytosis facilitator.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTogether, these data demonstrate that extracellular vesicle modulation of MerTK and C1qa expression leads to enhanced macrophage efferocytosis and cardioprotection.",

        "explanation": "This paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the mechanisms of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) and their extracellular vesicles (CDCev) in cardioprotection. The source paper discusses the potential of CDCs in cardiac regeneration, and this paper explores a specific mechanism by which CDCs exert their effects."

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Objective: HDL (high-density lipoprotein) can exert both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects in macrophages due to its ability to induce cholesterol depletion. Because cholesterol depletion also increases sheddase activity of the membrane protease ADAM17 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17) in other cells, we examined if ADAM17 plays a role in HDL\u2019s effects on inflammatory processes in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Approach and Results: Sorted peritoneal macrophages from human APOA1 (apolipoprotein A1) transgenic LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor-deficient (APOA1Tg; Ldlr\u2212/\u2212) mice with and without myeloid cell-targeted ADAM17-deficiency were studied in parallel with wildtype and ADAM17-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with HDL in vitro. HDL increased ADAM17 expression and activity in macrophages. Furthermore, ADAM17-deficient macrophages exhibited reduced expression of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette A1) and reduced cholesterol efflux and were cholesterol loaded. This was caused by the absence of shedding of TNF\u03b1, a major ADAM17 substrate. Sorted thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages freshly isolated from APOA1Tg; Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice, which have higher HDL levels than Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 controls, showed reduced expression of interferon-inducible genes in response to lipopolysaccharide or interferon \u03b2, but exacerbated proinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide for Tnfa, Cxcl1, Ccl2, and Il1b, phenocopying cells stimulated with HDL in vitro. These effects were all prevented in ADAM17-deficient macrophages and associated with lower concentrations of large HDL particles in APOA1Tg; Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 mice with myeloid cell-targeted ADAM17-deficiency. Conclusions: The increased cholesterol loading of ADAM17-deficient macrophages prevents both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory responses of HDL. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for ADAM17 in maintaining cholesterol efflux in macrophages, thereby regulating the immune functions of these cells.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the role of ADAM17 in regulating cholesterol efflux and inflammatory pathways in macrophages. The source paper mentions ADAM17 as a suppressor of microRNA-26a, which induces MerTK expression. Therefore, this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper."
