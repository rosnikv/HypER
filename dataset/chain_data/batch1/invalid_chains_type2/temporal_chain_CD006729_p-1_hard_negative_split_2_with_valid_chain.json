Thirty symptomatic patients were invited to undergo objective and subjective assessment of the ability to instill artificial tears with and without the Opticare.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred twenty-seven (37%) patients had had symptoms lasting at least 3 months at some time, and 85 (25%) were currently symptomatic. Many patients found difficulty using artificial tears due to problems aiming and squeezing the bottles as a result of impaired upper limb function. The Opticare statistically significantly improved the ability to squeeze out drops and get them in the eye.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Opticare device allows patients with functional impairment of the upper limb to instill artificial tears, resulting in less wastage of tears and increased independence and compliance.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate sicca symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with respect to constancy, temporal changes of prevalence, and possible risk factors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospective cohort study of 70 patients with RA was conducted over 5 years. The main variables of interest were the 6 questions on sicca symptoms used in the preliminary European criteria for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourteen patients were lost to followup. We found that 84.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 59.5-95.8) of the patients reporting sicca symptoms at baseline also reported them at followup. During the study period, sicca symptoms increased by 52.6% in general (P = 0.02) and by 80.0% for the ocular components (P = 0.04). Sicca symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 8.35, 95% CI 1.91-36.49) and pain (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.07) at baseline were identified as independent predictive factors for sicca symptoms at followup.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSicca symptoms in patients with RA are remarkably constant over time. There is also a substantial time-dependent increase in the prevalence of such symptoms. As the prevalence of ocular sicca symptoms in general populations tend to level out with age, there seems to be a disease-related increase of ocular symptoms over time in patients with RA. Present pain and sicca symptoms constitute risk factors for future sicca symptoms.",

        "abstract": "It is thought that in genetically predisposed individuals, autoimmune diseases can be promoted and/or exacerbated by viruses, bacteria, or parasitic infectious agents. Pathogens can activate innate immune response interacting with Toll-like receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecules. As a consequence of infections, a prolonged inflammatory response may occur leading to chronic inflammation with activation of adaptive immune response. In addition, the defective clearance of apoptotic infected cells, which progress- es to secondary necrosis, can foster the autoimmune reactions. Although numerous data from humans and/or animal models support the hypothesis of a direct contribution of pathogens to the induction of the disease, some infectious agents are able to prevent autoimmune disorders. In this review, data on the innate and adaptive immune response induced by pathogens are summarized, focusing on the possible protective or non-protective role of infections in the development of autoimmune diseases.",

        "title": "Mercury Induces an Unopposed Inflammatory Response in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Vitro",
        "abstract": "Background The human immune response to mercury is not well characterized despite the body of evidence that suggests that Hg can modulate immune responses, including the induction of autoimmune disease in some mouse models. Dysregulation of cytokine signaling appears to play an important role in the etiology of Hg-induced autoimmunity in animal models. Objectives In this study, we systematically investigated the human immune response to Hg in vitro in terms of cytokine release. Methods Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 20 volunteers who donated blood six separate times. PBMCs were cultured with lipopolysaccharide and concentrations of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) up to 200 nM. Seven cytokines representing important pathways in physiologic and pathologic immune responses were measured in supernatants. We used multilevel models to account for the intrinsic clustering in the cytokine data due to experimental design. Results We found a consistent increase in the release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and concurrent decrease in release of the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1-receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-10 in human PBMCs treated with subcytotoxic concentrations of HgCl2. IL-4, IL-17, and interferon-\u03b3 increased in a concentration\u2013response manner. These results were replicated in a second, independently recruited population of 20 different volunteers. Conclusions Low concentrations of HgCl2 affect immune function in human cells by dysregulation of cytokine signaling pathways, with the potential to influence diverse health outcomes such as susceptibility to infectious disease or risk of autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "Background: Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with neurodevelopmental and immune system effects. An informative biomarker of Hg-induced immunotoxicity could aid studies on the potential contribution to immune-related health effects. Objectives: Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that methylmercury (MeHg) exposures affect levels of serum biomarkers and to examine interactions between Hg and selenium (Se) in terms of these responses. Methods: This cross-sectional epidemiological study assessed adults living along the Tapaj\u00f3s River, a system long affected by MeHg. We measured antinuclear (ANA) and antinucleolar (ANoA) autoantibody levels and eight cytokines in serum samples (n = 232). Total Hg (including MeHg) and Se were measured in blood, plasma, hair, and urine. Results: The median (range) total Hg concentrations were 14.1 \u03bcg/g (1.1\u201362.4), 53.5 \u03bcg/L (4.3\u2013288.9), 8.8 \u03bcg/L (0.2\u201340), and 3.0 \u03bcg/L (0.2\u201316.1) for hair, blood, plasma, and urine, respectively. Elevated titers of ANA (but not ANoA) were positively associated with MeHg exposure (log-transformed, for blood and plasma), unadjusted [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 6.2] and adjusted for sex and age (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.5). Proinflammatory [interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-\u00a9], anti-inflammatory (IL-4), and IL-17 cytokine levels were increased with MeHg exposure; however, in the subset of the population with elevated ANA, proinflammatory IL-1\u00ae, IL-6, IFN-\u00a9, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u2329 and anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokine levels were decreased with MeHg exposure. Although Se status was associated with MeHg level (correlation coefficient = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.29, 1.43), Se status was not associated with any changes in ANA and did not modify associations between Hg and ANA titers. Conclusions: MeHg exposure was associated with an increased ANA and changes in serum cytokine profile. Moreover, alterations in serum cytokine profiles differed based on ANA response, suggesting a specific phenotype of MeHg susceptibility. Further research on the potential health implications of these observed immunological changes is warranted.",

        "title": "Evidence on the Human Health Effects of Low-Level Methylmercury Exposure",
        "abstract": "Background: Methylmercury (MeHg) is a known neuro-toxicant. Emerging evidence indicates it may have adverse effects on the neuro-logic and other body systems at common low levels of exposure. Impacts of MeHg exposure could vary by individual susceptibility or be confounded by bene-ficial nutrients in fish containing MeHg. Despite its global relevance, synthesis of the available literature on low-level MeHg exposure has been limited. Objectives: We undertook a synthesis of the current knowledge on the human health effects of low-level MeHg exposure to provide a basis for future research efforts, risk assessment, and exposure remediation policies worldwide. Data sources and extraction: We reviewed the published literature for original human epidemio-logic research articles that reported a direct biomarker of mercury exposure. To focus on high-quality studies and those specifically on low mercury exposure, we excluded case series, as well as studies of populations with unusually high fish consumption (e.g., the Seychelles), marine mammal consumption (e.g., the Faroe Islands, circumpolar, and other indigenous populations), or consumption of highly contaminated fish (e.g., gold-mining regions in the Amazon). Data synthesis: Recent evidence raises the possibility of effects of low-level MeHg exposure on fetal growth among susceptible subgroups and on infant growth in the first 2 years of life. Low-level effects of MeHg on neuro-logic outcomes may differ by age, sex, and timing of exposure. No clear pattern has been observed for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) risk across populations or for specific CVD end points. For the few studies evaluating immunologic effects associated with MeHg, results have been inconsistent. Conclusions: Studies targeted at identifying potential mechanisms of low-level MeHg effects and characterizing individual susceptibility, sexual dimorphism, and non-linearity in dose response would help guide future prevention, policy, and regulatory efforts surrounding MeHg exposure.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Exposure to environmental toxins is a 21st century global health problem that is often the result of dietary intake. Although efforts are made to reduce dietary toxin levels, they are often unsuccessful, warranting research into novel methods to reduce host exposure. Food-grade microbes that can be delivered to the gastrointestinal tract and that are capable of sequestering toxins present a safe and cost-effective intervention. We sought to investigate the potential for probiotic-supplemented yogurt to lower heavy metal levels in at-risk populations of pregnant women and in children in Mwanza, Tanzania, and to examine the microbiome in relation to toxin levels. Two populations suspected to have high toxic metal exposures were studied. A group of 44 school-aged children was followed over 25 days, and 60 pregnant women were followed over their last two trimesters until birth. A yogurt containing 1010 CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 per 250 g was administered, while control groups received either whole milk or no intervention. Changes in blood metal levels were assessed, and the gut microbiomes of the children were profiled by analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing via the Ion Torrent platform. The children and pregnant women in the study were found to have elevated blood levels of lead and mercury compared to age- and sex-matched Canadians. Consumption of probiotic yogurt had a protective effect against further increases in mercury (3.2 nmol/liter; P = 0.035) and arsenic (2.3 nmol/liter; P = 0.011) blood levels in the pregnant women, but this trend was not statistically significant in the children. Elevated blood lead was associated with increases in Succinivibrionaceae and Gammaproteobacteria relative abundance levels in stool. IMPORTANCE Probiotic food produced locally represents a nutritious and affordable means for people in some developing countries to counter exposures to toxic metals. Further research and field trials are warranted to explore this approach in countries where communities are located near mining sites and agricultural areas, two types of areas where toxins are likely to be elevated.

        "title": "Oral Administration of Probiotics Inhibits Absorption of the Heavy Metal Cadmium by Protecting the Intestinal Barrier",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is an environmental pollutant that causes adverse health effects in humans and animals. Our previous work demonstrated that oral administration of probiotics can significantly inhibit Cd absorption in the intestines of mice, but further evidence is needed to gain insights into the related protection mode. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether probiotics can inhibit Cd absorption through routes other than the Cd binding, with a focus on gut barrier protection. In the in vitro assay, both the intervention and therapy treatments of Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 alleviated Cd-induced cytotoxicity in the human intestinal cell line HT-29 and protected the disruption of tight junctions in the cell monolayers. In a mouse model, probiotics with either good Cd-binding or antioxidative ability increased fecal Cd levels and decreased Cd accumulation in the tissue of Cd-exposed mice. Compared with the Cd-only group, cotreatment with probiotics also reversed the disruption of tight junctions, alleviated inflammation, and decreased the intestinal permeability of mice. L. plantarum CCFM8610, a strain with both good Cd binding and antioxidative abilities, exhibited significantly better protection than the other two strains. These results suggest that along with initial intestinal Cd sequestration, probiotics can inhibit Cd absorption by protecting the intestinal barrier, and the protection is related to the alleviation of Cd-induced oxidative stress. A probiotic with both good Cd-binding and antioxidative capacities can be used as a daily supplement for the prevention of oral Cd exposure. IMPORTANCE The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is an environmental pollutant that causes adverse health effects in humans and animals. For the general population, food and drinking water are the main sources of Cd exposure due to the biomagnification of Cd within the food chain; therefore, the intestinal tract is the first organ that is susceptible to Cd contamination. Moreover, Cd exposure causes the disruption of the intestinal barrier and further induces the amplification of Cd absorption. The present study confirms that, along with initial intestinal Cd sequestration, oral administration of probiotics can inhibit Cd absorption by protecting the intestinal barrier. A probiotic with both good Cd-binding and antioxidative capacities can be used as a daily supplement for the prevention of oral Cd exposure.",

        "abstract": "Aims: Lactobacillus strains have protective effects against heavy metals while relieving oxidative stress and modulating the immune response. Mechanisms that ameliorate heavy metal toxicity and the relationship between probiotics and gut barrier protection in the process of heavy metal pathogenesis was poorly understood. Methods and Results: In this study, Lactobacillus brevis 23017 (LAB, L. brevis 23017), a selected probiotics strain with strong mercury binding capacities, was applied to evaluate the efficiency against mercury toxicity in a mouse model. Histopathological results along with HE stains show that L. brevis 23017 protects the integrity of the small intestinal villus, which slows weight loss in response to Hg exposure. The qRT-PCR results demonstrate that L. brevis 23017 maintains a normal mucosal barrier via modulation of tight junction proteins. Importantly, the present study demonstrates that L. brevis 23017 effectively ameliorates injury of the small intestine by reducing intestinal inflammation and alleviating oxidative stress in animal models. Moreover, L. brevis 23017 blocks oxidative stress and inflammation through MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, as shown by western blot.

        "abstract": "Probiotic bacteria have the ability to modulate host immune responses and have potent therapeutic functional effects against several diseases, including inflammatory diseases. However, beneficial effects of probiotics are strain specific and their interactions with host immune cells to modulate inflammatory response are largely unknown. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which are the first line of defense against invading pathogens, and connects between commensals/probiotics and immune system; therefore, in this study, we used human IECs to assess the probiotic effects of three selected Lactobacillus strains in vitro. An HT-29 colonic epithelial cell and HT-29/blood mononuclear cells co-culture system were stimulated with Lactobacillus followed by Salmonella for different hours, after which the mRNA level of cytokines, \u03b2-defensin-2 and negative regulators for TLR signaling and protein levels of ZO-1 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. L. brevis decreased Salmonella induced IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels, whereas L. pentosus suppressed IL-6 and MCP-1 in HT-29 cells. Moreover, L. brevis was able to increase the mRNA levels of A20, Tollip, SIGIRR and IRAKM, while L. pentosus reduced the levels of A20, and IRAKM in response to Salmonella. In addition, decrease in protein level of TNF-\u03b1 and increase in mRNA level of IL-10 was observed in L. brevis and L. pentosus treated HT-29 cells. Lactobacillus strains were differentially modulated ZO-1 and p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 in HT-29 cells treated with Salmonella. Overall, the results of this study indicate that Lactobacillus strains attenuate Salmonella induced inflammatory responses through beneficial modulation of TLR negative regulators and the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

        "abstract": "Acute non-typhoidal salmonellosis (NTS) caused by Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STM) is among the most prevalent of foodborne diseases. A global rising of antibiotic resistance strains of STM raises an urgent need for alternative methods to control this important pathogen. Major human food animals which harbor STM in their gut are cattle, swine, and poultry. Previous studies showed that the probiotic Limosilactobacillus (Lactobacillus) reuteri KUB-AC5 (AC5) exhibited anti-Salmonella activities in chicken by modulating gut microbiota and the immune response. However, the immunobiotic effect of AC5 in a mammalian host is still not known. Here, we investigated the anti-Salmonella and anti-inflammatory effects of AC5 on STM infection using a mouse colitis model. Three groups of C57BL/6 mice (prophylactic, therapeutic, and combined) were fed with 109 colony-forming units (cfu) AC5 daily for 7, 4, and 11 days, respectively. Then, the mice were challenged with STM compared to the untreated group. By using a specific primer pair, we found that AC5 can transiently colonize mouse gut (colon, cecum, and ileum). Interestingly, AC5 reduced STM gut proliferation and invasion together with attenuated gut inflammation and systemic dissemination in mice. The decreased STM numbers in mouse gut lumen, gut tissues, and spleen possibly came from longer AC5 feeding duration and/or the combinatorial (direct and indirect inhibitory) effect of AC5 on STM. However, AC5 attenuated inflammation (both in the gut and in the spleen) with no difference between these three approaches. This study demonstrated that AC5 confers both direct and indirect inhibitory effects on STM in the inflamed gut.",

        "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri is a probiotic with bacteriostatic effects, which can effectively inhibit the activity of pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of pathogens by L. reuteri in intestinal cells remains unclear. Using the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC-J2 as a model, we combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq methods to delineate the porcine genome-wide changes in biological processes and chromatin accessibility in IPEC-J2 cells stimulated by Salmonella enterica BNCC186354, as well as L. reuteri ATCC 53608. Overall, we found that many porcine transcripts were altered after S. enterica BNCC186354 treatment, while L. reuteri ATCC 53608 treatment partially restored this alteration, such as salmonella infection and PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Combined analysis of these two datasets revealed that 26 genes with similar trends overlapped between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In addition, we identified potential host functional transcription factors (TFs), such as GATA1, TAL1, TBP, RUNX1, Gmeb1, Gfi1b, RARA, and RXRG, in IPEC-J2 cells that might play a critical role and are targeted by L. reuteri ATCC 53608. Moreover, we verified that PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and apoptosis pathways are potentially regulated by S. enterica BNCC186354 but restored by L. reuteri ATCC 53608. The PI3K/AKT pathway was activated by L. reuteri ATCC 53608, thereby potentially inhibiting S. enterica BNCC186354 infection. In conclusion, our data provide new insights into the expression pattern of functional genes and the epigenetic alterations in IPEC-J2 cells underlying the bacteriostatic action of L. reuteri ATCC 53608.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the molecular mechanism of Lactobacillus reuteri's inhibition of Salmonella enterica in intestinal cells. Although it explores a different aspect of the Lactobacillus reuteri and Salmonella enterica interaction, it builds upon the source paper's findings of Lactobacillus reuteri's anti-Salmonella effects, thus using the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis."

        "title": "The Metabolic Pathway of Bile Secretion Is Vulnerable to Salmonella enterica Exposure in Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells",
        "abstract": "Simple Summary Salmonella enterica is a zoonotic pathogen in humans that causes gastrointestinal infections or more serious infections. Second only to poultry, pigs are the most common source of zoonotic Salmonella enterica infections. Although current pig farm disinfection is very strict, its positive detection rate is still very high. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics has been observed in various bacteria in recent decades, requiring the use of alternative strategies to control pathogens. Therefore, comprehension of the pathogenic mechanism of Salmonella enterica in the pig gut is imperative, as it will greatly facilitate the advancement of preventive and therapeutic approaches for combating Salmonella enterica. By exploring the transcriptional regulation of intestinal cells in response to Salmonella enterica infection, we can find the key genes and pathways of host cells in resistance to Salmonella enterica infection, which will provide theoretical support for disease resistance breeding in pigs. Abstract Pigs can be colonized with Salmonella enterica and become established carriers. However, the mechanisms of the host\u2019s response to Salmonella enterica infection are largely unclear. This study was constructed with the Salmonella enterica infection model in vitro using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Transcriptome profiling of IPEC-J2 cells was carried out to characterize the effect of Salmonella enterica infection and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, in which LPS-induced inflammation was a positive control. At first, Salmonella enterica infection increased the cell apoptosis rate and induced an inflammation response in IPEC-J2. Then, the up-regulated genes were enriched in metabolic pathways, such as those for bile secretion and mineral absorption, while down-regulated genes were enriched in immune-related pathways, such as the Toll-like receptor signaling and p53 signaling pathways. Moreover, we found 368 up-regulated genes and 101 down-regulated genes in common. Then, an integrative analysis of the transcriptomic profile under Salmonella enterica infection and LPS treatment was conducted, and eight up-regulated genes and one down-regulated gene were detected. Among them, AQP8 is one critical gene of the bile secretion pathway, and its mRNA and protein expression were increased significantly under Salmonella enterica infection and LPS treatment. Thus, the AQP8 gene and bile secretion pathway may be important in IPEC-J2 cells under Salmonella enterica infection or LPS treatment.",
