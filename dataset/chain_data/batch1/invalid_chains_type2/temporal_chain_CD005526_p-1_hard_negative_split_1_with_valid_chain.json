        "title": "A controlled trial of cyclosporine in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis.",
        "abstract": "Primary biliary cirrhosis is a progressive disease of the liver characterized by the immunologic destruction of bile ducts; effective therapy is lacking. We therefore evaluated the safety and efficacy of low-dose cyclosporine in 29 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis without evidence of damage to the lobular architecture (precirrhotic disease) or portal hypertension. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cyclosporine (4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo. After one year 17 of the 19 patients assigned to cyclosporine had improvement or stability in their degree of fatigue, and 18 in their degree of pruritus. In contrast, among the 10 patients assigned to placebo, fatigue increased in 4 (P less than 0.06) and pruritus worsened in 6 (P less than 0.001). Those assigned to cyclosporine also had significant decreases in serum levels of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma globulin, and the titer of antimitochondrial antibodies. For the 20 patients who have completed two years in the study, liver biopsies (coded specimens) showed evidence of histologic progression in only 1 of 13 patients in the cyclosporine group, as compared with 5 of 7 in the placebo group (P less than 0.003). No patient has permanently discontinued cyclosporine because of side effects; however, signs of nephrotoxicity developed in 12 of 19, and 9 of 19 had increased blood pressure. We conclude that in patients with precirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine is promising and deserves further evaluation.",

Specifically, the T1 times were 695 \u00b176 ms for the treated group, versus 748 \u00b1 61 ms in the controls; P= 0.095.

        "abstract": "C6 glioma cells were implanted in the left caudate nucleus of the rat brain. Histologic studies confirmed the presence of neoplastic tissue surrounded by a thin edematous region. Proton magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) fast imaging, using continuous wave off\u2010resonance irradiation, was performed in vivo at 4.7 T with the rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence. The observed MTC allowed very clear distinction of the tumoral region, in which magnetization transfer (MT) ratios were lower than in healthy tissues. Contrasts were analyzed as a function of the offset frequency and the amplitude of the radiofrequency (RF) irradiation. The contrast was higher between the contralateral basal ganglia and the tumor and lower between the tumor and the temporal lobe. Modeling of MT in the three brain regions was performed using a system including free water and a pool of protons with restricted motions. The rate of exchange between the two pools exhibited a decreasing hierarchy from the basal ganglia to the tumor. T2B values for the immobile protons ranged from 9.3 \u03bcsec in the basal ganglia to 7.5 \u03bcsec for the glioma. The acquisition conditions leading to the highest contrasts between the tumor and the healthy tissues correspond to 3,000 Hz offset frequency and 300 to 700 Hz RF irradiation amplitude.",

The tumor status was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and conventional histology. The glioma\u2010bearing rats were infused for 1 h with a [1\u201013C]glucose solution. Perchloric acid extracts of the tumor and the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were analyzed by 13C\u2010NMR spectroscopy. The 13C\u2010labeling patterns in compounds, mainly amino acids, indicated no drastic modification of carbon metabolism in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, as compared with control rats, whereas profound metabolic differences between brain tissue and tumor were observed. Glutamine C4 enrichment was lower in the glioma than in the brain [mean \u00b1 SD values, 5.4 \u00b1 2.3 (n = 5) and 15.0 \u00b1 0.8% (n = 10), respectively] and also lower than the glutamate C4 enrichment in the glioma (mean \u00b1 SD value, 22.6 \u00b1 4.2%; n = 5), indicating that tumor glutamine was neither synthesized inside the glioma nor taken up from the surrounding brain. The glutamine C4 enrichment in the serum (6.7 \u00b1 0.5%; n = 10) suggested that the glioma imported glutamine from the blood, a process probably connected with angiogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Lactate metabolism in the adult rat brain was investigated in relation with the concept of lactate trafficking between astrocytes and neurons. Wistar rats were infused intravenously with a solution containing either [3\u201013C]lactate (534 mM) or both glucose (750 mM) and [3\u201013C]lactate (534 mM). The time courses of both the concentration and 13C enrichment of blood glucose and lactate were determined. The data indicated the occurrence of [3\u201013C]lactate recycling through liver gluconeogenesis. The yield of glucose labeling was, however, reduced when using the glucose\u2010containing infusate. After a 20\u2010min or 1\u2010h infusion, perchloric acid extracts of the brain tissue were prepared and subsequently analyzed by 13C\u2010 and 1H\u2010observed/13C\u2010edited NMR spectroscopy. The 13C labeling of amino acids indicated that [3\u201013C]lactate was metabolized in the brain. Based on the alanine C3 enrichment, lactate contribution to brain metabolism amounted to 35% under the most favorable conditions used. By contrast with what happens with [1\u201013C]glucose metabolism, no difference in glutamine C2 and C3 labeling was evidenced, indicating that lactate was metabolized in a compartment deprived of pyruvate carboxylase activity. This result confirms, for the first time from an in vivo study, that lactate is more specifically a neuronal substrate.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports a crucial role for glial metabolism in maintaining proper synaptic function and in the etiology of neurological disease. However, the study of glial metabolism in humans has been hampered by the lack of noninvasive methods. To specifically measure the contribution of astroglia to brain energy metabolism in humans, we used a novel noninvasive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic approach. We measured carbon 13 incorporation into brain glutamate and glutamine in eight volunteers during an intravenous infusion of [2-13C] acetate, which has been shown in animal models to be metabolized specifically in astroglia. Mathematical modeling of the three established pathways for neurotransmitter glutamate repletion indicates that the glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter cycle between astroglia and neurons (0.32 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcmol \u00b7 gm\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121) is the major pathway for neuronal glutamate repletion and that the astroglial TCA cycle flux (0.14 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcmol \u00b7 gm\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121) accounts for \u223c14% of brain oxygen consumption. Up to 30% of the glutamine transferred to the neurons by the cycle may derive from replacement of oxidized glutamate by anaplerosis. The further application of this approach could potentially enlighten the role of astroglia in supporting brain glutamatergic activity and in neurological and psychiatric disease.",

        "abstract": "Glutamine, the preferred precursor for neurotransmitter glutamate and GABA, is likely to be the principal substrate for the neuronal System A transporter SNAT1 in vivo. We explored the functional properties of SNAT1 (the product of the rat Slc38a1 gene) by measuring radiotracer uptake and currents associated with SNAT1 expression in Xenopus oocytes and determined the neuronal-phenotypic and cellular distribution of SNAT1 by confocal laser-scanning microscopy alongside other markers. We found that SNAT1 mediates transport of small, neutral, aliphatic amino acids including glutamine (K0.5 \u2248 0.3 mm), alanine, and the System A-specific analogue 2-(methylamino)isobutyrate. Amino acid transport is driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient. The voltage-dependent binding of Na+ precedes that of the amino acid in a simultaneous transport mechanism. Li+ (but not H+) can substitute for Na+ but results in reduced Vmax. In the absence of amino acid, SNAT1 mediates Na+-dependent presteady-state currents (Qmax \u2248 9 nC) and a nonsaturable cation leak with selectivity Na+, Li+ \u00bb H+, K+. Simultaneous flux and current measurements indicate coupling stoichiometry of 1 Na+ per 1 amino acid. SNAT1 protein was detected in somata and proximal dendrites but not nerve terminals of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons throughout the adult CNS. We did not detect SNAT1 expression in astrocytes but detected its expression on the luminal membranes of the ependyma. The functional properties and cellular distribution of SNAT1 support a primary role for SNAT1 in glutamine transport serving the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle in central neurons. Localization of SNAT1 to certain dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and cholinergic motoneurons suggests that SNAT1 may play additional specialized roles, providing metabolic fuel (via \u03b1-ketoglutarate) or precursors (cysteine, glycine) for glutathione synthesis.",

We investigated its distribution and cellular localization in the cerebral cortex and neighboring regions of rats and humans using light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical methods with specific antibodies. In the first somatic sensory cortex of rats and in areas 9, 10, 21 and 46 of the human cortex, numerous SNAT1-positive (+) cells were present in the cortical parenchyma and in the white matter; >95% of SNAT1+ cells were neurons, but some were astrocytes. Most SNAT1+ cells were pyramidal neurons, but numerous non-pyramidal neurons were also observed: SNAT1/GABA double-labeling studies showed that SNAT1 is expressed in all GABA+ neurons. SNAT1/synaptophysin studies showed that <0.1% of all synaptophysin+ puncta coexpressed SNAT1. SNAT1 immunoreactivity (ir) was also in leptomeninges, ependymal cells and choroid plexus. Electron microscopic studies showed that neuronal SNAT1 ir was almost exclusively observed in perikarya and dendritic profiles. SNAT1 ir was also in distal astrocytic processes, including end feet profiles, and in leptomeninges. These findings suggest that the major function of SNAT1 is not to replenish the transmitter pools of Glu and GABA.",

Semiquantitative reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction revealed similarly high expression of mRNA for GlnT by rat brain neocortical astrocytes as well as neurons, with progressively lower expression by cerebellar astrocytes, hippocampal astrocytes, and whole\u2010brain microglia in culture. [3H]Gln was accumulated in a temperature\u2010dependent manner with a saturable profile in both cultured neocortical neurons and astrocytes, whereas biochemical and pharmacological analyses on [3H]Gln accumulation revealed the expression of both system A and system L transporters by cultured neocortical neurons and astrocytes. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hr resulted in a significant decrease in both GlnT mRNA expression and [3H]Gln accumulation, with a concomitant drastic increase in nitrite formation in cultured neocortical astrocytes. Moreover, LPS significantly inhibited the promoter activity of GlnT in the astrocytic cell line C6 glioma cells as well as primary rat neocortical astrocytes in culture. These results suggest that activation by LPS would lead to down\u2010regulation of the expression of GlnT responsible for the incorporation of extracellular Gln into intracellular spaces across plasma membranes through the inhibition of its promoter activity in cultured rat neocortical astrocytes. \u00a9 2006 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that theanine (=\u03b3\u2010glutamylethylamide), an ingredient of green tea, has a protective effect against ischemic neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region of the gerbil brain without affecting ligand binding to ionotropic receptor subtypes of the neurotransmitter glutamate structurally related to theanine. The neurotransmitter pool of glutamate is thought to be fueled by the entry of the other structural analog glutamine (Gln) and subsequent cleavage by glutaminase. Although theanine did not inhibit [3H]glutamate accumulation, [3H]theanine was actively accumulated in a temperature\u2010dependent and saturable manner in rat brain synaptosomal fractions. The accumulation of [3H]theanine was markedly inhibited by Gln in a concentration\u2010dependent manner, whereas [3H]Gln accumulation was inhibited by theanine vice versa. Both [3H]theanine and [3H]Gln accumulations were decreased after the replacement of sodium chloride with choline chloride, along with similarly high distribution profiles in telencephalic structures. A similar equilibrium was observed within 30 min at 30\u00b0C for the accumulations of both [3H]theanine and [3H]Gln in cultured rat neocortical astroglia as well as neurons, whereas theanine inhibited [3H]Gln accumulation in a concentration\u2010dependent manner at 0.1\u201310 mM. Furthermore, sustained exposure to 10 mM theanine led to a significant decrease in the level of extracellular glutamate released from cultured neurons.

In addition, it investigated the anti-stress effect of theanine (\u03b3-glutamylethylamide), an amino acid in tea. Mice were housed under confrontation. That is, two male mice were separately housed in the same cage with a partition for establishing the territorial imperative in each mouse. Then, the partition was removed and mice were co-housed confrontationally (confront-housing) using a model mouse of accelerated-senescence (SAMP10) that exhibited cerebral atrophy and cognitive dysfunction with ageing. It was found that mice began to die earlier under confront-housing than group-housed control mice. Additionally, it was found that cerebral atrophy, learning impairment and behavioural depression were higher in mice under the stressed condition of confront-housing than age-matched mice under group-housing. Furthermore, the level of oxidative damage in cerebral DNA was higher in mice housed confrontationally than group-housed control mice. On the other hand, the consumption of purified theanine (20 \u03bcg/ml, 5\u20136 mg/kg) suppressed the shortened lifespan, cerebral atrophy, learning impairment, behavioural depression and oxidative damage in cerebral DNA. These results suggest that psychosocial stress accelerates age-related alterations such as oxidative damage, lifespan, cognitive dysfunction and behavioural depression.

This result showed that transited theanine has an effect on the metabolic balance of Glu analogs in the hippocampus.",

        "title": "Protective Effect and Mechanism of Theanine on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation and Acute Liver Injury in Mice.",
        "abstract": "Theanine, a unique bioactive constituent from tea ( Camellia sinensis) leaves, is widely used as a functional ingredient and dietary supplement. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects of theanine and its molecular mechanism, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation mouse model was employed in this study. The survival rate of mice in the theanine-treated group increased significantly compared with that of LPS-only group mice. Furthermore, ICR male mice were randomly divided into three or four groups: control, LPS (LPS treatment only), LPS + theanine (20 mg/kg/day), and theanine (theanine treatment only). The results showed that compared with the LPS group, the liver damage and oxidative stress of the theanine-treated group decreased significantly, based on plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, hepatic total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and histological scores and apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 activity] in the liver tissues. Furthermore, compared with no treatment, pretreatment with theanine significantly decreased the release of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, inhibited the expression of several inflammatory factors (including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6), and increased the IL-10/interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 ratio in the hepatic tissues. In the LPS-induced inflammation model, theanine inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators involved in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and attenuated the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB in the hepatic tissues. Moreover, theanine suppressed the acute-phase response (elevated nitric oxide and C-reactive protein levels). Furthermore, theanine suppressed the LPS-induced inflammatory state by normalizing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity. Taken together, the results suggest that theanine potentially ameliorates LPS-induced inflammation and acute liver injury; molecular mechanism of action may involve normalization of HPA axis hyperactivity and inactivation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

The paper builds upon the source paper's findings by exploring the molecular mechanism of theanine's effects, but it does not directly use the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis. However, it is closely related to the source paper's topic, and the source paper's findings on theanine's effects in the brain could be seen as a sub-hypothesis for this paper's investigation of theanine's effects in the liver."

        "title": "Green tea polyphenols prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory liver injury in mice by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",
        "abstract": "Inflammatory liver diseases present a significant public health problem. Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) have a myriad of health benefits in animals and humans, including alleviating of hepatic inflammation; however, the underlying mechanisms are complicated and remain unclear. The current study investigated the preventive effects and mechanism of GTPs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory liver injury in mice. The ICR mice received intragastric GTPs once per day for 7 consecutive days prior to LPS stimulation (15 mg kg-1, intraperitoneally) and liver damage and oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the hepatic nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes were observed. Our results showed that GTP supplementation significantly reduced LPS-induced plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; and LPS-induced reduction of glutathione (GSH) levels and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activities was drastically improved by GTP pretreatment. GTP supplementation significantly reduced plasma contents and hepatic mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, compared with LPS-treated mice which did not receive GTP treatment. In addition, the production of cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in mice livers, and acute-phase response (plasma levels of nitric oxide and C-reactive protein) were also decreased following GTP pre-treatment. Furthermore, GTPs reduced LPS-induced hepatic NF-\u03baB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. GTPs exert protective effects against inflammatory liver injury by regulating NF-\u03baB signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our findings suggest that dietary GTP supplementation may be an adjunctive prevention and treatment for acute liver injury-associated inflammation.",

        "title": "Micheliolide Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation by Modulating the mROS/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 Axis in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells",
        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is a common disease closely related to renal tubular inflammation and oxidative stress, and no effective treatment is available. Activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is an important factor in renal inflammation, but the mechanism remains unclear. Micheliolide (MCL), which is derived from parthenolide, is a new compound with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and has multiple roles in tumors and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of MCL on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced inflammation in renal tubular cells and the related mechanism. We found that MCL significantly suppressed the LPS-induced NF-\u03baB signaling and inflammatory expression of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in a rat renal proximal tubular cell line (NRK-52E). MCL also prevented LPS- and adenosine triphosphate-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro, as evidenced by the inhibition of NLRP3 expression, caspase-1 cleavage, and interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-18 maturation and secretion. Additionally, MCL inhibited the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreases the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, MCL can prevent NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by rotenone, a well-known mitochondrial ROS (mROS) agonist, indicating that the mechanism of MCL's anti-inflammatory effect may be closely related to the mROS. In conclusion, our study indicates that MCL can inhibit LPS-induced renal inflammation through suppressing the mROS/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 axis in tubular epithelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Acute liver injury (ALI) is a poor prognosis and high mortality complication of sepsis. Paeoniflorin (PF) has remarkable anti\u2010inflammatory effects in different disease models. Here, we explored the protective effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of PF against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2010induced ALI. Sprague\u2010Dawley rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of PF for 7\u2009days, 1 h after the last administration, and rats were injected i.p. 10\u2009mg/kg LPS. PF improved liver structure and function, reduced hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) levels, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Western blot analysis suggested that PF significantly inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u201018) and inhibited activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. PF or mitochondrial ROS scavenger (mito\u2010TEMPO) significantly improved liver mitochondrial function by scavenging mitochondrial ROS (mROS), restoring mitochondrial membrane potential loss and increasing level of ATP and enzyme activity of complex I and III. In addition, PF increased expression of sirtuin\u20101 (SIRT1), forkhead box O1 (FOXO1a) and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), and increased FOXO1a nuclear retention. However, the inhibitor of SIRT1 (EX527) abolished the protective effect of PF. Taken together, PF promotes mROS clearance to inhibit mitochondrial damage and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via SIRT1/FOXO1a/SOD2 signaling.",

        "title": "The role and therapeutic potential of SIRTs in sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the host's dysfunctional response to infection. Abnormal activation of the immune system and disturbance of energy metabolism play a key role in the development of sepsis. In recent years, the Sirtuins (SIRTs) family has been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. SIRTs, as a class of histone deacetylases (HDACs), are widely involved in cellular inflammation regulation, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. The effects of SIRTs on immune cells are mainly reflected in the regulation of inflammatory pathways. This regulation helps balance the inflammatory response and may lessen cell damage and organ dysfunction in sepsis. In terms of energy metabolism, SIRTs can play a role in immunophenotypic transformation by regulating cell metabolism, improve mitochondrial function, increase energy production, and maintain cell energy balance. SIRTs also regulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting cells from oxidative stress damage by activating antioxidant defense pathways and maintaining a balance between oxidants and reducing agents. Current studies have shown that several potential drugs, such as Resveratrol and melatonin, can enhance the activity of SIRT. It can help to reduce inflammatory response, improve energy metabolism and reduce oxidative stress, showing potential clinical application prospects for the treatment of sepsis. This review focuses on the regulation of SIRT on inflammatory response, energy metabolism and oxidative stress of immune cells, as well as its important influence on multiple organ dysfunction in sepsis, and discusses and summarizes the effects of related drugs and compounds on reducing multiple organ damage in sepsis through the pathway involving SIRTs. SIRTs may become a new target for the treatment of sepsis and its resulting organ dysfunction, providing new ideas and possibilities for the treatment of this life-threatening disease.",
