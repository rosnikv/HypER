        "title": "Subcutaneous IGF-1 is not beneficial in 2-year ALS trial",
        "abstract": "Background: Previous human clinical trials of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been inconsistent. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to address whether IGF-1 benefited patients with ALS. Methods: A total of 330 patients from 20 medical centers were randomized to receive 0.05 mg/kg body weight of human recombinant IGF-1 given subcutaneously twice daily or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome measure was change in their manual muscle testing score. Secondary outcome measures included tracheostomy-free survival and rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale. Intention to treat analysis was used. Results: There was no difference between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcome measures after the 2-year treatment period. Conclusions: Insulin-like growth factor type I does not provide benefit for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. GLOSSARY: ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-r = revised ALS functional rating scale; AUC = area under the curve; DVT = deep venous thromboses; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor type I; MMT = manual muscle testing; PE = pulmonary embolisms.",

        "title": "The natural history of ALS is changing: Improved survival",
        "abstract": "In the past two decades new practice parameters for clinical care in ALS were developed and several clinical trials were performed. We sought to review information in these prospective datasets and assess whether natural history of ALS has changed over time. Survival and the rate of functional decline were compared across the placebo arms of efficacy trials conducted from 1999 to 2005 by the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS). Similar data from the placebo arms of 12 other published efficacy ALS trials conducted between 1990 and 2008 were compared descriptively. In the three NEALS clinical trials, survival improved over time in the placebo cohort (p=0.05) while the rate of change in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) (p=0.15), ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) (p=0.6) and vital capacity (%VC) (p=0.5) was unchanged. No differences were observed in the mean rates of decline of these outcome measures in the published clinical trials. However, survival improved in the more recently conducted trials. Survival improved over time in placebo controlled participants enrolled in clinical trials in ALS since 1990. However, the decline in measures of function appears unchanged since then. These changes in natural history reflect improvements in symptomatic care of ALS.",

        "title": "Toward more efficient clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
        "abstract": "Abstract More than 30 phase II or III clinical trials have been carried out in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Only riluzole, however, has been shown to extend survival and/or time to tracheostomy. Many early ALS trials lacked solid pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data for the treatment being tested, challenging the interpretation of the efficacy and pathway relevance. Understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of ALS has improved considerably in the past decade, but biomarkers of disease activity remain lacking. A more efficient approach to early phase clinical trials is needed to accelerate the identification of useful agents for ALS. Here we summarize our current thinking about phase II design options and the potential benefits of a clinical trial network for phase II trials in ALS.",

        "title": "Electrical impedance myography as a biomarker to assess ALS progression",
        "abstract": "Abstract Electrical impedance myography (EIM), a non-invasive, electrophysiological technique, has preliminarily shown value as an ALS biomarker. Here we perform a multicenter study to further assess EIM\u2019s potential for tracking ALS. ALS patients were enrolled across eight sites. Each subject underwent EIM, handheld dynamometry (HHD), and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) regularly. Techniques were compared by assessing the coefficient of variation (CoV) in the rate of decline and each technique\u2019s correlation to survival. Results showed that in the 60 patients followed for one year, EIM phase measured from the most rapidly progressing muscle in each patient had a CoV in the rate of decline of 0.62, compared to HHD (0.82) and the ALSFRS-R (0.74). Restricting the measurements to the first six months gave a CoV of 0.55 for EIM, 0.93 for HHD, and 0.84 for ALSFRS-R. For both time-periods, all three measures correlated with survival. Based on these data, a six-month clinical trial designed to detect a 20% treatment effect with 80% power using EIM would require only 95 patients/arm compared to the ALSFRS-R, which would require 220 subjects/arm. In conclusion, EIM can serve as a useful ALS biomarker that offers the prospect of greatly accelerating phase 2 clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare electrical impedance myography (EIM) 50 kHz phase to weight, motor score, paw grip endurance (PGE), CMAP amplitude, and MUNE for the identification of disease progression and the effect of riluzole in the SOD1 G93A mouse. Methods Twenty-three animals received 8 mg/kg/day riluzole in the drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age; 22 animals served as controls. Weight, motor score, PGE, CMAP, MUNE, and EIM were performed weekly to evaluate disease progression. Results No difference in clinical disease onset or survival was found between treated and untreated groups. In addition, all methods failed to identify any beneficial effect of riluzole. Thus, data from all animals were combined for additional analyses. Of the 4 parameters, EIM phase showed the earliest change from baseline and the most linear decline throughout the entire measurement period. In addition, EIM phase correlated with PGE, CMAP amplitude, and MUNE (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a0.92, 0.90, and 0.72, respectively, p<0.01 for all). The rate of EIM phase decline also correlated with individual animal survival (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.31, p<0.05). Conclusions At this dose, riluzole is ineffective in slowing progression of ALS. However, EIM phase shows early linear declines, supporting its potential as a useful new biomarker for preclinical drug testing.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Isolated sural mononeuropathy is rare and frequently constitutes a diagnostic challenge. Methods: This investigation was a retrospective study of sural neuropathy at a single electrodiagnostic center. Results: Our study included 36 patients with sural neuropathy, the largest sample so far reported. Non\u2010surgical, non\u2010traumatic etiologies account for 50% of the cases, including 7 patients with inflammatory or vasculitic conditions. Routine sural conduction study was positive in 34 of 36 patients, whereas a distal recording method was used to verify the diagnosis of sural mononeuropathy in 2 patients. Most (58%) patients did not require specific treatment, but persistent sensory symptoms were seen in a minority of cases. Sural nerve biopsy in 1 patient helped diagnostic and treatment planning. Conclusions: Sural mononeuropathy has distinct etiologic, clinical, and electrophysiological features.
