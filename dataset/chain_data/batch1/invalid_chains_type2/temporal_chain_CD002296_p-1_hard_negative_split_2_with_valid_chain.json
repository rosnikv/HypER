        "title": "Misoprostol Reduces Serious Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Receiving Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs",
        "abstract": "Approximately 14 million patients in the United States regularly take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) for various types of arthritis [1] for relief of pain, stiffness, and other symptoms. However, these benefits are obtained at a price. Use of NSAIDs is associated with various gastrointestinal side effects. Minor side effects such as nausea, dyspepsia, anorexia, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea may affect 10% to 60% of patients [2]. Symptomatic ulcers and potentially life-threatening ulcer complications such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction are reported in 2% to 4% of patients who take NSAIDs for a year [3]. The chance of hospitalization or death from a gastrointestinal adverse event is 1.3% to 1.6% per year in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [4]. These infrequent but potentially serious gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs have become a major health care problem because of the many patients at risk [5]. General physicians and rheumatologists caring for patients with symptoms of chronic arthritis may be reluctant to abandon using NSAIDs, which help most of these patients, in order to protect the few who may develop serious complications from use of these drugs. On the other hand, gastroenterologists see fewer patients for arthritis but many with serious gastrointestinal complications. Life-threatening events such as perforation or serious hemorrhage from NSAID-induced ulcers, which often develop with little or no warning [6], are a real problem because of the many patients at risk. Various agents have been used in attempts to reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal lesions. In one endoscopic study, cimetidine at a dose of 300 mg four times a day showed no benefit in healing NSAID-related lesions compared with placebo, and 400 mg at bedtime provided no benefit in preventing these lesions compared with placebo [7]. Antacids (magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, 10 to 20 mL as needed to a dose as high as 60 mL daily) and sucralfate have recently been reported to reduce dyspeptic symptoms in arthritic patients receiving NSAIDs in whom gastropathic lesions (but not ulcers) were shown endoscopically [8, 9]. The surface-active antiulcer drug sucralfate was ineffective in preventing ulcers in persons receiving NSAIDs [10, 11], and the histamine-2-receptor antagonist ranitidine did not prevent gastric ulcers but did reduce the frequency of duodenal ulcers [12, 13]. Results of preliminary studies indicate that the effects of omeprazole parallel those of ranitidine [14]. A recent study [15] in achlorhydric patients showed that NSAID-induced ulcers develop in the absence of gastric acid. In contrast, several clinical trials have shown that the incidence of endoscopically visible erosions and ulcers associated with NSAID use can be reduced by cotherapy with the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol [16-19]. However, it was not proved that preventing endoscopic lesions would prevent clinically serious complications of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers [20]. Our objective was to determine whether concurrent therapy with misoprostol reduces the incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications in older patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis who are taking NSAIDs. Because most patients taking NSAIDs do not routinely have endoscopy, we investigated the incidence of these complications during clinical care as actually practiced. A second goal was to better define which patients were at increased risk for development of serious NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications. Methods Patients Ambulatory patients at least 52 years of age who had chronic rheumatoid arthritis, defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria [21], and who were expected to be taking 1 of 10 specified NSAIDs at predefined minimum doses for 6 months were sought from practices of family medicine, internal medicine, or rheumatology. Of these practices, 661 in the United States and 3 in Canada enrolled at least one patient between July 1991 and August 1993. For all patients, a medical history was elicited, a physical examination was done, and a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire that included eight items on activities of daily living was administered [22]. Patients were excluded if they had had active peptic ulcer disease within 30 days of study enrollment; were taking or expected to need antiulcer medication (histamine-2 blockers, sucralfate, omeprazole) or any experimental medication during the study; had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, previous gastric resection or vagotomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, varices, or cirrhosis; had a history of inflammatory bowel disease, upper gastrointestinal tract malignancies, hepatitis, alcoholism, or bleeding diathesis; were estimated to have a life expectancy of less than 8 months or had do-not-resuscitate status; were women of child-bearing potential; or could not tolerate misoprostol or any prostaglandin. The following were the minimum NSAID doses (mg/d) allowed: aspirin, 2000; diclofenac, 100; flurbiprofen, 200; ibuprofen, 1200; indomethacin, 75; ketoprofen, 150; naproxen, 750; piroxicam, 20; sulindac, 200; or tolmetin, 1200. Patients were allowed to receive more than one NSAID. Intervention Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either misoprostol or placebo in the form of 200- micrograms tablets from coded bottles supplied by the manufacturer. Patients were randomly assigned in blocks of four, so that in each block, half the patients would receive misoprostol and half would receive placebo. Because blocks were assigned to investigators, patients were randomly assigned within the individual centers. Investigators were not informed about the randomization procedure but were told only that the study was randomized and double-blind. Patients were instructed to begin taking half a tablet with meals and at bedtime each day for 10 days and then, if the drug was tolerated, to increase the dose to a whole tablet four times a day for the rest of the study. If the drug was not tolerated, the patients were instructed to reduce the dose back to half a tablet four times a day. Patients could continue therapy with arthritis disease-modifying agents (such as gold or corticosteroids) and were allowed to take antacids that did not contain magnesium. Patients purchased their own arthritis medications or antacids and reported their consumption when seen monthly for examination and counts of study medication tablets. Physicians were instructed to watch closely for clinical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other possible gastrointestinal complications, to inquire about symptoms, and to investigate suspicious episodes by appropriate clinical procedures. Outcome Measures All suspicious events, regardless of presumed cause, were to be reported, along with all available patient data, to the study medical officer (HWD) and then to an external review committee. This committee consisted of a gastroenterologist (FS), a rheumatologist (Kenneth Brandt, MD, Indiana University), and an epidemiologist (Marie Griffin, MD, MPH, Vanderbilt University). The committee determined, without unblinding the randomization code, whether the patient had upper gastrointestinal bleeding; other ulcer complications; or a problem such as hemorrhoids, diverticulitis, colon polyps, or cancer. It developed definitions of what were considered to be complications related to NSAID use and categories of such complications. The committee reached consensus and assigned such events to one of the following categories of definite upper gastrointestinal complications: 1. perforated ulcer, proved at surgery; 2. gastric outlet obstruction caused by proven ulceration and stricture, proved by endoscopy; 3. hematemesis, with endoscopically proven gastric or duodenal ulceration or erosion; 4. active or recent visualized bleeding from endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; 5. melena, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; 6. heme-positive stool, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion, plus either a) a decrease in hematocrit of at least 0.05 or b) orthostatic change in the pulse rate (from sitting to standing) of at least 20 beats per minute or decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg; 7. hematemesis, without endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; and 8. melena, with heme-positive stool and without endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion. The committee also defined categories of events not involving clinically significant bleeding: 9. report of melena with no other data; 10. heme-positive stools, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion and without active bleeding; and 11. report of melena and heme-negative stools when the stools were tested. Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Methods The placebo group was expected to have an incidence of serious NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications of about 2% per year or about 1% during the 6-month study period. We estimated that the misoprostol group might have 40% to 50% fewer complications and that 60% to 70% of patients would complete the study. Given an less than 0.05 and power greater than 0.80, we planned in the protocol to assess the number of such complications observed, without unblinding the study, after 7500 patients had been followed. We did this to confirm the incidence assumptions and adjust the study size if necessary. We used the Fisher exact test to compare occurrence of events in the treatment groups. To identify risk factors, we evaluated the relation between the occurrence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications and patient characteristics using logistic regression. Supplementary time-to-event analyses were done using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves. The study was supported by a grant from G.D. Searle & Co. Data c",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAcid suppression with famotidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, provides protection against gastric injury in normal subjects receiving short courses of aspirin or naproxen. The efficacy of famotidine in preventing peptic ulcers in patients receiving long-term therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied the efficacy of two doses of famotidine (20 mg and 40 mg, each given orally twice daily), as compared with placebo, in preventing peptic ulcers in 285 patients without peptic ulcers who were receiving long-term NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (82 percent) or osteoarthritis (18 percent). The patients were evaluated clinically and by endoscopy at base line and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. The evaluators were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of gastric or duodenal ulceration at 24 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers was 20 percent in the placebo group, 13 percent in the group of patients receiving 20 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.24 for the comparison with placebo), and 8 percent in the group receiving 40 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.03 for the comparison with placebo). The proportion of patients in whom duodenal ulcers developed was significantly lower with both doses of famotidine than with placebo (13 percent in the placebo group, 4 percent in the low-dose famotidine group [P = 0.04], and 2 percent in the high-dose famotidine group [P = 0.01]). Both doses of famotidine were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with high-dose famotidine significantly reduces the cumulative incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients with arthritis receiving long-term NSAID therapy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSuppressing acid secretion is thought o reduce the risk of ulcers associated with regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but the best means of accomplishing this is uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 541 patients who required continuous treatment with NSAIDs and who had ulcers or more than 10 erosions in either the stomach or duodenum. Patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg or 40 mg orally per day, or ranitidine, 150 mg orally twice a day, for four or eight weeks, depending on when treatment was successful (defined as the resolution of ulcer and the presence of fewer than five erosions in the stomach, and fewer than five erosions in the duodenum, and not more than mild dyspepsia). We randomly assigned 432 patients in whom treatment was successful to maintenance treatment with either 20 mg of omeprazole per day or 150 mg of ranitidine twice a day for six months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt eight weeks, treatment was successful in 80 percent (140 of 174) of the patients in the group given 20 mg of omeprazole per day, 79 percent (148 of 187) of those given 40 mg of omeprazole per day, and 63 percent (110 of 174) of those given ranitidine (P<0.001 for the comparison with 20 mg of omeprazole and P=0.001 for the comparison with 40 mg of omeprazole). The rates of healing of all types of lesions were higher with omeprazole than with ranitidine. During maintenance therapy, the estimated proportion of patients in remission at the end of six months was 72 percent in the omeprazole group and 59 percent in the ranitidine group. The rates of adverse events were similar between groups during both phases. Both medications were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with regular use of NSAIDs, omeprazole healed and prevented ulcers more effectively than did ranitidine.",

        "abstract": "We studied the recurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in a cohort of patients who had an episode of peptic ulcer bleed, and we investigated the effect of maintenance treatment with cimetidine, omeprazole, and ranitidine. We identified 952 patients with a hospitalization for an episode of peptic ulcer bleed by searching the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom. The mean follow-up time was 33 months. Less than 10% of the cohort presented with a new episode of UGIB. We calculated incidence rates of recurrent UGIB and estimated the relative risk (RR) of UGIB associated with use of the various acid-suppressing drugs. The greatest protection for recurrent UGIB associated with maintenance acid-suppressing treatment was seen with omeprazole (relative risk 0.2; 95% CI, 0.02-1.0). The corresponding estimates with cimetidine and ranitidine were 0.9 (0.3-2.3) and 0.9 (0.5-1.8). Among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, concomitant use of omeprazole afforded protection against a new bleed (RR 0.0; 0.0-1.0), and there was a suggestion of a protective effect with misoprostol, 0.4 (0.01-3.2). The degree of lowered risk of recurrent UGIB in patients on omeprazole maintenance therapy compared with cimetidine or ranitidine therapy is comparable with the protection provided through profound reduction of gastric acidity achieved with proton-pump inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany patients who have had upper gastrointestinal bleeding continue to take low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis or other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for musculoskeletal pain. It is uncertain whether infection with Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for bleeding in such patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were infected with H. pylori and who were taking low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs. We evaluated whether eradication of the infection or omeprazole treatment was more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding. We recruited patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was confirmed by endoscopy. Their ulcers were healed by daily treatment with 20 mg of omeprazole for eight weeks or longer. Then, those who had been taking aspirin were given 80 mg of aspirin daily, and those who had been taking other NSAIDs were given 500 mg of naproxen twice daily for six months. The patients in each group were then randomly assigned separately to receive 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months or one week of eradication therapy, consisting of 120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, all given four times daily, followed by placebo for six months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 400 patients (250 of whom were taking aspirin and 150 of whom were taking other NSAIDs). Among those taking aspirin, the probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 1.9 percent for patients who received eradication therapy and 0.9 percent for patients who received omeprazole (absolute difference, 1.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1.9 to 3.9 percent). Among users of other NSAIDs, the probability of recurrent bleeding was 18.8 percent for patients receiving eradication therapy and 4.4 percent for those treated with omeprazole (absolute difference, 14.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, 4.4 to 24.4 percent; P=0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with H. pylori infection and a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are taking low-dose aspirin, the eradication of H. pylori is equivalent to treatment with omeprazole in preventing recurrent bleeding. Omeprazole is superior to the eradication of H. pylori in preventing recurrent bleeding in patients who are taking other NSAIDs.",

Design Nested case-control study. Setting 367 general practices contributing to the UK QRESEARCH database, spread throughout every strategic health authority and each health board in England, Wales, and Scotland. Participants Patients aged 25 or more with a first ever diagnosis of an adverse upper gastrointestinal event (peptic ulcer or haematemesis) between 1 August 2000 and 31 July 2004 and up to 10 controls per case matched for age, sex, calendar time, and practice. Main outcome measures Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for adverse upper gastrointestinal events associated with celecoxib, rofecoxib, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, other selective and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and aspirin. Results The incidence of adverse upper gastrointestinal events was 1.36 per 1000 person years (95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.39). We identified 9407 incident cases and 88 867 matched controls. Increased risks of adverse gastrointestinal events were associated with current use of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and with conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Risks were reduced after adjustment for confounders but remained significantly increased for naproxen (adjusted odds ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.73 to 2.58), diclofenac (1.96, 1.78 to 2.15), and rofecoxib (1.56, 1.30 to 1.87) but not for current use of celecoxib (1.11, 0.87 to 1.41). We found clinically important interactions with current use of ulcer healing drugs that removed the increased risks for adverse gastrointestinal events for all groups of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs except diclofenac, which still had an increased odds ratio (1.49, 1.26 to 1.76). Conclusion No consistent evidence was found of enhanced safety against gastrointestinal events with any of the new cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors compared with non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The use of ulcer healing drugs reduced the increased risk of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes with all groups of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but for diclofenac the increased risk remained significant.",

The focus of this paper has been placed on the effects of NSAIDs on the mucosal surface, and specifically the effect of these powerful drugs in inducing changes in the hydrophobicity, fluidity, biomechanical and permeability properties of extracellular and membrane phospholipids. Lastly, recent evidence is presented that salicylic acid and related NSAIDs may alter the stability of membranes, inducing the formation of unstable pores that may lead to back\u2010diffusion of luminal acid and membrane rupture.

        "abstract": "The hydrophobic surface layer of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which has been attributed to the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the mucus gel, protects the mucosa of the GI tract and is disrupted by parenteral LPS treatment. We investigated the potential for repletion of this layer as a means to prevent LPS-induced GI injury. Rats were treated orally with PC 1 h before LPS (i.p.). Gastric and ileal tissues were assessed for changes in permeability 5 h later, and gastric fluid was analyzed for signs of GI-related LPS effects (bile acid reflux, increased volume, and pH) and gastric injury (bleeding). Serum TNF-&agr; was assessed as a measure of a non-GI, LPS response. Radiolabeled PC was tracked through the GI tract to verify the extent of luminal exposure during the time of the study. Pretreatment with oral PC significantly blocked permeability increases in gastric and ileal tissue due to LPS. A portion of orally administered PC gained access to the entire GI tract in 1 h. Exogenous PC did not prevent the increase in serum TNF-&agr; or gastric fluid volume or pH induced by LPS, nor did it prevent the duodenogastric reflux of bile acid. There was a tendency for PC to reduce gastric bleeding after LPS. Orally administered PC seems to act directly on the mucosa to prevent GI permeability disturbances due to LPS. Under the conditions studied, oral PC does not block systemic effects of LPS. However, enteral formulations containing PC may be useful adjuncts in the prevention of GI injury from endotoxemia.",

        "abstract": "Endotoxemia from sepsis can injure the gastrointestinal tract through mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. We have shown that LPS induces an increase in gastric permeability in parallel with the luminal appearance of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and its product, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC). We proposed that sPLA2 acted on the gastric hydrophobic barrier, composed primarily of phosphatidylcholine (PC), to degrade it and produce lyso-PC, an agent that is damaging to the mucosa. In the present study, we have tested whether lyso-PC and/or sPLA2 have direct damaging effects on the hydrophobic barriers of synthetic and mucosal surfaces. Rats were administered LPS (5 mg/kg, i.p.), and gastric contents were collected 5 h later for analysis of sPLA2 and lyso-PC content. Using these measured concentrations, direct effects of sPLA2 and lyso-PC were determined on (a) surface hydrophobicity as detected with an artificial PC surface and with intact gastric mucosa (contact angle analysis) and (b) cell membrane disruption of gastric epithelial cells (AGS). Both lyso-PC and sPLA2 increased significantly in the collected gastric juice of LPS-treated rats. Using similar concentrations to the levels in gastric juice, the contact angle of PC-coated slides declined after incubation with either pancreatic sPLA2 or lyso-PC. Similarly, gastric contact angles seen in control rats were significantly decreased in sPLA2 and lyso-PC-treated rats. In addition, we observed dose-dependent injurious effects of both lyso-PC and sPLA2 in gastric AGS cells. An LPS-induced increase in sPLA2 activity in the gastric lumen and its product, lyso-PC, are capable of directly disrupting the gastric hydrophobic layer and may contribute to gastric barrier disruption and subsequent inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by inflammatory disruption of the alveolar\u2014vascular barrier, resulting in severe respiratory compromise. Inhibition of the intercellular messenger protein, Group V phospholipase A2 (gVPLA2), blocks vascular permeability caused by LPS both in vivo and in vitro. In this investigation we studied the mechanism by which recombinant gVPLA2 increases permeability of cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells (EC). Exogenous gVPLA2 (500 nM), a highly hydrolytic enzyme, caused a significant increase in EC permeability that began within minutes and persisted for >10 hours. However, the major hydrolysis products of gVPLA2 (Lyso-PC, Lyso-PG, LPA, arachidonic acid) did not cause EC structural rearrangement or loss of barrier function at concentrations >10 \u03bcM. Higher concentrations (\u2265 30 \u03bcM) of these membrane hydrolysis products caused some increased permeability but were associated with EC toxicity (measured by propidium iodide incorporation) that did not occur with barrier disruption by gVPLA2 (500 nM). Pharmacologic inhibition of multiple intracellular signaling pathways induced by gVPLA2 activity (ERK, p38, PI3K, cytosolic gIVPLA2) also did not prevent EC barrier disruption by gVPLA2. Finally, pretreatment with heparinase to prevent internalization of gVPLA2 did not inhibit EC barrier disruption by gVPLA2. Our data thus indicate that gVPLA2 increases pulmonary EC permeability directly through action as a membrane hydrolytic agent. Disruption of EC barrier function does not depend upon membrane hydrolysis products, gVPLA2 internalization, or upregulation of downstream intracellular signaling.",

        "abstract": "Ventilation at high tidal volume may cause lung inflammation and barrier dysfunction that culminates in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). However, the mechanisms by which mechanical stimulation triggers the inflammatory response have not been fully elucidated. This study tested the hypothesis that onset of VILI is triggered by activation of secretory group V phospholipase A(2) (gVPLA2) in pulmonary vascular endothelium exposed to excessive mechanical stretch. High-magnitude cyclic stretch (18% CS) increased expression and surface exposure of gVPLA2 in human pulmonary endothelial cells (EC). CS-induced gVPLA2 activation was required for activation of ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) adhesion to CS-preconditioned EC. By contrast, physiological CS (5% CS) had no effect on gVPLA2 activation or EC-PMN adhesion. CS-induced ICAM-1 expression and EC-PMN adhesion were attenuated by the gVPLA2-blocking antibody (MCL-3G1), general inhibitor of soluble PLA2, LY311727, or siRNA-induced EC gVPLA2 knockdown. In vivo, ventilator-induced lung leukocyte recruitment, cell and protein accumulation in the alveolar space, and total lung myeloperoxidase activity were strongly suppressed in gVPLA2 mouse knockout model or upon administration of MCL-3G1. These results demonstrate a novel role for gVPLA2 as the downstream effector of pathological mechanical stretch leading to an inflammatory response associated with VILI.",

        "abstract": "Increased vascular permeability causes pulmonary edema that impairs arterial oxygenation and thus contributes to morbidity and mortality associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and sepsis. Although components of intercellular adhesive and tight junctions are critical for maintaining the endothelial barrier, there has been limited study of the roles of gap junctions and their component proteins (connexins). Since connexins can modulate inflammatory signaling in other systems, we hypothesized that connexins may also regulate pulmonary endothelial permeability. The relationships between connexins and the permeability response to inflammatory stimuli were studied in cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells. Prolonged treatment with thrombin, lipopolysaccharide, or pathological cyclic stretch increased levels of mRNA and protein for the major connexin, connexin43 (Cx43). Thrombin and lipopolysaccharide both increased intercellular communication assayed by transfer of microinjected Lucifer yellow. Although thrombin decreased transendothelial resistance in these cells, the response was attenuated by pretreatment with the connexin inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, the decreases of transendothelial resistance produced by either thrombin or lipopolysaccharide were attenuated by reducing Cx43 expression by siRNA knockdown. Both carbenoxolone and Cx43 knockdown also abrogated thrombin-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain. Taken together, these data suggest that increased lung vascular permeability induced by inflammatory conditions may be amplified via increased expression of Cx43 and intercellular communication among pulmonary endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Gap junction functionality and intercellular exchange of chemical messengers and other biologically important cellular signals makes communication between adjacent cells possible and is essential for multicellular living systems. This intercellular communication is carried out through gap junction channels that are comprised of multimeric connexin (Cx) proteins and that provide physical linkages between neighboring cells. This Cx-specific gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) helps perform numerous essential physiological functions in different organ systems. In vascular tissues, reciprocal GJIC between intimal vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) helps to control blood flow and arterial pressures by signaling contraction or relaxation events. In the vascular system appropriate GJIC also regulates responses to circulating hormones and other vasoactive factors as well as growth during episodes of stimulated angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis. Deleterious GJIC, however, serves as a contributing element in vascular pathologies and plays key roles in abnormal vascular cell proliferation, migration, and inflammation, foundational mechanisms of arterial remodeling and neointima development. In this review we discuss the critical roles of vascular gap junction Cx proteins and GJIC in regulating pathologic arterial remodeling.",

        "abstract": "Vasculoprotective endothelium glycocalyx (GCX) shedding plays a critical role in vascular disease. Previous work demonstrated that GCX degradation disrupts endothelial cell (EC) gap junction connexin (Cx) proteins, likely blocking interendothelial molecular transport that maintains EC and vascular tissue homeostasis to resist disease. Here, we focused on GCX regeneration and tested the hypothesis that vasculoprotective EC function can be stimulated via replacement of GCX when it is shed. We used EC with [i] intact heparan sulfate (HS), the most abundant GCX component; [ii] degraded HS; or [iii] HS that was restored after enzyme degradation, by cellular self-recovery or artificially. Artificial HS restoration was achieved via treatment with exogenous HS, with or without the GCX regenerator and protector sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P). In these cells we immunocytochemically examined expression of Cx isotype 43 (Cx43) at EC borders and characterized Cx-containing gap junction activity by measuring interendothelial spread of gap junction permeable Lucifer Yellow dye. With intact HS, 60% of EC borders expressed Cx43 and dye spread to 2.88 \u00b1 0.09 neighboring cells. HS degradation decreased Cx43 expression to 30% and reduced dye spread to 1.87\u00b1 0.06 cells. Cellular self-recovery of HS restored baseline levels of Cx43 and dye transfer. Artificial HS recovery with exogenous HS partially restored Cx43 expression to 46% and yielded dye spread to only 1.03 \u00b1 0.07 cells. Treatment with both HS and S1P, recovered HS and restored Cx43 to 56% with significant dye transfer to 3.96 \u00b1 0.23 cells. This is the first evidence of GCX regeneration in a manner that effectively restores vasculoprotective EC communication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The lung epithelial glycocalyx is a carbohydrate\u2010enriched layer lining the pulmonary epithelial surface. Although epithelial glycocalyx visualization has been reported, its composition and function remain unknown. Using immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry, we identified heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate within the lung epithelial glycocalyx. In vivo selective enzymatic degradation of epithelial HS, but not chondroitin sulfate, increased lung permeability. Using mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis approaches to determine the fate of epithelial HS during lung injury, we detected shedding of 20 saccharide\u2010long or greater HS into BAL fluid in intratracheal LPS\u2010treated mice. Furthermore, airspace HS in clinical samples from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome correlated with indices of alveolar permeability, reflecting the clinical relevance of these findings. The length of HS shed during intratracheal LPS\u2010induced injury (\u226520 saccharides) suggests cleavage of the proteoglycan anchoring HS to the epithelial surface, rather than cleavage of HS itself. We used pharmacologic and transgenic animal approaches to determine that matrix metalloproteinases partially mediate HS shedding during intratracheal LPS\u2010induced lung injury. Although there was a trend toward decreased alveolar permeability after treatment with the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, doxycycline, this did not reach statistical significance. These studies suggest that epithelial HS contributes to the lung epithelial barrier and its degradation is sufficient to increase lung permeability. The partial reduction of HS shedding achieved with doxycycline is not sufficient to rescue epithelial barrier function during intratracheal LPS\u2010induced lung injury; however, whether complete attenuation of HS shedding is sufficient to rescue epithelial barrier function remains unknown.",

        "abstract": "The pulmonary epithelial glycocalyx, an anionic cell-surface layer enriched in glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, contributes to the alveolar barrier. Direct injury to the pulmonary epithelium induces shedding of heparan sulfate into the airspace; the impact of this shedding on recovery after lung injury is unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we found that heparan sulfate was shed into the airspace for up to three weeks after intratracheal bleomycin-induced lung injury and coincided with induction of matrix metalloproteinases (including matrix metalloproteinase 2). Delayed inhibition of metalloproteinases, beginning seven days after bleomycin using the nonspecific MMP inhibitor doxycycline, attenuated heparan sulfate shedding and improved lung function, suggesting that heparan sulfate shedding may impair lung recovery. While we also observed an increase in airspace heparanase activity after bleomycin, pharmacologic and transgenic inhibition of heparanase in vivo failed to attenuate heparan sulfate shedding or protect against bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, experimental augmentation of airway heparanase activity significantly worsened post-bleomycin outcomes, confirming the importance of epithelial glycocalyx integrity to lung recovery. We hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinase-associated heparan sulfate shedding contributed to delayed lung recovery in part by the release of large, highly sulfated fragments that sequestered lung-reparative growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor. In vitro, heparan sulfate bound hepatocyte growth factor and attenuated growth factor signaling, suggesting that heparan sulfate shed into the airspace after injury may directly impair lung repair. Accordingly, administering exogenous heparan sulfate to mice after bleomycin injury increased the likelihood of death with severe lung dysfunction. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that alveolar epithelial heparan sulfate shedding impedes lung recovery after bleomycin.",

        "abstract": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) encompass a group of glycoproteins composed of unbranched negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) chains covalently attached to a core protein. The complex HSPG biosynthetic machinery generates an extraordinary structural variety of HS chains that enable them to bind a plethora of ligands, including growth factors, morphogens, cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, matrix proteins, and bacterial and viral pathogens. These interactions translate into key regulatory activity of HSPGs on a wide range of cellular processes such as receptor activation and signaling, cytoskeleton assembly, extracellular matrix remodeling, endocytosis, cell-cell crosstalk, and others. Due to their ubiquitous expression within tissues and their large functional repertoire, HSPGs are involved in many physiopathological processes; thus, they have emerged as valuable targets for the therapy of many human diseases. Among their functions, HSPGs assist many viruses in invading host cells at various steps of their life cycle. Viruses utilize HSPGs for the attachment to the host cell, internalization, intracellular trafficking, egress, and spread. Recently, HSPG involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been established. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying HSPG/SARS-CoV-2 interaction and downstream effects, and we provide an overview of the HSPG-based therapeutic strategies that could be used to combat such a fearsome virus.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has rekindled interest in the molecular mechanisms involved in the early steps of infection of cells by viruses. Compared to SARS-CoV-1 which only caused a relatively small albeit deadly outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has led to fulminant spread and a full-scale pandemic characterized by efficient virus transmission worldwide within a very short time. Moreover, the mutations the virus acquired over the many months of virus transmission, particularly those seen in the Omicron variant, have turned out to result in an even more transmissible virus. Here, we focus on the early events of virus infection of cells. We review evidence that the first decisive step in this process is the electrostatic interaction of the spike protein with heparan sulfate chains present on the surface of target cells: Patches of cationic amino acids located on the surface of the spike protein can interact intimately with the negatively charged heparan sulfate chains, which results in the binding of the virion to the cell surface. In a second step, the specific interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the spike with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor leads to the uptake of bound virions into the cell. We show that these events can be expressed as a semi-quantitative model by calculating the surface potential of different spike proteins using the Adaptive Poison-Boltzmann-Solver (APBS). This software allows visualization of the positive surface potential caused by the cationic patches, which increased markedly from the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 to the Omicron variant. The surface potential thus enhanced leads to a much stronger binding of the Omicron variant as compared to the original wild-type virus. At the same time, data taken from the literature demonstrate that the interaction of the RBD of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor remains constant within the limits of error. Finally, we briefly digress to other viruses and show the usefulness of these electrostatic processes and calculations for cell-virus interactions more generally.",

        "abstract": "Interactions of polyelectrolytes (PEs) with proteins play a crucial role in numerous biological processes, such as the internalization of virus particles into host cells. Although docking, machine learning methods, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are utilized to estimate binding poses and binding free energies of small-molecule drugs to proteins, quantitative prediction of the binding thermodynamics of PE-based drugs presents a significant obstacle in computer-aided drug design. This is due to the sluggish dynamics of PEs caused by their size and strong charge-charge correlations. In this paper, we introduce advanced sampling methods based on a force-spectroscopy setup and theoretical modeling to overcome this barrier. We exemplify our method with explicit solvent all-atom MD simulations of interactions of anionic PEs that show antiviral properties, namely heparin and linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS), with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Our prediction for the binding free energy of LPGS to the wild-type RBD matches experimentally measured dissociation constants within thermal energy, kT, and correctly reproduces the experimental PE-length dependence. We find that LPGS binds to the Delta-variant RBD with an additional free-energy gain of 2.4 kT, compared to the wild-type RBD, in accord with electrostatic arguments. We show that the LPGS-RBD binding is solvent-dominated and enthalpy-driven, though with a large entropy-enthalpy compensation. Our method is applicable to general polymer adsorption phenomena and predicts precise binding free energies and re-configurational friction as needed for drug and drug-delivery design.",
