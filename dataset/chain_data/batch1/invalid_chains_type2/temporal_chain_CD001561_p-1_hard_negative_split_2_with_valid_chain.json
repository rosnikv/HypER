        "title": "Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus by changes in lifestyle among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nType 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.",

        "title": "TRENDS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA, PAKISTAN: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of new coronary artery disease (CAD) cases during the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in patients presenting to a cardiology clinic and to look for its current trends in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan.METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted in a private clinic of interventional cardiologist, based in Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan from January to March 2018. We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiography data and review of clinical records from January 2015 to December 2017 and identified cases of incident CAD based on Regional Wall Motion Abnormalities on echo. SPSS V20.0 was used for analysis. We applied the unpaired t-test to look for an increasing trend in CAD between 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2015 through 2017.RESULTS: A total of 3865 patients of incident coronary artery disease were identified from January 2015 to December 2017. The number of incident CAD patients was 998 in 2015, 1362 in 2016 and 1505 in 2017. We applied the unpaired t-test on the number of post myocardial infarction patients for an increasing trend in 2015 vs 2016, 2016 vs 2017 and 2015 vs 2017 which showed a p-value of <0.001, 0.961 and <0.001 respectively.CONCLUSION: CAD is on the rise in KP over the past 3 years and attention needs to be paid to risk factor control and health education in addition to improvement in the health system to prevent this trend from getting out of control among the population of KP.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Patients with low ejection fraction undergoing isolated CABG surgery are at a higher risk for postoperative complications and mortality. This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of ejection fraction on the outcome of isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). Methods: Between July, 2017 to May, 2019 total 1214 patients underwent isolated CABG. Patients were divided into three groups based on their pre-operative Ejection Fraction (EF). Group-I included 625 patients with EF >50% [Normal EF], Group-II included 484 patients with EF 35-50% [Mild to Moderately Reduced EF], and Group 3 included 105 patients with EF<35% [Severely Reduced EF]. Results: The mean age of Group-I was 57.58 \u00b1 9.206, Group-II was 58.38\u00b19.124 and Group-III was 58.81\u00b1 8.663. The male gender was the predominant gender in all three groups: 194(41.1%) in Group-I, 201(52.6%) in Gp2, 52 (61.9%) in Group-III. 231(36.9) patients in Group-I, 234(48.3)in Group-II and 59(56.2) in Group-III had raised creatinine pre operatively. 5(0.8%) patients in Group-I, 2(0.4%) in Group-II and 3(2.9%) in Group-III had history of CVA. Hypertension was present in approximately 60% of all our patients. In the per-operative period 20(3.2%) patients in Group-I required an IABP as compared to 73(15.1%) in Group-II and 41(39.0%) in Group-III. The mean post-operative mortality in Group-I was 19 (3%), Group-II was 24(5.0%) and low EF group was 9(8.6%). Conclusions: The results clearly indicate that worsening pre-operative ejection fraction is associated with a higher mortality post-operatively in patients undergoing isolated CABG. In addition, use of IABP increases as pre-operative LVEF decreases.",

This paper explores the impact of ejection fraction on mortality in patients undergoing isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), which is a treatment for CAD. The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the outcome of a treatment for CAD, a condition whose rising trend was documented in the source paper."

        "abstract": "- Background: The role of CABG in patients with reduced ejection fraction has been unclear, and several studies have shown that CABG can be performed safely in those patients. Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the final outcome of isolated CABG surgery in patients with reduced EF before surgery. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analytical study involved 350 patients who underwent isolated CABG and were admitted to the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, during the four-year period 2017-2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to EF: <35%(47 cases) and \u226535%(303 cases), and final outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results: Ages of the study population range from 31 to 84 years, with a mean age of 61.9\u00b16.8. Males represented 71.7% of the patients with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1. There was an increase in post-operative EF on average of 4.6% in patients with EF <35%)33.7\u00b11.8 versus 30.5\u00b12.6 before surgery). Lower levels of EF were associated significantly with higher frequency of post-operative use of inotropic agents (12.8 versus 3.3%, p:0.03), reoperation due to bleeding (4.2% versus 1.6%, p:0.04), kidney injury (6.4% versus 0.3%, p:0.01) and mortality (8.5% versus 2.6%, p:0.03). Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in patients with EF<35%(6.7\u00b12.3 versus 4.2\u00b11.9, p:0.005). In multivariate regression analysis, reduced EF was associated with prolonged use of inotropic agents (OR: 2.7,95% CI: 1.2-9.3, p: 0.0001), kidney injury (OR:2.1,95% CI: 0.9-7.2, p:0.001), reoperation due to bleeding (OR: 2.1,95% CI 1.1-5.7, p=0.01), and mortality (OR:2.2,95% CI: 0.9-5.3, p:0.004).Conclusion: Low ejection fraction at admission is a prognostic factor for morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent CABG surgery.",
