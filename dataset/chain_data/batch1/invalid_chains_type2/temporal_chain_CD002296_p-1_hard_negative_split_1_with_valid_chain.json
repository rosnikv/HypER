        "title": "Misoprostol Reduces Serious Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Receiving Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs",
        "abstract": "Approximately 14 million patients in the United States regularly take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) for various types of arthritis [1] for relief of pain, stiffness, and other symptoms. However, these benefits are obtained at a price. Use of NSAIDs is associated with various gastrointestinal side effects. Minor side effects such as nausea, dyspepsia, anorexia, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea may affect 10% to 60% of patients [2]. Symptomatic ulcers and potentially life-threatening ulcer complications such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction are reported in 2% to 4% of patients who take NSAIDs for a year [3]. The chance of hospitalization or death from a gastrointestinal adverse event is 1.3% to 1.6% per year in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [4]. These infrequent but potentially serious gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs have become a major health care problem because of the many patients at risk [5]. General physicians and rheumatologists caring for patients with symptoms of chronic arthritis may be reluctant to abandon using NSAIDs, which help most of these patients, in order to protect the few who may develop serious complications from use of these drugs. On the other hand, gastroenterologists see fewer patients for arthritis but many with serious gastrointestinal complications. Life-threatening events such as perforation or serious hemorrhage from NSAID-induced ulcers, which often develop with little or no warning [6], are a real problem because of the many patients at risk. Various agents have been used in attempts to reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal lesions. In one endoscopic study, cimetidine at a dose of 300 mg four times a day showed no benefit in healing NSAID-related lesions compared with placebo, and 400 mg at bedtime provided no benefit in preventing these lesions compared with placebo [7]. Antacids (magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, 10 to 20 mL as needed to a dose as high as 60 mL daily) and sucralfate have recently been reported to reduce dyspeptic symptoms in arthritic patients receiving NSAIDs in whom gastropathic lesions (but not ulcers) were shown endoscopically [8, 9]. The surface-active antiulcer drug sucralfate was ineffective in preventing ulcers in persons receiving NSAIDs [10, 11], and the histamine-2-receptor antagonist ranitidine did not prevent gastric ulcers but did reduce the frequency of duodenal ulcers [12, 13]. Results of preliminary studies indicate that the effects of omeprazole parallel those of ranitidine [14]. A recent study [15] in achlorhydric patients showed that NSAID-induced ulcers develop in the absence of gastric acid. In contrast, several clinical trials have shown that the incidence of endoscopically visible erosions and ulcers associated with NSAID use can be reduced by cotherapy with the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol [16-19]. However, it was not proved that preventing endoscopic lesions would prevent clinically serious complications of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers [20]. Our objective was to determine whether concurrent therapy with misoprostol reduces the incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications in older patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis who are taking NSAIDs. Because most patients taking NSAIDs do not routinely have endoscopy, we investigated the incidence of these complications during clinical care as actually practiced. A second goal was to better define which patients were at increased risk for development of serious NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications. Methods Patients Ambulatory patients at least 52 years of age who had chronic rheumatoid arthritis, defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria [21], and who were expected to be taking 1 of 10 specified NSAIDs at predefined minimum doses for 6 months were sought from practices of family medicine, internal medicine, or rheumatology. Of these practices, 661 in the United States and 3 in Canada enrolled at least one patient between July 1991 and August 1993. For all patients, a medical history was elicited, a physical examination was done, and a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire that included eight items on activities of daily living was administered [22]. Patients were excluded if they had had active peptic ulcer disease within 30 days of study enrollment; were taking or expected to need antiulcer medication (histamine-2 blockers, sucralfate, omeprazole) or any experimental medication during the study; had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, previous gastric resection or vagotomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, varices, or cirrhosis; had a history of inflammatory bowel disease, upper gastrointestinal tract malignancies, hepatitis, alcoholism, or bleeding diathesis; were estimated to have a life expectancy of less than 8 months or had do-not-resuscitate status; were women of child-bearing potential; or could not tolerate misoprostol or any prostaglandin. The following were the minimum NSAID doses (mg/d) allowed: aspirin, 2000; diclofenac, 100; flurbiprofen, 200; ibuprofen, 1200; indomethacin, 75; ketoprofen, 150; naproxen, 750; piroxicam, 20; sulindac, 200; or tolmetin, 1200. Patients were allowed to receive more than one NSAID. Intervention Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either misoprostol or placebo in the form of 200- micrograms tablets from coded bottles supplied by the manufacturer. Patients were randomly assigned in blocks of four, so that in each block, half the patients would receive misoprostol and half would receive placebo. Because blocks were assigned to investigators, patients were randomly assigned within the individual centers. Investigators were not informed about the randomization procedure but were told only that the study was randomized and double-blind. Patients were instructed to begin taking half a tablet with meals and at bedtime each day for 10 days and then, if the drug was tolerated, to increase the dose to a whole tablet four times a day for the rest of the study. If the drug was not tolerated, the patients were instructed to reduce the dose back to half a tablet four times a day. Patients could continue therapy with arthritis disease-modifying agents (such as gold or corticosteroids) and were allowed to take antacids that did not contain magnesium. Patients purchased their own arthritis medications or antacids and reported their consumption when seen monthly for examination and counts of study medication tablets. Physicians were instructed to watch closely for clinical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other possible gastrointestinal complications, to inquire about symptoms, and to investigate suspicious episodes by appropriate clinical procedures. Outcome Measures All suspicious events, regardless of presumed cause, were to be reported, along with all available patient data, to the study medical officer (HWD) and then to an external review committee. This committee consisted of a gastroenterologist (FS), a rheumatologist (Kenneth Brandt, MD, Indiana University), and an epidemiologist (Marie Griffin, MD, MPH, Vanderbilt University). The committee determined, without unblinding the randomization code, whether the patient had upper gastrointestinal bleeding; other ulcer complications; or a problem such as hemorrhoids, diverticulitis, colon polyps, or cancer. It developed definitions of what were considered to be complications related to NSAID use and categories of such complications. The committee reached consensus and assigned such events to one of the following categories of definite upper gastrointestinal complications: 1. perforated ulcer, proved at surgery; 2. gastric outlet obstruction caused by proven ulceration and stricture, proved by endoscopy; 3. hematemesis, with endoscopically proven gastric or duodenal ulceration or erosion; 4. active or recent visualized bleeding from endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; 5. melena, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; 6. heme-positive stool, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion, plus either a) a decrease in hematocrit of at least 0.05 or b) orthostatic change in the pulse rate (from sitting to standing) of at least 20 beats per minute or decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg; 7. hematemesis, without endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; and 8. melena, with heme-positive stool and without endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion. The committee also defined categories of events not involving clinically significant bleeding: 9. report of melena with no other data; 10. heme-positive stools, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion and without active bleeding; and 11. report of melena and heme-negative stools when the stools were tested. Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Methods The placebo group was expected to have an incidence of serious NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications of about 2% per year or about 1% during the 6-month study period. We estimated that the misoprostol group might have 40% to 50% fewer complications and that 60% to 70% of patients would complete the study. Given an less than 0.05 and power greater than 0.80, we planned in the protocol to assess the number of such complications observed, without unblinding the study, after 7500 patients had been followed. We did this to confirm the incidence assumptions and adjust the study size if necessary. We used the Fisher exact test to compare occurrence of events in the treatment groups. To identify risk factors, we evaluated the relation between the occurrence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications and patient characteristics using logistic regression. Supplementary time-to-event analyses were done using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves. The study was supported by a grant from G.D. Searle & Co. Data c",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAcid suppression with famotidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, provides protection against gastric injury in normal subjects receiving short courses of aspirin or naproxen. The efficacy of famotidine in preventing peptic ulcers in patients receiving long-term therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied the efficacy of two doses of famotidine (20 mg and 40 mg, each given orally twice daily), as compared with placebo, in preventing peptic ulcers in 285 patients without peptic ulcers who were receiving long-term NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (82 percent) or osteoarthritis (18 percent). The patients were evaluated clinically and by endoscopy at base line and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. The evaluators were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of gastric or duodenal ulceration at 24 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers was 20 percent in the placebo group, 13 percent in the group of patients receiving 20 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.24 for the comparison with placebo), and 8 percent in the group receiving 40 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.03 for the comparison with placebo). The proportion of patients in whom duodenal ulcers developed was significantly lower with both doses of famotidine than with placebo (13 percent in the placebo group, 4 percent in the low-dose famotidine group [P = 0.04], and 2 percent in the high-dose famotidine group [P = 0.01]). Both doses of famotidine were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with high-dose famotidine significantly reduces the cumulative incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients with arthritis receiving long-term NSAID therapy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSuppressing acid secretion is thought o reduce the risk of ulcers associated with regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but the best means of accomplishing this is uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 541 patients who required continuous treatment with NSAIDs and who had ulcers or more than 10 erosions in either the stomach or duodenum. Patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg or 40 mg orally per day, or ranitidine, 150 mg orally twice a day, for four or eight weeks, depending on when treatment was successful (defined as the resolution of ulcer and the presence of fewer than five erosions in the stomach, and fewer than five erosions in the duodenum, and not more than mild dyspepsia). We randomly assigned 432 patients in whom treatment was successful to maintenance treatment with either 20 mg of omeprazole per day or 150 mg of ranitidine twice a day for six months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt eight weeks, treatment was successful in 80 percent (140 of 174) of the patients in the group given 20 mg of omeprazole per day, 79 percent (148 of 187) of those given 40 mg of omeprazole per day, and 63 percent (110 of 174) of those given ranitidine (P<0.001 for the comparison with 20 mg of omeprazole and P=0.001 for the comparison with 40 mg of omeprazole). The rates of healing of all types of lesions were higher with omeprazole than with ranitidine. During maintenance therapy, the estimated proportion of patients in remission at the end of six months was 72 percent in the omeprazole group and 59 percent in the ranitidine group. The rates of adverse events were similar between groups during both phases. Both medications were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with regular use of NSAIDs, omeprazole healed and prevented ulcers more effectively than did ranitidine.",

        "abstract": "We studied the recurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in a cohort of patients who had an episode of peptic ulcer bleed, and we investigated the effect of maintenance treatment with cimetidine, omeprazole, and ranitidine. We identified 952 patients with a hospitalization for an episode of peptic ulcer bleed by searching the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom. The mean follow-up time was 33 months. Less than 10% of the cohort presented with a new episode of UGIB. We calculated incidence rates of recurrent UGIB and estimated the relative risk (RR) of UGIB associated with use of the various acid-suppressing drugs. The greatest protection for recurrent UGIB associated with maintenance acid-suppressing treatment was seen with omeprazole (relative risk 0.2; 95% CI, 0.02-1.0). The corresponding estimates with cimetidine and ranitidine were 0.9 (0.3-2.3) and 0.9 (0.5-1.8). Among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, concomitant use of omeprazole afforded protection against a new bleed (RR 0.0; 0.0-1.0), and there was a suggestion of a protective effect with misoprostol, 0.4 (0.01-3.2). The degree of lowered risk of recurrent UGIB in patients on omeprazole maintenance therapy compared with cimetidine or ranitidine therapy is comparable with the protection provided through profound reduction of gastric acidity achieved with proton-pump inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany patients who have had upper gastrointestinal bleeding continue to take low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis or other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for musculoskeletal pain. It is uncertain whether infection with Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for bleeding in such patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were infected with H. pylori and who were taking low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs. We evaluated whether eradication of the infection or omeprazole treatment was more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding. We recruited patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was confirmed by endoscopy. Their ulcers were healed by daily treatment with 20 mg of omeprazole for eight weeks or longer. Then, those who had been taking aspirin were given 80 mg of aspirin daily, and those who had been taking other NSAIDs were given 500 mg of naproxen twice daily for six months. The patients in each group were then randomly assigned separately to receive 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months or one week of eradication therapy, consisting of 120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, all given four times daily, followed by placebo for six months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 400 patients (250 of whom were taking aspirin and 150 of whom were taking other NSAIDs). Among those taking aspirin, the probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 1.9 percent for patients who received eradication therapy and 0.9 percent for patients who received omeprazole (absolute difference, 1.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1.9 to 3.9 percent). Among users of other NSAIDs, the probability of recurrent bleeding was 18.8 percent for patients receiving eradication therapy and 4.4 percent for those treated with omeprazole (absolute difference, 14.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, 4.4 to 24.4 percent; P=0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with H. pylori infection and a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are taking low-dose aspirin, the eradication of H. pylori is equivalent to treatment with omeprazole in preventing recurrent bleeding. Omeprazole is superior to the eradication of H. pylori in preventing recurrent bleeding in patients who are taking other NSAIDs.",

Design Nested case-control study. Setting 367 general practices contributing to the UK QRESEARCH database, spread throughout every strategic health authority and each health board in England, Wales, and Scotland. Participants Patients aged 25 or more with a first ever diagnosis of an adverse upper gastrointestinal event (peptic ulcer or haematemesis) between 1 August 2000 and 31 July 2004 and up to 10 controls per case matched for age, sex, calendar time, and practice. Main outcome measures Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for adverse upper gastrointestinal events associated with celecoxib, rofecoxib, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, other selective and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and aspirin. Results The incidence of adverse upper gastrointestinal events was 1.36 per 1000 person years (95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.39). We identified 9407 incident cases and 88 867 matched controls. Increased risks of adverse gastrointestinal events were associated with current use of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and with conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Risks were reduced after adjustment for confounders but remained significantly increased for naproxen (adjusted odds ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.73 to 2.58), diclofenac (1.96, 1.78 to 2.15), and rofecoxib (1.56, 1.30 to 1.87) but not for current use of celecoxib (1.11, 0.87 to 1.41). We found clinically important interactions with current use of ulcer healing drugs that removed the increased risks for adverse gastrointestinal events for all groups of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs except diclofenac, which still had an increased odds ratio (1.49, 1.26 to 1.76). Conclusion No consistent evidence was found of enhanced safety against gastrointestinal events with any of the new cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors compared with non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The use of ulcer healing drugs reduced the increased risk of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes with all groups of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but for diclofenac the increased risk remained significant.",

The focus of this paper has been placed on the effects of NSAIDs on the mucosal surface, and specifically the effect of these powerful drugs in inducing changes in the hydrophobicity, fluidity, biomechanical and permeability properties of extracellular and membrane phospholipids. Lastly, recent evidence is presented that salicylic acid and related NSAIDs may alter the stability of membranes, inducing the formation of unstable pores that may lead to back\u2010diffusion of luminal acid and membrane rupture.

        "abstract": "The hydrophobic surface layer of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which has been attributed to the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the mucus gel, protects the mucosa of the GI tract and is disrupted by parenteral LPS treatment. We investigated the potential for repletion of this layer as a means to prevent LPS-induced GI injury. Rats were treated orally with PC 1 h before LPS (i.p.). Gastric and ileal tissues were assessed for changes in permeability 5 h later, and gastric fluid was analyzed for signs of GI-related LPS effects (bile acid reflux, increased volume, and pH) and gastric injury (bleeding). Serum TNF-&agr; was assessed as a measure of a non-GI, LPS response. Radiolabeled PC was tracked through the GI tract to verify the extent of luminal exposure during the time of the study. Pretreatment with oral PC significantly blocked permeability increases in gastric and ileal tissue due to LPS. A portion of orally administered PC gained access to the entire GI tract in 1 h. Exogenous PC did not prevent the increase in serum TNF-&agr; or gastric fluid volume or pH induced by LPS, nor did it prevent the duodenogastric reflux of bile acid. There was a tendency for PC to reduce gastric bleeding after LPS. Orally administered PC seems to act directly on the mucosa to prevent GI permeability disturbances due to LPS. Under the conditions studied, oral PC does not block systemic effects of LPS. However, enteral formulations containing PC may be useful adjuncts in the prevention of GI injury from endotoxemia.",

        "title": "Nutritional Protocol for the Treatment of Intestinal Permeability Defects and Related Conditions",
        "abstract": "Under healthy conditions, the intestinal mucosa permits the absorption of vital nutrients from the gut lumen while presenting a barrier against the passage of pathogenic substances into the body. Leaky gut syndrome describes a pathological increase in permeability of the intestinal mucosa that causes increased absorption of intestinally derived endotoxin, antigens, inflammatory mediators, and, in some cases, intact bacteria. These agents can cause local and systemic reactions associated with a broad range of acute and chronic diseases. In some cases, atrophic changes in the mucosal epithelium can lead to the seemingly paradoxical condition of decreased permeability and malabsorption of essential nutrients concurrent with increased permeability and absorption of pathogenic macromolecules. Research indicates that certain nutritional factors may help to support mucosal health and promote normal intestinal permeability (IP). These factors include antioxidants, mucosal nutrients, digestive enzymes, probiotics, and dietary fiber. Some of these nutrients have also been shown to lead to improvement in diseases associated with leaky gut syndrome. This article outlines evidence of efficacy for a number of these agents. It also includes recommendations for a nutritional protocol to treat IP defects. A number of the recommendations in this article are based on double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies that show statistically significant benefit for certain dietary supplements in the treatment of IP defects and related conditions. In most cases, however, the recommendations are based on indirect evidence of efficacy from in vitro human studies or animal research. The nutritional protocol, nutrient forms and dosages presented are the author\u2019s recommendations and have not been studied in controlled clinical trials.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the treatment of intestinal permeability defects and related conditions using nutritional protocols. While it mentions the importance of maintaining the intestinal mucosal barrier, it does not directly build on the findings of the source paper or investigate the specific role of phosphatidylcholine in the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. The paper is more focused on nutritional interventions and does not have a direct connection to the source paper."
