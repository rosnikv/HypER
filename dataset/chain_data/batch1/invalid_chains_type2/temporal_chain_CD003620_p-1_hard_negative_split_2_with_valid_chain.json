        "title": "Effect of silymarin and silybinin on oxygen radicals",
        "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the scavenging action of the flavonoids, silymarin and silybinin (two well known hepatoprotective agents) against different types of oxygen radicals which were generated by specific chemical reactions and detected by luminol\u2010sensitized chemiluminescence. A well known scavenger for each radical was used as control for the paradigm and for comparing its effect with those of the flavonoids. It was found that 0.8 \u03bcg/ml of silymarin and 5.5 mg/ml of silybinin produced the same effect as 3.2 ng/ml superoxide dismutase (SOD). An alkoxy radical scavenging effect similar to the one produced by 0.35 ng/ml of vitamin E was caused by 2 \u03bc/ml silymarin and 1.6 ng/ml silybinin. Silybinin was evaluated as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals by determining the inhibition of the chemiluminescence produced by the Fenton reaction with luminol; this was compared with the results obtained from a more conventional method which determines the inhibition of the damage to 2\u2010deoxyribose by the Fenton reaction. In both methods, inhibition was observed at a relatively high concentration of the flavonoid as compared with ethanol. The action of silymarin and silybinin as scavengers of oxygen radicals may explain the protective effect of these flavonoids in certain forms of liver disease where free radicals are involved. However, other properties of these compounds cannot be discarded for their hepatoprotective actions. \u00a9 1993 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of three pharmaceutical forms of silymarin (silymarin MZ-80, silybinin-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, and silybinin) on the liver oxidative status in vitro and after oral administration to rats with extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO) and sham-operated animals. We evaluated thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and their related enzyme activities (GSH peroxidase, GSSG reductase and GSH transferase). All three compounds inhibited the in vitro production of TBARS (IC50 56\u2013533 \u00b5mol/l). These compounds, mainly silymarin MZ-80, also increased GSH peroxidase and GSH transferase activities. In EBO rats we found increases in TBARS production which was inhibited by 50\u201370% after treatment. Glutathione was reduced by 55% and elevated by silymarin MZ-80. GSH transferase increased in the group given silymarin MZ-80. We conclude that all three derivatives of silymarin show a clear ability to reduce lipid peroxidation in the liver. Silymarin MZ-80 was the only compound that enhanced the glutathione antioxidant system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 We have reported that orally administered melatonin exerts a therapeutic effect on cholestatic liver injury in rats treated with bile duct ligation (BDL) possibly through its antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory actions. Herein, we examined whether successively postadministered melatonin prevents the disruption of hepatic antioxidant status in BDL\u2010treated rats. Wistar rats with BDL were killed 5 and 13\u2003days after BDL. Melatonin (10 or 100\u2003mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to rats with and without BDL everyday for 8\u2003days, starting 5\u2003days after BDL. The hepatic concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, an index of lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione increased 5\u2003days after BDL and further increased at 13\u2003days. Hepatic vitamin E concentration and catalase and Se\u2010glutathione peroxidase (Se\u2010GSH\u2010Px) activities were similarly reduced at 5 and 13\u2003days after BDL. Hepatic ascorbic acid concentration and the hepatic activities of Cu,Zn\u2010 and Mn\u2010superoxide dismutases, glutathione reductase, and glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase decreased 13\u2003days after BDL. Melatonin postadministered to BDL\u2010treated rats attenuated all these changes observed at 13\u2003days after the treatment more effectively at the higher dose than at the lower dose. Melatonin administered to BDL\u2010untreated rats increased the hepatic Se\u2010GSH\u2010Px activity at both doses and the hepatic activities of Cu,Zn\u2010 and Mn\u2010superoxide dismutases at the higher dose. These results indicate that successively postadministered melatonin at pharmacological doses prevents the disruption of hepatic antioxidant status in rats with BDL through its direct and indirect antioxidant action, which may contribute to its therapeutic effect of BDL\u2010induced cholestatic liver injury.",

        "title": "Mechanisms of protection by melatonin against acetaminophen\u2010induced liver injury in mice",
        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 The present study was performed to determine whether melatonin protects mouse liver against severe damage induced by acetaminophen (APAP) administration and where melatonin primarily functions in the metabolic pathway of APAP to protect mouse liver against APAP\u2010induced injury. Treatment of mice with melatonin (50 or 100\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) 8 or 4\u2003hr before APAP administration (750\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) suppressed the increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in a dose\u2010 and a time\u2010dependent manner. Melatonin treatment (100\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) 4\u2003hr before APAP administration remarkably inhibited centrilobular hepatic necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration and increases in hepatic lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase activity, an index of tissue neutrophil infiltration, as well as release of nitric oxide and interleukin\u20106 into blood circulation at 9\u2003hr after APAP administration. However, melatonin neither affected hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content nor spared hepatic GSH consumption by APAP treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with melatonin 4\u2003hr before APAP administration did not influence the induction of hepatic heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) by APAP and melatonin alone did not induce HSP70 in mouse liver. These results indicate that exogenously administered melatonin exhibits a potent hepatoprotective effect against APAP\u2010induced hepatic damage probably downstream of the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1, which works upstream of GSH conjugation in the pathway of APAP metabolism, via its anti\u2010nitrosative and anti\u2010inflammatory activities in addition to its antioxidant activity.",

        "title": "Melatonin receptors mediate improvements of liver function but not of hepatic perfusion and integrity after hemorrhagic shock in rats*",
        "abstract": "Objective:Melatonin has been demonstrated to attenuate organ damage in models of ischemia and reperfusion. Melatonin treatment before hemorrhagic shock has been shown to improve liver function and hepatic perfusion. Proposed mechanisms of the pineal hormone involve direct inactivation of reactive oxygen species and induction of antioxidative enzymes. However, recent evidence suggests a strong influence of melatonin receptor activation for these effects. Specific protection of organ function by melatonin after hemorrhage has not been investigated yet. In this study, we evaluated whether melatonin therapy after hemorrhagic shock improves liver function and hepatic perfusion, with emphasis on melatonin receptor activation. Design:Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting:University research laboratory. Subjects:Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 200\u2013300 g (n = 10 per group). Interventions:Animals underwent hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure, 35 \u00b1 5 mm Hg for 90 mins) and were resuscitated with shed blood and Ringer's solution. At the end of shock, animals were treated with either melatonin (10 mg/kg, intravenously), melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole (2.5 mg/kg, intravenously) plus melatonin (10 mg/kg, intravenously), luzindole alone (2.5 mg/kg, intravenously), or vehicle. Measurements and Main Results:After 2 hrs of reperfusion, either liver function was assessed by plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green or intravital microscopy of the liver was performed for evaluation of hepatic perfusion, hepatocellular redox state, and hepatic integrity. Compared with vehicle controls, melatonin therapy after hemorrhagic shock significantly improved plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green, hepatic redox state, hepatocellular injury, and hepatic perfusion index. Coadministration of luzindole completely abolished the protective effect with respect to liver function only, and improvements regarding hepatic redox state, perfusion, and integrity were comparable with melatonin treatment alone. Conclusions:Melatonin therapy after hemorrhagic shock improves liver function, hepatic perfusion, redox state, and hepatic integrity. With respect to liver function, beneficial effects of the pineal hormone seem to be dependent on melatonin receptor activation.",

        "abstract": "Melatonin, the hormone of darkness and messenger of the photoperiod, is also well known to exhibit strong direct and indirect antioxidant properties. Melatonin has previously been demonstrated to be a powerful organ protective substance in numerous models of injury; these beneficial effects have been attributed to the hormone's intense radical scavenging capacity. The present report reviews the hepatoprotective potential of the pineal hormone in various models of oxidative stress in vivo, and summarizes the extensive literature showing that melatonin may be a suitable experimental substance to reduce liver damage after sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, ischemia/reperfusion, and in numerous models of toxic liver injury. Melatonin's influence on hepatic antioxidant enzymes and other potentially relevant pathways, such as nitric oxide signaling, hepatic cytokine and heat shock protein expression, are evaluated. Based on recent literature demonstrating the functional relevance of melatonin receptor activation for hepatic organ protection, this article finally suggests that melatonin receptors could mediate the hepatoprotective actions of melatonin therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 Although melatonin treatment following trauma\u2010hemorrhage or ischemic reperfusion prevents organs from dysfunction and injury, the precise mechanism remains unknown. This study tested whether melatonin prevents liver injury following trauma\u2010hemorrhage involved the protein kinase B (Akt)\u2010dependent heme oxygenase (HO)\u20101 pathway. After a 5\u2010cm midline laparotomy, male rats underwent hemorrhagic shock (mean blood pressure approximately 40\u2003mmHg for 90\u2003min) followed by fluid resuscitation. At the onset of resuscitation, rats were treated with vehicle, melatonin (2\u2003mg/kg), or melatonin plus phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (1\u2003mg/kg). At 2\u2003hr after trauma\u2010hemorrhage, the liver tissue myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde, adenosine triphosphate, serum alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly increased compared with sham\u2010operated control. Trauma\u2010hemorrhage resulted in a significant decrease in the Akt activation in comparison with the shams (relative density, 0.526\u2003\u00b1\u20030.031 versus 1.012\u2003\u00b1\u20030.066). Administration of melatonin following trauma\u2010hemorrhage normalized liver Akt phosphorylation (0.993\u2003\u00b1\u20030.061), further increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation (5.263\u2003\u00b1\u20030.338 versus 2.556\u2003\u00b1\u20030.225) and HO\u20101 expression (5.285\u2003\u00b1\u20030.325 versus 2.546\u2003\u00b1\u20030.262), and reduced cleaved caspase\u20103 levels (2.155\u2003\u00b1\u20030.297 versus 5.166\u2003\u00b1\u20030.309). Coadministration of wortmannin abolished the melatonin\u2010mediated attenuation of the shock\u2010induced liver injury markers.

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. Exercise has been reported to be effective to protect the heart from cardiac injury during the development of DCM. However, the potential cardioprotective effect of exercise in advanced DCM remains unclear. Methods: Seven-week old male C57BL/6 wild-type or db/db mice were either subjected to a running exercise program for 15 weeks or kept sedentary. Cardiac function, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, and mitochondrial biogenesis were examined for evaluation of cardiac injury. Results: A reduction in ejection fraction and fractional shortening in db/db mice was significantly reversed by exercise training. DCM induced remarkable cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 at the protein level. Meanwhile, DCM caused slightly myocardial fibrosis with elevated mRNA levels of collagen I and collagen III. Also, DCM resulted in a reduction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and transcription, together with reduced mtDNA content and impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure. All of these changes could be abolished by exercise training. Furthermore, DCM-associated inhibition of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling was significantly activated by exercise, indicating that exercise-induced activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling might be responsible for mediating cardioprotective effect of exercise in DCM. Conclusion: Exercise preserves cardiac function, prevents myocardial apoptosis and fbrosis, and improves mitochondrial biogenesis in the late stage of DCM. Exercise-induced activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling might be promising therapeutic targets for advanced DCM.",

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) agonists and exendin-4; an analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 have shown cardioprotective properties in many cardiac injury models. So, we evaluated their effects in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in relation to mitochondrial dysfunction. This work included seven groups of adult male albino rats: the control group, the non-treated diabetic group, and the treated diabetic groups: one group was treated with MSCs only, the second with pioglitazone only, the third with MSCs and pioglitazone, the forth with exendin-4 only and the fifth with MSCs and exendin-4. All treatments were started after 6 weeks from induction of diabetes and continued for the next 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected for assessment of glucose, insulin, and cardiac enzymes. Hearts were removed and used for isolated heart studies, and gene expression of: myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) and autophagic markers: light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The cardiac mitochondrial protein levels of cardiolipin and uncoupler protein 2 (UCP2) were assessed by ELISA and western blot technique, respectively. Treated groups showed significant improvement in left ventricular function associated with improvement in the cardiac injury and myopathic markers compared to the non treated diabetic group. NFKB was down-regulated while cardiolipin, PGC1\u03b1, LC.3 and beclin were up-regulated in all treated groups. These data suggest that the cardioprotective effects of MSCs, exendin-4 or pioglitazone based on their ability to improve mitochondrial functions through targeting inflammatory and autophagy signaling. The co- administration of pioglitazone or exendin-4 with MSCs showed significant superior improvement compared with MSCs alone, indicating the ability to use them in supporting cardioprotective effects of MSCs.",

        "abstract": "Objective- This study investigates the functional significance of mitochondria present in endothelial microparticles (EMP) and how MK2 (MAPKAPK2 [MAPK-activated protein kinase 2]) governs EMP production and its physiological effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Approach and Results- Flow cytometric analysis, confocal imaging, oxygen consumption rate measurement through Seahorse were used to confirm the presence of functionally active mitochondria in nontreated EMP (EMP derived from untreated control cells), lipopolysaccharide, and oligomycin treatment increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species activity in EMP (EMP derived from cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin, respectively). The dysfunctional mitochondria contained in EMP derived from cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin induced the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the target endothelial cells leading to the augmented adhesion of human monocytic cell line on EA.hy926 cells. Multiphoton real-time imaging detected the increased adherence of EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin at the site of carotid artery injury as compared to EMP derived from untreated control cells. MK2 regulates EMP generation during inflammation by reducing E-selectin expression and regulating the cytoskeleton rearrangement through ROCK-2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2) pathway. MK2-deficient EMP reduced the E-selectin and ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1) expression on target endothelial cells leading to reduced monocyte attachment and reduced cardiac hypertrophy in mice.

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Background: S-nitrosylation (SNO), a prototypic redox-based posttranslational modification, is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the role of SNO of MLP (muscle LIM protein) in myocardial hypertrophy, as well as the mechanism by which SNO-MLP modulates hypertrophic growth in response to pressure overload. Methods: Myocardial samples from patients and animal models exhibiting myocardial hypertrophy were examined for SNO-MLP level using biotin-switch methods. SNO sites were further identified through liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. Denitrosylation of MLP by the mutation of nitrosylation sites or overexpression of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase was used to analyze the contribution of SNO-MLP in myocardial hypertrophy. Downstream effectors of SNO-MLP were screened through mass spectrometry and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Recruitment of TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3) by SNO-MLP in myocardial hypertrophy was examined in TLR3 small interfering RNA\u2013transfected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and in a TLR3 knockout mouse model. Results: SNO-MLP level was significantly higher in hypertrophic myocardium from patients and in spontaneously hypertensive rats and mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction. The level of SNO-MLP also increased in angiotensin II\u2013 or phenylephrine-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. S-nitrosylated site of MLP at cysteine 79 was identified by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry and confirmed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Mutation of cysteine 79 significantly reduced hypertrophic growth in angiotensin II\u2013 or phenylephrine-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and transverse aortic constriction mice. Reducing SNO-MLP level by overexpression of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase greatly attenuated myocardial hypertrophy. Mechanistically, SNO-MLP stimulated TLR3 binding to MLP in response to hypertrophic stimuli, and disrupted this interaction by downregulating TLR3-attenuated myocardial hypertrophy. SNO-MLP also increased the complex formation between TLR3 and RIP3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3). This interaction in turn induced NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain\u2013like receptor pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation, thereby promoting the development of myocardial hypertrophy. Conclusions: Our findings revealed a key role of SNO-MLP in myocardial hypertrophy and demonstrated TLR3-mediated RIP3 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation as the downstream signaling pathway, which may represent a therapeutic target for myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is often accompanied by hypertension. Although a large number of studies have confirmed that NLRP3 inhibitors can improve cardiac remodeling in mice with a normal diet, it is still unclear whether NLRP3 inhibitors can improve heart failure (HF) induced by pressure overload in obese mice. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, on HF in obese mice and its metabolic mechanism. Obese mice induced with a 10-week high-fat diet (HFD) were used in this study. After 4 weeks of HFD, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery was performed to induce a HF model. MCC950 (10 mg/kg, once/day) was injected intraperitoneally from 2 weeks after TAC and continued for 4 weeks. After echocardiography examination, we harvested left ventricle tissues and performed molecular experiments. The results suggest that in obese mice, MCC950 can significantly improve cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis caused by pressure overload. MCC950 ameliorated cardiac inflammation after TAC surgery and promoted M2 macrophage infiltration in the cardiac tissue. MCC950 not only restored fatty acid uptake and utilization by regulating the expression of CD36 and CPT1\u03b2 but also reduced glucose uptake and oxidation via regulating the expression of GLUT4 and p-PDH. In addition, MCC950 affected the phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK in obese mice with HF. In summary, MCC950 can alleviate HF induced by pressure overload in obese mice via improving cardiac metabolism, providing a basis for the clinical application of NLRP3 inhibitors in obese patients with HF.",

        "title": "Microglia\u2010Mediated Neuroimmune Response Regulates Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction",
        "abstract": "Background Sympathetic hyperactivity contributes to pathological remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the mechanisms underlying the increase in sympathetic activity remain unknown. Microglia are the predominant immune cells in the central nervous system and can regulate sympathetic neuron activity through neuroimmune response in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. The present study aimed to investigate whether microglia\u2010mediated neuroimmune response can regulate sympathetic activity and cardiac remodeling after MI. Methods and Results PLX3397 (pexidartinib) was used to deplete central microglia via intragastric injection or intracerebroventricular injection. After that, MI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Our study showed that MI resulted in the activation of microglia in the paraventricular nucleus. Microglia depletion, which was induced by PLX3397 treatment via intragastric injection or intracerebroventricular injection, improved cardiac function, reduced infarction size, and attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibrosis, pathological electrical remodeling, and myocardial inflammation after MI. Mechanistically, these protective effects were associated with an attenuated neuroimmune response in the paraventricular nucleus, which contributed to the decrease of sympathetic activity and attenuation of sympathetic remodeling in the heart. However, intragastric injection with PLX3397 obviously depleted macrophages and induced neutrophil and T\u2010lymphocyte disorders in the heart, blood, and spleen. Conclusions Microglia depletion in the central nervous system attenuates pathological cardiac remodeling after MI by inhibiting neuroimmune response and sympathetic activity. Intragastric administration of PLX3397 leads to serious deleterious effects in peripheral immune cells, especially macrophages, which should be a cause for concern in animal experiments and clinical practice.",

        "explanation": "While this paper explores the role of microglia in regulating cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction, it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings on MCC950's effects on cardiac remodeling in obese mice. However, both papers discuss the importance of immune responses in cardiac remodeling, making the key hypothesis in this paper at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper."

        "title": "Stellate ganglion, inflammation, and arrhythmias: a new perspective on neuroimmune regulation",
        "abstract": "Current research on the stellate ganglion (SG) has shifted from merely understanding its role as a collection of neurons to recognizing its importance in immune regulation. As part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the SG plays a crucial role in regulating cardiovascular function, particularly cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. Abnormal SG function can lead to disordered cardiac electrical activity, which in turn affects heart rhythm stability. Studies have shown that excessive activity of the SG is closely related to the occurrence of arrhythmias, especially in the context of inflammation. Abnormal activity of the SG may trigger excessive excitation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) through neuroimmune mechanisms, thereby increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Simultaneously, the inflammatory response of the SG further aggravates this process, forming a vicious cycle. However, the causal relationship between SG, inflammation, and arrhythmias has not yet been fully clarified. Therefore, this article deeply explores the key role of the SG in arrhythmias and its complex relationship with inflammation, providing relevant clinical evidence. It indicates that interventions targeting SG function and inflammatory responses have potential in preventing and treating inflammation-related arrhythmias, offering a new perspective for cardiovascular disease treatment strategies.",
