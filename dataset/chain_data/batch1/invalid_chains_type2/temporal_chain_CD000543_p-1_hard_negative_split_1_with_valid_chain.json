        "abstract": "We assessed oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) prepared with a pH-sensitive polymer coating in 87 patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5-ASA at a dosage of either 4.8 or 1.6 g per day or placebo for six weeks. The outcome was monitored by flexible proctosigmoidoscopic examinations and physicians' assessments at three-week intervals and by patients' recordings of daily symptoms. Results showed 24 percent complete and 50 percent partial responses in those receiving 4.8 g of 5-ASA per day as compared with 5 percent complete and 13 percent partial responses in those receiving placebo (P less than 0.0001, rank-sum test). At a dosage of 1.6 g per day, the response was twice as good as with placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.51). Age, sex, duration of disease, duration of active symptoms, or extent of disease did not affect the clinical outcome. We conclude that oral 5-ASA administered in a dosage of 4.8 g per day is effective therapy, at least in the short term, for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn\u2019s and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88\u2009247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, including patients, their families and friends.",

        "title": "Liver-side of inflammatory bowel diseases: Hepatobiliary and drug-induced disorders",
        "abstract": "Hepatobiliary disorders are among the most common extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), and therefore represent a diagnostic challenge. Immune-mediated conditions include primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as the main form, variant forms of PSC (namely small-duct PSC, PSC-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis) and granulomatous hepatitis. PSC is by far the most common, presenting in up to 8% of IBD patients, more frequently in UC. Several genetic foci have been identified, but environmental factors are preponderant on disease pathogenesis. The course of the two diseases is typically independent. PSC diagnosis is based mostly on typical radiological findings and exclusion of secondary cholangiopathies. Risk of cholangiocarcinoma is significantly increased in PSC, as well as the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with PSC and IBD-related colitis. No disease-modifying drugs are approved to date. Thus, PSC management is directed against symptoms and complications and includes medical therapies for pruritus, endoscopic treatment of biliary stenosis and liver transplant for end-stage liver disease. Other non-immune-mediated hepatobiliary disorders are gallstone disease, whose incidence is higher in IBD and reported in up to one third of IBD patients, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, pyogenic liver abscess and portal vein thrombosis. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important issue in IBD, since most IBD therapies may cause liver toxicity; however, the incidence of serious adverse events is low. Thiopurines and methotrexate are the most associated with DILI, while the risk related to anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and anti-integrins is low. Data on hepatotoxicity of newer drugs approved for IBD, like anti-interleukin 12/23 and tofacitinib, are still scarce, but the evidence from other rheumatic diseases is reassuring. Hepatitis B reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is a major concern in IBD, and adequate screening and vaccination is warranted. On the other hand, hepatitis C reactivation does not seem to be a real risk, and hepatitis C antiviral treatment does not influence IBD natural history. The approach to an IBD patient with abnormal liver function tests is complex due to the wide range of differential diagnosis, but it is of paramount importance to make a quick and accurate diagnosis, as it may influence the therapeutic management.",

        "abstract": "Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease which is associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in 70% of cases. It seems PSC/IBD is a distinct phenotype that is different from PSC, and IBD alone. Hence, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural course and management of PSC/IBD before and after LT for PSC. Extensive colitis, rectal sparing, backwash ileitis, and mild symptoms are the characteristics of IBD coexisting with PSC. Moreover, PSC patients with concurrent IBD have higher risk of cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal neoplasia predominantly in right colon and at younger age. Therefore, it is essential to monitor these individuals continuously. It is interesting to note that the course of IBD (ulcerative colitis) after liver transplantation (LT) for PSC varies greatly, and some patients may develop worsening colitis after LT despite immunosuppressive regimens. As well, management of these patients was discussed in this review.",

        "abstract": "a scale from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death). They found that CCI >42 can predict the significantly poorer survival after LTx for PSC. In addition, transplant at an earlier era, higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and high/low body mass index were associated with higher CCI. Since CCI is an aggregation score of post-transplant complications according to the severity stratified by Clavien-Dindo classification (4), it is quite reasonable that the higher the CCI score the poorer the patient outcome. The fact that there was no difference in CCI between cirrhotic PSC recipients and non-cirrhotic PSC recipients was quite interesting. In addition, it was noteworthy that the way of biliary reconstruction (duct-to-duct vs. choledochoenterostomy) was not associated with CCI score. These facts may represent that the complications developing among PSC recipients are more affected by disease specific causes such as cholangitis, recurrent PSC, and infections (5). It was regretful that the details of biliary complications including anastomotic biliary stricture,",
