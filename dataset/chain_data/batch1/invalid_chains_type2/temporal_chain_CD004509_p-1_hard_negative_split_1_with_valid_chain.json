        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe ovaries provide approximately half the circulating testosterone in premenopausal women. After bilateral oophorectomy, many women report impaired sexual functioning despite estrogen replacement. We evaluated the effects of transdermal testosterone in women who had impaired sexual function after surgically induced menopause.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy-five women, 31 to 56 years old, who had undergone oophorectomy and hysterectomy received conjugated equine estrogens (at least 0.625 mg per day orally) and, in random order, placebo, 150 microg of testosterone, and 300 microg of testosterone per day transdermally for 12 weeks each. Outcome measures included scores on the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women, the Psychological General Well-Being Index, and a sexual-function diary completed over the telephone.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) serum free testosterone concentration increased from 1.2+/-0.8 pg per milliliter (4.2+/-2.8 pmol per liter) during placebo treatment to 3.9+/-2.4 pg per milliliter (13.5+/-8.3 pmol per liter) and 5.9+/-4.8 pg per milliliter (20.5+/-16.6 pmol per liter) during treatment with 150 and 300 microg of testosterone per day, respectively (normal range, 1.3 to 6.8 pg per milliliter [4.5 to 23.6 pmol per liter]). Despite an appreciable placebo response, the higher testosterone dose resulted in further increases in scores for frequency of sexual activity and pleasure-orgasm in the Brief index of Sexual Functioning for Women (P=0.03 for both comparisons with placebo). At the higher dose the percentages of women who had sexual fantasies, masturbated, or engaged in sexual intercourse at least once a week increased two to three times from base line. The positive-well-being, depressed-mood, and composite scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index also improved at the higher dose (P=0.04, P=0.03, and P=0.04, respectively, for the comparison with placebo), but the scores on the telephone-based diary did not increase significantly.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn women who have undergone oophorectomy and hysterectomy, transdermal testosterone improves sexual function and psychological well-being.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of adding testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily to estrogen replacement on sexual function, psychological well-being and self-esteem in surgically postmenopausal women. Methods: A letter of invitation to participate in the study was mailed to women who had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for benign disorders during 1990-98. Fifty women, 45-60 years old, were consecutively recruited and randomly assigned to oral treatment with testosterone undecanoate 40 mg plus estradiol valerate 2 mg daily or placebo plus estradiol valerate 2 mg daily for 24 weeks. A double-blind design was chosen, with cross-over to the other regimen for another 24 weeks of treatment. Forty-four women completed the study. Outcome included scores on McCoy's sex scale questionnaire, the Psychological General Well-Being index and a self-esteem questionnaire, at baseline and after 24 weeks of either treatment. Serum concentrations of total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were analyzed at baseline and after 24 weeks of both treatment regimens. Results: After 24 weeks, both treatment regimens had significantly improved some of the sexual variables. The addition of testosterone had a significantly better effect on the sex variables 'enjoyment of sex', 'satisfaction with frequency of sexual activity' and 'interest in sex'. The total McCoy score was significantly increased by both treatments, but there was a stronger effect when testosterone was also given. Although both regimens improved psychological well-being and self-esteem, we found no significant differences between testosterone-estrogen or estrogen alone at 24 weeks. Serum levels of all androgens, with considerable individual variation, increased significantly from baseline after 24 weeks of testosterone-estrogen treatment. Supraphysiological levels were achieved in a significant proportion of the women. Increases in estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin were less marked when testosterone was also given. Both treatments reduced gonadotropin levels. Conclusions: The addition of testosterone undecanoate improved specific aspects of sexual function more than treatment with estrogen alone. Improvements in well-being and self-esteem were similar for both treatments. If testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily should be used for clinical treatment, regular monitoring of androgen serum levels is needed.",

        "title": "The Menopause and Sexual Functioning: A Review of the Population-Based Studies",
        "abstract": "Abstract Sexual problems are among the most frequently presented health concerns of women attending menopause clinics. We examine rigorous observational studies of the menopausal transition to determine whether there are changes in sexual functioning associated with the menopausal transition and the relative roles of aging and hormonal factors. We detail the methodological limitations of menopause research. We then review studies documenting the effects of aging on women's sexual functioning prior to reviewing studies that document both aging and menopausal status. These latter studies are divided into both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. In summary, there is an age-related decline in sexual functioning but an added incremental decline associated with the menopausal transition. There have been relatively few studies that have been prospective, population-based, utilised a validated measure of sexual functioning, and carried out concurrent hormonal sampling. The Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project is a prospective, observational study of a community-based sample of Australian born women aged 45\u201355 at baseline. There were eight annual assessments using a self-report questionnaire based on the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and blood sampling for hormone levels. From early to late menopausal transition, the percentage of women with scores indicating sexual dysfunction rose from 42% to 88%. Decreasing scores correlated with decreasing estradiol but not with androgens. By the postmenopausal phase there was a significant decline in sexual arousal and interest, frequency of sexual activities, and the Total Score. There was a significant increase in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia and women's reports of their partner's problems in sexual performance. Women with low scores of sexual functioning were more likely to be distressed on the Female Sexual Distress Scale. In conclusion, there is a dramatic decline in female sexual functioning with the natural menopausal transition.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nDespite rapid current and anticipated growth in the number of women who will spend a substantial portion of their life span in the postmenopausal period, the nature, incidence, and prevalence of changes in sexual function during and after the menopausal transition remain poorly characterized.\n\n\nAIM\nChallenges inherent in studying the menopausal transition and proposed additions and changes that have emerged from recent consensus conferences on female sexual dysfunction are reviewed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSpecific topics related to female sexual dysfunction were presented in a Postmenopausal FSD Roundtable in which multidisciplinary international experts participated.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nExpert opinion was based on a review of evidence-based medical literature, presentation, and internal discussion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKnowledge concerning sexual function in the menopause is limited, in part, due to the difficulty in designing and conducting studies that adequately address these changes over time, and which also permit the effects of menopause to be distinguished from more general changes associated with aging. Moreover, the study of female sexual function and dysfunction is in the midst of significant transition: a tentative definition of the stages of reproductive aging and menopause has recently been advanced, and a set of comprehensive changes to the diagnostic framework that defines female sexual dysfunction is under review.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn spite of fast-moving changes in this field of study, it is possible to reach some tentative conclusions about how women's sexual function changes after menopause: postmenopausal women report a relatively high rate of sexual dysfunction (higher than men). There is a marked decline in sexual interest and frequency of sexual activity. This decline can be ameliorated by a number of psychosocial factors, although vaginal dryness and dyspareunia seem to be driven primarily by declining estradiol. The effects of menopause appear to be incremental and additional to those characteristic of aging.",

        "abstract": "The frequency of female sexual dysfunction increases with age, and the menopausal transition has a negative effect on the sexuality. Pharmacological treatment options for female sexual dysfunction during the peri- and post-menopause include hormone therapy or sildenafil. A limited number of randomized, controlled trials have been conducted and evidence suggests that systemic hormone therapy with estrogen, estrogen/progesterone, estrogen/testosterone and tibolone have a positive impact on sexual dysfunction during the peri- and postmenopause. Further, there is evidence that treatment with local estrogen relieves vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Recent knowledge on side effects related to hormone therapy necessitates careful evaluation of the indication for hormone therapy and the duration of postmenopausal hormone therapy should be as short as possible. Long-term side effects of testosterone have not yet been fully investigated. A positive effect of sildenafil has been observed in a limited group of women; those with arousal problems but with no desire problems. The results suggest an intensified focus on new pharmaceutical products for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction in the postmenopause. For the time being the effect of testosterone therapy and tibolone on female sexual dysfunction is being investigated. Sexual dysfunction in women (Female Sexual Dysfunction, FSD) is multi-factorial and influenced by physiological, psychological, social and emotional factors. FSD is defined in four diagnostic groups: desire-, arousal-, orgasm- and pain problems. Recently, it has been suggested that the woman herself should assess the dysfunction as distressful to be diagnosed as having a sexual dysfunction [1]. There are only a limited number of well-conducted population surveys on the prevalence of FSD. Further, relatively few randomized, controlled trials of pharmacological treatment of FSD have been carried out.",

        "title": "Management of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal breast cancer patients taking adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy",
        "abstract": "Treatment with aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women with breast cancer has been shown to reduce or obviate invasive procedures such as hysteroscopy or curettage associated with tamoxifen-induced endometrial abnormalities. The side effect of upfront aromatase inhibitors, diminished estrogen synthesis, is similar to that seen with the natural events of aging. The consequences often include vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) and vaginal dryness and atrophy, which in turn may result in cystitis and vaginitis. Not surprisingly, painful intercourse (dyspareunia) and loss of sexual interest (decreased libido) frequently occur as well. Various interventions, both non-hormonal and hormonal, are currently available to manage these problems. The purpose of the present review is to provide the practitioner with a wide array of management options to assist in treating the sexual consequences of aromatase inhibitors. The suggestions in this review are based on recent literature and on the recommendations set forth both by the North American Menopause Association and in the clinical practice guidelines of the Society of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians of Canada. The complexity of female sexual dysfunction necessitates a biopsychosocial approach to assessment and management alike, with interventions ranging from education and lifestyle changes to sexual counselling, pelvic floor therapies, sexual aids, medications, and dietary supplements\u2014all of which have been reported to have a variable, but often successful, effect on symptom amelioration. Although the use of specific hormone replacement\u2014most commonly local estrogen, and less commonly, systemic estrogen with or without an androgen, progesterone, or the additional of an androgen in an estrogenized woman (or a combination)\u2014may be highly effective, the concern remains that in patients with estrogen-dependent breast cancer, including those receiving anti-estrogenic adjuvant therapies, the use of these hormones may be attended with potential risk. Therefore, non-hormonal alternatives should in all cases be initially tried with the expectation that symptomatic relief can often be achieved. First-line therapy for urogenital symptoms, notably vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, should be the non-hormonal group of preparations such as moisturizers and precoital vaginal lubricants. In patients with estrogen-dependent breast cancer (notably those receiving anti-estrogenic adjuvant therapies) and severely symptomatic vaginal atrophy that fails to respond to non-hormonal options, menopausal hormone replacement or prescription vaginal estrogen therapy may considered. Systemic estrogen may be associated with risk and thus is best avoided. Judicious use of hormones may be appropriate in the well-informed patient who gives informed consent, but given the potential risk, these agents should be prescribed only after mutual agreement of the patient and her oncologist.",

Treatment decisions should take into consideration co-morbidities as well as the presence of other classical risk factors such as HER2 overexpression or extensive peritumoral vascular invasion. Tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression should be considered as proper endocrine therapies in premenopausal patients. Ovarian function suppression alone or ovarian ablation might also be considered adequate in selected patients (e.g. very low-risk patients, in the presence of co-morbidities or patient preference). An aromatase inhibitor should form part of standard endocrine therapy for most postmenopausal women with receptor-positive breast cancer, although patients at low risk or with co-morbid musculoskeletal or cardiovascular risk factors may be considered suitable for tamoxifen alone. Tailored endocrine treatments should be considered in patients with endocrine-responsive tumors classified as pT1 pN0.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nAdjuvant endocrine therapy for early-stage breast cancer has greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with breast cancer recurrence. Despite this, a significant proportion of women report fears of cancer recurrence. This study examined the associations between fear of cancer recurrence (FoR) and illness perceptions, medication beliefs, and treatment side effects in women taking adjuvant endocrine therapy following breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 153 post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer completed a postal survey. Analyses were conducted to examine the association between FoR and illness perceptions, medication beliefs, treatment side effects, demographic factors, and emotional distress and to identify which of these factors would be most strongly associated with FoR in a regression model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll illness perceptions (apart from personal control) were associated with FoR, as were patient beliefs about endocrine therapy. Although treatment side effects, being unemployed, and higher levels of anxiety and depression were associated with FoR, only illness perceptions (identity, treatment control, timeline, and emotional representation) and medication necessity beliefs were significantly correlated with FoR in the final model.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt appears that, in addition to directly targeting FoR, it may be worthwhile to address the illness and medication beliefs supporting the fear. Additionally, helping women to differentiate everyday symptoms from those indicative of breast cancer may help to reduce fear of recurrence.\n\n\nSTATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION\nWhat is already known on this subject? A significant proportion of women report fear of cancer recurrence following breast cancer. The literature shows that illness perceptions, side effects of treatment, and beliefs about medicines are related to fear of recurrence among cancer patients. However, because these variables have often been looked at in isolation, it is not clear whether some perceptions or cues are more likely to relate to fear of recurrence than others. What does this study add? This study shows illness perceptions and medication beliefs are strongly related to fears of cancer recurrence. The results point to ways in which the self-regulatory model of illness may be used to reduce patients' fear of recurrence. The study results show that women with higher fear of recurrence may be balancing a tension between believing that they need to take the medication to protect their future health alongside concerns that the treatment may not be working.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAdherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) influences breast cancer survival. Because ET side effects are frequently cited as reasons for nonadherence, understanding how perceptions and motivations in relation to ET are associated with symptom attribution can help promote timely symptom management.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants were 2,086 breast cancer survivors recruited through the Army of Women registry who were current tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) users. Participants reported whether they were bothered by each of 47 symptoms during the past month and whether they thought each symptom was related to taking ET. Frequencies of overall symptoms and symptoms attributed and misattributed to ET were calculated, and linear regression was used to assess sociodemographics, emotions, and illness perceptions as predictors of symptoms attributed to ET.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen attributed a mean of 8.9 symptoms and misattributed a mean of 1.5 symptoms to ET. In the multivariable analysis, younger age, a more recent diagnosis, AI use (vs. tamoxifen), anxiety, depressive symptoms, more ET-related negative emotions, more concern about long-term ET use, and greater perceived ET necessity were independently associated with attribution of more symptoms to ET. More perceived ET necessity was associated with correctly attributing symptoms to ET, whereas higher depressive symptoms and more concern about ET use were associated with misattribution of symptoms to ET.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven that many women perceive a range of symptoms as a consequence of ET, attention to these symptoms may reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life, potentially improving ET adherence and optimizing survival.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nMany breast cancer survivors on endocrine therapy (ET) experience a range of side effects while taking ET. Targeting potentially modifiable factors associated with attributing a greater number of symptoms to ET, including perceived need for ET, concerns about long-term ET use, negative emotions toward ET, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, may reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hyperhidrosis can significantly curtail patient quality of life, from debilitating physical symptoms to social stigmatization and reduced life opportunities. Current treatments often prove unsatisfactory, especially in sufferers of generalized hyperhidrosis. In this open trial, we present the case of a refractory generalized hyperhidrosis treated with cannabinoids. We found a remarkable reduction in the volume of sweat and an improvement to the patient\u2019s quality of life using this novel low-cost and low-impact approach.",

        "title": "Comprehensive Insight into Cutaneous Application of Hemp",
        "abstract": "Known for its natural bio-compounds and therapeutic properties, hemp is being utilized in the development of skin products. These products offer a wide range of applications and benefits in the fields of natural bio-compounds, pharmaceutical technology, topical delivery systems, and cosmeceuticals. This manuscript deals with hemp actives, such as cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids, and their diverse biological properties relative to topical application, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects. Also, the paper reviews strategies to overcome poor penetration of hemp actives, as well as the integration of hemp actives in cosmeceuticals that provide natural and sustainable alternatives to traditional skincare products offering a range of benefits, including anti-aging, moisturizing, and soothing properties. The review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development and manufacturing processes of skin products containing hemp actives. By delving into the science behind hemp-based products, the paper provides valuable insights into the potential of hemp as a versatile ingredient in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The utilization of hemp in these innovative products not only offers therapeutic benefits but also promotes natural and sustainable approaches to skincare.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the application of hemp actives, including cannabinoids, in skincare products. While it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it does discuss the therapeutic properties of cannabinoids, which is related to the source paper's hypothesis. However, the paper's focus is on topical application in skincare, rather than treating hyperhidrosis, making it partially dependent on the source paper's findings."
