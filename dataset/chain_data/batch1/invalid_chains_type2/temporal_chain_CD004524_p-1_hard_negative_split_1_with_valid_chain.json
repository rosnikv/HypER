        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) compared with placebo in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis 24 week, double bind, randomized, placebo controlled trial compared the response between MTX 7.5 mg/week or placebo in patients with active AS. The primary outcome measure was a composite index of improvement in 5 of the following scales: severity of morning stiffness, physical well being, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire for Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), and physician and patient global assessment of disease activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen patients received MTX and 18 placebo. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 24 weeks, 53% of patients in the MTX group had a treatment response, compared with 17% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). We observed significant improvements with MTX in physical well being (p = 0.009), BASDAI (p = 0.02), BASFI (p = 0.02), physician global assessment (p < 0.001), patient global assessment (p = 0.03), and HAQ-S (p = 0.02). In the adjusted analysis only MTX determined the improvement in the primary outcome. At the end of the trial, one patient with MTX withdrew due to a lack of compliance, and one with placebo due to a lack of efficacy. We did not observe significant differences in rates of side effects between the 2 groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMTX is safe and effective for patients with AS. Longterm studies are needed to evaluate the permanence of its benefit.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGuidelines regarding the use of infliximab in Crohn's disease were previously published by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology in 2004. However, recent clinical findings and drug developments warrant a review and update of these guidelines.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo review and update Canadian guidelines regarding the use of tumour necrosis factor-alpha antibody therapy in both luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA consensus group of 25 voting participants developed a series of recommendation statements that addressed pertinent clinical questions and gaps in existing knowledge. An iterative voting and feedback process was used in advance of the consensus meeting in conjunction with a systematic literature review to refine the voting statements. These statements were brought to a formal consensus meeting held in Montreal, Quebec (March 2008), wherein each statement underwent discussion, reformulation, voting and subsequent revision until group consensus was obtained (at least 80% agreement).\n\n\nOUTCOME\nThe 47 voting statements addressed three themes: induction therapy, maintenance therapy and safety issues. As a result of the iterative process, 23 statements achieved consensus and were submitted for publication.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the past five years, tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonist therapy has become a cornerstone in the management of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional treatment algorithms. The evidentiary base supporting the use of these drugs in Crohn's disease is substantial and strengthened by results from longterm clinical and molecular studies. However, significant gaps in knowledge exist, particularly with regard to treatment failure. Confidence in the safety of these drugs is increasing, provided that therapy is administered in a clinical setting in which potential complications can be readily recognized and treated.",

Total health care resource use and direct health care costs were compared for patients with or without fistulae.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients with one (n=66) and two (n=39) years of economic data before and after infliximab treatment had their resource use and direct health care costs estimated. In the year following initiation of infliximab therapy, there were significant decreases in health care use, reflected in total hospital days (495 to 155 [P<0.05]), inpatient colonoscopies (46 to 24 [P<0.05]), outpatient colonoscopies (58 to 33 [P<0.05]) and major surgeries (10 to 2 [P<0.05]). Direct health care costs of inpatient costs for luminal (-$1,747 [P<0.05]) and fistulizing disease (-$2,530 [P<0.05]), major surgeries (-$1240 [P<0.05]) and outpatient colonoscopies (-$184 [P<0.05]) were also significantly reduced before and after infliximab therapy.

        "abstract": "Background: We systematically reviewed infliximab benefit in reducing hospitalizations and/or major surgery rates in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: A literature search to May 2012 was performed to identify all studies (experimental and observational) evaluating patients with IBD treated with infliximab and providing data on hospitalizations and/or major surgery rates. Three reviewers independently performed studies' selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. Analyses were carried according to study design (randomized clinical trials [RCTs] and observational studies) and IBD type (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). Random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive pooled and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimates of odds ratios (OR). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 test. Results: Twenty-seven eligible studies were included (9 RCTs and 18 observational studies). Infliximab reduced hospitalization risk, both in pooled RCTs (OR, 0.51; 95% CI 0.40\u20130.65; I2 = 0%) and results of observational studies (OR, 0.29, 95% CI, 0.19\u20130.43; I2 = 87%), without differences between CD and UC. Infliximab reduced surgery risk in pooled RCTs results, both in CD (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15\u20130.64; I2 = 0%) and UC (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37\u20130.88; I2 = 0%). Pooled estimate from observational studies favored infliximab for patients with CD (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21\u20130.49; I2 = 77%), but not for patients with UC. Conclusions: The best evidence available points toward a reduction of the risk of hospitalization and major surgery requirement in patients with IBD treated with infliximab. This impact is clinically and economically relevant because hospitalization and surgery are considered to be markers of disease severity and significantly contribute to the total direct costs associated with IBD.",

        "title": "Have Biologics Changed the Natural History of Crohn's Disease?",
        "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a progressive condition, with most patients developing a penetrating or stricturing phenotype over time. The introduction of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies over the past 10-15 years, which was supported by accumulating evidence both from trials and clinical practice, has led to a significant change in patient management, monitoring, and treatment algorithms. Anti-TNF therapy was demonstrated to be effective for both luminal and fistulizing disease. Regular therapy with both infliximab and adalimumab was shown to increase the likelihood of clinical remission and mucosal healing, as well as to reduce the need for surgery and hospitalization in both clinical trials and clinical practice, especially in patients with pediatric-onset CD, shorter disease duration, and when used in combination with immunosuppressives. This has led to new treatment goals and to the use of early aggressive medical therapy in a selected group of patients with a worse prognosis. Exploratory clinical trials are underway to determine if further optimization of therapies and treatment beyond clinical remission leads to superior disease outcomes. However, more long-term clinical data are needed to assess whether an early, aggressive therapeutic strategy employing anti-TNF, alone or in combination with biologicals, can further improve long-term disease outcomes in both pediatric patients and young adults.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated condition with a potentially disabling and destructive course. Despite growing data on when to use a therapeutic \u2018top-down\u2019 strategy, clinical management of this complex disorder is still challenging. Currently, the discussion of \u2018top-down\u2019 strategy in CD mostly includes biological therapy alone or in combination. Areas covered: This article is based on a review of existing literature regarding the use of biological therapy in a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease. The authors reviewed all the major databases including MEDLINE as well as DDW and ECCO abstracts, respectively. Expert opinion: A \u2018top-down\u2019 therapeutic approach in Crohn\u2019s disease is strongly supported by existing data in patients with several risk factors for a severe course of disease. Moreover, there is an increasing amount of published data recommending a more individualised therapeutic strategy to identify candidates for \u2018top-down\u2019 treatment, based on enhanced diagnostics using biomarkers. Emerging therapeutic approaches besides existing therapy concepts using biologicals may possibly redefine the \u2018top-down\u2019 therapeutic strategy for Crohn\u2019s disease in the future.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aim Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with the potential to progress to a severe debilitating state. Treatment with biological agents is highly efficient, improving both short-term outcomes and long-term prognosis. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients receiving biological therapy will exhibit nonresponse at some point. The optimal management of such patients is not clearly defined. Besides traditional anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab), alternative biological therapies (natalizumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab) are currently available for the treatment of CD. Our aim was to analyze all available evidence regarding efficacy of a second biological in \u201cbiological-treatment-experienced\u201d patients. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted using specific criteria for selecting relevant randomized clinical trials evaluating response to administration of secondary biological therapy in \u201canti-TNF-experienced\u201d CD patients. Data from these studies was used to perform (a) traditional meta-analysis to ascertain the effect of secondary treatment versus placebo and (b) network meta-analysis to compare indirectly the efficacy of available biological agents. Results Out of initially 977 studies, only eight were included for analysis, providing a total of 1281 treated and 733 placebo-receiving CD patients. Treatment with a second biological was found to be superior to placebo for both induction of remission (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7 to 3) and response (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.5), with global rates of 24% and 42%, respectively (placebo rate: 11% and 27%, p < 0.0001 for both). Indirect comparisons performed with network meta-analysis suggest no specific agent is clearly superior to others, with relatively better results observed for adalimumab in inducing disease remission. Conclusion In anti-TNF-experienced CD patients, secondary biological administration may be efficient, while no specific agent seems to outperform the others. Further research is needed to identify optimal management strategies for this challenging subset of patients.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of ustekinumab and vedolizumab as second-line therapies in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in which tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi) failed is still debated. The aim of this study was to compare, in a large multicenter observational retrospective cohort, the effectiveness of ustekinumab and vedolizumab as second-line therapies, as assessed by clinical and objective outcomes including endoscopy and gastrointestinal imaging. METHODS: Clinical response, remission, and steroid-free remission at weeks 26 and 52 were evaluated in a retrospective propensity score\u2013weighted and propensity score\u2013matched cohort of patients in which TNFi failed. Objective response and remission were evaluated by 1 or more techniques among endoscopy, magnetic resonance/computed tomography enteroclysis, and small bowel ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 470 patients with CD (239 treated with ustekinumab and 231 treated with vedolizumab) were included in the study. At week 26, clinical outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. At week 52, clinical remission (ustekinumab 42.5% vs vedolizumab 55.5%, P = 0.01) and steroid-free remission (ustekinumab 40.6% vs vedolizumab 51.1%, P = 0.038) rates were significantly higher in vedolizumab-treated patients. Three hundred two patients (hundred thirty-five treated with ustekinumab and hundred sixty-seven treated with vedolizumab) had an objective evaluation of disease activity at baseline and week 52. At week 52, objective response and remission rates were similar between the 2 groups. Clinical response at week 26 predicted steroid-free remission at week 52 in both ustekinumab-treated and vedolizumab-treated patients. Safety profiles were similar between the 2 groups. DISCUSSION: In patients with CD in which TNFi failed, both ustekinumab and vedolizumab showed similar clinical effectiveness after 26 weeks of treatment. At 1 year, vedolizumab was associated with a higher rate of clinical remission when compared with ustekinumab. However, no difference was observed between the 2 groups when objective outcomes were investigated at this time point.",
