        "title": "Efficacy of low-dose methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-eight patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis completed a randomized 24-week double-blind crossover trial comparing oral methotrexate (2.5 to 5 mg every 12 hours for three doses weekly) with placebo. The methotrexate group had significant reductions (P less than 0.01 as compared with the placebo group) in the number of tender or painful joints, the duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity according to physician and patient assessments at the 12-week crossover visit; reductions in the number of swollen joints (P less than 0.05) and 15-m walking time (P less than 0.03) also occurred. These variables, as well as the grip strength and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, showed significant (P less than 0.01) improvement at 24 weeks in the population crossed over to methotrexate. A significantly increased frequency (P less than 0.03) of the HLA-DR2 haplotype occurred in the eight patients with the most substantial response to methotrexate. Adverse reactions during methotrexate therapy included transaminase elevation (21 per cent), nausea (18 per cent), and diarrhea (12 per cent); one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of diarrhea. One patient died while receiving the placebo. Methotrexate did not affect measures of humoral or cellular immunity. We conclude that this trial provides evidence of the short-term efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Longer trials will be required to determine the ultimate safety and effectiveness of this drug.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients participated in a prospective study of the safety and efficacy of oral methotrexate in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Patients received a mean dosage of 12.4 mg weekly over a mean duration of 29.1 months. All patients had liver biopsies at baseline, 2 years, and annually thereafter. Patients improved significantly by all clinical measures of efficacy after 1 month; maximum improvement tended to occur after approximately 6 months of therapy. Radiographs showed improvement of erosive disease in 7 of 11 patients measured. There was a significant reduction in mean prednisone dosage. Four patients required an increase in the dosage of methotrexate after prolonged therapy, because of declining clinical response. Toxicity was noted at some time in 26 of 29 patients (90%), but reactions universally became mild and tolerable after adjustment of the dosage. No significant hepatotoxicity was found in 60 sequential liver biopsies, although elevated transaminase levels were noted at some time in 20 of 29 patients (70%).",

        "abstract": "Twenty-six patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis who had completed a randomized crossover trial of methotrexate elected to continue to receive the drug in a long-term prospective study. At 36 months, 16 patients remained in the study. Over this period of time, significant improvement was noted in the number of painful and swollen joints, physician and patient global assessments, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prednisone dose. Adverse reactions occurred in 16 patients (62%), including nausea, alopecia, headache, stomatitis, herpes zoster, and diarrhea. Mild leukopenia (3 patients), thrombocytopenia (3 patients), and elevated transaminase levels (8 patients) resolved with temporary drug discontinuation. No patient withdrew due to drug toxicity. Liver biopsy specimens in 17 patients after 24 months of treatment showed no evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. A significant increase in the percentage of T3 and T4 blood cells and increases in lymphocyte proliferation to concanavalin A and purified protein derivative of tuberculin were found after 2 years of therapy. Our findings indicate that methotrexate has remained effective over 36 months of therapy, with acceptable toxicity levels and no evidence of systemic immunosuppression.",

        "title": "Liver histology in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving long-term methotrexate therapy. A prospective study with baseline and sequential biopsy samples.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term oral weekly methotrexate (MTX) therapy were studied to determine the extent of their hepatic architectural changes. Liver biopsies (n = 101) were performed in all patients before the initiation of MTX therapy, after 2 years, and annually thereafter (mean duration of therapy 53 months). The hepatic histologic grade (5-point scale) in 25 patients increased (worsened) (mean +/- SEM change 0.84 +/- 1.02; P = 0.001). Fibrosis, confirmed by trichrome staining, developed in 14 of 27 patients (52%). A history of alcohol consumption prior to starting MTX correlated significantly with subsequent worsening of the liver biopsy grade (r = 0.55, P = 0.0054). Alcohol intake prior to study entry, elevated weight at MTX initiation, and dose and duration of MTX were significantly associated with the development of fibrosis. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at 29-53 months of therapy correlated with the increase in hepatic histologic grade at the 3-year biopsy (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) and 4-year biopsy (r = 0.58, P = 0.03). We conclude that long-term MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients results in a statistically significant worsening in hepatic histologic grade, with common development of mild fibrosis. We do not consider these changes to be clinically significant at present.",

        "abstract": "Levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from 5 centers involved in the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System were correlated with the use of specific antirheumatic medications. Elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT were most frequent in patients taking salicylates and methotrexate (MTX) and least frequent in patients taking hydroxychloroquine. The combination of MTX and salicylates greatly increased the frequency of abnormal liver enzyme values. In contrast, the addition of hydroxychloroquine to a regimen of either MTX or aspirin essentially eliminated the SGOT and SGPT abnormalities. Results from all 5 centers were consistent and remained so after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. Knowledge of these important drug interactions may permit continuation of MTX therapy in patients in whom the drug might otherwise be discontinued.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To assess the relative efficacy of methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA), and their combination in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a double-blind, prospective, multicenter, controlled trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods. Two hundred nine patients with active RA were treated with escalating doses of MTX (5\u201315 mg/week), AZA (50\u2013150 mg/day), or combination (5 mg MTX/week plus 50 mg AZA/day\u20137.5 mg MTX/week plus 100 mg AZA/day), with opportunity to increase the dosage at 6-w eek intervals. The patients were evaluated for significant clinical and laboratory improvement and assessed for radiologic progression at 48 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults. One hundred ten patients remained on the initial, randomly assigned therapeutic regimen. The percentage of patients who were responders, defined as those who had 30% or greater improvement in at least 3 of 4 variables, was 38% for the combination treatment, 26% for AZA, and 45% for MTX (P = 0.06). A trend toward decreased radiologic progression was seen in the MTX-treated patients. Termination of treatment due to adverse experience occurred more frequently with combination and AZA treatments than with MTX treatment. Lack of effectiveness, adverse gastrointestinal effects, and liver enzyme elevation were the most frequent causes of treatment discontinuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion. This study establishes that the combination of MTX and AZA in the dosages utilized is not associated with more toxicity than treatment with single agents; however, enhanced efficacy is also not seen. There is a trend toward decreased radiologic progression in patients treated with MTX.",

        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs comprise an important class of medications that reduce the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. They bring relief to millions of people but do not eliminate underlying disease. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs also bring relief, but these drugs are often ineffective and not well tolerated. Failure to provide long-term benefits combined with the high toxicity of most of the disease-modifying agents has prompted a search for more effective treatments. New methods using modern technologies have generated much enthusiasm and hold promise for the future. In the meantime, administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and judicious use of disease-modifying agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for arthritis.",
