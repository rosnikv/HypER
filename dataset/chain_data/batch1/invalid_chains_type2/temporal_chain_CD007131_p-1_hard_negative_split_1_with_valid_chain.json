        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of the present study was to test two brief planning interventions designed to encourage cardiac patients to engage in regular physical exercise following discharge from rehabilitation. The interventions comprised action plans on (a) when, where, and how to act, and (b) coping plans on how to deal with anticipated barriers.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHOD\nAn experimental longitudinal trial was conducted to test two interventions that either focused on action planning alone, or on a combination of action planning and coping planning. A total of 211 participants completed assessments at baseline and 2 months after discharge. Participants were randomly assigned to either one of the intervention groups or a standard-care control group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in the combined planning group did significantly more physical exercise 2 months post-discharge than those in the other groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe theoretical distinction between action planning and coping planning as introduced in the present study has proven useful in explaining changes in health-related behaviour. The combined planning intervention can be applied in the context of cardiac rehabilitation programmes.",

        "abstract": "Although considerable evidence suggests that forming an implementation intention increases rates of goal attainment, less research has examined the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The present research investigated the role of deliberative processes and accessibility of plan components as explanation for the relationship between implementation intentions and goal achievement. Study 1 used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of implementation intentions on goal intentions and self-efficacy. The results of 66 tests suggested that forming implementation intentions had negligible effects on both variables. Study 2 focused on the accessibility of plan components and found that the effect of implementation intentions on goal achievement was mediated simultaneously by the accessibility of specified situational cues and by the strength of the association forged between these cues and the intended response. These findings suggest that implementation intention effects are not explained by increased deliberation, but rather accrue from heightened accessibility of specified opportunities and strong opportunity-response links.",

        "abstract": "Implementation intention formation promotes effective goal striving and goal attainment. However, little research has investigated whether implementation intentions promote behaviour change when people possess strong antagonistic habits. Experiment 1 developed relatively habitual responses that, after a task switch, had a detrimental impact on task performance. Forming an if-then plan reduced the negative impact of habit on performance. However, the effect of forming implementation intentions was smaller among participants who possessed strong habits as compared to participants who had weaker habits. Experiment 2 provided a field test of the role of habit strength in moderating the relationship between implementation intentions and behaviour in the context of smoking. Implementation intentions reduced smoking among participants with weak or moderate smoking habits, but not among participants with strong smoking habits. In summary, habit strength moderates the effectiveness of if-then plan formation in breaking unwanted habits.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHabit might be usefully characterized as a form of automaticity that involves the association of a cue and a response. Three studies examined habitual automaticity in regard to different aspects of the cue-response relationship characteristic of unhealthy and healthy habits.\n\n\nDESIGN, MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS\nIn each study, habitual automaticity was assessed by the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI). In Study 1 SRHI scores correlated with attentional bias to smoking cues in a Stroop task. Study 2 examined the ability of a habit cue to elicit an unwanted habit response. In a prospective field study, habitual automaticity in relation to smoking when drinking alcohol in a licensed public house (pub) predicted the likelihood of cigarette-related action slips 2 months later after smoking in pubs had become illegal. In Study 3 experimental group participants formed an implementation intention to floss in response to a specified situational cue. Habitual automaticity of dental flossing was rapidly enhanced compared to controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe studies provided three different demonstrations of the importance of cues in the automatic operation of habits. Habitual automaticity assessed by the SRHI captured aspects of a habit that go beyond mere frequency or consistency of the behavior.",

        "title": "Behavioural determinants of salt consumption among hypertensive individuals.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHigh salt consumption among populations remains a challenge for health professionals dealing with prevention and control of hypertension. The present study aimed to identify the psychosocial predictors of salt consumption among hypertensive individuals, based on an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Three salt consumption behaviours were studied: Behaviour 1- using <4 g of salt per day during cooking; Behaviour 2- avoiding adding salt/table salt use to the prepared foods; and Behaviour 3- avoiding the consumption of foods with high salt content.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt baseline (n = 108), TPB and additional variables (self-efficacy, habit, past behaviour, hedonic determinant, self-perceived diet quality) were measured. At 2-month follow-up (n = 95), the three behaviours were assessed. Behaviour and intention were sequentially regressed on the study variables, using polytomous logistic regression and hierarchical linear regression with rank transformation, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBehaviour 1 was predicted by intention [odds ratio (OR) = 6.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.81-21.52], whereas self-efficacy and habit predicted intention. Behaviour 2 exhibited high score mean and low variation and was predicted by self-perceived diet quality (OR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.03-6.36). Behaviour 3 was predicted by the hedonic determinant (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.01-1.98).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results indicate that salt-related behaviours are explained by a variety of determinants. Among these determinants, special consideration should be given to motivational and hedonic aspects.",

        "title": "Development of the SALd\u00e1vel programme to reduce salt intake among hypertensive Brazilian women: an intervention mapping approach",
        "abstract": "Background: Despite strong evidence for a relationship between high salt intake and hypertension, plus the widespread recommendations for dietary salt restriction among hypertensive subjects, there are no nursing studies describing effective theory-based interventions. Aim: To describe a systematic process for development of a theory-based nursing intervention that is aimed at reducing salt intake among hypertensive women, by applying the \u2018intervention mapping\u2019 protocol. Methods: We developed our intervention following the six steps of the \u2018intervention mapping\u2019 protocol: assessing needs, creating a matrix of change objectives, selecting theoretical methods and practical applications, defining the intervention programme, organizing the adoption and implementation plan, and defining the evaluation plan. Results: Addition of salt during cooking is identified as the main source for salt consumption, plus women are identified as the people responsible for cooking meals at home. In our study, the motivational predictors of this behaviour were self-efficacy and habit. Guided practice, verbal persuasion, coping barriers, consciousness-raising and counter-conditioning were the theoretical methods we selected for enhancing self-efficacy and promoting habit change, respectively. Brainstorming, role-playing, cookbook use, measuring spoon use, label reading, hands-on skill-building activities and reinforcement phone calls were the chosen practical applications. We designed our intervention programme, and then organized the adoption and implementation plans. Finally, we generated a plan to evaluate our intervention. Conclusions: \u2018Intervention mapping\u2019 was a feasible methodological framework to guide the development of a theory-based nursing intervention for dietary salt reduction among hypertensive women.",

        "abstract": "Background: Excessive salt intake has been directly associated with cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension, and non-cardiovascular diseases. Despite the current recommendations, salt intake remains high, indicating the need to develop theory-based interventions aimed at reducing this intake. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the impact of a theory-based intervention - the SALd\u00e1vel Program \u2013 to promote the use of less than 4 g of salt/day during cooking. Methods: This was a two-arm parallel-group randomized study. A total of 92 hypertensive women were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention was aimed at motivating participants to reduce salt addition by increasing self-efficacy and counteracting the negative influence of habit. Primary outcomes were the behavioral question of salt addition and total salt addition, secondary outcomes were overall salt intake, provided by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, and psychosocial variables (intention, self-efficacy, and habit). Results: At three-month follow-up, the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group regarding salt addition measures (p-values between 0.05 and 0.001) and psychosocial variables (all p-values \u2a7d0.001). The reduction in 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was not significant. Conclusion: The findings showed that this theory-based intervention was effective to motivate and change the behavior of hypertensive women regarding daily salt use in cooking meals. This was accomplished by means of improvements in intention and self-efficacy and reduction of the habit of using more than 4 g of salt/day during cooking.",

        "abstract": "Background: High salt intake is considered as one of the most important causes of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Measuring and identifying factors contributing to people's salt intake behaviors is important to evaluate effectiveness of interventions focusing on salt reduction behaviors. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new theory of planned behavior (TPB)- based instrument to measure factors influencing three different salt intake behaviors (adding salt during cooking, at the table, purchasing salty food) among women. Study design: A mixed-method study. Methods: After the face and content validity of developed instrument were established, a representative sample of women (N= 300, age (SD):42.82(12.10)) were recruited to assess the construct validity using Partial Least Square confirmatory factor analysis. Coefficient alpha and composite reliability (CR) were used to establish reliability of instrument. The content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) were used to assess the content validity. Results: Assessing validity and reliability of instrument led to 56-item questionnaire. CVI was more than 0.70 and CVR more than 0.56. Internal consistency as assessed by Cronbach's alpha was acceptable. Convergent and discriminant validity were established. The GOF index for behavior one was 0.250, for behavior two was 0.414 and behavior three was 0.374. The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicate that TPB model has an acceptable fit with data. Conclusion: Our instrument provides a validated and reliable tool for assessing different aspects of salt intake behaviors in women to evaluate effectiveness of interventions focusing on salt reduction behaviors.",
