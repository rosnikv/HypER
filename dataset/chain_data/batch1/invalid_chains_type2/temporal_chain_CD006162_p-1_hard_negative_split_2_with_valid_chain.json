        "title": "The Endocannabinoid System as an Emerging Target of Pharmacotherapy",
        "abstract": "The recent identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid ligands has triggered an exponential growth of studies exploring the endocannabinoid system and its regulatory functions in health and disease. Such studies have been greatly facilitated by the introduction of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists and inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism and transport, as well as mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors or the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amidohydrolase. In the past decade, the endocannabinoid system has been implicated in a growing number of physiological functions, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in peripheral organs. More importantly, modulating the activity of the endocannabinoid system turned out to hold therapeutic promise in a wide range of disparate diseases and pathological conditions, ranging from mood and anxiety disorders, movement disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, to cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, obesity/metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, to name just a few. An impediment to the development of cannabinoid medications has been the socially unacceptable psychoactive properties of plant-derived or synthetic agonists, mediated by CB1 receptors. However, this problem does not arise when the therapeutic aim is achieved by treatment with a CB1 receptor antagonist, such as in obesity, and may also be absent when the action of endocannabinoids is enhanced indirectly through blocking their metabolism or transport. The use of selective CB2 receptor agonists, which lack psychoactive properties, could represent another promising avenue for certain conditions. The abuse potential of plant-derived cannabinoids may also be limited through the use of preparations with controlled composition and the careful selection of dose and route of administration. The growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials with compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system will probably result in novel therapeutic approaches in a number of diseases for which current treatments do not fully address the patients' need. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the current state of knowledge of the endocannabinoid system as a target of pharmacotherapy.",

        "abstract": "The pharmacological importance of cannabinoids has been in study for several years. Cannabinoids comprise of (a) the active compounds of the Cannabis sativa plant, (b) endogenous as well as (c) synthetic cannabinoids. Though cannabinoids are clinically used for anti-palliative effects, recent studies open a promising possibility as anti-cancer agents. They have been shown to possess anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects in vitro as well as in vivo in different cancer models. Cannabinoids regulate key cell signaling pathways that are involved in cell survival, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, etc. There is more focus on CB1 and CB2, the two cannabinoid receptors which are activated by most of the cannabinoids. In this review article, we will focus on a broad range of cannabinoids, their receptor dependent and receptor independent functional roles against various cancer types with respect to growth, metastasis, energy metabolism, immune environment, stemness and future perspectives in exploring new possible therapeutic opportunities.",

        "title": "Cannabinoids synergize with carfilzomib, reducing multiple myeloma cells viability and migration",
        "abstract": "Several studies showed a potential anti-tumor role for cannabinoids, by modulating cell signaling pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation, chemo-resistance and migration. Cannabidiol (CBD) was previously noted in multiple myeloma (MM), both alone and in synergy with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, to induce cell death. In other type of human cancers, the combination of CBD with \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was found to act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic drugs suggesting their use in combination therapy. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of THC alone and in combination with CBD in MM cell lines. We found that CBD and THC, mainly in combination, were able to reduce cell viability by inducing autophagic-dependent necrosis. Moreover, we showed that the CBD-THC combination was able to reduce MM cells migration by down-regulating expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and of the CD147 plasma membrane glycoprotein. Furthermore, since the immuno-proteasome is considered a new target in MM and also since carfilzomib (CFZ) is a new promising immuno-proteasome inhibitor that creates irreversible adducts with the \u03b25i subunit of immuno-proteasome, we evaluated the effect of CBD and THC in regulating the expression of the \u03b25i subunit and their effect in combination with CFZ. Herein, we also found that the CBD and THC combination is able to reduce expression of the \u03b25i subunit as well as to act in synergy with CFZ to increase MM cell death and inhibits cell migration. In summary, these results proved that this combination exerts strong anti-myeloma activities.",

        "title": "Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 synergizes with carfilzomib in resistant multiple myeloma cells",
        "abstract": "Curative responses in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) are limited by the emergence of therapeutic resistance. To address this problem, we set out to identify druggable mechanisms that convey resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs; e.g., bortezomib), which are cornerstone agents in the treatment of MM. In isogenic pairs of PI sensitive and resistant cells, we observed stark differences in cellular bioenergetics between the divergent phenotypes. PI resistant cells exhibited increased mitochondrial respiration driven by glutamine as the principle fuel source. To target glutamine-induced respiration in PI resistant cells, we utilized the glutaminase-1 inhibitor, CB-839. CB-839 inhibited mitochondrial respiration and was more cytotoxic in PI resistant cells as a single agent. Furthermore, we found that CB-839 synergistically enhanced the activity of multiple PIs with the most dramatic synergy being observed with carfilzomib (Crflz), which was confirmed in a panel of genetically diverse PI sensitive and resistant MM cells. Mechanistically, CB-839 enhanced Crflz-induced ER stress and apoptosis, characterized by a robust induction of ATF4 and CHOP and the activation of caspases. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of PI resistance involves adaptations in cellular bioenergetics, supporting the combination of CB-839 with Crflz for the treatment of refractory MM.",

        "title": "Targeting Glutamine Metabolism and Redox State for Leukemia Therapy",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of immature myeloid precursor cells. AML is poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy and a diagnosis of AML is usually fatal. More effective and less toxic forms of therapy are desperately needed. AML cells are known to be highly dependent on the amino acid glutamine for their survival. These studies were directed at determining the effects of glutaminase inhibition on metabolism in AML and identifying general weaknesses that can be exploited therapeutically. Experimental Design: AML cancer cell lines, primary AML cells, and mouse models of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were utilized. Results: We show that blocking glutamine metabolism through the use of a glutaminase inhibitor (CB-839) significantly impairs antioxidant glutathione production in multiple types of AML, resulting in accretion of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) and apoptotic cell death. Moreover, glutaminase inhibition makes AML cells susceptible to adjuvant drugs that further perturb mitochondrial redox state, such as arsenic trioxide (ATO) and homoharringtonine (HHT). Indeed, the combination of ATO or HHT with CB-839 exacerbates mitoROS and apoptosis, and leads to more complete cell death in AML cell lines, primary AML patient samples, and in vivo using mouse models of AML. In addition, these redox-targeted combination therapies are effective in eradicating ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Targeting glutamine metabolism in combination with drugs that perturb mitochondrial redox state represents an effective and potentially widely applicable therapeutic strategy for treating multiple types of leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Cancer cells are abnormal cells that can reproduce and regenerate rapidly. They are characterized by unlimited proliferation, transformation and migration, and can destroy normal cells. To meet the needs for cell proliferation and migration, tumor cells acquire molecular materials and energy through unusual metabolic pathways as their metabolism is more vigorous than that of normal cells. Multiple carcinogenic signaling pathways eventually converge to regulate three major metabolic pathways in tumor cells, including glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. The distinct metabolic signatures of cancer cells reflect that metabolic changes are indispensable for the genesis and development of tumor cells. In this review, we report the unique metabolic alterations in tumor cells which occur through various signaling axes, and present various modalities available for cancer diagnosis and clinical therapy. We further provide suggestions for the development of anti\u2010tumor therapeutic drugs.",

        "title": "Crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetics in cancer: updates on mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities",
        "abstract": "Reversible, spatial, and temporal regulation of metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic homeostasis are prominent hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to meet the high bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands for vigorous proliferation. Epigenetic dysregulation is a common feature of human cancers, which contributes to tumorigenesis and maintenance of the malignant phenotypes by regulating gene expression. The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic changes. Metabolism produces various metabolites that are substrates, cofactors, or inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes. Alterations in metabolic pathways and fluctuations in intermediate metabolites convey information regarding the intracellular metabolic status into the nucleus by modulating the activity of epigenetic enzymes and thus remodeling the epigenetic landscape, inducing transcriptional responses to heterogeneous metabolic requirements. Cancer metabolism is regulated by epigenetic machinery at both transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional levels. Epigenetic modifiers, chromatin remodelers and non\u2010coding RNAs are integral contributors to the regulatory networks involved in cancer metabolism, facilitating malignant transformation. However, the significance of the close connection between metabolism and epigenetics in the context of cancer has not been fully deciphered. Thus, it will be constructive to summarize and update the emerging new evidence supporting this bidirectional crosstalk and deeply assess how the crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic abnormalities could be exploited to optimize treatment paradigms and establish new therapeutic options. In this review, we summarize the central mechanisms by which epigenetics and metabolism reciprocally modulate each other in cancer and elaborate upon and update the major contributions of the interplays between epigenetic aberrations and metabolic rewiring to cancer initiation and development. Finally, we highlight the potential therapeutic opportunities for hematological malignancies and solid tumors by targeting this epigenetic\u2010metabolic circuit. In summary, we endeavored to depict the current understanding of the coordination between these fundamental abnormalities more comprehensively and provide new perspectives for utilizing metabolic and epigenetic targets for cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The RNA modification, 5\u2010methylcytosine (m5C), has recently gained prominence as a pivotal post\u2010transcriptional regulator of gene expression, intricately intertwined with various tumorigenic processes. However, the exact mechanisms governing m5C modifications during the onset and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Here, it is determined that the m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 exhibits significantly elevated expression and exerts an oncogenic function in CRC. Mechanistically, NSUN2 and YBX1 are identified as the \u201cwriter\u201d and \u201creader\u201d of ENO1, culminating in the reprogramming of the glucose metabolism and increased production of lactic acid in an m5C\u2010dependent manner. The accumulation of lactic acid derived from CRC cells, in turn, activates the transcription of NSUN2 through histone H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la), and induces the lactylation of NSUN2 at the Lys356 residue (K356), which is crucial for capturing target RNAs. Together, these findings reveal an intriguing positive feedback loop involving the NSUN2/YBX1/m5C\u2010ENO1 signaling axis, thereby bridging the connection between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic remodeling, which may shed light on the therapeutic potential of combining an NSUN2 inhibitor with immunotherapy for CRC.",
