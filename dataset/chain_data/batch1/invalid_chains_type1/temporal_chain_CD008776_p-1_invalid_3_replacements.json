        "title": "Cluster-Randomized Trial of a Mobile Phone Personalized Behavioral Intervention for Blood Glucose Control",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To test whether adding mobile application coaching and patient/provider web portals to community primary care compared with standard diabetes management would reduce glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A cluster-randomized clinical trial, the Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study, randomly assigned 26 primary care practices to one of three stepped treatment groups or a control group (usual care). A total of 163 patients were enrolled and included in analysis. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin levels over a 1-year treatment period. Secondary outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, depression, and other clinical (blood pressure) and laboratory (lipid) values. Maximal treatment was a mobile- and web-based self-management patient coaching system and provider decision support. Patients received automated, real-time educational and behavioral messaging in response to individually analyzed blood glucose values, diabetes medications, and lifestyle behaviors communicated by mobile phone. Providers received quarterly reports summarizing patient\u2019s glycemic control, diabetes medication management, lifestyle behaviors, and evidence-based treatment options. RESULTS The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were 1.9% in the maximal treatment group and 0.7% in the usual care group, a difference of 1.2% (P = 0.001) over 12 months. Appreciable differences were not observed between groups for patient-reported diabetes distress, depression, diabetes symptoms, or blood pressure and lipid levels (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood glucose data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines to providers substantially reduced glycated hemoglobin levels over 1 year.",

        "title": "The eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model: A Theory Derivation Approach",
        "abstract": "Background Chronic illnesses are significant to individuals and costly to society. When systematically implemented, the well-established and tested Chronic Care Model (CCM) is shown to improve health outcomes for people with chronic conditions. Since the development of the original CCM, tremendous information management, communication, and technology advancements have been established. An opportunity exists to improve the time-honored CCM with clinically efficacious eHealth tools. Objective The first goal of this paper was to review research on eHealth tools that support self-management of chronic disease using the CCM. The second goal was to present a revised model, the eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model (eCCM), to show how eHealth tools can be used to increase efficiency of how patients manage their own chronic illnesses. Methods Using Theory Derivation processes, we identified a \u201cparent theory\u201d, the Chronic Care Model, and conducted a thorough review of the literature using CINAHL, Medline, OVID, EMBASE PsychINFO, Science Direct, as well as government reports, industry reports, legislation using search terms \u201cCCM or Chronic Care Model\u201d AND \u201ceHealth\u201d or the specific identified components of eHealth. Additionally, \u201cChronic Illness Self-management support\u201d AND \u201cTechnology\u201d AND several identified eHealth tools were also used as search terms. We then used a review of the literature and specific components of the CCM to create the eCCM. Results We identified 260 papers at the intersection of technology, chronic disease self-management support, the CCM, and eHealth and organized a high-quality subset (n=95) using the components of CCM, self-management support, delivery system design, clinical decision support, and clinical information systems. In general, results showed that eHealth tools make important contributions to chronic care and the CCM but that the model requires modification in several key areas. Specifically, (1) eHealth education is critical for self-care, (2) eHealth support needs to be placed within the context of community and enhanced with the benefits of the eCommunity or virtual communities, and (3) a complete feedback loop is needed to assure productive technology-based interactions between the patient and provider. Conclusions The revised model, eCCM, offers insight into the role of eHealth tools in self-management support for people with chronic conditions. Additional research and testing of the eCCM are the logical next steps.",

        "abstract": "Cancer survivors' acceptance and use of eHealth/mHealth applications for self-management can be unique and are not fully understood. We used data from the Health Information National Trends Survey 4 Cycle 4 to examine cancer survivors' acceptance and use of eHealth/mHea applications for key self-management processes, and conducted logistic regression and Rao-Scott design-adjusted Chi-square tests to assess bivariate associations between potential predictors and actual use. Potential factors were selected based on the Individual and Family Self-Management theory. High acceptance of eHealth applictions was identified, and adoption of mHealth was relatively low. Younger, higher educated, married, employed, and higher income survivors tended to use eHealth/mHealth applications for self-management. Survivors who were newly diagnosed or still on treatment were more likely to look for cancer information online or communicate with health providers electronically. BMI and rural residency were associated with use of mHealth apps to achieve a health-related goal and treatment decision-making.",

        "title": "Patient portal utilization: before and after stage 2 electronic health record meaningful use",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPatient portal functionalities, such as patient-physician e-communication, can benefit patients by improving clinical outcomes. Utilization has historically been low but may have increased in recent years due to the implementation of Stage 2 Meaningful Use for electronic health records. This study has 2 objectives: 1) to compare patient portal utilization rates before Stage 2 (2011-2013) and after Stage 2 (2014-2017), and 2) to examine whether disparities in patient portal utilization attenuate after Stage 2.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe conducted an observational study using a pooled cross-sectional analysis of 2011-2017 National Health Interview Survey data (n\u2009=\u2009254\u00a0183).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean percent use of patient portals significantly increased from the pre-Stage 2 to the post-Stage 2 period (6.9%, 95% CI, 6.2-7.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Non-Hispanic Black individuals (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.76-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.0001) and Hispanic individuals (OR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.74-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.0001) have lower odds of using patient portals compared to non-Hispanic White individuals. Although we found independent effects of race/ethnicity, we did not find a statistically significant interaction between race/ethnicity and time. We found a similar level of increase in patient portal utilization from the pre- to postperiod across racial and ethnic groups.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nHealth care policies such as Stage 2 Meaningful Use are likely contributing to increased patient portal utilization across all patients and helping to attenuate disparities in utilization between subgroups of patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFurther research is needed to explore which patient portal functionalities are perceived as most beneficial to patients and whether patients have access to those functionalities.",

        "title": "Electronic Medical Record\u2013Based Electronic Messaging Among Patients with Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background \u2003Electronic medical record (EMR) systems and electronic messages are an increasingly common conduit between physicians and patients. Clear benefits of this type of communication have been established, especially among cancer patients. Studies suggest that patient portals and electronic messaging platforms can help with care coordination between oncology providers and facilitate asynchronous patient-provider communication. Despite the many benefits, there is little research regarding EMR and secure messaging use, particularly among patients with breast cancer. Objectives \u2003The objective of this systematic review was to examine the evidence supporting the use of EMR-based messaging systems in patients with breast cancer. Methods \u2003A systematic literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science CINAHL, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Studies were required to be published between 2005 and 2022 and report data on demographic information and electronic messaging between patients and providers. Studies were excluded if they reported insufficient data, did not include breast cancer patients, or were not published in English. Results \u2003This study identified 10 articles that met inclusion criteria. The resulting studies investigated topics such as: patterns of messaging and medication adherence, cancer screening, messaging as a predictor of behavior or outcomes, and symptom management. The literature indicates that electronic messaging with providers was associated with clinical benefits for breast cancer patients and improved screening behaviors. Conclusion \u2003This review uncovered multiple areas to focus future research on, including ideal volume of electronic messages sent and their relation to prescription adherence, studies focusing solely on the breast cancer population, racial disparities in electronic messaging, and provider perceptions of electronic messaging. It is vital that more work be done to understand barriers and gaps in EMR usage to ensure that all individuals can access this increasingly essential medical service while minimizing physician workload and burnout.",

        "title": "The Effect of Using a Client-Accessible Health Record on Perceived Quality of Care: Interview Study Among Parents and Adolescents",
        "abstract": "Background Patient-accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs) are assumed to enhance the quality of care, expressed in terms of safety, effectiveness, timeliness, person centeredness, efficiency, and equity. However, research on the impact of PAEHRs on the perceived quality of care among parents, children, and adolescents is largely lacking. In the Netherlands, a PAEHR (Iuvenelis) was developed for preventive child health care and youth care. Parents and adolescents had access to its full content, could manage appointments, ask questions, and comment on written reports. Objective This study aims to assess whether and how using this PAEHR contributes to perceived quality of care from a client\u2019s perspective. Methods We chose a qualitative design with a phenomenological approach to explore how parents and adolescents perceived the impact of using a PAEHR on quality of care. In-depth interviews that simultaneously included 1 to 3 people were conducted in 2021. In total, 20 participants were included in the study, representing parents and adolescents, both sexes, different educational levels, different native countries, and all participating municipalities. Within this group, 7 of 13 (54%) parents had not previously been informed about the existence of a client portal. Their expectations of using the client portal, in relation to quality of care, were discussed after a demonstration of the portal. Results Parents and adolescents perceived that using Iuvenelis contributed to the quality of care because they felt better informed and more involved in the care process than before the introduction of Iuvenelis. Moreover, they experienced more control over their health data, faster and simpler access to their health information, and found it easier to manage appointments or ask questions at their convenience. Parents from a migratory background, among whom 6 of 7 (86%) had not previously been informed about the portal, expected that portal access would enhance their understanding of and control over their care processes. The parents expressed concerns about equity because parents from a migratory background might have less access to the service. Nevertheless, portal usability was regarded as high. Furthermore, both parents and adolescents saw room for improvement in the broader interdisciplinary use of Iuvenelis and the quality of reporting. Conclusions Using Iuvenelis can contribute to the client-experienced quality of care, more specifically to perceived person centeredness, timeliness, safety, efficiency, and integration of care. However, some quality aspects, such as equity, still need addressing. In general, client information about the portal needs to be improved, specifically focusing on people in vulnerable circumstances, such as those from migratory backgrounds. In addition, to maximize the potential benefit of using Iuvenelis, stimulating a person-centered attitude among professionals is important. Considering the small number of adolescent participants (n=7), adding quantitative data from a structured survey could strengthen the available evidence.",
