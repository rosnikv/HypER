        "title": "Hypoxaemia and Supplemental Oxygen Therapy in the First 24 Hours after Myocardial Infarction: The Role of Pulse Oximetry",
        "abstract": "Objective To assess the incidence and degree of hypoxaemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate the nation-wide perception and usage of oxygen therapy. Design Postal survey of all coronary care units (CCU) in England of their use of prescribed oxygen and pulse oximetry. Prospective randomised study of 50 patients presenting within 24 hours of onset of myocardial infarction, half of whom received oxygen therapy. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) as continuously measured by pulse oximetry, and arrhythmias and ST segment changes were recorded on simultaneous 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitors. Results In 53% of UK coronary care units oxygen is not routinely prescribed but in only 3% is a pulse oximeter used to aid management. In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction the incidence of hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 90%) was 70% and severe hypoxaemia 35% in those not given oxygen, compared with only 27% and 4% in patients given oxygen therapy. The only patient to receive oxygen on clinical grounds had an oxygen saturation of 71%. Severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 80%) occurred significantly less often (1 and 7 patients, p < 0.05) in patients given oxygen. There were no differences in arrhythmias or ST segment changes between groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemia occurs frequently in patients in the first 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction. It is effectively and easily treated with supplemental oxygen which can be guided by pulse oximetry. This is rarely done. Measurements of oxygen saturation are therefore justified in all patients to guide oxygen therapy unless there is a decision to give all patients supplemental oxygen: this we believe to be unnecessary.",

        "abstract": "Context: International guidelines recommend the routine use of oxygen therapy in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). Objective: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. Data sources: Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and CINHAL. Study selection: Randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. Data extraction: The primary clinical outcome was mortality. Results: Two of 51 potential studies met the inclusion criteria. The one study with substantive clinical outcome data reported that in uncomplicated MI, high-flow oxygen was associated with a non-significant increased risk of death (risk ratio 2.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 10.3, p\u200a=\u200a0.08) and a greater serum aspartate aminotransferase level (difference 19.2 IU/ml, 95% CI 0 to 38.4, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) than room air. Conclusion: The limited evidence that does exist suggests that the routine use of high-flow oxygen in uncomplicated MI may result in a greater infarct size and possibly increase the risk of mortality.",

        "abstract": "Background Although the haemodynamic effects of oxygen in healthy subjects are well documented, there have been no well-controlled studies of the effects of oxygen in patients with heart failure (HF). Aims To non-invasively evaluate haemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of oxygen in patients with HF at rest. Methods and results 13 men with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) were randomised in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to receive medical air or oxygen (40% and high concentration via Hudson non-rebreathing mask). Haemodynamic measurements were made with applanation tonometry, impedance cardiography and venous occlusion plethysmography. Plasma C-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and A-type natriuretic peptide were measured. Data were analysed with paired t tests. Cardiac output fell by \u22120.58 (0.62)\u2005l/min on high-flow oxygen compared with \u22120.02 (0.58)\u2005l/min on air, p=0.031. Oxygen caused a reduction in heart rate (\u22124.02 (4.21) vs 0.41 (5.35)\u2005beats/min, respectively, p=0.021) and a trend towards increased systemic vascular resistance (875 (1174) vs 235 (321)\u2005dyne/s/m5, p=0.050). Oxygen led to a paradoxical increase in forearm blood flow (0.513 (0.391) vs 0.024 (0.246)\u2005ml/min/100\u2002ml forearm volume on air, p=0.01). Natriuretic peptides were unchanged with oxygen. Conclusions High-concentration inhaled oxygen has significant haemodynamic effects in patients with LVSD and mild HF. Such effects may be detrimental in patients with decompensated HF.",

        "abstract": "During and after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, high concentrations of oxygen are routinely administered, with the intention of preventing cellular hypoxia. We systematically reviewed the literature addressing the effects of arterial hyperoxia. Extensive evidence from pre\u2010clinical experiments and clinical studies in other patient groups suggests predominant harm, caused by oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, perfusion heterogeneity and myocardial injury. Whether these alterations are temporary and benign, or actually affect clinical outcome, remains to be demonstrated. In nine clinical cardiac surgical studies in low\u2010risk patients, higher oxygen targets tended to compromise cardiovascular function, but did not affect clinical outcome. No data about potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia, such as reduction of gas micro\u2010emboli or post\u2010cardiac surgery infections, were reported. Current evidence is insufficient to specify optimal oxygen targets. Nevertheless, the safety of supraphysiological oxygen suppletion is unproven. Randomised studies with a variety of oxygen targets and inclusion of high\u2010risk patients are needed to identify optimal oxygen targets during and after cardiac surgery.",

        "title": "Normothermic Perfusion in the Assessment and Preservation of Declined Livers Before Transplantation: Hyperoxia and Vasoplegia\u2014Important Lessons From the First 12 Cases",
        "abstract": "Background A program of normothermic ex situ liver perfusion (NESLiP) was developed to facilitate better assessment and use of marginal livers, while minimizing cold ischemia. Methods Declined marginal livers and those offered for research were evaluated. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion was performed using an erythrocyte-based perfusate. Viability was assessed with reference to biochemical changes in the perfusate. Results Twelve livers (9 donation after circulatory death [DCD] and 3 from brain-dead donors), median Donor Risk Index 2.15, were subjected to NESLiP for a median 284 minutes (range, 122-530 minutes) after an initial cold storage period of 427 minutes (range, 222-877 minutes). The first 6 livers were perfused at high perfusate oxygen tensions, and the subsequent 6 at near-physiologic oxygen tensions. After transplantation, 5 of the first 6 recipients developed postreperfusion syndrome and 4 had sustained vasoplegia; 1 recipient experienced primary nonfunction in conjunction with a difficult explant. The subsequent 6 liver transplants, with livers perfused at lower oxygen tensions, reperfused uneventfully. Three DCD liver recipients developed cholangiopathy, and this was associated with an inability to produce an alkali bile during NESLiP. Conclusions Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion enabled assessment and transplantation of 12 livers that may otherwise not have been used. Avoidance of hyperoxia during perfusion may prevent postreperfusion syndrome and vasoplegia, and monitoring biliary pH, rather than absolute bile production, may be important in determining the likelihood of posttransplant cholangiopathy. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion has the potential to increase liver utilization, but more work is required to define factors predicting good outcomes.",

        "title": "Observations on the ex situ perfusion of livers for transplantation",
        "abstract": "Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion might allow viability assessment of livers before transplantation. Perfusion characteristics were studied in 47 liver perfusions, of which 22 resulted in transplants. Hepatocellular damage was reflected in the perfusate transaminase concentrations, which correlated with posttransplant peak transaminase levels. Lactate clearance occurred within 3 hours in 46 of 47 perfusions, and glucose rose initially during perfusion in 44. Three livers required higher levels of bicarbonate support to maintain physiological pH, including one developing primary nonfunction. Bile production did not correlate with viability or cholangiopathy, but bile pH, measured in 16 of the 22 transplanted livers, identified three livers that developed cholangiopathy (peak pH < 7.4) from those that did not (pH > 7.5). In the 11 research livers where it could be studied, bile pH > 7.5 discriminated between the 6 livers exhibiting >50% circumferential stromal necrosis of septal bile ducts and 4 without necrosis; one liver with 25\u201050% necrosis had a maximum pH 7.46. Liver viability during normothermic perfusion can be assessed using a combination of transaminase release, glucose metabolism, lactate clearance, and maintenance of acid\u2010base balance. Evaluation of bile pH may offer a valuable insight into bile duct integrity and risk of posttransplant ischemic cholangiopathy.",

        "abstract": "The impact of aspartate transaminases (AST) and gamma\u2010glutamyl transferase (GGT) in serum of deceased donors on outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) is unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between donor highest AST value or first donor GGT value and graft survival. All consecutive patients who underwent a primary LT in a single center with available donor AST (N\u2009=\u20091253) and GGT value (N\u2009=\u20091152) were included. There was no significant association between donor AST and 90\u2010day graft survival. We found a moderate association between GGT and 90\u2010day graft survival. We found a significant interaction with a donor history of alcohol abuse (HAA). The risk of graft loss was associated with AST and GGT in donors with an HAA but remains unchanged in donors without HAA. There was no difference in graft survival according to donor AST or GGT with a cutoff \u226595th percentile (475\u2009UI/l for AST and 170\u2009UI/l for GGT). However, graft survival was significantly decreased when donors combined GGT\u2009\u2265\u2009170\u2009UI/l and HAA (61% at one year).

        "abstract": "Organ shortage has led to the increasing utilization of livers retrieved from donors after circulatory death (DCD). These pre-damaged organs are susceptible to further warm ischemia and exhibit minimal tolerance for cold storage. The aim was thus to examine the effects of fibrinolysis combined with Venous Systemic Oxygen Persufflation (VSOP) on the preservation of DCD livers in vivo. Livers of male Lewis rats were explanted after 45 min of warm ischemia, cold-stored for 18 h, and transplanted into a recipient animal. Livers were left untreated or underwent either VSOP or fibrinolysis via Streptokinase (SK) or received combined SK and VSOP. Combined treatment exhibited improved microvascular flow at 168 h (p = 0.0009) and elevated microperfusion velocity at 24 h post-transplantation (p = 0.0007). Combination treatment demonstrated increased portal venous flow (PVF) at 3 and 24 h post-transplantation (p = 0.0004, p < 0.0001), although SK and VSOP analogously achieved increases at 24 h (p = 0.0036, p = 0.0051). Enzyme release was decreased for combination treatment (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0223) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurements were lower at 24 h post-transplantation (p = 0.0287). Further supporting findings have been obtained in terms of serum cytokine levels and in the alterations of endothelial injury markers. The combination treatment of SK + VSOP might provide improved organ integrity and viability and may therefore warrant further investigation as a potential therapeutic approach in the clinical setting of DCD.",

        "title": "Challenges With the Implementation of Machine Perfusion in Clinical Liver Transplantation.",
        "abstract": "Dynamic organ preservation is a relatively old technique which has regained significant interest in the last decade. Machine perfusion (MP) techniques are applied in various fields of solid organ transplantation today. The first clinical series of ex situ MP in liver transplantation was presented in 2010. Since then, the number of research and clinical applications has substantially increased. Despite the notable beneficial effect on organ quality and recipient outcome, MP is still not routinely used in liver transplantation. Based on the enormous need to better preserve organs and the subsequent demand to continuously innovate and develop perfusion equipment further, this technology is also beneficial to test and deliver future therapeutic strategies to livers before implantation. This article summarizes the various challenges observed during the current shift from static to dynamic liver preservation in the clinical setting. The different organ perfusion strategies are discussed first, together with ongoing clinical trials and future study design. The current status of research and the impact of costs and regulations is highlighted next. Factors contributing to costs and other required resources for a worldwide successful implementation and reimbursement are presented third. The impact of research on cost-utility and effectivity to guide the tailored decision-making regarding the optimal perfusion strategy is discussed next. Finally, this article provides potential solutions to the challenging field of innovation in healthcare considering the various social and economic factors and the role of clinical, regulatory, and financial stakeholders worldwide.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHypothermic Oxygenated machine PErfusion (HOPE) can reduce ischemic reperfusion injury and improve outcomes for liver transplant recipients. However, the effect of HOPE on high-risk extended criteria donor (ECD) and donation after circulatory death determination (DCDD) grafts is incomplete, despite the expectation that this cohort benefit maximally from HOPE. Accordingly, this paper aims to characterize the effect of HOPE on ECD and DCDD grafts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study includes all papers comparing HOPE to static cold storage for high-risk ECD and DCDD grafts. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and Scopus were completed using the terms \"HOPE\" OR \"hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion\" AND \"liver transplantation\". Data were extracted and analyzed using IBM SPSS to perform the meta-analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 2286 records were identified, with 10 meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, the quality of evidence is heterogenous with many papers relying on retrospective controls. However, pooled analysis demonstrates HOPE to significantly reduce the rate of early allograft dysfunction, 12-month graft failure, re-transplantation, total biliary complications, and non-anastomotic strictures for high-risk grafts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is good evidence that HOPE improves outcomes following liver transplantation across a number of biochemical and clinical endpoints for high-risk grafts. Of note, the reduction in biliary complications and re-transplantation is particularly significant given the morbidity associated with these endpoints. However, further, high-quality prospective trials with contemporary controls and clinically relevant primary endpoints are needed to better define the impact of HOPE for this cohort of grafts.",
