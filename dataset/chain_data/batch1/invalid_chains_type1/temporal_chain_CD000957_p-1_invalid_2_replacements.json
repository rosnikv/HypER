        "title": "Efficacy of low-dose methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-eight patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis completed a randomized 24-week double-blind crossover trial comparing oral methotrexate (2.5 to 5 mg every 12 hours for three doses weekly) with placebo. The methotrexate group had significant reductions (P less than 0.01 as compared with the placebo group) in the number of tender or painful joints, the duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity according to physician and patient assessments at the 12-week crossover visit; reductions in the number of swollen joints (P less than 0.05) and 15-m walking time (P less than 0.03) also occurred. These variables, as well as the grip strength and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, showed significant (P less than 0.01) improvement at 24 weeks in the population crossed over to methotrexate. A significantly increased frequency (P less than 0.03) of the HLA-DR2 haplotype occurred in the eight patients with the most substantial response to methotrexate. Adverse reactions during methotrexate therapy included transaminase elevation (21 per cent), nausea (18 per cent), and diarrhea (12 per cent); one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of diarrhea. One patient died while receiving the placebo. Methotrexate did not affect measures of humoral or cellular immunity. We conclude that this trial provides evidence of the short-term efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Longer trials will be required to determine the ultimate safety and effectiveness of this drug.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients participated in a prospective study of the safety and efficacy of oral methotrexate in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Patients received a mean dosage of 12.4 mg weekly over a mean duration of 29.1 months. All patients had liver biopsies at baseline, 2 years, and annually thereafter. Patients improved significantly by all clinical measures of efficacy after 1 month; maximum improvement tended to occur after approximately 6 months of therapy. Radiographs showed improvement of erosive disease in 7 of 11 patients measured. There was a significant reduction in mean prednisone dosage. Four patients required an increase in the dosage of methotrexate after prolonged therapy, because of declining clinical response. Toxicity was noted at some time in 26 of 29 patients (90%), but reactions universally became mild and tolerable after adjustment of the dosage. No significant hepatotoxicity was found in 60 sequential liver biopsies, although elevated transaminase levels were noted at some time in 20 of 29 patients (70%).",

        "abstract": "Twenty-six patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis who had completed a randomized crossover trial of methotrexate elected to continue to receive the drug in a long-term prospective study. At 36 months, 16 patients remained in the study. Over this period of time, significant improvement was noted in the number of painful and swollen joints, physician and patient global assessments, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prednisone dose. Adverse reactions occurred in 16 patients (62%), including nausea, alopecia, headache, stomatitis, herpes zoster, and diarrhea. Mild leukopenia (3 patients), thrombocytopenia (3 patients), and elevated transaminase levels (8 patients) resolved with temporary drug discontinuation. No patient withdrew due to drug toxicity. Liver biopsy specimens in 17 patients after 24 months of treatment showed no evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. A significant increase in the percentage of T3 and T4 blood cells and increases in lymphocyte proliferation to concanavalin A and purified protein derivative of tuberculin were found after 2 years of therapy. Our findings indicate that methotrexate has remained effective over 36 months of therapy, with acceptable toxicity levels and no evidence of systemic immunosuppression.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term oral weekly methotrexate (MTX) therapy were studied to determine the extent of their hepatic architectural changes. Liver biopsies (n = 101) were performed in all patients before the initiation of MTX therapy, after 2 years, and annually thereafter (mean duration of therapy 53 months). The hepatic histologic grade (5-point scale) in 25 patients increased (worsened) (mean +/- SEM change 0.84 +/- 1.02; P = 0.001). Fibrosis, confirmed by trichrome staining, developed in 14 of 27 patients (52%). A history of alcohol consumption prior to starting MTX correlated significantly with subsequent worsening of the liver biopsy grade (r = 0.55, P = 0.0054). Alcohol intake prior to study entry, elevated weight at MTX initiation, and dose and duration of MTX were significantly associated with the development of fibrosis. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at 29-53 months of therapy correlated with the increase in hepatic histologic grade at the 3-year biopsy (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) and 4-year biopsy (r = 0.58, P = 0.03). We conclude that long-term MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients results in a statistically significant worsening in hepatic histologic grade, with common development of mild fibrosis. We do not consider these changes to be clinically significant at present.",

These patients had used maximal daily doses of bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid and, on average, had used prednisone, 26.8 mg/d, for 4.7 years (range, 1 to 11 years). Of these 31 patients, 25 completed 18 to 28 months of methotrexate therapy.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nPatients were treated for at least 18 months with low-dose methotrexate (range, 15 to 50 mg/wk).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean prednisone dose was reduced from 26.9 mg/d to 6.3 mg/d (P = 0.0001) in the 25 patients treated with long-term methotrexate: Fifteen patients discontinued the regular use of prednisone, 9 patients reduced prednisone use by more than 50%, and 1 patient failed to respond. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) improved from 1.7 L/s to 1.9 L/s (P = 0.0513), and subjective symptom scores for breathing ability, cough, wheeze, and frequency of nocturnal awakenings all improved. Adverse drug reactions were noted in 15 patients. These reactions were mild and did not lead to discontinuation of drug therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethotrexate is effective and safe when used as a long-term, corticosteroid sparing agent in patients with severe bronchial asthma.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To assess the relative efficacy of methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA), and their combination in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a double-blind, prospective, multicenter, controlled trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods. Two hundred nine patients with active RA were treated with escalating doses of MTX (5\u201315 mg/week), AZA (50\u2013150 mg/day), or combination (5 mg MTX/week plus 50 mg AZA/day\u20137.5 mg MTX/week plus 100 mg AZA/day), with opportunity to increase the dosage at 6-w eek intervals. The patients were evaluated for significant clinical and laboratory improvement and assessed for radiologic progression at 48 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults. One hundred ten patients remained on the initial, randomly assigned therapeutic regimen. The percentage of patients who were responders, defined as those who had 30% or greater improvement in at least 3 of 4 variables, was 38% for the combination treatment, 26% for AZA, and 45% for MTX (P = 0.06). A trend toward decreased radiologic progression was seen in the MTX-treated patients. Termination of treatment due to adverse experience occurred more frequently with combination and AZA treatments than with MTX treatment. Lack of effectiveness, adverse gastrointestinal effects, and liver enzyme elevation were the most frequent causes of treatment discontinuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion. This study establishes that the combination of MTX and AZA in the dosages utilized is not associated with more toxicity than treatment with single agents; however, enhanced efficacy is also not seen. There is a trend toward decreased radiologic progression in patients treated with MTX.",

They bring relief to millions of people but do not eliminate underlying disease. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs also bring relief, but these drugs are often ineffective and not well tolerated. Failure to provide long-term benefits combined with the high toxicity of most of the disease-modifying agents has prompted a search for more effective treatments. New methods using modern technologies have generated much enthusiasm and hold promise for the future. In the meantime, administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and judicious use of disease-modifying agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for arthritis.",

        "abstract": "approaches needs to be considered; triple therapy has been reported to be well tolerated at three to five years, while similar data are not available for methotrexate and cyclosporin A. The success of combination DMARD therapy in recent double blind controlled studies is encouraging.2223 As is frequently the case, however, the success of these approaches raises as many questions as it answers. Should all patients with rheumatoid arthritis receive combination DMARD therapy, or should it be reserved for only those with severe disease? Are there ways to predict who will respond best? When in the course of disease should combinations be used? Which combinations are best, or does this vary among patients? After an excellent response occurs, can some or all of these drugs be tapered or discontinued? Where do biological agents fit in, and should they be used in combinations? I do not have the answer to any of these questions. Until these answers are available, we will have to do as we have always done-make the best decisions we can based on the limited data available. As I stated earlier, our goal when treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be remission. As we try to achieve this goal, the data available now support the use of certain combinations of DMARD. Whether combinations should be used early in the disease process as suggested by Wilske and Healey'5 or added later is still open to question. As we better understand the mechanisms of actions of drugs and the disease process itself, we will be able to intervene more intelligently at the right time with the right drugs or combinations of drugs to improve the long term outcome for our patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
