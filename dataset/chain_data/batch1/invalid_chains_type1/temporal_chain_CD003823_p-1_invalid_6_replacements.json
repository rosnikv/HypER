        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor peptide derived from the endothelium. We evaluated the contribution of endothelin to blood-pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension by studying the effect of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 293 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute reduction of 5.7 mm Hg at each dose), which was similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to elevated blood pressure in such patients. The favorable effect of treatment with bosentan on blood pressure occurred without reflexive neurohormonal activation.",

        "abstract": "The absorption, excretion, and metabolism of the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was investigated in healthy male subjects by administration of 14C-labeled compound. Four subjects received a single oral dose of 500 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq), and four other subjects received a single i.v. dose of 250 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq). Radioactivity and concentrations of bosentan and its metabolites were measured in plasma, urine, and feces samples. More than 97% of drug-related material was recovered on average within 3.5 days after oral dosing and within 5 days after i.v. dosing. More than 90% of radioactivity was found in feces after both oral and i.v. dosing. Most of the radioactivity in urine and feces represented bosentan and three metabolites. Ro 48-5033, the major metabolite in plasma, urine, and feces, is the result of hydroxylation at the t-butyl group of bosentan. The two other metabolites Ro 47-8634 and Ro 64-1056 represent minor metabolite species. Ro 47-8634 is the product of O-demethylation of the phenolic methyl ester, and Ro 64-1056 is generated by both demethylation and hydroxylation. The radioactivity in plasma could almost entirely be attributed to bosentan and the two metabolites Ro 48-5033 and Ro 47-8634, whereby both metabolites exhibited much lower plasma levels than bosentan. Hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion of the metabolites apparently represents the major pathway of elimination for bosentan in humans.",

The P-glycoprotein drug efflux transporter is a determinant of oral bioavailability and central nervous system (CNS) penetration of protease inhibitors (PIs), and may affect drug penetration to other tissue compartments that can serve as sanctuaries for HIV. Potent and selective inhibitors of P-glycoprotein can dramatically increase PI CNS penetration. Polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene regulating P-glycoprotein expression are associated with differences in drug disposition, with some data indicating that different genotypes are associated with differences in plasma PI levels and magnitudes of CD4+ cell count recovery under therapy. The activity of drug transporters in modulating antiretroviral drug effects and the potential for exploiting this activity to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize drug toxicity are the subjects of ongoing study.

        "abstract": "Induction of hepatic phase I/II detoxification enzymes and alternative excretory pumps may limit hepatocellular accumulation of toxic biliary compounds in cholestasis. Because the nuclear xenobiotic receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulate involved enzymes and transporters, we aimed to induce adaptive alternative pathways with different CAR and PXR agonists in vivo. Mice were treated with the CAR agonists phenobarbital and 1,4\u2010bis\u2010[2\u2010(3,5\u2010dichlorpyridyloxy)]benzene, as well as the PXR agonists atorvastatin and pregnenolone\u201016\u03b1\u2010carbonitrile. Hepatic bile acid and bilirubin\u2010metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, Ugt1a1, Sult2a1), their regulatory nuclear receptors (CAR, PXR, farnesoid X receptor), and bile acid/organic anion and lipid transporters (Ntcp, Oatp1,2,4, Bsep, Mrp2\u20104, Mdr2, Abcg5/8, Asbt) in the liver and kidney were analyzed via reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Potential functional relevance was tested in common bile duct ligation (CBDL). CAR agonists induced Mrp2\u20104 and Oatp2; PXR agonists induced only Mrp3 and Oatp2. Both PXR and CAR agonists profoundly stimulated bile acid\u2013hydroxylating/detoxifying enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10. In addition, CAR agonists upregulated bile acid\u2013sulfating Sult2a1 and bilirubin\u2010glucuronidating Ugt1a1. These changes were accompanied by reduced serum levels of bilirubin and bile acids in healthy and CBDL mice and by increased levels of polyhydroxylated bile acids in serum and urine of cholestatic mice. Atorvastatin significantly increased Oatp2, Mdr2, and Asbt, while other transporters and enzymes were moderately affected. In conclusion, administration of specific CAR or PXR ligands results in coordinated stimulation of major hepatic bile acid/bilirubin metabolizing and detoxifying enzymes and hepatic key alternative efflux systems, effects that are predicted to counteract cholestasis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates protection against bile acid-induced liver injury in cholestatic animal models. Ursodeoxycholic acid and rifampicin are known ligands. We investigated whether functional polymorphisms of the SXR gene influence disease susceptibility or disease progression in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPolymorphisms at 8 loci across the SXR gene were genotyped in 327 Scandinavian PSC patients and 275 healthy controls. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regressions were performed to estimate effects from genotypes on patient survival, defined as time from diagnostic cholangiography to death or liver transplantation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSusceptibility to PSC was not associated with any of the SXR polymorphisms studied. Median survival was significantly reduced in patients homozygous for the minor allele as compared with patients carrying at least 1 major allele of the neighboring polymorphisms rs6785049 (10.8 vs 14.0 years, respectively, P = .01), rs1054190 (3.6 vs 13.6 years, respectively, P = .004), and rs3814058 (3.5 vs 13.3 years, respectively, P = .01). The increased risk of death or liver transplantation was confirmed in univariate Cox regressions (relative risk [RR](rs6785049) = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.6; RR(rs1054190) = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.4-7.1; and RR(rs3814058) = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.2 for the 3 polymorphisms, respectively). In multiple Cox regressions including age at PSC onset, rs1054190 remained an independent risk factor.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFunctional SXR gene variants appear to modify disease course in PSC. Further investigations of polymorphisms in the SXR gene may provide insight into the prognostic importance of SXR-regulated pathways in this disease, perhaps even in a therapeutic perspective.",

        "abstract": "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is a transcriptional factor involved in detoxification responses to pollutants and in intrinsic biological processes of multicellular organisms. We recently described that Vav3, an activator of Rho/Rac GTPases, is an Ahr transcriptional target in embryonic fibroblasts. These results prompted us to compare the Ahr\u2212/\u2212 and Vav3\u2212/\u2212 mouse phenotypes to investigate the implications of this functional interaction in vivo. Here, we show that Ahr is important for Vav3 expression in kidney, lung, heart, liver, and brainstem regions. This process is not affected by the administration of potent Ahr ligands such as benzo[a]pyrene. We also report that Ahr- and Vav3-deficient mice display hypertension, tachypnea, and sympathoexcitation. The Ahr gene deficiency also induces the GABAergic transmission defects present in the Vav3\u2212/\u2212 ventrolateral medulla, a main cardiorespiratory brainstem center. However, Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice, unlike Vav3-deficient animals, display additional defects in fertility, perinatal growth, liver size and function, closure, spleen size, and peripheral lymphocytes. These results demonstrate that Vav3 is a bona fide Ahr target that is in charge of a limited subset of the developmental and physiological functions controlled by this transcriptional factor. Our data also reveal the presence of sympathoexcitation and new cardiorespiratory defects in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

        "abstract": "Two Vav isoforms could be targeted to prevent breast tumors from metastasizing to the lung. Metastatic Route to the Lung Many individuals with cancer die from secondary tumors or metastases that spread through blood or lymph vessels to other tissues from the primary tumor site. The members of the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) promote tumor growth and metastasis and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rho GEFs are attractive pharmacological targets because they have potentially druggable catalytic activities and more restricted distribution patterns than Rho proteins. Citterio et al. found that the mRNA abundance of the GEFs Vav2 and Vav3 was increased in certain breast cancer subtypes in patient samples. Mice implanted with breast cancer cells in which Vav2 and Vav3 had been silenced developed slowly growing breast tumors and did not develop lung metastases. Vav2- and Vav3-deficient breast cancer cells showed an altered transcriptional profile, leading the authors to further analyze the role of select target genes encoding proteins that could be pharmacologically inhibited, such as the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. When implanted into mice, breast cancer cells with deficiencies in individual Vav target genes showed defects in proliferation, angiogenesis, the ability to enter or exit blood vessels during metastasis, and the ability to colonize the lung. When applied to human breast cancer data sets, the changes in the abundance of a subset of mRNAs from the Vav transcriptome generated a gene signature that accurately predicted if patients survived and were free of detectable lung metastasis. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and preventing secondary lung metastases and provide a potential prognostic tool for clinicians. The guanosine triphosphatases of the Rho and Rac subfamilies regulate protumorigenic pathways and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs), which could be potential targets for anticancer therapies. We report that two Rho GEFs, Vav2 and Vav3, play synergistic roles in breast cancer by sustaining tumor growth, neoangiogenesis, and many of the steps involved in lung-specific metastasis. The involvement of Vav proteins in these processes did not correlate with Rac1 and RhoA activity or cell migration, implying the presence of additional biological programs. Microarray analyses revealed that Vav2 and Vav3 controlled a vast transcriptional program in breast cancer cells through mechanisms that were shared between the two proteins, isoform-specific or synergistic. Furthermore, the abundance of Vav-regulated transcripts was modulated by Rac1-dependent and Rac1-independent pathways. This transcriptome encoded therapeutically targetable proteins that played nonredundant roles in primary tumorigenesis and lung-specific metastasis, such as integrin-linked kinase (Ilk), the transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 family ligand inhibin \u03b2A, cyclooxygenase-2, and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule Tacstd2. It also contained gene signatures that predicted disease outcome in breast cancer patients. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and lung metastases and provide a potential diagnostic tool for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Associations of ErbB4 (ERBB4/HER4), the fourth member of the EGFR family, with cancer are variable, possibly as a result of structural diversity of this receptor. There are multiple structural isoforms of ERBB4 arising by alternative mRNA splicing, and a subset undergo proteolysis that releases membrane-anchored and soluble isoforms that associate with transcription factors and coregulators to modulate transcription. To compare the differential and common signaling activities of full-length (FL) and soluble intracellular isoforms of ERBB4, four JM-a isoforms (FL and soluble intracellular domain (ICD) CYT-1 and CYT-2) were expressed in isogenic MCF10A cells and their biologic activities were analyzed. Both FL and ICD CYT-2 promoted cell proliferation and invasion, and CYT-1 suppressed cell growth. Transcriptional profiling revealed several new and underexplored ERBB4-regulated transcripts, including: proteases/protease inhibitors (MMP3 and SERPINE2), the YAP/Hippo pathway (CTGF, CYR61, and SPARC), the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway (HMGCR, HMGCS1, LDLR, and DHCR7), and cytokines (IL8, CCL20, and CXCL1). Many of these transcripts were subsequently validated in a luminal breast cancer cell line that normally expresses ERBB4. Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments identified ADAP1, APOE, SPARC, STMN1, and MXD1 as novel molecular targets of ERBB4. These findings clarify the diverse biologic activities of ERBB4 isoforms, and reveal new and divergent functions.

However, the effect of statins on spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of statin-mediated tumor growth and metastasis inhibition in an in vivo model. We found that statins significantly inhibited spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth. Statins inhibited the mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo and also suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of very late antigens (VLAs). Moreover, statins inhibited the prenylation of Rho as well as the phosphorylation of LIM kinase, serum response factor (SRF), and c-Fos downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. In addition, statins enhanced p53, p21, and p27 expression and reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase and expression of cyclin D1 and E2.

Moreover, the invasion and metastasis of CRC are the main reason therapy is usually inefficient. Decreased intercellular adhesion and enhanced cell motility induced by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) provide the basic conditions for the invasion and metastasis of the epithelial tumor cells of CRC. The Jiedu Sangen Decoction (JSD) is a prescription that has been used for more than 50 years in the treatment of CRC in the Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of JSD-triggered inhibition of invasion and metastasis in colon cancer. In vitro, the EMT model of the SW480 cells was induced by using epithelial growth factor (50 ng/mL). In vivo, the murine model of liver metastasis was constructed by inoculating mice with the SW480 cells. The effects of JSD on cell migration, invasion, and proliferation were determined using the transwell assay and CCK-8 assay. Moreover, the proteins related to the EMT process and the Hippo signaling pathway in the cancerous tissues and cell lines were determined by western blotting and immunostaining. JSD could significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells and reverse their EMT status (all, P < 0.05). Moreover, after intervention with JSD, the levels of E-Cadherin (E-cad) increased, whereas the expression levels of N-Cadherin (N-cad), Yes-associated protein (YAP), and the transcriptional coactivator with the PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) decreased in both the SW480 cells and the tumor tissues. In summary, JSD reversed EMT and inhibited the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells through the Hippo signaling pathway.",

The differential expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was obtained by analyzing the lncRNA data of 370 HCC samples in TCGA. Then, Pearson correlation analysis was carried out with EMT related genes (ERGs) from molecular signatures database. Combined with the univariate Cox expression analysis of the total survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, the prognostic ERLs were obtained. Then use \u201cstep\u201d function to select the optimal combination of constructing multivariate Cox expression model. The expression levels of ERLs in HCC samples were verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, we identified 5 prognostic ERLs (AC023157.3, AC099850.3, AL031985.3, AL365203.2, CYTOR). The model showed that these prognostic markers were reliable independent predictors of risk factors (P value <.0001, hazard ratio [HR]\u200a=\u200a2.400, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u200a=\u200a1.667\u20133.454 for OS). In the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis, this prognostic marker is a good predictor of HCC survival (area under the curve of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years are 0.754, 0.720, 0.704, and 0.662 respectively). We analyzed the correlation of clinical characteristics of these prognostic markers, and the results show that this prognostic marker is an independent factor that can predict the prognosis of HCC more accurately. In addition, by matching with the Molecular Signatures Database, we obtained 18 ERLs, and then constructed the HCC prognosis model and clinical feature correlation analysis using 5 prognostic ERLs. The results show that these prognostic markers have reliable independent predictive value. Bioinformatics analysis showed that these prognostic markers were involved in the regulation of EMT and related functions of tumor occurrence and migration. Five prognostic types of ERLs identified in this study can be used as potential biomarkers to predict the prognosis of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Background This study aimed to investigate the potential of a NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature as a reliable prognostic biomarker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods Transcriptome profiles and clinical data of AML patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. NAD+ metabolism-related genes (NMRGs) were identified from the KEGG and Reactome databases. Coexpression analysis was used to screen NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNAs. The NAD+ metabolismrelated lncRNA signature was constructed using univariate analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate analysis. High- and low-risk groups were compared for survival, tumor mutation burden, immune cell infiltration, and response to immunotherapy. Enrichment analysis explored the biological functions. Results LINC01679, AC079922.2, TRAF3IP2-AS1, and LINC02465 were identified to construct the risk model. The model exhibited good predictive power and outperformed age and gender as an independent prognostic marker. High-risk patients showed poorer survival, distinct TP53 mutations, and altered immune cell infiltration compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, low-risk patients exhibited greater sensitivity to immunotherapy. Enriched biological functions included leukocyte migration and positive regulation of cytokine production. Conclusions The NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature shows promise in predicting clinical outcomes for AML patients.",

The source paper also identified TRAF3IP2-AS1 as one of the ferroptosis-related lncRNAs with prognostic value in pancreatic cancer. The current paper uses the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis, exploring the role of TRAF3IP2-AS1 in a different context."
