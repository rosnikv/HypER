        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe conducted a randomized, double blind clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and cervical spine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA controlled trial of 18 half-hour active or placebo treatments was conducted in 86 patients with OA of the knee and 81 patients with OA of the cervical spine, in which pain was evaluated using a 10 cm visual analog scale, activities of daily living using a series of questions (answered by the patient as never, sometimes, most of the time, or always), pain on passive motion (recorded as none, slight, moderate, or severe), and joint tenderness (recorded using a modified Ritchie scale). Global evaluations of improvement were made by the patient and examining physician. Evaluations were made at baseline, midway, end of treatment, and one month after completion of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMatched pair t tests showed extremely significant changes from baseline for the treated patients in both knee and cervical spine studies at the end of treatment and the one month followup observations, whereas the changes in the placebo patients showed lesser degrees of significance at the end of treatment, and had lost significance for most variables at the one month followup. Means of the treated group of patients with OA of the knee showed greater improvement from baseline values than the placebo group by the end of treatment and at the one month followup observation. Using the 2-tailed t test, at the end of treatment the differences in the means of the 2 groups reached statistical significance for pain, pain on motion, and both the patient overall assessment and the physician global assessment. The means of the treated patients with OA of the cervical spine showed greater improvement from baseline than the placebo group for most variables at the end of treatment and one month followup observations; these differences reached statistical significance at one or more observation points for pain, pain on motion, and tenderness.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPEMF has therapeutic benefit in painful OA of the knee or cervical spine.",

        "title": "Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A plays a role in the directed migration of human keratinocytes in a DC electric field.",
        "abstract": "Skin wound healing requires epithelial cell migration for re-epithelialization, wound closure, and re-establishment of normal function. We believe that one of the earliest signals to initiate wound healing is the lateral electric field generated by the wound current. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes migrate towards the negative pole, representing the center of the wound, in direct currents of a physiological strength, 100 mV/mm. Virtually nothing is known about the signal transduction mechanisms used by these cells to sense the endogenous electric field. To elucidate possible protein kinase (PK) involvement in the process, PK inhibitors were utilized. Two important findings have been described. Firstly, addition of 50 nM KT5720, an inhibitor of PKA, resulted in a 53% percent reduction in the directional response of keratinocytes in the electric field, while not significantly affecting general cell motility. The reduction was dose-dependent, there was a gradual decrease in the directional response from 5 to 50 nM. Secondly, addition of 1 microM ML-7, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, resulted in an approximate 31% decrease in the distance the cells migrated without affecting directional migration. The PKC inhibitors GF109203X at 4 microM and H-7 at 20 microM and W-7, a CaM kinase inhibitor, did not significantly alter either directed migration or cell migration, although they all resulted in a slight reduction in directional migration. D-erythro-sphingosine at 15 microM, a PKC inhibitor, had virtually no effect on either migration distance or directed migration. These findings demonstrate that divergent kinase signaling pathways regulate general cell motility and sustained directional migration and highlight the complexity of the signal transduction mechanisms involved. The inhibitor studies described in this paper implicate a role for PKA in the regulation of the directional migratory response to applied electric fields, galvanotaxis.",

        "title": "Effects of Direct Current Electric Fields on Cell Migration and Actin Filament Distribution in Bovine Vascular Endothelial Cells",
        "abstract": "Electric fields exceeding 1 V/cm occur during wound healing, morphogenesis, and tumor growth, and such fields have been shown to induce directional migration of a variety of different cells. However, the mechanism by which electric fields direct cell movement is not yet understood, and the effects on vascular endothelial cells are entirely unknown. We demonstrate that cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells migrate toward the cathode of an applied electric field. Time-lapse microscopic imaging shows that the field suppresses protrusive activity from anode-facing surfaces of the cells while stimulating protrusions from surfaces that face the cathode. The threshold for this response is 1\u20132 V/cm, similar to field strengths measured in vivo. In addition, fluorescence microscopy shows that lamellipodia projecting toward the cathode are rich in actin filaments. Using quantitative image analysis, we show that the electric field induces a transient 80% increase in the amount of filamentous actin in the cell. Comparison of the distribution of F-actin with total protein distribution indicates that F-actin is asymmetrically distributed in the cytoplasm, being selectively enriched toward the cathode. We propose that physiological electric fields direct cell migration by eliciting an intracellular signal that creates new sites for actin assembly in the cathodal cytoplasm.",

        "title": "Cellular mechanisms of direct-current electric field effects: galvanotaxis and metastatic disease",
        "abstract": "Endogenous direct-current electric fields (dcEFs) occur in vivo in the form of epithelial transcellular potentials or neuronal field potentials, and a variety of cells respond to dcEFs in vitro by directional movement. This is termed galvanotaxis. The passive influx of Ca2+ on the anodal side should increase the local intracellular Ca2+ concentration, whereas passive efflux and/or intracellular redistribution decrease the local intracellular Ca2+ concentration on the cathodal side. These changes could give rise to `push-pull' effects, causing net movement of cells towards the cathode. However, such effects would be complicated in cells that possess voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and/or intracellular Ca2+ stores. Moreover, voltage-gated Na+ channels, protein kinases, growth factors, surface charge and electrophoresis of proteins have been found to be involved in galvanotaxis. Galvanotactic mechanisms might operate in both the short term (seconds to minutes) and the long term (minutes to hours), and recent work has shown that they might be involved in metastatic disease. The galvanotactic responses of strongly metastatic prostate and breast cancer cells are much more prominent, and the cells move in the opposite direction compared with corresponding weakly metastatic cells. This could have important implications for the metastatic process and has clinical implications. Galvanotaxis could thus play a significant role in both cellular physiology and pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is a pivotal signalling element in cell migration and is thought to be required for chemotaxis of Dictyostelium. Ca2+ signalling may also be important for electrotaxis. However this suggestion has been controversial. We show that electric fields direct Dictyostelium cells to migrate cathodally and increase [Ca2+]i in Dictyostelium cells, as determined by Fluo-3 AM imaging and 45Ca2+ uptake. Omission of extracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]e) and incubation with EGTA abolished the electric-field-stimulated [Ca2+]i rise and directional cell migration. This suggests a requirement for [Ca2+]e in the electrotactic response. Deletion of iplA, a gene responsible for chemoattractant-induced [Ca2+]i increase, had only a minor effect on the electric-field-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Moreover, iplA-null Dictyostelium cells showed the same electrotactic response as wild-type cells. Therefore, iplA-independent Ca2+ influx is necessary for electrotactic cell migration. These results suggest that the [Ca2+]i regulatory mechanisms induced by electric fields are different from those induced by cAMP and folic acid in Dictyostelium cells. Different roles of the iplA gene in chemoattractant-induced and electrically induced Ca2+ signalling, and different effects of [Ca2+]i elevation on chemotaxis and electrotaxis indicate that the chemoattractant and electric cues activate distinctive initial signalling elements.",

        "abstract": "Electric fields are generated in vivo in a variety of physiologic and pathologic settings, including penetrating injury to epithelial barriers. An applied electric field with strength within the physiologic range can induce directional cell migration (i.e., electrotaxis) of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and neutrophils suggesting a potential role in cell positioning during wound healing. In the present study, we investigated the ability of lymphocytes to respond to applied direct current (DC) electric fields. Using a modified Transwell assay and a simple microfluidic device, we show that human PBLs migrate toward the cathode in physiologically relevant DC electric fields. Additionally, electrical stimulation activates intracellular kinase signaling pathways shared with chemotactic stimuli. Finally, video microscopic tracing of GFP-tagged immunocytes in the skin of mouse ears reveals that motile cutaneous T cells actively migrate toward the cathode of an applied DC electric field. Lymphocyte positioning within tissues can thus be manipulated by externally applied electric fields, and may be influenced by endogenous electrical potential gradients as well.",

        "abstract": "Switching between attractive and repulsive migration in cell movement in response to extracellular guidance cues has been found in various cell types and is an important cellular function for translocation during cellular and developmental processes. Here we show that the preferential direction of migration during electrotaxis in Dictyostelium cells can be reversed by genetically modulating both guanylyl cyclases (GCases) and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-binding protein C (GbpC) in combination with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases (PI3Ks). The PI3K-dependent pathway is involved in cathode-directed migration under a direct-current electric field. The catalytic domains of soluble GCase (sGC) and GbpC also mediate cathode-directed signaling via cGMP, whereas the N-terminal domain of sGC mediates anode-directed signaling in conjunction with both the inhibition of PI3Ks and cGMP production. These observations provide an identification of the genes required for directional switching in electrotaxis and suggest that a parallel processing of electric signals, in which multiple-signaling pathways act to bias cell movement toward the cathode or anode, is used to determine the direction of migration.",

        "abstract": "Background Electrotaxis is the movement of adherent living cells in response to a direct current (dc) electric field (EF) of physiological strength. Highly metastatic human lung cancer cells, CL1\u20135, exhibit directional migration and orientation under dcEFs. To understand the transcriptional response of CL1\u20135 cells to a dcEF, microarray analysis was performed in this study. Methodology/Principal Findings A large electric-field chip (LEFC) was designed, fabricated, and used in this study. CL1\u20135 cells were treated with the EF strength of 0mV/mm (the control group) and 300mV/mm (the EF-treated group) for two hours. Signaling pathways involving the genes that expressed differently between the two groups were revealed. It was shown that the EF-regulated genes highly correlated to adherens junction, telomerase RNA component gene regulation, and tight junction. Some up-regulated genes such as ACVR1B and CTTN, and some down-regulated genes such as PTEN, are known to be positively and negatively correlated to cell migration, respectively. The protein-protein interactions of adherens junction-associated EF-regulated genes suggested that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and ephrin receptors may participate in sensing extracellular electrical stimuli. We further observed a high percentage of significantly regulated genes which encode cell membrane proteins, suggesting that dcEF may directly influence the activity of cell membrane proteins in signal transduction. Conclusions/Significance In this study, some of the EF-regulated genes have been reported to be essential whereas others are novel for electrotaxis.

        "title": "Molecular bioelectricity: how endogenous voltage potentials control cell behavior and instruct pattern regulation in vivo",
        "abstract": "In addition to biochemical gradients and transcriptional networks, cell behavior is regulated by endogenous bioelectrical cues originating in the activity of ion channels and pumps, operating in a wide variety of cell types. Instructive signals mediated by changes in resting potential control proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and apoptosis of stem, progenitor, and somatic cells. Of importance, however, cells are regulated not only by their own Vmem but also by the Vmem of their neighbors, forming networks via electrical synapses known as gap junctions. Spatiotemporal changes in Vmem distribution among nonneural somatic tissues regulate pattern formation and serve as signals that trigger limb regeneration, induce eye formation, set polarity of whole-body anatomical axes, and orchestrate craniofacial patterning. New tools for tracking and functionally altering Vmem gradients in vivo have identified novel roles for bioelectrical signaling and revealed the molecular pathways by which Vmem changes are transduced into cascades of downstream gene expression. Because channels and gap junctions are gated posttranslationally, bioelectrical networks have their own characteristic dynamics that do not reduce to molecular profiling of channel expression (although they couple functionally to transcriptional networks). The recent data provide an exciting opportunity to crack the bioelectric code, and learn to program cellular activity at the level of organs, not only cell types. The understanding of how patterning information is encoded in bioelectrical networks, which may require concepts from computational neuroscience, will have transformative implications for embryogenesis, regeneration, cancer, and synthetic bioengineering.",

        "abstract": "Background: Kv2.1 channels are components of plasma membrane:endoplasmic reticulum membrane contact sites (PM:ER MCS). Results: Kv2.1 exhibits clustering and enhanced phosphorylation in M phase versus interphase COS-1 cells, resulting in enhanced PM:ER MCS. Conclusion: Cell cycle-dependent regulation of Kv2.1 localization and phosphorylation impacts PM:ER MCS. Significance: PM:ER MCS are regulated by changes in PM protein localization and phosphorylation during mitosis. The plasma membrane (PM) comprises distinct subcellular domains with diverse functions that need to be dynamically coordinated with intracellular events, one of the most impactful being mitosis. The Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel is conditionally localized to large PM clusters that represent specialized PM:endoplasmic reticulum membrane contact sites (PM:ER MCS), and overexpression of Kv2.1 induces more exuberant PM:ER MCS in neurons and in certain heterologous cell types. Localization of Kv2.1 at these contact sites is dynamically regulated by changes in phosphorylation at one or more sites located on its large cytoplasmic C terminus. Here, we show that Kv2.1 expressed in COS-1 cells undergoes dramatic cell cycle-dependent changes in its PM localization, having diffuse localization in interphase cells, and robust clustering during M phase. The mitosis-specific clusters of Kv2.1 are localized to PM:ER MCS, and M phase clustering of Kv2.1 induces more extensive PM:ER MCS. These cell cycle-dependent changes in Kv2.1 localization and the induction of PM:ER MCS are accompanied by increased mitotic Kv2.1 phosphorylation at several C-terminal phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of exogenously expressed Kv2.1 is significantly increased upon metaphase arrest in COS-1 and CHO cells, and in a pancreatic \u03b2 cell line that express endogenous Kv2.1. The M phase clustering of Kv2.1 at PM:ER MCS in COS-1 cells requires the same C-terminal targeting motif needed for conditional Kv2.1 clustering in neurons. The cell cycle-dependent changes in localization and phosphorylation of Kv2.1 were not accompanied by changes in the electrophysiological properties of Kv2.1 expressed in CHO cells. Together, these results provide novel insights into the cell cycle-dependent changes in PM protein localization and phosphorylation.",

        "abstract": "All epistemic agents physically consist of parts that must somehow comprise an integrated cognitive self. Biological individuals consist of subunits (organs, cells, and molecular networks) that are themselves complex and competent in their own native contexts. How do coherent biological Individuals result from the activity of smaller sub-agents? To understand the evolution and function of metazoan creatures\u2019 bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of the basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent larger organism. In this article, I synthesize ideas in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and developmental physiology toward a hypothesis about the origin of Individuality: \u201cScale-Free Cognition.\u201d I propose a fundamental definition of an Individual based on the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents. Any Self is demarcated by a computational surface \u2013 the spatio-temporal boundary of events that it can measure, model, and try to affect. This surface sets a functional boundary - a cognitive \u201clight cone\u201d which defines the scale and limits of its cognition. I hypothesize that higher level goal-directed activity and agency, resulting in larger cognitive boundaries, evolve from the primal homeostatic drive of living things to reduce stress \u2013 the difference between current conditions and life-optimal conditions. The mechanisms of developmental bioelectricity - the ability of all cells to form electrical networks that process information - suggest a plausible set of gradual evolutionary steps that naturally lead from physiological homeostasis in single cells to memory, prediction, and ultimately complex cognitive agents, via scale-up of the basic drive of infotaxis. Recent data on the molecular mechanisms of pre-neural bioelectricity suggest a model of how increasingly sophisticated cognitive functions emerge smoothly from cell-cell communication used to guide embryogenesis and regeneration. This set of hypotheses provides a novel perspective on numerous phenomena, such as cancer, and makes several unique, testable predictions for interdisciplinary research that have implications not only for evolutionary developmental biology but also for biomedicine and perhaps artificial intelligence and exobiology.",

        "title": "Cancer Niches and Their Kikuchi Free Energy",
        "abstract": "Biological forms depend on a progressive specialization of pluripotent stem cells. The differentiation of these cells in their spatial and functional environment defines the organism itself; however, cellular mutations may disrupt the mutual balance between a cell and its niche, where cell proliferation and specialization are released from their autopoietic homeostasis. This induces the construction of cancer niches and maintains their survival. In this paper, we characterise cancer niche construction as a direct consequence of interactions between clusters of cancer and healthy cells. Explicitly, we evaluate these higher-order interactions between niches of cancer and healthy cells using Kikuchi approximations to the free energy. Kikuchi\u2019s free energy is measured in terms of changes to the sum of energies of baseline clusters of cells (or nodes) minus the energies of overcounted cluster intersections (and interactions of interactions, etc.). We posit that these changes in energy node clusters correspond to a long-term reduction in the complexity of the system conducive to cancer niche survival. We validate this formulation through numerical simulations of apoptosis, local cancer growth, and metastasis, and highlight its implications for a computational understanding of the etiopathology of cancer.",

        "title": "Competency in Navigating Arbitrary Spaces as an Invariant for Analyzing Cognition in Diverse Embodiments",
        "abstract": "One of the most salient features of life is its capacity to handle novelty and namely to thrive and adapt to new circumstances and changes in both the environment and internal components. An understanding of this capacity is central to several fields: the evolution of form and function, the design of effective strategies for biomedicine, and the creation of novel life forms via chimeric and bioengineering technologies. Here, we review instructive examples of living organisms solving diverse problems and propose competent navigation in arbitrary spaces as an invariant for thinking about the scaling of cognition during evolution. We argue that our innate capacity to recognize agency and intelligence in unfamiliar guises lags far behind our ability to detect it in familiar behavioral contexts. The multi-scale competency of life is essential to adaptive function, potentiating evolution and providing strategies for top-down control (not micromanagement) to address complex disease and injury. We propose an observer-focused viewpoint that is agnostic about scale and implementation, illustrating how evolution pivoted similar strategies to explore and exploit metabolic, transcriptional, morphological, and finally 3D motion spaces. By generalizing the concept of behavior, we gain novel perspectives on evolution, strategies for system-level biomedical interventions, and the construction of bioengineered intelligences. This framework is a first step toward relating to intelligence in highly unfamiliar embodiments, which will be essential for progress in artificial intelligence and regenerative medicine and for thriving in a world increasingly populated by synthetic, bio-robotic, and hybrid beings.",

        "title": "Motile Living Biobots Self\u2010Construct from Adult Human Somatic Progenitor Seed Cells",
        "abstract": "Fundamental knowledge gaps exist with respect to the plasticity of cells from adult soma and the potential diversity of body shape and behavior in living constructs derived from such genetically wild-type cells. Here we introduce Anthrobots, a spheroid-shaped multicellular biological robot (biobot) platform with diameters ranging from 30 to 500 microns. Anthrobots have an inherent capacity for motility in aqueous environments, via cilia covering their surface. Each Anthrobot starts out as a single cell, derived from the adult human lung, and self-constructs into a multicellular motile biobot after having been cultured in extra cellular matrix for 2 weeks and transferred into a minimally viscous habitat. Anthrobots exhibit a wide range of behaviors with motility patterns ranging from tight loops to straight lines and speeds ranging from 5-50 microns/second. Our anatomical investigations reveal that this behavioral diversity is significantly correlated with their morphological diversity. Anthrobots can assume diverse morphologies from fully polarized to wholly ciliated bodies with spherical or ellipsoidal shapes, each correlating with a distinct movement type. Remarkably, as a function of these different movement types, Anthrobots were found to be capable of traversing live human tissues in various ways. Furthermore, Anthrobots were able to induce rapid repair of wounds in human neural cell sheets in vitro. By controlling microenvironmental cues in bulk, entirely novel structure, behavior, and biomedically-relevant capabilities can be discovered in morphogenetic processes without direct genetic editing or manual sculpting. Significance Statement We demonstrate that normal, non-genetically-modified human tracheal cells can be induced to form a new proto-organism - Anthrobots - which exhibit spontaneous behavior, swimming around in one of several patterns, demonstrating plasticity for novel form and function inherent in even elderly human somatic cells. Moreover, Anthrobots are able to traverse over cultured neurons, settling down and causing repair under them: the nerves knit together across the wound gap due to the presence of the Anthrobot. A patient\u2019s own cells can be harnessed to make a motile biological robot that can traverse human tissue and induce repair. In the future, this platform can deliver pro-regenerative therapeutics for a range of biomedical applications that will not trigger rejection or require immune suppression.",
