        "abstract": "Abstract The effects of sulfinpyrazone and a placebo on the incidence of thrombosis of arteriovenous shunts was investigated in a double-blind study in 52 patients on chronic hemodialysis over a six-month period. Thrombi occurred in 86 per cent of patients on placebo and 50 per cent of those on sulfinpyrazone (p<0.01). The incidence of thrombosis was reduced from 0.76 thrombi per patient month in the placebo group to 0.18 thrombi per patient month in the sulfinpyrazone group (p<0.001). Venous-shunt revisions were required in 48 per cent of patients given placebo and in only 16 per cent of those receiving sulfinpyrazone (p<0.05). Side effects were minimal and necessitated withdrawal from the study in only one patient. This study supports the results of animal experiments showing that sulfinpyrazone decreases thrombus formation the high-flow systems. (N Engl J Med 290:304\u2013306, 1974)",

        "title": "Aspirin - Effective in Males Threatened with Stroke",
        "abstract": "A CLINICAL TRIAL on 2 drugs which inhibit platelet function has been concluded after 5'/2 years of cooperative effort. The results indicate that male patients threatened with stroke will benefit by the daily use of the commonest and one of the oldest pharmaceutical agents \u2014 aspirin. Females will not benefit and neither men nor women will benefit from the use of sulfinpyrazone. This claim may be said to demand the attention of all who are engaged in clinical practice, since vascular stroke has been identified as the likely cause of death of 1 of every 5 persons by 1980. An expected 225,000 people will die each year in the United States and Canada, and, of a slightly larger number who will survive, half will be disabled, continuing as a burden to themselves, their families and the community. To those who frequent the wards of neurological departments and institutions these chilling figures require no elaboration. They are the \"raison d'etre\" of this journal and the compelling argument behind the apportionment of a significant part of the annual budget of the U.S. National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) to the pursuit of stroke-oriented research. It is imperative and appropriate that many American and Canadian neurologists and neurosurgeons occupy much of their time with problems of stroke. Progress in stroke research has been slow but measurable over the past 3 decades. The adoption of angiography focussed attention on the importance of the extracranial arteries and led in turn to the realization that atheromatous lesions in these extracranial sites were associated with some of the phenomena of the \"transient ischemic attack.\" These transient events came to be recognized as the forerunners of thrombo-embolic stroke, with a prognosis for stroke approximating 5-6% per year, and a similarly high annual threat of vascular death. It became possible to identify, in advance, a significant proportion of patients who were going on to have a stroke and to initiate such imperfect measures of investigation and therapy as were known. Anticoagulants were tested in studies wherein the entry criteria were not screened with sufficient scrupulousness to satisfy modern critical methodology. Their final role in TIA and in patients afflicted with partial non-progressing stroke (PNS) remains unsettled. Extracranial vascular surgery was introduced. In some hands, but decidedly not in others, it has found a limited but definite place in stroke prevention. Concomitantly came an increased understanding of the important role of platelets in initiating arterial thrombosis. Whitish material passing through retinal arterioles in patients experiencing amaurosis fugax was observed and identified as aggregates of platelets with fibrin. The ulcerated plaque in the extracranial arteries was recognized as a potential source for these aggregates. In addition, embolic material containing cholesterol and other elements of atheromatous debris have been seen in retinal arterioles (\"bright plaques\") and it was determined that these fragments were conducive to extending platelet-induced thrombus formation. Thus, the 2 varieties of artery-to-artery retinal or cerebral emboli were known to have a significant dependency on platelet reaction. Beginning in Mustard's laboratory in 1965, and continuing with the work of Weiss and Aledont, of Zucker and Peterson, and of Emmons et al, it was discovered that platelet function could be altered in a significant way by sulfinpyrazone, acetylsalicylic acid and by pyrimido-pyrimidine compounds. Experimental evidence from a variety of sources, a few clinical trials on cardiovascular and systemic vascular disease, and a few clinical fragments, largely of anecdotal variety, in cerebral vascular disease made it appear that the time had come to submit the platelet-inhibiting drugs to a full-scale clinical study. It was apparent that a trial would require a population of patients sufficiently large to settle the question of the drugs' efficacy in altering the prognosis in patients with TIA and PNS, and it was calculated that a minimum of 540 patients should be entered into the program. This demanded a collaborative effort among many neurological centers. It was recognized that the trial would utilize drugs whose mode of action, for the most part, was unknown. Funded by the Canadian Medical Research Council, 12 university centers involving 31 neurologists, contributed 585 cases with TIA and PNS into a randomized double-blind trial. The study enrolled the first patients in November 1971, the final entrant in June 1976, and followed the patients until June 30, 1977. Despite the fact that the patients were scattered between the Atlantic fishing-fleets of Newfoundland and the logging camps of Vancouver Island, modern jet travel by the methodological and neurological coordinators, and a long-distance telephone switchboard made it possible to achieve a 99.3% follow up of the patients. It was also possible to recall them to the centers for 3-monthly check-ups on their",

        "title": "RECENT ADVANCES IN THE TREATMENT OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES",
        "abstract": "Medical treatment of cerebrovascular diseases is still under development as much of the pathogenetic principles are not known e.g. a lot of new information was brought with the introduction of the computerized tomography (CT) and old clinical criteria have had to be reconsidered. The purpose of this review is to describe the present medical treatments of stroke. Therefore hemorrhagic strokes are sparsely dealt with, as the treatment of these disorders is mainly surgical, even if many patients with both intracerebral hemorrhages and subarachnoidal hemorrhages (SAB) are treated conservatively. The hypotensive treatment in patients with SAB suggested by Slosberg (1973) has never been given as much attention as the surgical therapy, even if the indications differ between the hospitals, especially concerning the time of operation. The value of antifibrinolytic agents to reduce the risk of rebleeding has not been able to prove in double blind studies (van Rossum et al, 1977, Kaste & Ramsay, 1979). The ischemic strokes will be divided into transient ischemic attacks (TIA) where focal neurological symptoms persist no longer than 24 hours and usually disappear within one hour; reversible ischemic neurological deficit (RIND) where minor focal neurological symtoms can be found longer than 24 hours, but where the clinical profile is that of a regressive stroke; progressive stroke or stroke in evolution where the clinical temporal profile is that of a step-wise or gradually increasing disability and the completed ischemic stroke, i. e. the definite cerebral infarction where the neurological symptoms have been stable during the last 24 hours. The completed stroke with a definite cerebral infarction is a very heterogeneous group concerning the pathological-anatomical damage even if the clinical symptoms are rather uniform. The brain damage can be very large as in patients with carotid occlusion or infarction within the territory of the middle cerebral artery and very small as in the lacunar infarctions of the basal ganglia. This lack of correlation between the clinical picture and the extent of the anatomical damage makes the treatment difficult. The pathophysiology of the focal incomplete ischemic stroke is known only in parts (Nilsson et af, 1979) and this is probably the explanation of the lack of effectiveness in cerebral infarction of many trials with different agents as vasodilators, anticoagulants, dextrans, steroids, glycerol, papaverine, aminophylline etc. (Genton et af. 1977),",

Patients in groups I and II had increased platelet coagulant activities concerned with the initiation and early stages of intrinsic coagulation, and group I patients had an increased proportion of circulating platelet aggregates and platelets relatively insensitive to epinephrine in aggregation and secretion. The incidence of platelet coagulant hyperactivity in patients with mitral valve prolapse was 76% (100% in group I, 75% in group II, 58% in group III), compared with 6% in control patients.

        "title": "Central Sensitization in Tension-Type Headache\u2014Possible Pathophysiological Mechanisms",
        "abstract": "The aim of the present thesis was to investigate the pathophysiology of chronic tension-type headache with special reference to central mechanisms. Increased tenderness to palpation of pericranial myofascial tissues is the most apparent abnormality in patients with tension-type headache. A new piece of equipment, a so-called palpometer, that makes it possible to control the pressure intensity exerted during palpation, was developed. Thereafter, it was demonstrated that the measurement of tenderness could be compared between two observers if the palpation pressure was controlled, and that the Total Tenderness Scoring system was well suited for the scoring of tenderness during manual palpation. Subsequently, it was found that pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds were significantly decreased in the finger and tended to be decreased in the temporal region in chronic tension-type headache patients compared with controls. In addition, the electrical pain threshold in the cephalic region was significantly decreased in patients. It was concluded that the central pain sensitivity was increased in the patients probably due to sensitization of supraspinal neurones. The stimulus-response function for palpation pressure vs. pain was found to be qualitatively altered in chronic tension-type headache patients compared with controls. The abnormality was related to the degree of tenderness and not to the diagnosis of tension-type headache. In support of this, the stimulus-response function was found to be qualitatively altered also in patients with fibromyalgia. It was concluded that the qualitatively altered nociception was probably due to central sensitization at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus. Thereafter, the prophylactic effect of amitriptyline, a non-selective serotonin(5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, and of citalopram, a highly selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, was examined in patients with chronic tension-type headache. Amitriptyline reduced headache significantly more than placebo, while citalopram had only a slight and insignificant effect. It was concluded that the blockade of 5-HT reuptake could only partly explain the efficacy of amitriptyline in tension-type headache, and that also other actions of amitriptyline, e.g. reduction of central sensitization, were involved. Finally, the plasma 5-HT level, the platelet 5-HT level and the number of platelet 5-HT transporters were found to be normal in chronic tension-type headache. On the basis of the present and previous studies, a pathophysiological model for tension-type headache is presented. According to the model, the main problem in chronic tension-type headache is central sensitization at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus due to prolonged nociceptive inputs from pericranial myofascial tissues. The increased nociceptive input to supraspinal structures may in turn result in supraspinal sensitization. The central neuroplastic changes may affect the regulation of peripheral mechanisms and thereby lead to, for example, increased pericranial muscle activity or release of neurotransmitters in the myofascial tissues. By such mechanisms the central sensitization may be maintained even after the initial eliciting factors have been normalized, resulting in the conversion of episodic into chronic tension-type headache. Future basic and clinical research should aim at identifying the source of peripheral nociception in order to prevent the development of central sensitization and at ways of reducing established sensitization. This may lead to a much needed improvement in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache and other chronic myofascial pain conditions.",

        "abstract": "Increased muscle tenderness is the most prominent finding in patients with tension-type headache, and it has recently been shown that muscle blood flow is diminished in response to static exercise in tender points in these patients. Although tenderness has been ascribed to local inflammation and release of inflammatory mediators, the interstitial concentration of inflammatory mediators has not previously been studied in tender muscles of patients with tension-type headache. The aim of the present study was to investigate in vivo concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), glutamate, bradykinin and other metabolites in a tender point of patients with chronic tension-type headache, in the resting state as well as in response to static exercise, and to compare findings with measurements in a matched non-tender point of healthy controls. We recruited 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 17 healthy control subjects. Two microdialysis catheters were inserted into the trapezius muscle and dialysates were collected at rest, 15 and 30 min after start of static exercise (10% of maximal force) and 15 and 30 min after end of exercise. All samples were coded and analysed blindly. There was no difference in resting concentration of any inflammatory mediators or metabolites between tender patients and non-tender controls (P > 0.05). We also found no difference in change in interstitial concentration of ATP, PGE2, glutamate, glucose, pyruvate and urea from baseline to exercise and post-exercise periods between patients and controls (P > 0.05). The present study provides in vivo evidence of normal interstitial levels of inflammatory mediators and metabolites in tender trapezius muscle in patients with chronic tension-type headache during both rest and static exercise. Thus, our data suggest that tender points in these patients are not sites of ongoing inflammation.",

        "title": "Neurobiology of fibromyalgia syndrome.",
        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) pain is maintained by tonic impulse input from deep tissues, such as muscle and joints, in combination with central sensitization mechanisms. This nociceptive input may originate in peripheral tissues (trauma and infection) resulting in hyperalgesia/allodynia and/or central sensitization. Evidence for abnormal sensitization mechanisms in FM includes enhanced temporal summation of delayed pain in response to repeated heat taps and repeated muscle taps, as well as prolonged and enhanced painful after-sensations in FM patients but not control subjects. Moreover, magnitudes of enhanced after-sensations are predictive of FM patients' ongoing clinical pain. Such alterations of relevant pain mechanisms may lead to longterm neuroplastic changes that exceed the antinociceptive capabilities of affected individuals, resulting in ever-increasing pain sensitivity and dysfunction. Future research needs to address the important role of abnormal nociception and/or antinociception for chronic pain in FM.",

        "abstract": "Treatment for chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is unsatisfactory. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine in the prophylactic treatment of CTTH. We included 40 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Memantine 20\u201340 mg/day or placebo was each given for 10 weeks separated by a 2-week wash-out period; 29 patients completed the study. The primary efficacy variable, area-under-the-headache curve (duration X intensity), did not differ between memantine (1352 \u00b1 927) and placebo (1449 \u00b1 976; P = 0.10). Headache intensity in both sexes was significantly lower on a 0\u201310 verbal rating scale with memantine (3.8) than with placebo (4.1; P = 0.03). In women, area-under-the-headache curve was significantly lower with memantine (1343 \u00b1 919) than with placebo (1555 \u00b1 1019; P = 0.01). The most common side-effects were dizziness and nausea. In conclusion, although no statistically significant effect was seen in the primary end-point, some beneficial effects of memantine were observed in women. Memantine was shown to reduce pain intensity in CTTH patients, albeit to a limited extent. Future NMDA antagonists with higher efficacy could be of major interest as regards the pathophysiology and future treatment of CTTH and other chronic pain disorders.",

        "abstract": "Objective The objective of this article is to determine whether cutaneous allodynia (CA) influences the response to treatment with occipital transcutaneous electrical stimulation (OTES) in chronic migraine (CM) and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Methods One hundred and sixty consecutive patients with CM or CTTH were randomized to be treated with real or sham OTES stimulation three times a day for two consecutive weeks. All patients completed the validated 12-item allodynia symptom checklist for assessing the presence and the severity of CA during headache attack. Primary end-point was change (\u226550%) in number of monthly headache-free days. Results There was a significant difference in the percentage of responders in the real OTES compared with sham OTES group (p <0.001). Importantly, there was not a significant change of monthly headache-free days in the allodynic patients with CM and CTTH treated both with real and sham OTES, while the number of headache-free days per month was significantly reduced in the real (86%) but not in the sham group (7%) of non-allodynic patients with CTTH and CM. Conclusions Severe CA is associated with decreased response to treatment with OTES in patients with CM and CTTH.",

        "abstract": "According to rough estimates, at least one third of the population in developed countries suffers, to varying degrees, from certain forms of primary headache, the modern pharmacotherapy of which is not always effective and has a number of limitations. The non-pharmacological treatment of headache can be an alternative to the prescription of pharmacological agents and the only possible assistance option for patients developing drug-resistant cephalalgias. This review describes various methods of electrical neuromodulation that are used for the management of primary headaches. The authors provide information on current stages in implementation of implantable and non-invasive equipment into clinical practice, which makes possible electrical stimulations of peripheral nerves and of the sphenopalatine ganglion, as well as allows transcranial magnetic stimulation. Also the appearance and usage of portable electrical devices available on the world market are described, and mechanisms that can underlie anticephalgic action of neuromodulation therapy are discussed. Special attention is paid to the methods that are applied for electrostimulation of the vagus nerve and occipital nerves.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nCluster headache is a neurological disorder that patients consider the most severe pain they experience. Recognizing new treatments provides opportunities to advance current management.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nIn contrast to the classic treatments, new options narrow in on the therapeutic target and are better tolerated. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway blockade with monoclonal antibodies (MABs), specifically the CGRP MAB galcanezumab, represents an important advance for episodic cluster headache, reducing the number of attacks during a bout. Neuromodulation strategies aimed at anatomical structures involved in the pathophysiology of cluster headache, such as the sphenopalatine ganglion and the vagus nerve, have proved effective in reducing the pain intensity and the number of attacks, and also to be safe and well tolerated.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nOur understanding of the pathophysiology of cluster headache and its management continues to grow. Novel treatments have appeared from research, such as neuromodulation and CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Nonetheless, chronic cluster headache and designing trials that select the correct sham in evaluating devices remain challenging.",
