        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation is significantly reduced by prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulins (HBIG) or antiviral drugs in nonreplicating patients and by the combination of both drugs in replicating patients. However, the load of HBV DNA, which defines replicating status in patients undergoing liver transplantation, remains unclear. This study analyzes the correlation between the viral load, tested with a single amplified assay, at the time of liver transplantation, and the risk of hepatitis B recurrence in 177 HBV carriers who underwent transplantation in a single center from 1990 to 2002. Overall, HBV relapsed after surgery in 15 patients (8.5%) with a 5\u2010 and 8\u2010year actuarial rate of recurrence of 8% and 21%, respectively. After liver transplantation hepatitis B recurred in 9% of 98 selected subjects treated only with immune globulins and in 8% of 79 viremic patients who received immune globulins and lamivudine (P = NS). A linear correlation was observed between recurrence and viral load at the time of surgery. In transplant patients with HBV DNA higher than 100,000 copies/mL, 200\u201399,999 copies/mL, and DNA undetectable by amplified assay, hepatitis B recurred in 50%, 7.5%, and 0% of patients, respectively. Overall, a viral load higher than 100,000 copies/mL at the time of liver transplantation was significantly associated with hepatitis B recurrence (P = .0003). In conclusion, spontaneous or antiviral\u2010induced HBV DNA viral load at the time of surgery classifies the risk of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation and indicates the best prophylaxis strategy.

        "abstract": "A disintegrin\u2010like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type\u20101 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) is a metalloproteinase that specifically cleaves the multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF). Deficiency of ADAMTS13 increases the unusually large VWF multimers (UL\u2010VWFM), which leads to platelet clumping and/or thrombus formation, resulting in microcirculatory disturbance. We serially determined the activity of plasma ADAMTS13, together with VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and UL\u2010VWFM, in association with the development of early graft dysfunction in 3 liver transplant recipients and 4 patients with major hepatectomy as controls. In case 1, ADAMTS13 activity decreased markedly from 108% to less than 3% with concomitant thrombocytopenia on posttransplantation day 7, when acute rejection occurred. Simultaneously, UL\u2010VWFM were detected. During the second episode of rejection, VWF:Ag increased to 368% with the appearance of UL\u2010VWFM, while ADAMTS13 activity was as low as 18%, indicating an imbalance between a large amount of UL\u2010VWFM and low activity of ADAMTS13. Administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) together with treatment for acute rejection resulted in an improvement of ADAMTS13 activity and disappearance of the UL\u2010VWFM. In case 2, ADAMTS13 activity promptly decreased to 9% with thrombocytopenia on day 1, when ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury occurred. Subsequently, the ADAMTS13 activity increased steadily without appearance of UL\u2010VWFM, and the patient recovered uneventfully. ADAMTS13 activity decreased to 15% immediately after transplantation in case 3 as well. In contrast, ADAMTS13 activity never decreased below 20% in 4 patients with major hepatectomy as controls. In conclusion, these results indicate that the kinetics of ADAMTS13 and UL\u2010VWFM could be good indicators of adverse events after liver transplantation. Our findings not only suggest a novel mechanism for thrombocytopenia, but also provide a useful tool for diagnosis of graft dysfunction in the early stage after transplantation.

        "abstract": "Introduction. Liver transplantation (LT) has been the treatment of choice for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was designed to summarize our experience in LT for HCC patients and establish a new set of criteria for patient selection and prognosis prediction. Materials and Methods. Data of 195 patients with HCC were retrospectively analyzed and various clinical and pathological factors for survival and tumor-free survival were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results. Macrovascular invasion, preoperative serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, tumor size, multifocality, histopathologic grading, distribution, and cirrhosis background were significant factors for survival and tumor-free survival by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis identified macrovascular invasion, tumor size, preoperative AFP level, and histopathologic grading were prognostic factors independently associated with patient survival or tumor-free survival (RR=1.688\u20132.779, P=0.000\u20130.034). Based on the prognostic stratification of different risk groups of patients without macrovascular invasion, Hangzhou criteria was established, containing one of the two following items: (a) Total tumor diameter less than or equal to 8 cm; (b) total tumor diameter more than 8 cm, with histopathologic grade I or II and preoperative AFP level less than or equal to 400 ng/mL, simultaneously. The difference between survival curves of patients fulfilling Milan criteria (n=72) and patients fulfilling Hangzhou criteria (n=99) did not achieve statistical significance (5-year survival rates: 78.3% vs. 72.3%, P>0.05). Of the patients exceeding Milan criteria (n=123), those who fulfilled Hangzhou criteria (n=26) also had better prognosis than the others (n=97) (P=0.000). Conclusion. The results of this study show a reliable and feasible candidates selection and prognostic criteria of LT in HCC patients.",

        "abstract": "Background. The aim of this study was to analyze the combination with long-term, low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogs as prophylaxis for hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and to assess the risk factors of HBV recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Methods. One hundred sixty patients undergoing OLT with HBV-related liver disease make up the cohort studied. Long-term, low dosage of HBIG in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs were used as prophylaxis for HBV recurrence after OLT. Patient preoperative data were collected by a retrospective method, and the rate and risk factors of HBV recurrence post-OLT after a long-term follow-up were analyzed. Results. Nineteen patients developed hepatitis B recurrence for a rate of recurrence of 11.88% (19/160). There was no significant correlation between HBV recurrence after OLT and the level of HBV DNA, HBeAg state pre-OLT, or the use of nucleoside analog drug therapy pre-OLT (P>0.05). Of 19 patients with HBV recurrence, 17 patients used Lamivudine, and HBV YMDD mutants were detected in nine cases. The HBV-YMDD mutation was the major reason for recurrence of HBV in our study (P<0.001). Conclusions. Long-term use of combination prophylaxis with nucleoside analogs and low-dose HBIG can effectively prevent hepatitis B recurrence after OLT, and that a positive preoperative serum HBV DNA status did not affect the recurrence rate of HBV post-OLT. Preoperative nucleoside analogs therapy is unlikely to be obligatory if the patients received effective combination prophylaxis postoperatively. HBV YMDD mutation is the primary reason for HBV recurrence in patients treated with Lamivudine after OLT.",

        "abstract": "Background. Tenofovir therapy has been found to be efficient in treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) in nontransplant patients. However, in the setting of solid-organ transplantation, the efficacy of tenofovir has not been tested. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the clinical and biologic response and tolerance to tenofovir therapy in HBV-positive organ transplant recipients. Methods. Seven patients, three kidney, three liver, and one cardiac transplant recipients, with chronic HBV infection were partial responders to adefovir (n=7), lamivudine (n=7), or entecavir (n=5) therapy. Consequently, they were placed on tenofovir therapy (245 mg daily, which was adapted to renal function) alone (n=4) or in combination with lamivudine (n=3). Tenofovir therapy was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinitiation or at the last follow-up. Results. HBV DNA viral load (4.16 [2.03\u20135.56] log10 copies/mL at baseline) became significantly decreased to 3.15 (1.08\u20135.17), 2.88 (1.3\u20134.3), 3.53 (1.3\u20135.75), 3.33 (1.3\u20137.57), and 2.31 (1.3\u20134.81) log copies/mL at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttenofovir initiation and at last follow-up, respectively (P=0.02). Three patients were HBV DNA negative at the last follow-up. Liver enzyme levels did not change significantly throughout the follow-up period. Clinical and biologic tolerance was excellent. Conclusions. Even though HBV DNA clearance was not achieved in all patients, the results of this pilot study are encouraging and demonstrate that tenofovir therapy is safe and efficacious in treating HBV-positive organ transplant patients.

        "abstract": "Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related end-stage liver disease. However, without antiviral prophylaxis, the recurrence rate of hepatitis B is as high as 80%-100%, which leads to a 50% mortality rate in the first 2 years after liver transplantation. Combination therapy of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and lamivudine demonstrated a higher efficacy of prophylaxis and further reduced the rate of recurrence to < 10%. The strategy of HBIG combined with lamivudine has been the standard treatment in many centers. However, the high rate of lamivudine resistance and the many disadvantages of HBIG have compelled surgeons to reconsider the long-term efficacy of this strategy for the prevention of HBV reinfection. Recently, new nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as entecavir and tenofovir, have been approved as first-line monotherapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection. These antiviral medicines have replaced lamivudine as the first choice in the prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation. Various therapies that are composed of entecavir, tenofovir, and lamivudine plus adefovir, with or without HBIG have been adopted in several liver transplant centers.

Aim The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NUCs prophylaxis (\u00b1HBIG) against HBV recurrence after LTx. Patients and methods This was a retrospective cohort-longitudinal study on 44 HBV-related post-LTx patients on anti-HBV prophylactic therapy. They included the entecavir (ETV)-based (n=34, 30 males) and the other NUC-based (n=10, 7 males) groups\u00b1HBIG. Results The median age was 63.5 (60\u201370) years in ETV and 62.5 (55\u201365) years in other NUCs groups. The mean follow-up duration was 6.09\u00b11.83 years in ETV-based group and 6.3\u00b11.89 years in other NUCs-based group. The mean ETV duration was 3.47\u00b13.04 years. In ETV+HBIG patients, none of them developed HBV recurrence throughout the \u00b18 years. In the 14 patients on ETV+other NUC+HBIG, four developed HBsAg positive and then transformed to HbsAb positive at the end of \u00b18 years without hepatitis or detectable HBV-DNA. Liver graft function showed nonsignificant difference for ETV-based patients, in comparison with other NUC groups (P=0.09). With subdivision, the graft function was maintained significantly better in ETV+HBIG or other NUCs+HBIG (P=0.04) groups. None of our patients reported NUCs-related complications or adverse effects. Conclusion ETV and other NUCs were effective and safe as a long-term prophylaxis of HBV recurrence after LTx, leading to a good graft function. HBsAg temporally reappeared in a minority of patients, where all showed HBsAb seroconversion without detectable HBV-DNA or clinical hepatitis.",

Treatment with entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) and the later released tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is highly effective at controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and, in the vast majority of patients, is well tolerated. No significant differences in viral suppression have been described among the different regimens, although an earlier achievement in biochemical response has been suggested first under TDF and recently under TAF. High barrier to resistance NAs rarely achieve hepatitis B surface antigen sero-clearance, and therefore should be maintained life-long in most cases. This has increased concerns about treatment-related toxicity, especially in patients under TDF with additional risk factors for kidney and bone impairment. TAF has shown a better bone and kidney safety profile than TDF, although it is not yet available worldwide due to its higher cost. Emergence of adverse events should be monitored since treatment-switch to ETV/TAF seems to be effective and safe in HBV mono-infected subjects. Finally, although an effective antiviral treatment leads to a clear improvement in clinical outcome of CHB patients; the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely avoided with viral suppression. Whether tenofovir-based regimens provide any additional benefit over ETV in HCC prevention remains unclear and requires further investigation.",
