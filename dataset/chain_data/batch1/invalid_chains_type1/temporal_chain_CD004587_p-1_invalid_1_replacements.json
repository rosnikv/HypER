The delivery of paclitaxel to the site of vascular injury may reduce the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt 73 U.S. centers, we enrolled 1314 patients who were receiving a stent in a single, previously untreated coronary-artery stenosis (vessel diameter, 2.5 to 3.75 mm; lesion length, 10 to 28 mm) in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A total of 652 patients were randomly assigned to receive a bare-metal stent, and 662 to receive an identical-appearing, slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent. Angiographic follow-up was prespecified at nine months in 732 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn terms of base-line characteristics, the two groups were well matched. Diabetes mellitus was present in 24.2 percent of patients; the mean reference-vessel diameter was 2.75 mm, and the mean lesion length was 13.4 mm. A mean of 1.08 stents (length, 21.8 mm) were implanted per patient. The rate of ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization at nine months was reduced from 12.0 percent with the implantation of a bare-metal stent to 4.7 percent with the implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.59; P<0.001). Target-lesion revascularization was required in 3.0 percent of the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent, as compared with 11.3 percent of the group that received a bare-metal stent (relative risk, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.43; P<0.001). The rate of angiographic restenosis was reduced from 26.6 percent to 7.9 percent with the paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.46; P<0.001). The nine-month composite rates of death from cardiac causes or myocardial infarction (4.7 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively) and stent thrombosis (0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively) were similar in the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent and the group that received a bare-metal stent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with bare-metal stents, the slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent is safe and markedly reduces the rates of clinical and angiographic restenosis at nine months.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Long-term comparative data of first-generation drug-eluting stents are scarce. We investigated clinical and angiographic outcomes of sirolimus-eluting (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) at 5 years as part of the Sirolimus-Eluting Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents for Coronary Revascularization (SIRTAX) LATE study. Methods and Results\u2014 A total of 1012 patients were randomly assigned to SES or PES. Repeat angiography was completed in 444 of 1012 patients (43.8%) at 5 years. Major adverse cardiac events occurred in 19.7% of SES- and 21.4% of PES-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17; P=0.39) at 5 years. There were no differences between SES and PES in terms of cardiac death (5.8% versus 5.7%; P=0.35), myocardial infarction (6.6% versus 6.9%; P=0.51), and target lesion revascularization (13.1% versus 15.1%; P=0.29). Between 1 and 5 years, the annual rate of target lesion revascularization was 2.0% (95% confidence interval, 1.4% to 2.6%) for SES and 1.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.9% to 2.0%) for PES. Among patients undergoing paired angiography at 8 months and 5 years, delayed lumen loss amounted to 0.37\u00b10.73 mm for SES and 0.29\u00b10.59 mm for PES (P=0.32). The overall rate of definite stent thrombosis was 4.6% for SES and 4.1% for PES (P=0.74), and very late definite stent thrombosis occurred at an annual rate of 0.65% (95% confidence interval, 0.40% to 0.90%). Conclusions\u2014 Long-term follow-up of first-generation drug-eluting stents shows no significant differences in clinical and angiographic outcomes between SES and PES. The continuous increase in late lumen loss in conjunction with the ongoing risk of very late stent thrombosis suggests that vascular healing remains incomplete up to 5 years after implantation of first-generation drug-eluting stents.

Methods and Results\u2014 PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for randomized clinical trials, until March 2012, that compared any of the Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved durable stent and polymer DES (sirolimus-eluting stent [SES], paclitaxel-eluting stent [PES], everolimus-eluting stent [EES], zotarolimus-eluting stent [ZES], and ZES-Resolute [ZES-R]) with each other or against BMS for de novo coronary lesions, enrolling at least 100 patients and with follow-up of at least 6 months. Short-term (\u2a7d1 year) and long-term efficacy (target-vessel revascularization, target-lesion revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis) outcomes were evaluated and trial-level data pooled by both mixed-treatment comparison and direct comparison analyses. From 76 randomized clinical trials with 117 762 patient-years of follow-up, compared with BMS, each DES reduced long-term target-vessel revascularization (39%\u201361%), but the magnitude varied by DES type (EES\u223cSES\u223cZES-R>PES\u223cZES>BMS), with a >42% probability that EES had the lowest target-vessel revascularization rate. There was no increase in the risk of any long-term safety outcomes, including stent thrombosis, with any DES (versus BMS). In addition, there was reduction in myocardial infarction (all DES except PES versus BMS) and stent thrombosis (with EES versus BMS: Rate ratio, 0.51; 95% credibility interval, 0.35\u20130.73). The safest DES appeared to be EES (>86% probability), with reduction in myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis compared with BMS. Short-term outcomes were similar to long-term outcomes, with SES, ZES-R, and everolimus-eluting stent being the most efficacious and EES being the safest stent. Conclusions\u2014 DES are highly efficacious at reducing the risk of target-vessel revascularization without an increase in any safety outcomes, including stent thrombosis. However, among the DES types, there were considerable differences, such that EES, SES, and ZES-R were the most efficacious and EES was the safest stent.",

Clinical follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Eligible patients were those with stable coronary artery disease or history of low-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI with zotarolimus-eluting stents.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nAfter PCI with zotarolimus-eluting stents, patients were prescribed aspirin (100-200 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for 3 months (n\u2009=\u20091563) or 12 months (n\u2009=\u20091556), unless contraindicated because of occurrence of an end point.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was net adverse clinical and cerebral events (NACCE; a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, or major bleeding); the expected event rate at 1 year was 9%, with a noninferiority margin of 2.7%. Secondary end points were major adverse cardiac events (MACE; a composite of all-cause death, MI, emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or target lesion revascularization) and Academic Research Consortium definite or probable stent thrombosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNACCE occurred in 93 patients receiving short-term and 90 patients receiving long-term therapy (6.0% vs 5.8%, respectively; risk difference, 0.17 [95% CI, -1.52 to 1.86]; P\u2009=\u2009.002 for noninferiority).

After 12 months of treatment with a thienopyridine drug (clopidogrel or prasugrel) and aspirin, patients were randomly assigned to continue receiving thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo for another 18 months; all patients continued receiving aspirin. The coprimary efficacy end points were stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) during the period from 12 to 30 months. The primary safety end point was moderate or severe bleeding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 9961 patients were randomly assigned to continue thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo. Continued treatment with thienopyridine, as compared with placebo, reduced the rates of stent thrombosis (0.4% vs. 1.4%; hazard ratio, 0.29 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.17 to 0.48]; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (4.3% vs. 5.9%; hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85]; P<0.001). The rate of myocardial infarction was lower with thienopyridine treatment than with placebo (2.1% vs. 4.1%; hazard ratio, 0.47; P<0.001). The rate of death from any cause was 2.0% in the group that continued thienopyridine therapy and 1.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.85]; P=0.05). The rate of moderate or severe bleeding was increased with continued thienopyridine treatment (2.5% vs. 1.6%, P=0.001). An elevated risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction was observed in both groups during the 3 months after discontinuation of thienopyridine treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDual antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year after placement of a drug-eluting stent, as compared with aspirin therapy alone, significantly reduced the risks of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events but was associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

Methods and results Using population-based electronic health records (EHRs) (CALIBER, England, 2000\u201310), of patients evaluated 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (MI), we developed (n\u2009=\u200912 694 patients) and validated (n\u2009=\u20095613) prognostic models for cardiovascular (cardiovascular death, MI or stroke) events and three different bleeding endpoints. We applied trial effect estimates to determine potential benefits and harms of DAPT and the net clinical benefit of individuals. Prognostic models for cardiovascular events (c-index: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.77)) and bleeding (c index 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.77)) were well calibrated: 3-year risk of cardiovascular events was 16.5% overall (5.2% in the lowest- and 46.7% in the highest-risk individuals), while for major bleeding, it was 1.7% (0.3% in the lowest- and 5.4% in the highest-risk patients). For every 10 000 patients treated per year, we estimated 249 (95% CI: 228, 269) cardiovascular events prevented and 134 (95% CI: 87, 181) major bleeding events caused in the highest-risk patients, and 28 (95% CI: 19, 37) cardiovascular events prevented and 9 (95% CI: 0, 20) major bleeding events caused in the lowest-risk patients. There was a net clinical benefit of prolonged DAPT in 63\u201399% patients depending on how benefits and harms were weighted.

        "title": "Improving outcomes after acute coronary events: what works and what doesn't.",
        "abstract": "Risk assessment before and after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an important first step in the management of such patients. While classical risk factors such as age, blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes, as well as biomarkers, are commonly used, their predictive power at the individual level is still limited. The non-coding genome plays a key role in genetic programming, during development, and in health and cardiovascular disease. About 99% of human genes do not encode proteins but are transcriptionally active, giving rise to a broad spectrum of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with regulatory and structural functions which appear to represent novel candidates to improve diagnostics and prognosis, as outlined in the review article \u2018Noncoding RNAs in cardiovascular diseases: diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives\u2019 by Wolfgang Poller and colleagues from the Charite Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin in Germany. Beyond that, ncRNAs provide new therapeutic targets currently being tested in clinical trials. New therapeutic tools were developed from endogenous ncRNAs serving as blueprints such as RNA interferencemediating drugs which mimic functions of endogenous small interfering RNAs and are versatile tools for silencing any protein-encoding or non-coding RNA target. Pioneering trials include RNA drugs targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) or apolipoprotein(a) and resulting in highly significant lowering of LDL cholesterol or lipoprotein(a), respectively. Novel drugs mimicking actions of endogenous ncRNAs may arise from exploitation of molecular interactions not accessible to conventional pharmacology. Nitric oxide or NO is an important regulator of cardiovascular function. In pre-clinical models, inhalation of NO during myocardial ischaemia and after reperfusion confers cardioprotection. In their article entitled \u2018Nitric oxide for inhalation in ST-elevation myocardialinfarction (NOMI): a multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial\u2019, Stefan P. Janssens and the NOMI Investigators report the results of their double-blind, placebo-controlled study on NO inhalation at a dose of 80 ppm for 4 h in 250 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or STEMI. Overall, infarct size at 48\u201372 h was 18.0 \u00b1 13.4% with NO and 19.4 \u00b1 15.4% in controls. Subgroup analysis indicated consistency across clinical confounders of infarct size, but significant treatment interaction with nitroglycerin, resulting in smaller infarct size after NO, in nitroglycerin-na\u0131\u0308ve patients. The myocardial salvage index and left ventricular volumes were similar in both groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis for the composite of death, recurrent ischaemia, stroke, or rehospitalizations showed a tendency toward lower event rates with NO at 4 months and 1 year. Thus, inhalation of NO in STEMI is safe, but does not reduce infarct size. The observed functional recovery and clinical event rates at follow-up and possible interaction with nitroglycerin warrant further studies, a perspective that is further explored in an Editorial by Borja Ibanez from Madrid, Spain. Another widely used small molecule in infarction is oxygen, which Robin Hofmann and colleagues tested in the DETO2XSWEDEHEART trial report in their article \u2018Oxygen therapy in STelevation myocardial infarction\u2019. They randomized 2807 patients with suspected STEMI to receive oxygen at 6 L/min for 6\u201312 h or ambient air. All-cause death, rehospitalization for infarction, cardiogenic shock, or stent thrombosis at 1 year occurred in 6.3% of patients allocated to oxygen and in 7.5% allocated to ambient air. The primary composite endpoint was consistent across all subgroups, as well as at different time points, such as during hospital stay, at 30 days, and follow-up for up to 1356 days. Thus, routine use of supplemental oxygen in non-hypoxaemic patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome and should not be routinely used. Diabetes is a known risk predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. However, the GRACE risk score, a powerful predictor of prognosis after an ACS, does not include a glucometabolic measure.

        "abstract": "Purpose The values of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) score in the stratification of ischemic risk were assessed in this study. Methods A total of 489 patients with acute coronary syndrome who received DAPT at discharge between June 2020 and August 2020 were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization, all-cause death, or ischemic stroke during a 27-month follow-up period. Results Patients with ESC-defined high-risk showed a significantly higher risk of MACE (HR 2.75, 95% CI 1.78\u20134.25), all-cause death (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.14\u20135.43), and recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization (HR 2.80, 95% CI 1.57\u20134.99) than those with ESC-defined low/medium-risk during follow-up. The results of landmark analysis showed that patients in the high-risk group had a significantly higher risk of MACE (HR 2.80,95 CI% 1.57\u20134.97), recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization (HR 3.19,95 CI% 1.47\u20136.93) within one year, and a higher risk of MACE (HR 2.69,95 CI% 1.38\u20135.23) after one year. There was no significant difference in the incidence of MACE between patients with a DAPT score \u22652 and a DAPT score <2. The C-indices of ESC criteria and DAPT score for prediction of MACE were 0.63 (95% CI 0.57\u20130.70) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.48\u20130.61), respectively. The predictive value of ESC criteria for MACE was better than the DAPT score according to the DeLong test (z-statistic=2.30, P=0.020). Conclusion Patients with ESC-defined high-risk had a higher risk of MACE compared to those with ESC-defined low/medium-risk. The discriminant ability of the ESC criteria was better than the DAPT score for MACE. The ESC criteria demonstrated moderate discriminatory capacity of MACE in ACS patients treated with DAPT.",
