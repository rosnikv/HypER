        "title": "Recombinant factor VIIa for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a randomized, double-blind trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a severe and frequent complication of cirrhosis. Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been shown to correct the prolonged prothrombin time in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB. This trial aimed to determine efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in cirrhotic patients with variceal and nonvariceal UGIB.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 245 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh < 13; Child-Pugh A = 20%, B = 52%, C = 28%) with UGIB (variceal = 66%, nonvariceal = 29%, bleeding source unknown = 5%) were randomized equally to receive 8 doses of 100 microg/kg rFVIIa or placebo in addition to pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment. The primary end point was a composite including: (1) failure to control UGIB within 24 hours after first dose, or (2) failure to prevent rebleeding between 24 hours and day 5, or (3) death within 5 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics were similar between rFVIIa and placebo groups. rFVIIa showed no advantage over standard treatment in the whole trial population. Exploratory analyses, however, showed that rFVIIa significantly decreased the number of failures on the composite end point (P = 0.03) and the 24-hour bleeding control end point (P = 0.01) in the subgroup of Child-Pugh B and C variceal bleeders. There were no significant differences between rFVIIa and placebo groups in mortality (5- or 42-day) or incidence of adverse events including thromboembolic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough no overall effect of rFVIIa was observed, exploratory analyses in Child-Pugh B and C cirrhotic patients indicated that administration of rFVIIa significantly decreased the proportion of patients who failed to control variceal bleeding. Dosing with rFVIIa appeared safe. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\u2002 In recent years, the hemostatic agent recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has emerged as a potentially new therapeutic agent for management of coagulopathy in patients with cirrhosis or following severe traumatic injury, a complex problem for clinicians in which standard treatment strategies are not always effective. As with other hemostatic agents, a primary safety concern of rFVIIa therapy is the theoretical possibility that systemic administration could confer an increased risk of thrombotic complications. So far, clinical experience indicates rFVIIa to be a safe treatment for currently approved indications within hemophilia.

The turnaround time for the first shipment was less than 10 minutes, and the time between the first and second shipments was reduced from 42 to 18 minutes, compared with historical controls. The decreased use of blood products represented a savings of $2270 per patient or an annual savings of $200, 000, despite increased costs for recombinant factor VIIa. There was no difference in mortality in either group; it remained around 50%. Thromboembolic complications did not increase, despite a significant increase in the use of recombinant factor VIIa.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe MTP resulted in a reduction in the use of blood components with improved turnaround times and significant savings.

        "abstract": "The management of massively transfused trauma patients has improved with a better understanding of trauma-induced coagulopathy, the limitations of crystalloid infusion, and the implementation of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs), which encompass transfusion management and other patient care needs to mitigate the \u201clethal triad\u201d of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. MTPs are currently changing in the United States and worldwide because of recent data showing that earlier and more aggressive transfusion intervention and resuscitation with blood components that approximate whole blood significantly decrease mortality. In this context, MTPs are a key element of \u201cdamage control resuscitation,\u201d which is defined as the systematic approach to major trauma that addresses the lethal triad mentioned above. MTPs using adequate volumes of plasma, and thus coagulation factors, improve patient outcome. The ideal amounts of plasma, platelet, cryoprecipitate and other coagulation factors given in MTPs in relationship to the red blood cell transfusion volume are not known precisely, but until prospective, randomized, clinical trials are performed and more clinical data are obtained, current data support a target ratio of plasma:red blood cell:platelet transfusions of 1:1:1.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFibrinolysis contributes to coagulopathy after major trauma and surgery. We hypothesized that progressive haemodilution is responsible, at least in part, for increased fibrinolytic tendency of blood clot.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was performed in two parts. First, whole blood (WB) samples collected from six healthy, consented volunteers were diluted in vitro with either saline or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) to 40% and 15% of baseline. We quantified factor levels related to coagulation and fibrinolysis, and measured endogenous thrombin generation in undiluted control plasma samples and in samples diluted with saline or FFP. Additionally, thromboelastometry was used to assess susceptibility to fibrinolysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator in undiluted WB samples and in samples diluted with saline before and after substitution of fibrinogen or FFP. Secondly, as a model of in vivo haemodilution, we evaluated the same parameters before and after operation in nine consented patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe dilution with saline caused dose-dependent decreases in plasma levels of coagulation and antifibrinolytic factors, and in thrombin generation. In FFP-supplemented samples, factor levels and thrombin generation were maintained within normal ranges. Fibrinolytic tendency was significantly higher after haemodilution with saline independent of fibrinogen substitution compared with FFP. Similarly, increased tendency for fibrinolysis was also observed in the in vivo haemodilution.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that progressive haemodilution decreases endogenous antifibrinolytic proteins including alpha(2)-antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, resulting in increased fibrinolytic tendency. Therefore, early fluid replacement therapy with FFP might be advantageous after massive haemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) is characterized by increased bleeding risk. The treatment options in GT are limited. The aim of this study was to test the effect of GT blood supplementation with fibrinogen and factor XIII on thrombin generation, blood clotting, and fibrinolysis. Whole blood samples of GT patients and normal donors treated with eptifibatide (GT model) were subjected to clotting by CaCl2 and tissue factor. Thrombin generation was measured in platelet-rich plasma. Clot formation and tPA-induced fibrinolysis were evaluated in whole blood by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Blood was supplemented with fibrinogen (3\u2009g/L) and/or FXIII (2\u2009IU/mL). Thrombin generation analysis of blood derived from GT model and GT patients revealed decreased endogenous thrombin potential and peak height and extended lag time compared to control. However, this method was not sensitive to blood spiking with fibrinogen and FXIII. ROTEM revealed lower maximum clot firmness (MCF) and area under curve (AUC) in the blood of GT model and GT patients. In the absence of exogenous tPA, blood spiking with fibrinogen markedly enhanced clot quality while FXIII had no effect. Combination of fibrinogen and FXIII did not add to the effect of fibrinogen. In contrast, by the addition of tPA, both fibrinogen and FXIII separately and, to more extent, in combination enhanced clot quality as well as resistance against tPA-induced fibrinolysis (increasing MCF, AUC, and lysis onset time). In conclusion, fibrinogen and FXIII exerted stimulation of blood clotting and inhibition of fibrinolysis. Treating normal blood with eptifibatide mimics the changes of coagulopathy in GT blood.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives. Natural colloid albumin induces a lesser degree of dilutional coagulopathy than synthetic colloids. Fibrinogen concentrate has emerged as a promising strategy to treat coagulopathy, and factor XIII (FXIII) works synergistically with fibrinogen to correct coagulopathy following haemodilution with crystalloids. Our objectives were to examine the ability of fibrinogen and FXIII concentrates to reverse albumin-induced dilutional coagulopathy. Methods. High and low concentrations of both fibrinogen and FXIII were used to reverse coagulopathy induced by 1:1 dilution in vitro with 5% albumin of blood samples from healthy volunteers, monitored by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM\u00ae). Results. Haemodilution with albumin significantly attenuated EXTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), alpha angle (AA), clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), and FIBTEM MCF (p < 0.001). Following haemodilution, both doses of fibrinogen significantly corrected all ROTEM parameters (p \u2264 0.02), except the lower dose did not correct AA. Compared to the lower dose, the higher dose of fibrinogen significantly improved FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM MCF, AA and CFT (p < 0.001). The lower dose of FXIII did not significantly correct any of the ROTEM parameters, and the high dose only improved EXTEM CT (p = 0.004). All combinations of high/low concentrations of fibrinogen/FXIII significantly improved all ROTEM parameters examined (p \u2264 0.001). Fibrinogen concentration generally had a greater effect on each parameter than did FXIII concentration; the best correction of ROTEM parameters was achieved with high-dose fibrinogen concentrate and either low- or high-dose FXIII. Conclusions. Fibrinogen concentrate successfully corrected initiation, propagation and clot firmness deficits induced by haemodilution with albumin, and FXIII synergistically improved fibrin-based clot strength.",

        "abstract": "Background Albumin treatment of ischemic stroke was associated with cardiopulmonary adverse events in previous studies and a low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage. We sought to describe the neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events in the ALIAS Part 2 Multicenter Trial. Methods Ischemic stroke patients, aged 18\u201383 and a baseline NIHSS \u2265 6, were randomized to treatment with ALB or saline control within 5 hours of stroke onset. Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, hemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. Cardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolism. Results Among 830 patients, neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events were not differentially associated with poor outcome between ALB and saline control subjects. The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first 24h was low overall (2.9%, 24/830) but more common in the ALB treated subjects (RR = 2.4, CI95 1.01\u20135.8). The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was 7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 4.3\u201326.6); this complication was expected and was satisfactorily managed with mandated diuretic administration and intravenous fluid guidelines. Troponin elevations in the first 48h were common, occurring without ECG change or cardiac symptoms in 52 subjects (12.5%). Conclusions ALB therapy was associated with an increase in symptomatic ICH and pulmonary edema/congestive heart failure but this did not affect final outcomes.

Reduction of temperature during the clotting process supported the development of high moduli by providing more time for fiber assembly. But at low HCT, clot firmness could be increased by elevating the temperature from 32 to 37\u00b0C. In contrast, when the fibrinogen concentration was modified, acceleration of clotting via temperature always reduced clot stiffness, whatever the initial fibrinogen concentration. Electrical resistance increased continuously during clotting; loss tangent (D) (relaxation frequency 249\u200akHz) decreased when clots became denser: fewer dipoles contributed to the relaxation process.

        "abstract": "Objective: There is uncertainty about deep vein thrombosis standard treatment as thrombus stiffness alters each case. Here, we investigated thrombus\u2019 stiffness of different compositions and ages using shear wave elastography (SWE). We then studied the effectiveness of ultrasound-thrombolysis on different thrombus compositions. Methods: Shear waves generated through mechanical shaker and traveled along thrombus of different hematocrit (HCT) levels, whereas 18-MHz ultrasound array used to detect wave propagation. Thrombus\u2019 stiffness was identified by the shear wave speed (SWS). In thrombolysis, a 3.2 MHz focused transducer was applied to different thrombus compositions using different powers. The thrombolysis rate was defined as the percentage of weight loss. Results: The estimated average SWS of 20%, 40%, and 60% HCT thrombus were 0.75 m/s, 0.44 m/s, and 0.32 m/s, respectively. For Thrombolysis, the percentage weight loss at 8 MPa Negative pressure for the same HCT groups were 23.1%, 35.29%, and 39.66% respectively. Conclusion: SWS is inversely related to HCT level and positively related to thrombus age. High HCT thrombus had higher weight loss compared to low HCT. However, the difference between 20% and 40% HCT was more significant than between 40% and 60% HCT in both studies. Our results suggest that thrombus with higher SWS require more power to achieve the same thrombolysis rate as thrombus with lower SWS. Significance: Characterizing thrombus elastic property undergoing thrombolysis enables evaluation of ultrasound efficacy for fractionating thrombus and reveals the appropriate ultrasound parameters selection to achieve a certain thrombolysis rate in the case of a specific thrombus stiffness.",
