        "abstract": "Six primary care practices which utilize both physician and non-physician practitioner types were studied to measure differences between practitioner types in the care of patients. By chart review 1,369 patient-practitioner encounters were examined. Physicians identified less symptoms and signs in their patients and prescribed less non-drug therapies than did non-physicians. Likewise, at follow-up visits, physicians tended to document less follow-up of these types of problems and therapies than non-physicians. When examining the interaction between practitioners, the highest rates of follow-up of all types of problems and therapies were found when the same practitioner saw the patient at two successive visits to the same clinic. When a physician saw a patient following a previous visit to a nurse practitioner, there was a significant drop-off in the follow-up rate of problems and therapies. However, when a nurse practitioner saw the patient following a previous visit to a physician, the drop-off in follow-up rates was not as striking. These findings indicate that the skills of physician and nonphysician practitioners are potentially complementary. However, this potential is not fully exploited, particularly by physicians.",

Twelve of these practices had ceased to function, although eight have been replaced by physician practices. Of the remaining 32, 14 have physicians on their staffs and 18 remain staffed only by NPs and PAs. Those centers staffed by physicians experience greater patient utilization, charge more for office visits, have larger budgets, and generate more of their budgets from fees for services and therefore appear to be more organizationally stable than centers staffed only by NPs and PAs. Although broader studies are needed for substantiation, these findings suggest that the period when NP/PA-staffed satellite health centers were important organizations for delivering care to previously underserved rural communities may be ending.",

Increased emphasis was placed on an ideology that promoted deregulation and competitive market solutions. During the 1980s, the gap in the availability of physicians in metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan areas widened. Also during that time period, the gap between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan populations' utilization of physician services widened. In addition, many indicators of the health status of nonmetropolitan residents versus metropolitan residents worsened during the 1980s. As we enter the 1990s, concern about equitable access to needed health care services and for the vulnerability and fragility of rural health systems has resurfaced. A number of national policies and a research agenda to improve accessibility and availability of health services in rural areas are being considered.",

        "abstract": "This research examines the relationship between residence and infant mortality. The purpose of the study was to identify the effects of maternal residence on infant mortality, using a multivariate model which included both individual and county-level variables known to be associated with suboptimal birth outcome. Data on all births in Florida during 1987 were drawn from birth and infant death certificates. In addition, information concerning county sociodemographic structure and medical resources were gathered and linked to the individual records. After examining the distributions of selected risk variables across a five-category measure of residence (from most urban to most rural), a logit model was estimated to predict the odds of an infant death associated with maternal residence. At the bivariate level, rural residents were found to have increased odds of an infant death compared to residents of all other residence categories. Second, a logit model was estimated that controlled for the influence of important maternal, infant, and county risk characteristics. The results of this second, more fully specified model indicate that residence did not have an independent direct effect on infant mortality when the influence of the other risk factors was controlled. We conclude that although residence does not influence infant mortality directly, it does influence mortality indirectly through its association with key risk factors. In particular, because population characteristics and medical resources are differentially distributed across rural and urban areas, residence remains an important factor to be considered when predicting health outcomes. The implications of these findings for policy-makers and health planners, as well as for health services researchers, are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "It is often assumed that poor birth outcomes are more common among rural women than urban women, but there is little substantive evidence to that effect. While the effectiveness of rural providers and hospitals has been evaluated in previous studies, this study focuses on poor birth outcomes in a population of rural residents, including those who leave rural areas for obstetrical care. Rural and urban differences in rates of inadequate prenatal care, neonatal death, and low birth weight were examined in the general population and in subpopulations stratified by risk and race using data from five years (1984-88) of birth and infant death certificates from Washington state. Also examined were care and outcome differences between rural women delivering in rural hospitals and those delivering in urban facilities. Bivariate analyses were confirmed with logistic regression. Results indicate that rural residents in the general population and in various subpopulations had similar or lower rates of poor outcome than did urban residents but experienced higher rates of inadequate prenatal care than did urban residents. Rural residents delivering in urban hospitals had higher rates of poor outcomes than those delivering in rural hospitals. We conclude that rural residence is not associated with greater risk of poor birth outcome. White and nonwhite differences appear to exceed any rural and urban resident differences in rates of poor birth outcome.",

We used structured interviews to obtain information on the technical sophistication and approximate replacement value of all hospital-based obstetrical ultrasound machines in every maternity hospital in Washington state and Wales. The supply of hospital-based ultrasound machines\u2014approximately two machines per 1,000 births\u2014was similar in both countries. Wales had fewer advanced ultrasound machines than Washington state, and they were based exclusively in high-volume district general hospitals; there were no obstetric ultrasound machines in the private sector. In Washington state, the majority of advanced machines were in small and medium-sized hospitals, and many private offices had ultrasound machines. The approximate replacement value of hospital-based machines was three times as high per birth in Washington state as in Wales. In the case of obstetrical ultrasound, centralization of facilities, a relatively small private sector, and global budgeting lead to lower expenditures per patient within the National Health Service without compromising access to care.",

        "abstract": "Adequate prenatal care is known to reduce the risks of low birth weight and neonatal death, yet nearly one quarter of all women giving birth in the United States receive delayed, inadequate or no prenatal care. This suboptimal use of prenatal care has contributed to rates of low birth weight and neonatal mortality higher than those in most other industrialized nations. This paper examines the relationships among race/ethnicity, residence, maternal sociodemographic and medical risk characteristics, and use of prenatal care in the United States. Using data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey, this study found important differences in prenatal care use by race/ethnicity and residence, as well as interactive effects of these variables. Single marital status, nonmetropolitan residence, poverty, low level of education, and no insurance were more strongly associated with inadequate prenatal care for whites and Hispanics than for blacks. Nonmetropolitan residents were more likely to receive inadequate care, regardless of race/ethnicity or sociodemographic characteristics. Predicted probabilities of prenatal care use by race/ethnicity and residence showed that, regardless of risk, nonmetropolitan Hispanic women had the highest probability of obtaining inadequate prenatal care. Results highlight the continued importance of race/ethnicity and rural residence in determining prenatal care use and the need to design interventions targeted to these populations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo measure what patients with Spanish language preference and limited English proficiency value most when selecting a prenatal care clinician.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA discrete choice experiment was administered at two large academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants were identified by electronic medical record, had preferred Spanish language and self-identified limited English proficiency, and either were pregnant with a completed fetal anatomy scan or had given birth within the past 12 months at the time of the study. The discrete choice experiment consisted of eight attributes to consider when selecting a prenatal care clinician: clinician Spanish proficiency, type of interpreter used, interpersonal dynamics (ie, making patients feel seen, heard, and cared for), cultural concordance, continuity of care, shared decision making, distance from home, and wait times for appointments. Descriptive statistics of demographic variables were calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to analyze discrete choice experiment data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe attributes that were most important to 166 participants when choosing their prenatal care clinician were interpersonal dynamics within the patient-clinician dyad and clinician Spanish language proficiency (average importance 21.4/100 and 20.8/100, respectively). Of lowest importance were wait time to receive an appointment and continuity of care (average importance 5.1 and 6.1, respectively). Although participants highly preferred that their clinician be \"fluent or near fluent in Spanish,\" the second most preferred option was having a clinician with only basic Spanish proficiency rather than a more advanced level of Spanish proficiency with some misunderstandings.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study demonstrates the importance of positive clinician-patient interpersonal dynamics and language-concordant care for patients with Spanish language preference in prenatal care. Promoting equitable patient-centered care for patients with limited English proficiency requires responding to preferences regarding clinician language proficiency and demonstrating attentiveness, empathy, and concern for prenatal care experiences.",
