        "abstract": "We have developed a diabetes quality-of-life (DQOL) measure oriented toward the patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The DQOL was assessed for its reliability and validity in a group of patients with IDDM (n = 192). We found that the DQOL and its four scales had high degrees of internal consistency (Cronbach's r = .66\u2212.92) and excellent test-retest reliability (r = .78\u2212.92). Using conceptually relevant measures of psychiatric symptoms, perceived well-being and adjustment to illness, we also demonstrated convergent validity of the DQOL. This instrument was initially designed for use in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a multicenter controlled clinical trial evaluating the effects of two different diabetes treatment regimens on the appearance and progression of early vascular complications. However, the DQOL may also be useful in evaluating the quality of life in other groups of patients with IDDM.",

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of measures of psychosocial distress, health-seeking behaviour, sleep problems and traumatic life events to the development of new cases of CWP in the community.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a population-based prospective study, 3171 adults aged 25-65 yrs free of CWP were followed-up 15 months later to identify those with new CWP. Baseline data were available on their scores from a number of psychological scales including Illness Attitude Scales (IAS), Somatic Symptom Checklist (SSC), Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale, Sleep Problems Scale, and Life Events Inventory.\n\n\nRESULTS\n324 subjects [10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2, 11.3] developed new CWP at follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, three factors independently predicted the development of CWP: scoring three or more on the SSC [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1], scoring eight or more on the Illness Behaviour subscale of the IAS (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.3, 4.8), and nine or more on the Sleep Problem Scale (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6, 3.2). Subjects exposed to all three factors were at 12 times the odds of new CWP than those with low scores on all scales.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSubjects are at substantial increased odds of developing CWP if they display features of somatization, health-seeking behaviour and poor sleep.

        "abstract": "Objectives. Poor sleep is associated with chronic widespread pain (CWP). Conversely, good-quality sleep may play a role in the resolution of pain symptoms. Sleep is a multidimensional construct, comprising a number of diverse components. The aims of the current study were to examine the hypotheses that: (i) good sleep quality would predict the resolution of CWP, (ii) restorative sleep would predict the resolution of CWP and (iii) that these relationships would be independent of confounding psychological factors. Methods. Subjects in a population-based prospective study completed a pain questionnaire at baseline from which subjects with CWP were identified. Baseline sleep was measured using the Estimation of Sleep Problems Scale which measures sleep onset, maintenance, early wakening and restorative sleep. The questionnaire also contained scales examining psychosocial status. Subjects were followed up 15 months later and pain status was assessed. Results. A total of 1061 subjects reported CWP at baseline of whom 679 (75% of eligible subjects) responded at follow-up. Of those, a total of 300 (44%) no longer satisfied criteria for CWP. Univariate analysis revealed that three of the four sleep components were associated with the resolution of CWP: rapid sleep onset, odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.5; absence of early wakening, OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.4; and restorative sleep, OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.5, 4.8. After adjusting for the effect of psychosocial factors, which may have confounded the relationship, only restorative sleep (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.02, 3.8) was associated. Conclusions.

        "abstract": "In Finland, between 2003 and 2010 and parallel to the increase in the prevalence of insomnia-related symptoms among the general population, there has been a cessation of growth and even a decrease in the consumption of traditional hypnotics. The reasons behind this seemingly paradoxical situation are not known. We analyzed trends over the period 2000-2010 in the estimated consumption of traditional hypnotics and some new drugs that are destined for use in insomnia treatment. We used the annual wholesale statistical database compiled by the Finnish Medicine Agency, FIMEA, and data from the Finnish Drug Prescription Register. We found evidence to support two parallel trends in Finnish outpatient care. First, there seems to be a trend in which physicians increasingly comply with official guidelines for insomnia treatment, which partly accounts for the decrease in the consumption of traditional hypnotics. Second, at the same time, the first trend seems to be resulting in an increasing trend to treat insomnia patients with some new drugs that were not originally developed for insomnia treatment by prescribing these non-hypnotic drugs in small, sub-clinical doses. The current trend in practice may have contradictory effects on the treatment of insomnia. The long-term consequences of using low doses of drugs other than hypnotics to treat insomnia are not known and the situation should, therefore, be followed-up in subsequent studies. However, pharmacological treatment should never be a substitute for non-pharmacological treatments of insomnia.

        "abstract": "Chronic insomnia is one of the most prevalent central nervous system diseases, however, its neurobiology is poorly understood. Up to now, nothing is known about the integrity of white matter tracts in insomnia patients. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used in a well\u2010characterized sample of primary insomnia (PI) patients and good sleeper controls to fill this void. Voxelwise between\u2010group comparisons of fractional anisotropy (FA) were performed in 24 PI patients (10 males; 14 females; 42.7 \u00b1 14.5 years) and 35 healthy good sleepers (15 males; 20 females; 40.1 \u00b1 9.1 years) with age and sex as covariates. PI patients showed reduced FA values within the right anterior internal capsule and a trend for reduced FA values in the left anterior internal capsule. The results suggest that insomnia is associated with a reduced integrity of white matter tracts in the anterior internal capsule indicating that disturbed fronto\u2010subcortical connectivity may be a cause or consequence of the disorder.

        "abstract": "Significance Insomnia is a common symptom representing an important health burden. Widely prescribed hypnotic agents enhance the function of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. The ability to arouse and respond to unexpected stimuli is a feature of normal sleep, and one of the concerns of this class of hypnotic agents is that patients may become physically and/or cognitively impaired while the drug is in effect. As a new approach for the treatment of insomnia, orexin receptor antagonists have been recently approved, which specifically inhibit the orexin-mediated wake-promoting system, supposedly without affecting the whole brain. We found that, compared with the GABA receptor agonist brotizolam, the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant induced less impairment in body balance after taking the medicine. The majority of patients with insomnia are treated with hypnotic agents. In the present study, we evaluated the side-effect profile of an orexin receptor antagonist and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor agonist on physical/cognitive functions upon forced awakening. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted on 30 healthy male subjects. Fifteen minutes before bedtime, the subjects took a pill of suvorexant (20 mg), brotizolam (0.25 mg), or placebo and were forced awake 90 min thereafter. Physical- and cognitive-function tests were performed before taking the pill, after forced awakening, and the next morning. Polysomnographic recordings revealed that the efficacies of the hypnotic agents in prolonging total sleep time (\u223c30 min) and increasing sleep efficiency (\u223c6%) were comparable. When the subjects were allowed to go back to sleep after the forced awakening, the sleep latency was shorter under the influence of hypnotic agents (\u223c2 min) compared to the placebo trial (24 min), and the rapid eye movement latency was significantly shorter under suvorexant (98.8, 81.7, and 48.8 min for placebo, brotizolam, and suvorexant, respectively). Although brotizolam significantly impaired the overall physical/cognitive performance (sum of z score) compared with placebo upon forced awakening, there was no significant difference in the total z score of performance between suvorexant and placebo. Notably, the score for static balance with the eyes open was higher under suvorexant compared to brotizolam administration. The energy expenditure was lower under suvorexant and brotizolam compared with the placebo. The effect size of brotizolam (d = 0.24) to reduce the energy expenditure was larger than that of suvorexant (d < 0.01).",

        "abstract": "The hypocretins (Hcrts), also known as orexins, are two neuropeptides produced exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus. They act on two specific receptors that are widely distributed across the brain and involved in a myriad of neurophysiological functions that include sleep, arousal, feeding, reward, fear, anxiety and cognition. Hcrt cell loss in humans leads to narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy type 1), a disorder characterized by intrusions of sleep into wakefulness, demonstrating that the Hcrt system is nonredundant and essential for sleep/wake stability. The causal link between Hcrts and arousal/wakefulness stabilisation has led to the development of a new class of drugs, Hcrt receptor antagonists to treat insomnia, based on the assumption that blocking orexin\u2010induced arousal will facilitate sleep. This has been clinically validated: currently, two Hcrt receptor antagonists are approved to treat insomnia (suvorexant and lemborexant), with a New Drug Application recently submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for a third drug (daridorexant). Other therapeutic applications under investigation include reduction of cravings in substance\u2010use disorders and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, given the apparent bidirectional relationship between poor sleep and worsening of the disease. Circuit neuroscience findings suggest that the Hcrt system is a hub that integrates diverse inputs modulating arousal (e.g., circadian rhythms, metabolic status, positive and negative emotions) and conveys this information to multiple output regions. This neuronal architecture explains the wealth of physiological functions associated with Hcrts and highlights the potential of the Hcrt system as a therapeutic target for a number of disorders. We discuss present and future possible applications of drugs targeting the Hcrt system for the treatment of circuit\u2010related neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions.",

        "abstract": "Due to worldwide demographic change, the number of older persons in the population is increasing. Aging is accompanied by changes of sleep structure, deposition of beta-amyloid (A\u00df) and tau proteins and vascular changes and can turn into mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as dementia. Sleep disorders are discussed both as a risk factor for and as a consequence of MCI/dementia. Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based as well as case\u2013control studies revealed sleep disorders, especially sleep-disorderded breathing (SDB) and excessive or insufficient sleep durations, as risk factors for all-cause MCI/dementia. Regarding different dementia types, SDB was especially associated with vascular dementia while insomnia/insufficient sleep was related to an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Scarce and still inconsistent evidence suggests that therapy of sleep disorders, especially continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in SDB, can improve cognition in patients with sleep disorders with and without comorbid dementia and delay onset of MCI/dementia in patients with sleep disorders without previous cognitive impairment. Regarding potential pathomechanisms via which sleep disorders lead to MCI/dementia, disturbed sleep, chronic sleep deficit and SDB can impair glymphatic clearance of beta-amyloid (A\u00df) and tau which lead to amyloid deposition and tau aggregation resulting in changes of brain structures responsible for cognition. Orexins are discussed to modulate sleep and A\u00df pathology. Their diurnal fluctuation is suppressed by sleep fragmentation and the expression suppressed at the point of hippocampal atrophy, contributing to the progression of dementia. Additionally, sleep disorders can lead to an increased vascular risk profile and vascular changes such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis which can foster neurodegenerative pathology. There is ample evidence indicating that changes of sleep structure in aging persons can lead to dementia and also evidence that therapy of sleep disorder can improve cognition. Therefore, sleep disorders should be identified and treated early.",
