The PCOS SIG\u2019s annual meetingshowcased three different aspects of the disease, with the overall aimof encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and networking inthis important area.PCOS is one of the most common conditions in women ofchildbearing age, and is the most common cause of hyperandrogenismin this cohort. Dr Mason detailed the factors implicated in the causeof the ovulatory dysfunction in PCOS. It is clear that there are dif-ferences in the production of many of the paracrine signallinghormones between normal and polycystic ovaries. Although subtlechanges can be observed in the inhibin/activin family it is dif\ufb01cultto assess the in vivo impact of such changes on follicle growth.Likewise, there are clearly alterations in the IGF/IGFBP system andin the production of various androgenic and other steroids andwhereas these are not without interest, it is impossible to determinewhether they re\ufb02ect defective follicle function or cause it. It canhowever, be seen that the changes in testosterone and andro-stenedione are considerable and intrinsic and are likely candidatesfor disrupting folliculogenesis in the early stages. It is the sheermagnitude of the increase in AMH production that differentiates itfrom other factors and underlines the likelihood that this will proveto be an important factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS.Professor Colao detailed the CVR factors present in PCOS.However, it was noted that there is a paucity both of long-term datafor well-characterized women with PCOS, and for large-scaleprospective clinical trials to determine the outcome morbidity andmortality of CVD in PCOS subjects. Furthermore, the link betweenPCOS and primary cardiovascular events has not yet been demonstrated.Professor Blume-Peytavi urged that the impact of the dermato-logical manifestations of this disorder should not be underestimated,describing how many women \ufb01nd these symptoms extremelydebilitating, affecting many aspects of their lives. For patientssuffering from PCOS, treatment options include reduction of androgenproduction and action, lifestyle modi\ufb01cation, oral contraceptives,antiandrogens, and insulin-sensitizing agents as well as topicaltreatment of acne, seborrhoea and AGA. Local management ofhirsutism should also include photoepilation combined withe\ufb02ornithine cream.",

The AUC can be interpreted to equal the likelihood that a person destined to develop the disease or characteristic being tested for has a higher score, comparing one person who is with another who is not going to develop the given outcome (1). The AUC should be contrasted with an odds ratio (OR) or relative risk, which may be calculated as equaling (sensitivity) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 false positive rate)/[(1 \u2212 sensitivity) \u00d7 (false positive rate)]. This may better be thought of as pertaining to populations, with an OR of 1.5\u20133.0 giving rise to AUCs of 0.57\u20130.68, which Stern termed not terribly impressive levels, as can be observed in the overlap of distribution curves of those developing versus not developing the disease or characteristic.

Replication of the GWAS was applied to further confirm the relationship between LPP gene and PCOS. Methods Three polymorphisms of LPP gene (rs715790, rs4449306, rs6782041) were selected and replicated in additional 1132 PCOS cases and 1142 controls. Genotyping of LPP gene was carried out by Taqman-MGB method. Results In rs715790, the allele frequency is significantly different between the PCOS group and the control group. Meta-analysis showed that the allele frequencies of the three SNPs rs715790 (Pmeta\u200a=\u200a1.89E-05, OR\u200a=\u200a1.23), rs4449306 (Pmeta\u200a=\u200a3.0E-04, OR\u200a=\u200a1.10), rs6782041 (Pmeta\u200a=\u200a2.0E-04, OR\u200a=\u200a1.09), were significantly different between PCOS cases and controls.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIt is believed that a dysfunction in adipose tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Natriuretic peptides are hormones that regulate cardiovascular and body fluid homeostasis and adipose tissue metabolism. Natriuretic peptide levels are reduced in individuals with obesity and diabetes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to investigate whether natriuretic peptide levels are altered in women with PCOS and whether they correlate with adiponectin levels or insulin sensitivity markers.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nThis was a cross-sectional study at a referral center in a teaching hospital.\n\n\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS\nWe evaluated 40 patients diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria and 36 control women matched for age and body mass index.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe measured serum adiponectin, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and plasma brain natriuretic peptide using enzyme immunoassays in both groups. We evaluated metabolic markers, such as fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. In addition, we calculated the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and the lipid accumulation product (LAP) index and tested the linear correlations between these metabolic indices and the plasma ANP and serum adiponectin concentrations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nANP and adiponectin were reduced in the PCOS group compared with the control group (P = 0.010 and P = 0.014, respectively). The brain natriuretic peptide concentration did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.883). There was no correlation between ANP and any of the metabolic markers. In the control group, the serum adiponectin level was inversely correlated with BMI (P = 0.011), waist circumference (P = 0.021), insulin (P = 0.013), fasting glucose (P = 0.010), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (P = 0.007), and lipid accumulation product (P = 0.022). Remarkably, none of these correlations were observed in the women with PCOS.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWomen with PCOS had lower ANP and adiponectin compared with controls matched for age and BMI. Thus, the mechanisms that affect ANP and adiponectin production and clearance may be altered in PCOS, regardless of adiposity. These hormones may be involved in the metabolic features of PCOS.",

        "abstract": "Overweight and insulin resistance (IR) are central pathogenic features of the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and weight loss is the main treatment option. PCOS is also associated with signs of a chronic inflammation, activation of the coagulation system, defect endothelial function and increased arterial stiffness, all regarded as risk factors or markers for the development of cardiovascular disease. These factors are not taken into account in the definition of the syndrome, which is based on the 3 Rotterdam criteria. An uncertainty of the clinical risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in these relatively young women has led to many studies on surrogate markers of CVD in PCOS, including the search for new markers with additional information of the arteriosclerotic burden in PCOS. GLP-1 analogues, originally developed for the treatment of diabetes, induce weight loss also in non-diabetic people. We therefore questioned whether treatment with the GLP-1 analogue Liraglutide to women with PCOS in doses used for diabetes could induce weight loss and improve IR and through this action, or independently, improve markers of vascular thrombosis in women with PCOS. Thus, 70 overweight and/or insulin resistant PCOS women were planned treated for 26 weeks in a placebo controlled randomized trial with the following effect parameters to be evaluated: Changes in Thrombin generation time, Adrenomedullin, Atrial natriuretic peptide, body fat composition (DEXA), liver fat content (MRI), BMI, IR, sex hormones and ovarian morphology.

Endpoints included between-group difference in change (baseline to follow-up) in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels and in thrombin generation test parameters: endogenous thrombin potential, peak thrombin concentration, lag time and time to peak. Mean weight loss was 5.2\u2009kg (95% CI 3.0\u20137.5\u2009kg, P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the liraglutide group compared with placebo.

In overweight women with PCOS, liraglutide intervention caused an approximate 5% weight loss. In addition, liraglutide affected thrombin generation, although not significantly differently from placebo. A concomitant trend toward improved fibrinolysis indicates a possible reduction of the baseline thrombogenic potential. The findings point toward beneficial effects of liraglutide on markers of VTE and CVD risk, which should be further pursued in larger studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Context Obesity is responsible for an increased risk of sub-fecundity and infertility. Obese women show poorer reproductive outcomes regardless of the mode of conception, and higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with poorer fertility prognosis. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of infertility, and many women with PCOS are also overweight or obese. Evidence Acquisition The aim of the present narrative review is to describe the mechanisms responsible for the development of infertility and PCOS in women with obesity/overweight, with a focus on the emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) as a therapeutic option for obese women with PCOS. Evidence synthesis Weight reduction represents the most significant factor affecting fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Current experimental and clinical evidence suggests the presence of an underlying pathophysiological link between obesity, GLP-1 kinetic alterations, and PCOS pathogenesis. Based on the positive results in patients affected by obesity, with or without diabetes, the administration of GLP-1 RA (mainly liraglutide) alone or in combination with metformin has been investigated in women with obesity and PCOS. Several studies demonstrated significant weight loss and testosterone reduction, with mixed results relative to improvements in insulin resistance parameters and menstrual patterns. Conclusions The weight loss effects of GLP-1 RA offer a unique opportunity to expand the treatment options available to PCOS patients.",

        "abstract": "Insulin resistance is documented in clamp studies in 75% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Although it is not included in the diagnostic criteria of PCOS, there is a crucial role of this metabolic impairment, which along with hormonal abnormalities, increase each other in a vicious circle of PCOS pathogenesis. Insulin resistance in this group of patients results from defects at the molecular level, including impaired insulin receptor-related signaling pathways enhanced by obesity and its features: Excess visceral fat, chronic inflammation, and reactive oxygen species. While lifestyle intervention has a first-line role in the prevention and management of excess weight in PCOS, the role of anti-obesity pharmacological agents in achieving and maintaining weight loss is being increasingly recognized. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) not only act by reducing body weight but also can affect the mechanisms involved in insulin resistance, like an increasing expression of glucose transporters in insulin-dependent tissues, decreasing inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating lipid metabolism. They also tend to improve fertility either by increasing LH surge in hypothalamus-pituitary inhibition due to estrogen excess connected with obesity or decreasing too high LH levels accompanying hyperinsulinemia. GLP1-RAs seem promising for effective treatment of obese PCOS patients, acting on one of the primary causes of PCOS at the molecular level.",

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) are drugs utilized to treat diabetes, but they are also approved as an adjunct to a low-calorie diet to reduce body weight and to enhance the metabolic profile readings for diabetic and non-diabetic patients. However, their efficacy and safety in children have not been extensively examined. Aim To identify glucagon-like peptide-1 medications for obesity in pediatric participants (aged up to 17 years old). Methods Analysis of all clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for obesity using GLP-1 as a treatment for children. Results As of January 26th, 2023, 10,828 clinical trials were found.

        "abstract": "Background Metformin is commonly prescribed to treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, but in some cases, it may not be effective even at high doses or may cause intolerable side effects. Therefore, recent studies have examined the impact of combining metformin with other antidiabetic medications. Methods A systematic search was performed in Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase up to 30 June 2023. All interventional studies that assessed the efficacy of different antidiabetic agents were included. Results Among the 3488 records found in the primary search, 16 papers were included. Our study showed that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) had the most significant impact on glycemic profile, while thiazolidinediones (TZDs) had the most influence on lipid levels. However, it was observed that patients taking only metformin experienced a greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) effectively modified various anthropometric measurements, such as weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. The effects of different antidiabetic drugs on hormone levels were inconclusive, although testosterone levels were more affected by GLP1RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and TZDs. None of the combined therapies showed a significant change in blood pressure. Conclusion Since PCOS is a metabolic disorder, choosing the best combination of antidiabetic drugs in the clinical course of PCOS patients will be very important. Today, it seems that we need a new metabolic approach for better treatment of the metabolic aspects of these patients.",
