        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To compare the clinical effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection, standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and simple analgesics for the early treatment of lateral epicondylitis in primary care. Design: Multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Setting: 23 general practices in North Staffordshire and South Cheshire. Participants: 164 patients aged 18-70 years presenting with a new episode of lateral epicondylitis. Interventions: Local injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone plus lignocaine, naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two weeks, or placebo tablets. All participants received a standard advice sheet and co-codamol as required. Main outcome measures: Participants' global assessment of improvement (five point scale) at four weeks. Pain, function, and \u201cmain complaint\u201d measured on 10 point Likert scales at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Results: Over 2 years, 53 subjects were randomised to injection, 53 to naproxen, and 58 to placebo. Prognostic variables were similar between groups at baseline. At 4 weeks, 48 patients (92%) in the injection group were completely better or improved compared with 30 (57%) in the naproxen group (P<0.001) and 28 (50%) in the placebo group (P<0.001). At 12 months, 43 patients (84%) in the injection group had pain scores \u22643 compared with 45 (85%) in the naproxen group and 44 (82%) in the placebo group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Early local corticosteroid injection is effective for lateral epicondylitis. Outcome at one year was good in all groups, and effective early treatment does not seem to influence this. Key messages Most lateral epicondylitis is managed by general practitioners, but optimum treatment is unclear This large pragmatic randomised trial showed that corticosteroid injection was significantly better than non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or placebo tablets at four weeks A two week course of a standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory was no better than placebo A few patients who respond well initially to injection relapse by six months. Long term outcome was good, irrespective of initial treatment allocation",

        "abstract": "Lateral epicondylitis is the most common affliction of the elbow. It occurs in middle-aged individuals and is self-limiting in the majority of cases. The etiology of the condition is not completely understood. Based on clinical, histologic, and imaging data, the tendinous origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis is the most likely site of pathology. A variety of procedures have been described to treat epicondylitis. Most commonly, the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon origin is debrided with either open or arthroscopic methods. Both techniques require a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the extensor tendon origin at the humeral epicondyle. Improvement is reported in the majority of cases treated surgically, although residual symptoms persist in a substantial number of patients.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe treatment of tendinosis of elbow can be challenging, yet rewarding. Nevertheless, for the patients who failed conservative management and develop persistent recalcitrant symptoms, surgical intervention should be considered. The hypothesis of this study is iliac bone marrow plasma injection after arthroscopic debridement of degenerative tissue will bring along biological cure. Thus, it will not only reduce pain but also improve function in patients with resistant elbow tendonitis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTwenty-four patients (26 elbows) with significant persistent pain for a mean of 15 months, despite of standard rehabilitation protocol and a variety of other nonsurgical modalities were treated arthroscopically. We applied autologous iliac bone marrow plasma injection following arthroscopic debridement. This material is produced by centrifugation of iliac bone marrow blood at 1,800 rpm for 20 to 30 minutes. Patients were allowed full range of motion (ROM) exercise after 2 to 3 days. Cytokine analyses for this injective material were done. Outcome was rated by postoperative sonography, visual analog pain scores (VAS) and Mayo elbow performance scores (MEPS) at 8 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Informed consent had been obtained from the subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Chosun University Hospital, Korea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll patients in this study noted improvement both in their VAS and MEPS. No complication occurred in any patient. Evidence of tendon healing was observed in postoperative sonographic examination. Predominant cytokines of this study were interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and RANTES.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBiologic treatments in orthopaedics are just beginning to evolve. In the present investigation, the injection of iliac bone marrow plasma after arthroscopic debridement in severe elbow tendinosis demonstrated early recovery of daily activities and clear improvement.",

        "title": "Novel approaches for the management of tendinopathy.",
        "abstract": "Tendinopathy is a failed healing response of the tendon. Despite an abundance of therapeutic options, very few randomized prospective, placebo-controlled trials have been carried out to assist physicians in choosing the best evidence-based management. Eccentric exercises have been proposed to promote collagen fiber cross-link formation within the tendon, thereby facilitating tendon remodeling. Overall results suggest a trend for a positive effect of eccentric exercises, with no reported adverse effects. Combining eccentric training and shock wave therapy produces higher success rates compared with eccentric loading alone or shock wave therapy alone. The use of injectable substances such as platelet-rich plasma, autologous blood, polidocanol, corticosteroids, and aprotinin in and around tendons is popular, but there is minimal clinical evidence to support their use. The aim of operative treatment is to excise fibrotic adhesions, remove areas of failed healing, and make multiple longitudinal incisions in the tendon to detect intratendinous lesions and to restore vascularity and possibly stimulate the remaining viable cells to initiate cell matrix response and healing. New operative procedures include endoscopy, electrocoagulation, and minimally invasive stripping. The aim of these techniques is to disrupt the abnormal neoinnervation to interfere with the pain sensation caused by tendinopathy. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to better clarify the best therapeutic options for the management of tendinopathy.",

Diagnostic imaging studies revealed the presence of spinal nerve root impingement by large facet synovial cysts.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES\nActivity modification, gabapentinoid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications were unsuccessful in ameliorating either patient's symptoms. One patient had been receiving ongoing lumbar chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy despite the onset of a progressive neurological deficit. Both patients eventually required surgery to remove the cyst and decompress the affected spinal nerve roots.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with acute sciatica who develop a progressive neurological deficit while under care, require prompt referral for axial imaging and surgical consultation. Primary care spine clinicians need to be aware of lumbar facet synovial cysts as a possible cause of acute sciatica and the associated increased risk of the patient developing a progressive neurological deficit.",

Surgical osteosynthesis, with multiple lag screws and a neutralization plate, was performed for anatomical reconstruction. Despite a good gait condition, delayed bone consolidation and a bone gap were evident on follow up radiographic evaluations. Due to delayed healing, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was injected on the surface of the tibia. Increased bone consolidation was evident on radiographs one month after the PRP injection. Progressive filling of both the fracture lines and bone gap continued during the six-month follow up. Clinical outcome was excellent. Autologous PRP should be considered as a practical adjuvant therapy in bone healing process in donkeys.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) accelerates wound healing, as it is an excellent source of growth factors. PRP was separated from whole human blood by centrifugation. PRP powder and wafers were prepared by lyophilization, with the wafers prepared using sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na CMC). The PRP wafers showed porous structures, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and the ability of the wafer to absorb exudates and thus promote wound healing was tested with the hydration capacity test. The platelet count was tested and indicated that the presence of PRP in the wafers had no effect on the platelet count. An antimicrobial activity test was carried out, showing that PRP had antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with lyophilized PRP powder and PRP-free wafers, PRP wafers showed the highest percent of wound size reduction on induced wounds in rats. Histopathological examination of rat skin showed that the PRP wafers achieved the shortest healing time, followed by the lyophilized PRP powder and finally the PRP-free wafers. The present study revealed that PRP can be formulated as a wafer, which is a promising pharmaceutical delivery system that can be used for enhanced wound-healing activity and improved the ease of application compared to lyophilized PRP powder.",

        "abstract": "The complex biology of platelets and their involvement in tissue repair and inflammation have inspired the development of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapies for a broad array of medical needs. However, clinical advances are hampered by the fact that PRP products, doses and treatment protocols are far from being standardized. Freeze-drying PRP (FD-PRP) preserves platelet function, cytokine concentration and functionality, and has been proposed as a consistent method for product standardization and fabrication of an off-the-shelf product with improved stability and readiness for future uses. Here, we present the current state of experimental and clinical FD-PRP research in the different medical areas in which PRP has potential to meet prevailing medical needs. A systematic search, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, showed that research is mostly focused on wound healing, i.e., developing combination products for ulcer management. Injectable hydrogels are investigated for lumbar fusion and knee conditions. In dentistry, combination products permit slow kinetics of growth factor release and functionalized membranes for guided bone regeneration.",

        "abstract": "The serum fraction of platelet-rich fibrin (hyperacute serum) has been shown to improve cartilage cell proliferation in in vitro osteoarthritic knee joint models. We hypothesize that hyperacute serum may be a potential regenerative therapeutic for osteoarthritic knees. In this study, the cytokine milieu at the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic knee joints exposed to hyperacute serum intraarticular injections was investigated. Patients with knee osteoarthritis received three injections of autologous hyperacute serum; synovial fluid was harvested before each injection and clinical monitoring was followed-up for 6 months. Forty osteoarthritic-related cytokines, growth factors and structural proteins from synovial fluid were quantified and analysed by Multivariate Factor Analysis. Hyperacute serum provided symptomatic relief regarding pain and joint stability for OA patients. Both patients \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout effusion knees\u201d had improved VAS, KOOS and Lysholm-Tegner scores 6 months after of hyperacute serum treatment. Synovial fluid analysis revealed two main clusters of proteins reacting together as a group, showing strong and significant correlations with their fluctuation patterns after hyperacute serum treatment. In conclusion, hyperacute serum has a positive effect in alleviating symptoms of osteoarthritic knees. Moreover, identified protein clusters may allow the prediction of protein expression, reducing the number of investigated proteins in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Nanotechnology has acquired significance in dental applications, but its safety regarding human health is still questionable due to the chemicals utilized during various synthesis procedures. Titanium nanoparticles were produced by three novel routes, including Bacillus subtilis, Cassia fistula and hydrothermal heating, and then characterized for shape, phase state, size, surface roughness, elemental composition, texture and morphology by SEM, TEM, XRD, AFM, DRS, DLS and FTIR. These novel titanium nanoparticles were tested for cytotoxicity through the MTT assay. L929 mouse fibroblast cells were used to test the cytotoxicity of the prepared titanium nanoparticles. Cell suspension of 10% DMEM with 1 \u00d7 104 cells was seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated. Titanium nanoparticles were used in a 1 mg/mL concentration. Control (water) and titanium nanoparticles stock solutions were prepared with 28 microliters of MTT dye and poured into each well, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Readings were recorded on day 1, day 15, day 31, day 41 and day 51. The results concluded that titanium nanoparticles produced by Bacillus subtilis remained non-cytotoxic because cell viability was >90%. Titanium nanoparticles produced by Cassia fistula revealed mild cytotoxicity on day 1, day 15 and day 31 because cell viability was 60\u201390%, while moderate cytotoxicity was found at day 41 and day 51, as cell viability was 30\u201360%. Titanium nanoparticles produced by hydrothermal heating depicted mild cytotoxicity on day 1 and day 15; moderate cytotoxicity on day 31; and severe cytotoxicity on day 41 and day 51 because cell viability was less than 30% (p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Bacterial infections can often lead to complications in wound healing. The overuse of antimicrobial drugs can cause antimicrobial resistance, making it necessary to find alternative therapeutic options for wound care. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has been used for tissue regeneration, but until now, its application for antimicrobial activity has been limited to periodontal pathogens. In this study, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial effects of canine PRF (cPRF) against bacteria from the clinical wound of a dog and to investigate the mechanism of its antibacterial activity, which involves the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results showed that cPRF had a significant antimicrobial effect against Escherichia coli between 4 and 24 h, resulting from the release of ROS. Based on these findings, cPRF, a rich source of growth factors that accelerate the wound healing process, could be used as a biological material for wound infection treatment, benefiting veterinary medicine. Abstract Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), which has been shown to promote wound and bone regeneration, has demonstrated antimicrobial properties against periodontal pathogens. However, in veterinary medicine, no study has determined the antimicrobial effects of canine platelet-rich fibrin (cPRF). Therefore, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial effect of cPRF against E. coli and S. pseudintermedius found in dogs\u2019 wounds and against the standard strain S. aureus. Additionally, the mechanism of the existing antibacterial activity of cPRF, which involves the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), was tested. Blood samples from six dogs were processed for cPRF. The antimicrobial properties of three groups (growth control, cPRF, and drug control) were evaluated at 0.5, 4, 8, and 24 h using a time\u2013kill assay. The killing mechanisms involving ROS were evaluated using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to suppress ROS production in PRF (PRF-SR). Subsequently, tests for antimicrobial properties and ROS generation were compared to those of the growth control and cPRF groups. The results showed that cPRF had significant antimicrobial properties against E. coli but no antimicrobial properties against S. pseudintermedius. After the ROS suppression, PRF-SR did not show an antimicrobial property against E. coli. Moreover, cPRF-treated bacteria exhibited significantly greater intracellular ROS than PRF-SR. In conclusion, canine PRF showed an antimicrobial effect against E. coli, and its antibacterial mechanism was related to releasing ROS.",
