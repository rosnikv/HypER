        "title": "Budesonide in collagenous colitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with histologic follow-up.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nCollagenous colitis (CC) is a well-described entity causing chronic diarrhea and characteristic histologic findings. Several treatment options have been suggested, but no controlled data are available. We conducted a placebo-controlled trial to show the clinical and histologic effects of budesonide in CC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 14) or budesonide 9 mg daily (n = 14) for 8 weeks. Patients were evaluated clinically, and blinded biopsy specimens were analyzed from fixed locations at weeks 0 and 8. Clinical response was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in the disease activity score (number of bowel movements in the last 7 days). At week 8, nonresponders received open-label budesonide for the next 8-week period; responders discontinued treatment and were followed up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree patients discontinued the study prematurely. Intention-to-treat analysis showed clinical response in 8 of 14 patients in the budesonide group compared with 3 of 14 responders for placebo (P = 0.05) after 8 weeks of blinded therapy, together with improved stool consistency. Histologically, there was no change in the mean thickness of the collagen band but a significant decrease of the lamina propria infiltrate in the budesonide group (P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is efficacious in inducing short-term clinical response in CC with significant reduction of the histologic infiltrate in the lamina propria.",

        "abstract": "Microscopic colitis (MC) encompasses the two morphologically distinct entities of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC). MC was first described less than 30 years ago but is presently recognized as a relatively common cause of chronic diarrhea in the adult population. Remarkably, up to 10% of adults who have a colonoscopy for the investigation of chronic diarrhea, and have endoscopically normal appearing mucosa, may have MC. Patients with MC generally present with chronic diarrhea, which can be associated with cramping and bloating. Endoscopic and radiological examinations are usually normal. Histological assessment reveals inflammation consisting predominantly of lymphocytic infiltration, and a thickened subepithelial collagen band is diagnostic of CC. Both LC and CC can be associated with autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, diabetes, arthritis and thyroiditis, yet the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis remain unclear. Emerging studies suggest that a stepwise approach be taken in the medical management of MC. This approach includes antidiarrheal agents and stopping of any offending agents; budesonide or bismuth subsalicylate; and cholestyramine or 5-acetylsalicylic acid agents. In resistant cases, oral corticosteroids and other immune modulatory therapy have been used.",

        "abstract": "Background Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA\u20105 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB\u201012 (AB\u2010Cap\u201010) in patients with CC. Materials and Methods Patients with CC and diarrhea were in a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled study randomized (2:1) to AB\u2010Cap\u201010 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550%. Secondary end points were changes in bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal bloating and pain. Results Twenty\u2010nine patients were randomized: 21 to probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of \u226550% occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18\u201384) to 23 (range 11\u201356; P < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days (range 0\u20137 days) to 1 day (range 0\u20137 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group. Conclusions AB\u2010Cap\u201010 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB\u2010Cap\u201010 group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease course of CC.",

        "abstract": "Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.",

        "title": "Bacterial Teichoic Acids Reverse Predominant IL-12 Production Induced by Certain Lactobacillus Strains into Predominant IL-10 Production via TLR2-Dependent ERK Activation in Macrophages",
        "abstract": "The cytokine response of macrophages to probiotic lactobacilli varies between strains, and the balance of IL-10/IL-12 production is crucial for determination of the direction of the immune response. To clarify the mechanism whereby Lactobacillus strains differentially induce production of IL-10 and IL-12, we examined the potential relationship between cytokine production and MAPK activation. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, Lactobacillus plantarum potently induced IL-10 but weakly induced IL-12 production, whereas L. casei potently induced IL-12 but weakly induced IL-10 production. Kinetic analysis of the activation of ERK, p38, and JNK showed that L. plantarum induced a more rapid and intense activation of MAPKs, especially of ERK, than L. casei. A selective blockade of ERK activation induced by L. plantarum resulted in a decrease in IL-10 production and a simultaneous increase in IL-12 production. Interestingly, when macrophages were stimulated with a combination of L. plantarum and L. casei, IL-10 production was induced synergistically. We identified cell wall teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid as key factors for triggering the synergistic induction of IL-10 production, although these teichoic acids alone only weakly induced IL-10 production. The effect of these teichoic acids on IL-10 production was mediated by TLR2-dependent ERK activation. Our data demonstrate that activation of the ERK pathway is critical for determination of the balance of the IL-10/IL-12 response of macrophages to lactobacilli and that predominant IL-12 production induced by certain lactobacilli such as L. casei can be converted into predominant IL-10 production when stimulated in the presence of teichoic acids.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nto investigate the effect of Bifidobacterium infantis (B. infantis) on the T cell subsets and in attenuating the severity of experimental colitis in mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNormal BALB/c mice were fed different doses of B. infantis for 3 wk, and T cell subsets and related cytokine profiles in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were detected by flow cytometry and real-time RT-PCR. Colitis was induced by administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. Before colitis induction, mice were fed high dose B. infantis for 3 wk. Cytokine profiles in MLNs and histological changes of colonic tissue were examined 6 d after colitis induction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant change in cytokine profiles was observed in normal mice fed low dose B. infantis. However, Th1-related cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p40), Th17-related transcription factor and cytokines (ROR\u03b3t, IL-21, IL-23), regulatory T cell (Treg)-related transcription factor and cytokines (Foxp3, IL-10) were increased in normal mice fed high dose B. infantis. Furthermore, flow cytometry assay showed B. infantis increased the numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs and Th17 cells in MLNs. Colitis was successfully induced by TNBS in mice, characterized by colonic inflammation and aberrant Th1 and Th17 responses. Feeding high dose B. infantis for 3 wk before colitis induction decreased the inflammatory cell infiltration and goblet cell depletion and restored the intestinal epithelium. In addition, B. infantis feeding reduced Th1-related cytokines (T-bet, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) and Th17-related cytokines (IL-12p40, ROR\u03b3t, IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-23), and increased Treg-related molecules (Foxp3, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2) in colitis mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nB. infantis effectively attenuates TNBS-induced colitis by decreasing Th1 and Th17 responses and increasing Foxp3(+) Treg response in the colonic mucosa.",

        "abstract": "Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play important role in regulation of immune responses to self-antigens. Alterations in frequency and function of Tregs have been reported in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) subjects. Tregs have the potential to prevent destruction of pancreatic beta cells by targeting effector T-cells (Teff) and other immune cells causing inflammation. Therefore, strategies to increase Treg cell numbers and function are being explored as potential immunotherapeutic approaches in treating T1D. Today, several groups are involved in exploring different Treg cell types, sources, induction procedures and experimental systems in pursuit of generation of highly efficacious and stable Tregs for their clinical applications. Various protocols have been developed for the induction and expansion of islet antigen specific Tregs and polyclonal Tregs. Studies have shown that antigen specific Tregs are required at less number and are more efficient than polyclonal Tregs in suppressing autoimmune diabetes and they do not cause generalized immune suppression. Alternatively, generation of colonic Tregs (cTregs) has also gathered attention in recent years as an approach to limit pancreatic inflammation via gut induced tolerance. With a definitive treatment for T1D still elusive, application of Tregs as a part of combination therapy seems promising in treatment of T1D.",
