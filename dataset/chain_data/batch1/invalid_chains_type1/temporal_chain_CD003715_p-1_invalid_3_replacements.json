        "abstract": "Until a cure for Crohn's disease(s) is found, strategies that prolong the time spent in remission offer the greatest hope for reducing the morbidity and significant social costs associated with the disease. Medical therapy to date has been disappointing, and the search for a safe, effective therapy that could be offered at low cost continues. The aminosalicylates, so effective in ulcerative colitis, have shown, at best, minimal efficacy in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Conventional corticosteroids are not effective, and any reduction in time to relapse for budesonide-treated patients is measured in weeks not months. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are effective in maintaining remission, but all three have significant side effects. Antibiotics may have a role to play. Biological therapy may be considered, but the issues of cost and long-term safety require evaluation. Future studies should segregate patients into two groups, those with a medically induced remission and patients whose concern is the prevention of postoperative recurrence.",

        "title": "Maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease",
        "abstract": "The aetiology of Crohn's disease is unknown and therefore no curative treatments are available for the disease. The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by recurrent flare\u2010ups of symptoms. Several drug treatments are effective in inducing clinical remission. However, no drug treatments are available in order to prevent clinical relapses, although several drug regimens may delay clinical flare\u2010ups. Crohn's disease treatment for maintaining clinical remission needs to be tailored in relation to specific characteristics of each patient. The frequency of clinical relapse indeed shows marked variations in subgroups of patients, as the likelyhood of relapse is higher in patients in clinical remission for less than 6\u2003months. Treatment strategies for maintaining remission may therefore differ among inactive patients. In chronically active, steroid\u2010dependent or steroid\u2010refractory Crohn's disease patients immunomodulatory drugs (azathioprine 2\u20132.5\u2003mg/kg by mouth, 6\u2010mercaptopurine 1\u20131.5\u2003mg/kg by mouth, or methotrexate 15\u201325\u2003mg/i.m./week) should be added to oral mesalazine (2.4\u2003g/day), while in long\u2010term inactive Crohn's disease patients mesalazine alone may be effective in delaying relapse. Recently, treatment with anti\u2010tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies (Infliximab or CDP571) has shown efficacy in delaying relapse in responsive patients. One other issue which needs to be considered before selecting drug treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease, is that Crohn's disease activity is currently assessed on the basis of standard clinical scores which may not appropriately reflect the biological activity of the disease. Clinical remission as defined by standardized scores may include heterogeneous subgroups of patients showing different endoscopic and histological activity or persistence of activated immunocompetent cells within the gut. Several sub\u2010clinical markers of relapse have indeed been reported in quiescent Crohn's disease, although their usefulness in clinical practice in currently uncertain.",

Although no available pharmacologic data support the assumption that the bioavailability of methotrexate is diminished in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, most such patients receive methotrexate parenterally. Methods: The oral bioavailability of methotrexate was determined in 11 pediatric patients being treated with methotrexate for inflammatory bowel disease. Serial plasma methotrexate concentrations were determined after equal subcutaneous and oral doses of methotrexate. Results: The mean bioavailability of methotrexate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was 84% \u00b1 38%. Interpatient variability in drug exposure was similar after oral and subcutaneous administration. Conclusions: The bioavailability of methotrexate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is no different from that observed in other disease states. Subcutaneous administration of methotrexate does not appear to decrease the interpatient variability in drug exposure. There is no sound pharmacologic basis for favoring administration of methotrexate via the subcutaneous route for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "title": "Role of Methotrexate in the Management of Crohn Disease",
        "abstract": "Background: The majority of children with Crohn disease (CD) are likely to need some form of immunomodulatory therapy to maintain remission and to avoid long-term corticosteroid usage. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, some children are unresponsive or intolerant to these drugs. Biological agents like infliximab are being increasingly used in these circumstances, but long-term safety has yet to be established. Methotrexate has been shown to induce and maintain remission in CD in many adult studies, but pediatric data are limited. The present report describes our experience of using methotrexate in CD in children. Patients and Methods: All children with CD treated with methotrexate were identified by the departmental database. Case records were reviewed for site of disease, Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, medications, time to achieve remission, duration of remission, and complications. Results: A total of 10 children received methotrexate, 7 of whom were female and 3 of whom were male. All of the children had colonic involvement and had active disease despite previous standard medical treatments. Seven children exhibited remission with methotrexate treatment. Median time to achieve remission was 12 weeks and median duration of remission was 21 months to the point of assessment. One child had transient increase of alanine aminotransferase levels and another developed neutropenia, which remitted with dose reduction. None needed discontinuation of methotrexate treatment. Conclusions: Methotrexate is effective and well tolerated in children with CD. It should be considered in those patients who do not experience a remission with standard medications because it may avoid the use of biological agents and their potential uncertain long-term side effects.",

        "title": "Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and the Risk of Lymphoma: Should We Revise Our Treatment Strategies?",
        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are lifelong inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases starting in about one third of patients during childhood. Treatment strategies aim to control this chronic inflammatory process. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of IBD, immunosuppressive agents (mainly against TNF\u03b1 directed) as well as biological drugs are more and more often used. This therapeutic approach clearly improved the clinical condition of the majority of patients with IBD. However, with this more aggressive treatment strategy, safety concerns clearly arise. Recently, the description of a series of a particularly severe form of T cell lymphoma in pediatric and young adult patients with IBD under immunomodulator and biological combination therapy raised the question of the risks of treatment-induced side effects or complications. As reviewed in the present article, there is a slightly increased risk of not only lymphoma development in IBD patients, potentially related to the inflammatory process, but also to the use of immunosuppressive therapies. On the basis of the literature data, we reanalyzed current treatment strategies for children with moderate-to-severe IBD, who are candidates to receive immunomodulator and/or biological agents potentially accelerating the risk of lymphoma development. Comparative clinical studies in IBD are still missing; however, it is prudent to think about adapting immunosuppressive therapies to the inflammatory process of the underlying disorder and if possible to reduce them to monotherapy. Alternative treatment strategies for heavy immunosuppression exist (eg, enteral nutrition in Crohn disease or colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis) and should be considered whenever appropriate. There is a major need for comparative studies before evidence-based guidelines can be established for safest and best treatment strategies of pediatric patients with IBD.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aim: Thiopurines are a common, effective means of maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). Methotrexate (MTX) may be considered for those intolerant of or unresponsive to thiopurines. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of MTX as maintenance therapy in patients previously treated with thiopurines. Patients and Methods: All of the patients at Nationwide Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2007 with an International Classification of Diseases code indicative of CD were identified. Patients with a diagnosis of CD, a history of prior thiopurine use, no current infliximab therapy, and at least 6 months of follow-up after MTX initiation were included. The primary outcome was defined as steroid-/infliximab-free remission determined by the physician global assessment at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included subsequent treatment with infliximab and/or corticosteroids, rate of discontinuation of MTX, and adverse events (AEs). Results: Twenty-seven patients (17 boys, 63%) with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.3 \u00b1 0.7 years and mean disease duration of 1.49 \u00b1 0.3 years were identified. Indications for MTX included nonresponse to thiopurines, AE, and poor adherence to thiopurines. At 6 and 12 months, 13 of 27 patients (48.1%) and 9 of 27 patients (33.3%), respectively, were in steroid-/infliximab-free remission. A total of 10 patients (37.0%) required infliximab therapy during the 12-month period and 5 patients discontinued MTX. Nausea was the most commonly reported AE. Transient transaminase elevation occurred in 4 patients and transient leukopenia in 2 patients. Conclusions: MTX can be effective as maintenance therapy for patients with pediatric CD previously intolerant of or unresponsive to thiopurines; however, greater than one third of this cohort required escalation to antitumor necrosis factor therapy within 12 months following MTX initiation. MTX was well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years, including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life, including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ substantially from adult-onset disease. Various treatment options are available for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst preventing disease or treatment-related complications.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: ImproveCareNow (ICN) is the largest pediatric learning health system in the nation and started as a quality improvement collaborative. To test the feasibility and validity of using ICN data for clinical research, we evaluated the effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (anti-TNF\u03b1) agents in the management of pediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Data were collected in 35 pediatric gastroenterology practices (April 2007 to March 2012) and analyzed as a sequence of nonrandomized trials. Patients who had moderate to severe CD were classified as initiators or non-initiators of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. Among 4130 patients who had pediatric CD, 603 were new users and 1211 were receiving anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy on entry into ICN. RESULTS: During a 26-week follow-up period, rate ratios obtained from Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for patient and disease characteristics and concurrent medications, were 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20\u20131.96) for clinical remission and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.33\u20132.29) for corticosteroid-free remission. The rate ratio for corticosteroid-free remission was comparable to the estimate produced by the adult SONIC study, which was a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. The number needed to treat was 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4\u201311.1) for clinical remission and 5.0 (95% CI, 3.4\u201310.0) for corticosteroid-free remission. CONCLUSIONS: In routine pediatric gastroenterology practice settings, anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy was effective at achieving clinical and corticosteroid-free remission for patients who had Crohn disease. Using data from the ICN learning health system for the purpose of observational research is feasible and produces valuable new knowledge.",

Although very different, the approaches presented in this chapter are all based on assumptions about data, causal relationships, and biases. For instance, regression approaches assume that the relationship between the treatment, outcome, and other variables is properly specified, all of the variables are available for analysis (i.e., no unobserved confounders) and measured without error, and that the error term is independent and identically distributed. The instrumental variables approach requires identifying an instrument that is related to the assignment of treatment but otherwise has no direct on the outcome. Propensity score methods approaches, on the other hand, assume that there are no unobserved confounders. The epidemiological designs discussed also make assumptions, for instance that individuals can serve as their own control. To properly address these assumptions, analysts should conduct sensitivity analyses within the assumptions of each method to assess the potential impact of what cannot be observed. Researchers also should analyze the same data with different analytical approaches that make alternative assumptions, and to apply the same methods to different data sets. Finally, different analytical methods, each subject to different biases, should be used in combination and together with different designs, to limit the potential for bias in the final results.",

This is one of the largest clinical metaproteomic studies to date, and the first metaproteomic study addressing the gut microbiome in MRE colonized acute leukemia patients. Based on this substantial data set, we discuss major current limitations in clinical metaproteomic data analysis to provide guidance to researchers in the field. Notably, the results show that public metagenome databases are incomplete and that sample-specific metagenomes improve results. Furthermore, biological variation is tremendous which challenges clinical study designs and argues that longitudinal measurements of individual patients are a valuable future addition to the analysis of patient cohorts.",

To investigate if lifestyle-induced weight loss (WL) may modulate the gut microbiome composition and its interaction with the host on a functional level, we analyzed the fecal metaproteome of 33 individuals with metabolic syndrome in a longitudinal study before and after lifestyle-induced WL in a well-defined cohort. The 6-month WL intervention resulted in reduced BMI (\u221213.7%), improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, \u221246.1%), and reduced levels of circulating hsCRP (\u221239.9%), indicating metabolic syndrome reversal. The metaprotein spectra revealed a decrease of human proteins associated with gut inflammation. Taxonomic analysis revealed only minor changes in the bacterial composition with an increase of the families Desulfovibrionaceae, Leptospiraceae, Syntrophomonadaceae, Thermotogaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae. Yet we detected an increased abundance of microbial metaprotein spectra that suggest an enhanced hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates. Hence, lifestyle-induced WL was associated with reduced gut inflammation and functional changes of human and microbial enzymes for carbohydrate hydrolysis while the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome remained almost stable. The metaproteomics workflow has proven to be a suitable method for monitoring inflammatory changes in the fecal metaproteome.",

Due to diet and liver alteration, the axis between liver and gut is disturbed, resulting in gut microbiome alterations. Consequently, detecting these gut microbiome alterations represents a promising strategy for early NASH and HCC detection. We analyzed medical parameters and the fecal metaproteome of 19 healthy controls, 32 NASH patients, and 29 HCC patients, targeting the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers. Here, NASH and HCC resulted in increased inflammation status and shifts within the composition of the gut microbiome. An increased abundance of kielin/chordin, E3 ubiquitin ligase, and nucleophosmin 1 represented valuable fecal biomarkers, indicating disease-related changes in the liver. Although a single biomarker failed to separate NASH and HCC, machine learning-based classification algorithms provided an 86% accuracy in distinguishing between controls, NASH, and HCC.

A high unmet need exists for noninvasive biomarkers in IBD to monitor changes in disease activity\u00a0and guide treatment decisions. Stool is an easily accessed, disease proximal matrix in IBD, however the composition of the IBD fecal proteome remains poorly characterized.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nA data-independent acquisition LC-MS/MS approach was used to profile the human fecal proteome in two independent cohorts (Cohort 1: healthy n\u00a0=\u00a05, UC n\u00a0=\u00a05, CD n\u00a0=\u00a05, Cohort 2: healthy n\u00a0=\u00a020, UC n\u00a0=\u00a010, and CD n\u00a0=\u00a010) to identify noninvasive biomarkers reflective of disease activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\n688 human proteins were quantified, with 523 measured in both cohorts.
