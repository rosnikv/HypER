        "title": "Testosterone replacement and resistance exercise in HIV-infected men with weight loss and low testosterone levels.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nPrevious studies of testosterone supplementation in HIV-infected men failed to demonstrate improvement in muscle strength. The effects of resistance exercise combined with testosterone supplementation in HIV-infected men are unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of testosterone replacement with and without resistance exercise on muscle strength and body composition in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels and weight loss.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nPlacebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from September 1995 to July 1998 at a general clinical research center.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nSixty-one HIV-infected men aged 18 to 50 years with serum testosterone levels of less than 12.1 nmol/L (349 ng/dL) and weight loss of 5% or more in the previous 6 months, 49 of whom completed the study.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: placebo, no exercise (n = 14); testosterone enanthate (100 mg/wk intramuscularly), no exercise (n = 17); placebo and exercise (n = 15); or testosterone and exercise (n = 15). Treatment duration was 16 weeks.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nChanges in muscle strength, body weight, thigh muscle volume, and lean body mass compared among the 4 treatment groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBody weight increased significantly by 2.6 kg (P<.001) in men receiving testosterone alone and by 2.2 kg (P = .02) in men who exercised alone but did not change in men receiving placebo alone (-0.5 kg; P = .55) or testosterone and exercise (0.7 kg; P = .08). Men treated with testosterone alone, exercise alone, or both experienced significant increases in maximum voluntary muscle strength in leg press (range, 22%-30%), leg curls (range, 18%-36%), bench press (range, 19%-33%), and latissimus pulls (range, 17%-33%). Gains in strength in all exercise categories were greater in men assigned to the testosterone-exercise group or to the exercise-alone group than in those assigned to the placebo-alone group. There was a greater increase in thigh muscle volume in men receiving testosterone alone (mean change, 40 cm3; P<.001 vs zero change) or exercise alone (62 cm3; P = .003) than in men receiving placebo alone (5 cm3; P = .70). Average lean body mass increased by 2.3 kg (P = .004) and 2.6 kg (P<.001), respectively, in men who received testosterone alone or testosterone and exercise but did not change in men receiving placebo alone (0.9 kg; P = .21). Hemoglobin levels increased in men receiving testosterone but not in those receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data suggest that testosterone and resistance exercise promote gains in body weight, muscle mass, muscle strength, and lean body mass in HIV-infected men with weight loss and low testosterone levels. Testosterone and exercise together did not produce greater gains than either intervention alone.",

        "title": "Testosterone supplementation in older men: a rational idea whose time has not yet come.",
        "abstract": "Forty years after the introduction of estrogens, the debate over the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women is still not entirely settled. In contrast, the issues of testosterone replacement in older men are just beginning to be addressed. There is agreement that total, free, and bioavailable testosterone (ie, not bound by sex hormone-binding globulin) levels decline progressively with advancing age (Harman and Tsitouras, 1980, 1982; Murono et al, 1982; Nieschlag et al, 1982; Zumoff et al, 1982; Bremner and Prinz, 1983; Davidson et al, 1983; Nankin and Calkins, 1986; Tenover et al, 1987; Gray et al, 1991; Vermeulen, 1991; Simon et al, 1992; Rudman and Shetty, 1994; Morley et al, 1997; Zmuda et al, 1997; Harmon et al, in press), and that many of the physiological changes that occur with advancing age such as loss of bone and muscle mass; increased fat mass; impairment of physical, sexual, and cognitive functions; loss of body hair; and decreased hemoglobin levels, are similar to those associated with androgen deficiency in young men. However, the beneficial effects of testosterone replacement on health-related outcomes in older men with low testosterone levels have yet to be demonstrated, and the risks of long-term testosterone administration, particularly the risks of prostate cancer and heart disease, remain unknown. Therefore, it is premature to make a general recommendation about testosterone supplementation in older men. Despite the paucity of efficacy and safety data, the sales of testosterone and other androgenic products have witnessed explosive growth recently",

        "abstract": "Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is a rare congenital red cell aplasia that presents in infancy. The exact molecular mechanism of ineffective erythropoiesis and red cell aplasia remains unclear, rendering targeted therapy elusive. The mainstay treatment of DBA is with regular blood transfusion and long-term corticosteroids, both of which have long-term side effects. We report a case of DBA successfully treated with danazol, a synthetic androgen, and suggest that danazol be considered as a viable option in patients who become refractory to steroids and are considered high risk or unfit for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

        "title": "Ribosomopathies: New Therapeutic Perspectives",
        "abstract": "Ribosomopathies are a group of rare diseases in which genetic mutations cause defects in either ribosome biogenesis or function, given specific phenotypes. Ribosomal proteins, and multiple other factors that are necessary for ribosome biogenesis (rRNA processing, assembly of subunits, export to cytoplasm), can be affected in ribosomopathies. Despite the need for ribosomes in all cell types, these diseases result mainly in tissue-specific impairments. Depending on the type of ribosomopathy and its pathogenicity, there are many potential therapeutic targets. The present manuscript will review our knowledge of ribosomopathies, discuss current treatments, and introduce the new therapeutic perspectives based on recent research. Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia, currently treated with blood transfusion prior to steroids, could be managed with a range of new compounds, acting mainly on anemia, such as L-leucine. Treacher Collins syndrome could be managed by various treatments, but it has recently been shown that proteasomal inhibition by MG132 or Bortezomib may improve cranial skeleton malformations. Developmental defects resulting from ribosomopathies could be also treated pharmacologically after birth. It might thus be possible to treat certain ribosomopathies without using multiple treatments such as surgery and transplants. Ribosomopathies remain an open field in the search for new therapeutic approaches based on our recent understanding of the role of ribosomes and progress in gene therapy for curing genetic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal tumor that develops in the adult brain. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies related to surgical resection and chemo-radiotherapy, the overall survival of patients with GBM remains unsatisfactory. Genetic research on mutation, amplification, and deletion in GBM cells is important for understanding the biological aggressiveness, diagnosis, and prognosis of GBM. However, the efficacy of drugs targeting the genetic abnormalities in GBM cells is limited. Investigating special microenvironments that induce chemo-radioresistance in GBM cells is critical to improving the survival and quality of life of patients with GBM. GBM cells acquire and maintain stem-cell-like characteristics via their intrinsic potential and extrinsic factors from their special microenvironments. The acquisition of stem-cell-like phenotypes and aggressiveness may be referred to as a reprogramming of GBM cells. In addition to protein synthesis, deregulation of ribosome biogenesis is linked to several diseases including cancer. Ribosomal proteins possess both tumor-promotive and -suppressive functions as extra-ribosomal functions. Incorporation of ribosomes and overexpression of ribosomal protein S6 reprogram and induce stem-cell-like phenotypes in GBM cells. Herein, we review recent literature and our published data on the acquisition of aggressiveness by GBM and discuss therapeutic options through reprogramming.",

        "title": "RPL27 contributes to colorectal cancer proliferation and stemness via PLK1 signaling",
        "abstract": "Although expression of ribosomal protein L27 (RPL27) is upregulated in clinical colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue, to the best of our knowledge, the oncogenic role of RPL27 has not yet been defined. The present study aimed to investigate whether targeting RPL27 could alter CRC progression and determine whether RPL27 gains an extra-ribosomal function during CRC development. Human CRC cell lines HCT116 and HT29 were transfected with RPL27-specific small interfering RNA and proliferation was assessed in vitro and in vivo using proliferation assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and western blotting were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for RPL27 silencing-induced CRC phenotypical changes. Inhibiting RPL27 expression suppressed CRC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induced apoptotic cell death. Targeting RPL27 significantly inhibited growth of human CRC xenografts in nude mice. Notably, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which serves an important role in mitotic cell cycle progression and stemness, was downregulated in both HCT116 and HT29 cells following RPL27 silencing. RPL27 silencing reduced the levels of PLK1 protein and G2/M-associated regulators such as phosphorylated cell division cycle 25C, CDK1 and cyclin B1. Silencing of RPL27 reduced the migration and invasion abilities and sphere-forming capacity of the parental CRC cell population. In terms of phenotypical changes in cancer stem cells (CSCs), RPL27 silencing suppressed the sphere-forming capacity of the isolated CD133+ CSC population, which was accompanied by decreased CD133 and PLK1 levels. Taken together, these findings indicated that RPL27 contributed to the promotion of CRC proliferation and stemness via PLK1 signaling and RPL27 may be a useful target in a next-generation therapeutic strategy for both primary CRC treatment and metastasis prevention.",
