        "title": "Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe administration of growth hormone can attenuate the catabolic response to injury, surgery, and sepsis. However, the effect of high doses of growth hormone on the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the outcome in critically ill adults who are hospitalized for long periods is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out two prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in parallel involving 247 Finnish patients and 285 patients in other European countries who had been in an intensive care unit for 5 to 7 days and who were expected to require intensive care for at least 10 days. The patients had had cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple trauma, or acute respiratory failure. The patients received either growth hormone (mean [+/-SD] daily dose, 0.10 +/- 0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo until discharge from intensive care or for a maximum of 21 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe in-hospital mortality rate was higher in the patients who received growth hormone than in those who did not (P<0.001 for both studies). In the Finnish study, the mortality rate was 39 percent in the growth hormone group, as compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. The respective rates in the multinational study were 44 percent and 18 percent. The relative risk of death for patients receiving growth hormone was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.9) in the Finnish study and 2.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.5) in the multinational study. Among the survivors, the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital and the duration of mechanical ventilation were prolonged in the growth hormone group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with prolonged critical illness, high doses of growth hormone are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.",

        "title": "Long-term risk of gastrointestinal tumor recurrence after postoperative treatment with recombinant human growth hormone.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRecombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) promotes protein synthesis, accelerates wound healing, and maintains immune function in the catabolic state. It has also been claimed that rhGH may promote the activation of residual tumor cells, and therefore, increases the risk of tumor recurrence. This study aimed to investigate whether postoperative administration of rhGH increases the long-term risk of tumor recurrences in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery for malignancy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients (n =104) received three different doses of rhGH (0.075 IU/kg, 0.150 IU/kg, and 0.300 IU/kg) during 5 postoperative days in a placebo-controlled trial. Follow-up was performed for 56-70 months after radical tumor resection. Mean survival period and relapse-free survival were compared with the control group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nComplete data were available for 75 patients. Thirty-five percent (n = 20) of all patients treated with rhGH showed tumor recurrences in comparison to 44% (n = 8) of patients given placebo. Mean survival period for rhGH-treated patients was 46 months (median 59 months); in controls, 42 months (median 58 months). The length of relapse-free survival tended to be longer in rhGH-treated patients (2-47 months; median, 21 months) compared with the patients who were given placebo (2-18 months; median, 13 months).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results demonstrate no evidence for an increased risk of tumor recurrence after rhGH treatment for a short period of time after removal of a gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the positive metabolic effects of rhGH application can be used safely in the treatment of the postoperative catabolic state in the patient groups investigated.",

        "title": "Effect of growth hormone on muscle and liver protein synthesis in septic rats receiving glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveAdministration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to critically ill adults in an attempt to attenuate catabolism was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Possible explanations included inhibition of glutamine release from skeletal muscle and consequent restriction of splanchnic glutamine supply. In this study, we examined the effects of rhGH on plasma glutamine levels and on muscle and liver glutamine concentrations and protein synthesis rates in sepsis. We investigated the possibility that administration of supplemental glutamine might ameliorate any adverse effects of rhGH. DesignProspective study in rats rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture. SettingUniversity hospital laboratory. SubjectsA total of 78 male Wistar rats in six groups. InterventionsAnimals received 6-hr tail vein infusions, commencing 18 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, of either (a) 0.9% sodium chloride, (b) a standard parenteral nutrition (PN) solution without glutamine, or (c) an isocaloric, isonitrogenous PN solution with glutamine. PN groups received 400 &mgr;g rhGH or equivolume 0.9% sodium chloride vehicle in a divided subcutaneous and intravenous dose at PN commencement. Sacrifice was at the end of the infusion period. A further group was unoperated and uninfused and killed at 24 hrs as baseline controls. Measurements and Main ResultsGlutamine concentrations were measured by fluorometry. Protein synthesis in muscle and liver was measured by a \u201cflooding-dose\u201d technique employing l-[4-H]phenylalanine. Plasma glutamine was increased after cecal ligation and puncture except in the saline and glutamine with rhGH animals. Muscle glutamine was reduced after cecal ligation and puncture and was significantly lower in animals receiving standard PN with rhGH vs. saline alone. Liver glutamine was increased in animals receiving saline and those receiving standard PN with rhGH. PN, with or without glutamine, increased muscle protein synthesis, and the administration of rhGH tended to further increase this effect. Neither PN, glutamine, nor rhGH had an effect on the increased liver protein synthesis characteristic of sepsis. ConclusionsIn sepsis, increased muscle protein synthesis with PN and rhGH administration is not associated with increased muscle glutamine levels. Administration of rhGH does not result in reduced liver glutamine levels or rates of hepatic protein synthesis. PN containing glutamine was no more efficacious than standard PN at increasing muscle protein synthesis.",

        "title": "Expression of growth hormone receptor and its mRNA in hepatic cirrhosis.",
        "abstract": "AIM\nTo investigate the expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR) and mRNA of GHR in cirrhotic livers of rats with the intension to find the basis for application of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to patients with liver cirrhosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHepatic cirrhosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of thioacetamide intraperitoneally for 9-12 weeks. Collagenase IV was perfused in situ for isolation of hepatocytes. The expression of GHR and its mRNA in cirrhotic livers was studied with radio-ligand binding assay, RT-PCR and digital image analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne class of specific growth hormone-binding site, GHR, was detected in hepatocytes and hepatic tissue of cirrhotic livers. The binding capacity of GHR (R(T), fmol/mg protein) in rat cirrhotic liver tissue (30.8+/-1.9) was significantly lower than that in normal control (74.9+/-3.9) at the time point of the ninth week after initiation of induction of cirrhosis (n=10, P<0.05), and it decreased gradually along with the accumulation of collagen in the process of formation and development of liver cirrhosis (P<0.05). The number of binding sites (X10(4)/cell) of GHR on rat cirrhotic hepatocytes (0.86+/-0.16) was significantly lower than that (1.28+/-0.24) in control (n=10, P<0.05). The binding affinity of GHR among liver tissue, hepatocytes of various groups had no significant difference (P>0.05). The expression of GHR mRNA (riOD, pixel) in rat cirrhotic hepatic tissues (23.3+/-3.1) was also significantly lower than that (29.3+/-3.4) in normal control (n=10, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe growth hormone receptor was expressed in a reduced level in liver tissue of cirrhotic rats, and lesser expression of growth hormone receptors was found in a later stage of cirrhosis. The reduced expression of growth hormone receptor was partly due to its decreased expression on cirrhotic hepatocytes and the reduced expression of its mRNA in cirrhotic liver tissue.",

        "abstract": "Human serum albumin (HSA) is an abundant multifunctional non-glycosylated, negatively charged plasma protein, with ascribed ligand-binding and transport properties, antioxidant functions, and enzymatic activities.1 It is synthesized primarily in the liver and is thought to be a negative acute-phase protein. Physiologically, albumin is responsible for maintaining colloid osmotic pressure and may influence microvascular integrity and aspects of the inflammatory pathway, including neutrophil adhesion and the activity of cell signaling moieties. Clinically, albumin has been employed as a plasma expander in many patient populations, although the evidence from meta analyses2,3 and the recently published SAFE investigation4 suggests it does not afford a survival benefit over crystalloid solutions when administered to the critically ill. However, studies of albumin usage as a volume expander and albumin dialysis therapy in patients with liver disease have led to some encouraging results. This review aims to highlight current thinking regarding albumin therapy in the critical care and hepatological setting and also discusses other potential therapeutic applications for its use based around the complex biochemistry of this multifunctional plasma protein. Potential contraindications are also discussed.",

Design:A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Setting:Adult intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients:Fifty-five critically ill, septic patients requiring enteral feeding. Interventions:Patients received either an enteral supplement (500 mL of Intestamin, Fresenius Kabi) containing conditionally essential nutrients or a control solution via the nasogastric route for up to 10 days. Inclusion occurred within 24 hrs of intensive care unit admission. Additionally, patients received enteral feeding with an immunonutrition formula (experimental group) or standard formula (control group) initiated within 48 hrs after enrollment. Measurements and Main Results:Organ dysfunction was assessed by daily total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score over the 10-day study period in both patient groups. Patients receiving the experimental supplement showed a significantly faster decline in the regression slopes of delta daily total SOFA score over time compared with control. The difference between the regression coefficients of the two slopes was significant irrespective of the level of analysis: intent to treat \u22120.32 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; per protocol \u22120.34 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; and completers (patients receiving \u226580% of the calculated caloric target over a period of 6 days), \u22120.26 vs. \u22120.16, p = .0005.

        "title": "Congestive Heart Failure: Where Homeostasis Begets Dyshomeostasis",
        "abstract": "Despite today's standard of care, aimed at preventing homeostatic neurohormonal activation, one in every five patients recently hospitalized with congestive heart failure (CHF) will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge because of a recurrence of their symptoms and signs. In light of recent pathophysiological insights, it is now propitious to revisit CHF with a view toward complementary and evolving management strategies. CHF is a progressive systemic illness. Its features include: oxidative stress in diverse tissues; an immunostimulatory state with circulating proinflammatory cytokines; a wasting of soft tissues; and a resorption of bone. Its origins are rooted in homeostatic mechanisms gone awry to beget dyshomeostasis. For example, marked excretory losses of Ca2+ and Mg2+ accompany renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, causing ionized hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia that lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism with consequent bone resorption and a propensity to atraumatic fractures. Parathyroid hormone accounts for paradoxical intracellular Ca2+ overloading in diverse tissues and consequent systemic induction of oxidative stress. In cardiac myocytes and mitochondria, these events orchestrate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with an ensuing osmotic-based destruction of these organelles and resultant cardiomyocyte necrosis with myocardial scarring. Contemporaneous with Ca2+ and Mg2+ dyshomeostasis is hypozincemia and hyposelenemia, which compromise metalloenzyme-based antioxidant defenses, whereas hypovitaminosis D threatens Ca2+ stores needed to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. An intrinsically coupled dyshomeostasis of intracellular Ca2+ and Zn2+, representing pro-oxidant and antioxidant, respectively, is integral to regulating the mitochondrial redox state; it can be uncoupled by a Zn2+ supplement in favor of antioxidant defenses. Hence, the complementary use of nutriceuticals to nullify dyshomeostatic responses involving macro- and micronutrients should be considered. Evolving strategies with mitochondria-targeted interventions interfering with their uptake of Ca2+ or serving as selective antioxidant or mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor may also prove efficacious in the overall management of CHF.",

        "title": "Amino Acid Concentrations in Critically Ill Children Following Cardiac Surgery*",
        "abstract": "Objective: Guidelines for administering amino acids to critically ill children are largely based on uncontrolled observational studies and expert opinion, without support from rigorous outcome studies. Also, data on circulating amino acid concentrations during critical illness are scarce. We thoroughly studied the time profiles of circulating amino acid concentrations in critically ill children who received standard nutritional care according to international guidelines. Design: This is a subanalysis of pediatric critically ill patients included in a large (n = 700) randomized controlled study on intensive insulin therapy. Setting: The study was conducted at a university hospital PICU. Patients: We studied 100 patients in PICU for at least 3 days following cardiac surgery. Interventions: Patients were assigned to intensive insulin therapy targeting normal-for-age fasting blood glucose concentrations or insulin infusion only to prevent excessive hyperglycemia. Measurements and Main Results: Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured at admission, day 3, and day 7 in PICU. At admission, the concentrations of most amino acids were comparable to those reported for healthy children. Total amino acid concentrations remained stable during ICU stay, but individual amino acids showed different time profiles with eight of them showing an increase and five a decrease. Nonsurviving children had higher total amino acid concentrations and individual amino acids compared with survivors at admission and/or during ICU stay. Intensive insulin therapy lowered the concentrations of total amino acids and several individual amino acids. Neonates showed somewhat different amino acid profiles with rather increased concentrations from baseline with time in ICU for total amino acids and several individual amino acids as compared with older infants and children. Conclusions: Circulating amino acid concentrations in critically ill children after cardiac surgery differ according to survival status, blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy, and age.",

Their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains uncertain, particularly in youth. We investigated the role of BCAA and aromatic amino acids (AAA) in obesity, their relationships with novel biomarkers of CVD and response to a physical activity-based lifestyle intervention (PAL-I) in a randomized controlled study in youth with normal weight (NW) and obesity (OB).\n\n\nMETHODS\nAge (14-18 years) and Tanner stage (\u2265IV) matched youth (OB, n=15 and NW, n=6) were studied; the 15 participants with OB underwent a 3-month randomized controlled PAL-I. Circulating amino acid profile, glucose, insulin, lipids, adiponectin, retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4), fibrinogen, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 25-hydroxy vitamin-D, along with body composition (DXA) were measured at baseline and after PAL-I. Independent t-tests, analysis of covariance and mixed effect models were used for analysis of the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to NW, the concentration of various amino acids including BCAA and AAA were altered in the OB (P<0.05). BCAA and AAA showed baseline correlations with body composition and novel biomarkers of CVD, particularly inflammatory factors (p<0.05 for all). The PAL-I produced only negligible effects (p>0.05) on BCAA and AAA. Glutamine, glycine, and aspartic acid decreased with PAL-I (p<0.05 for all).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe novel finding of the BCAA-inflammation relationship along with strong correlations with nontraditional biomarkers of CVD may evoke the prospect of BCAA as a biomarkers of CVD and a potential link between obesity, T2DM and CVD.",

        "abstract": "Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes, severely affecting patients\u2019 vision and even leading to blindness. The development of DR is influenced by metabolic disturbance and genetic factors, including gene polymorphisms. The research aimed to uncover the causal relationships between blood metabolites and DR. Methods The two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to estimate the causality of blood metabolites on DR. The genetic variables for exposure were obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of 486 blood metabolites, while the genetic predictors for outcomes including all-stage DR (All DR), non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) were derived from the FinnGen database. The primary analysis employed inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and supplementary analyses were performed using MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), simple mode and weighted mode methods. Additionally, MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran\u2019s Q test, and leave-one-out analysis were also conducted to guarantee the accuracy and robustness of the results. Subsequently, we replicated the MR analysis using three additional datasets from the FinnGen database and conducted a meta-analysis to determine blood metabolites associated with DR. Finally, reverse MR analysis and metabolic pathway analysis were performed. Results The study identified 13 blood metabolites associated with All DR, 9 blood metabolites associated with NPDR and 12 blood metabolites associated with PDR. In summary, a total of 21 blood metabolites were identified as having potential causal relationships with DR. Additionally, we identified 4 metabolic pathways that are related to DR. Conclusion The research revealed a number of blood metabolites and metabolic pathways that are causally associated with DR, which holds significant importance for screening and prevention of DR. However, it is noteworthy that these causal relationships should be validated in larger cohorts and experiments.",
