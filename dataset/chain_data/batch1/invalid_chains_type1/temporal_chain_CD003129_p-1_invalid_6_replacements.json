        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe antimetabolite methotrexate has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be effective in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate may also be effective in children with resistant juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but the supporting data are from uncontrolled trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCenters in the United States and the Soviet Union participated in this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of orally administered methotrexate. Patients received one of the following treatments each week for six months: 10 mg of methotrexate per square meter of body-surface area (low dose), 5 mg of methotrexate per square meter (very low dose), or placebo. The use of prednisone (less than or equal to 10 mg per day) and two nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was also allowed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 127 children (mean age, 10.1 years) had a mean duration of disease of 5.1 years; 114 qualified for the analysis of efficacy. According to a composite index of several response variables, 63 percent of the children who received low-dose methotrexate improved, as compared with 32 percent of those in the very-low-dose group and 36 percent of those in the placebo group (P = 0.013). As compared with the placebo group, the low-dose group also had significantly larger mean reductions from base line in the number of joints with pain on motion (-11.0 vs. -7.1), the pain-severity score (-19 vs. -11.5), the number of joints with limited motion (-5.4 vs. -0.7), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (-19.0 vs. -6 mm per hour). In the methotrexate groups only three children had the drug discontinued because of mild-to-moderate side effects; none had severe toxicity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate given weekly in low doses is an effective treatment for children with resistant juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and at least in the short term this regimen is safe.",

        "title": "Accumulation of 5\u2010methyltetrahydrofolic acid and folylpolyglutamate synthetase expression by mitogen stimulated human lymphocytes",
        "abstract": "Summary. The accumulation of 5\u2010methyl[3H]tetrahydrofolic acid (5CH3[3H]FH4) by phytohaemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes (PHA\u2010L) cultured in folate free media was investigated to determine the mechanism of uptake of 5CH3FH4 and the requirement of the cells for this vitamin as assessed by monitoring de novo thymidine synthesis. When grown in 20 nm 5CH3[3H]FH4 PHA\u2010L accumulate radiolabel at a rate of 0\u00b704 pmol/h/106 cells. This doubles the endogenous folate pool of unstimulated cells (0\u00b76\u00b10\u00b716 pmol/106 cells) in about 15 h. Uptake proceeded via a saturable process, independent of a high affinity folate receptor as assessed by ligand binding and by Northern and Western blot analysis. However, transport was blocked by probenecid, which is consistent with an anion carrier mechanism. Unstimulated cells lacked folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity and did not express significant amounts of FPGS mRNA. After 48 h of mitogen stimulation there was a 4\u201310\u2010fold increase in FPGS mRNA and folylpolyglutamate formation (Glu\u22655) was essentially simultaneous with 5CH3[3H]FH4 transport. Increasing extracellular folate to 2\u03bcm only increased intracellular folate 8\u2010fold, but the length of the folylpolyglutamates decreased. The increased folate did not increase de novo thymidine synthesis compared to cells grown in physiological folate. We conclude that mitogen stimulation activates the process(es) for folate accumulation, especially FPGS, and that physiological uptake (0\u00b704 pmol/h/106 cells) is adequate for meeting the cells' need for the vitamin.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo describe the long-term outcome and determine predictors of severity among patients with oligoarticular-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a longitudinal study, 207 patients with oligoarticular-onset JIA who were referred between 1988 and 1998 were evaluated. At disease onset, selected clinical and laboratory data were collected as independent variables. A polyarticular disease course, joint erosion, uveitis, and remission were assessed as dependent variables. Longitudinal analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis with the Cox model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter 6 years of followup, the probability of a polyarticular course of disease was 50%, joint erosion was 35%, uveitis was 30%, and remission was 23% in these patients. Joint erosion was strongly associated with a polyarticular course. A high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as well as involvement of more than 1 joint or involvement of an upper limb at disease onset were predictors of disease extension. A high ESR was also a strong predictor of a destructive course, and a family history of psoriasis was predictive of uveitis occurrence. No predictive factor for remission could be identified.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOligoarticular-onset JIA is a severe disease with frequent complications. Factors predictive of severity in oligoarticular-onset JIA were identified. This could allow early identification of high-risk patient subgroups, warranting a more aggressive therapeutic approach.",

Jaw pain or dysfunction and maximal incisal opening (MIO) distance were assessed before and after injection. Fourteen patients had followup MRI studies of the TMJ 6-12 months after injection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 13 patients with symptoms of jaw pain prior to corticosteroid treatment, 10 (77%) had complete resolution of pain (P < 0.05). Prior to corticosteroid injection, MIO in all 23 patients was below age-matched normal values. After injection, the MIO was improved by at least 0.5 cm in 10 patients (43%) (P = 0.0017). Patients under 6 years of age at the time of injection showed the best response, with a postinjection MIO similar to that in age-matched controls (P = 0.2267). There was involvement of 23 TMJs in the 14 patients who had followup MRI studies; resolution of effusions was observed in 11 (48%) of the TMJs. Other than short-term facial swelling in 2 patients, there were no side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe majority of children with symptomatic TMJ arthritis improved after intraarticular corticosteroid injection. Approximately half the patients experienced significant improvement in MIO and TMJ effusion. These data suggest that corticosteroid injection may be a useful procedure for the prevention and treatment of morbidities associated with TMJ arthritis in JIA.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThis review explores the prevalence, clinical and radiographic signs, and treatment of temporomandibular joint arthritis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Recent findingsTemporomandibular joint arthritis seems to be a more frequent manifestation in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis than previously believed, in part due to the paucity of clinical symptoms and poor sensitivity of conventional radiographs used for diagnosis. Antinuclear antibody positivity, early onset of disease, and presence of systemic or polyarticular disease are all risk factors for temporomandibular joint arthritis but may underpredict temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging enhanced with gadolinium is currently the gold standard in detection of temporomandibular joint arthritis, and treatment with intra-articular corticosteroids has been shown to be effective and safe, with minimal side effects. SummaryGiven the paucity of clinical symptoms in temporomandibular joint arthritis, detection of temporomandibular joint inflammation using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is essential for instituting appropriate therapy in a timely fashion. The use of intra-articular corticosteroids holds promise for control of temporomandibular joint inflammation and prevention of associated morbidities.",

        "abstract": "Objectives. To study the validity of both rheumatological and orthodontic examinations and ultrasound (US) as screening methods for early diagnosis of TMJ arthritis against the gold standard MRI. Methods. Thirty consecutive juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients were included in this pilot study. Rheumatological and orthodontic examinations as well as US were performed within 1 month of the MRI in a blinded fashion. Joint effusion and/or increased contrast enhancement of synovium or bone were considered signs of active arthritis on MRI. Results. A total of 19/30 (63%) patients and 33/60 (55%) joints had signs of TMJ involvement on MRI. This was associated with condylar deformity in 9/19 (47%) patients and 15/33 (45%) joints. Rheumatological, orthodontic and US examinations correctly diagnosed 11 (58%), 9 (47%) and 6 (33%) patients, respectively, with active TMJ arthritis, but misdiagnosed 8 (42%), 10 (53%) and 12 (67%) patients, respectively, as having no signs of inflammation. The best predictor for active arthritis on MRI was a reduced maximum mouth opening. Conclusion. None of the methods tested was able to reliably predict the presence or absence of MRI-proven inflammation in the TMJ in our cohort of JIA patients. US was the least useful of all methods tested to exclude active TMJ arthritis.",

Twenty patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and 10 healthy control subjects underwent measurement of S100A12 serum concentrations by sandwich ELISA. Temporomandibular Joints (TMJs); clinical and post contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations were performed. MRI findings were scored. Results showed that TMJ arthritis was detected in 80% of JIA patients using MRI. Serum S100A12 levels were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. Serum concentrations of S100A12 and total MRI scores were significantly higher in JIA patients with active disease compared to those without activity. Systemic and polyarticular JIA patients showed significant increase in S100A12 levels and total MRI scores compared to those with oligoarticular JIA. The MRI TMJ abnormalities revealed significant association with clinical signs of TMJ inflammation but not with symptoms. A significant correlation was found between serum S100A12 concentrations and MRI score as well as between each of them and different clinical, laboratory disease parameters. Serum S100A12 levels showed significant positive correlation with synovial enhancement score. To conclude TMJ arthritis could be detected in most cases of JIA patients using contrast enhanced MRI. Increased S100A12 levels may point to synovial inflammation. Clinical signs of TMJ arthritis may be used as filter for MRI examination. Further studies on larger scale of JIA patients are needed for monitoring TMJ inflammation and S100A12 may be a potential target of future anti-inflammatory therapy.",

        "abstract": "An association between obesity and development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has been established in the literature; however, there are limited data regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this association. Therefore, we used a multistage design to identify and validate genes that are associated with obesity-related ccRCC. We conducted a microarray study and compared gene expression between obese and non-obese subjects in ccRCC tumors and patient-matched normal kidney tissues. Analyses were stratified by smoking status and subsequently performed on the combined cohort. The primary objective was to identify genes where the fold change of ccRCC tumor expression between obese and non-obese subjects was different than the fold change in the patient-matched normal kidney tissue. Thus, we utilized a mixed model and evaluated the tissue type-by-obesity status interaction term. Targeted validation was performed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on an independent cohort. ENRAGE was identified in the microarray study and subsequently validated using RT-PCR to have a statistically significant tissue type-by-obesity status interaction. Specifically, although ENRAGE is similarly expressed across obese and non-obese subjects in normal tissue, it is upregulated in the patient-matched ccRCC tumor tissue. Additionally, ENRAGE is upregulated in tumors that are wild-type for the von Hippel Lindau gene and in tumors for subjects with poorer overall survival. In summary, we provide evidence that overexpression of ENRAGE in ccRCC tumor tissue is an obesity-associated somatic alteration. Upregulation of ENRAGE could lead to local, autocrine stimulation of the RAGE receptor and thus support cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Plaque formation starts with the inflammation in fatty streaks and progresses through atheroma, atheromatous plaque, and fibroatheroma leading to development of stable plaque. Hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia are the risk factors for atherosclerosis. Inflammation, infection with viruses and bacteria, and dysregulation in the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells leads to advanced plaque formation. Death of the cells in the intima due to inflammation results in secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), alarmins (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and oxidized low-density lipoproteins), and infection with pathogens leads to secretion of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acids, and peptidoglycans. DAMPs and PAMPs further activate the inflammatory surface receptors such as TREM-1 and toll-like receptors and downstream signaling kinases and transcription factors leading to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and interferon-\u03b3 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These mediators and cytokines along with MMPs render the plaque vulnerable for rupture leading to ischemic events.

Material/Methods A total of 303 patients were enrolled in this study, with 110 having acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 110 having coronary heart disease (CHD), and 83 subjects served as healthy blood donors. The concentrations of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and S100A8/A9 protein were determined in the sera of the participants and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a rat carotid artery thrombosis model and in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and the TLR-4 blocker CLI-095 were used to investigate the role of the TLR-4-MAPK-COX2 signaling axis in thrombosis. Results The levels of COX-2, TLR-4, and S100A8/A9 in the sera of patients with ACS and CHD were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P<0.05).

In the rat carotid thrombosis model, the expressions of TLR-4, COX-2, and p-p38 MAPK significantly increased until 14 days after thrombosis induction, whereas S100A8/A9 expression increased until day 7, but then decreased. Administration of SB203580 to rats reduced COX-2 expression in PBMCs after thrombosis induction, and incubation of HAECs with CLI-095 reduced their p-p38 MAPK and COX-2 response to S100A8/A9 stimulation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between microRNA-146b-3p (miR-146b-3p) and inflammatory factors in thrombosis. Method THP-1 cells were cultured in vitro, Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of COX-2 and p38MAPK in the cells, and real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of miRNA-146b-3p and COX-2. A lentiviral expression vector of miRNA-146b-3p and its inhibitor were constructed to transfect THP-1 cells. COX-2 and p38MAPK expression in transfected cells was detected by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Results Ang II and TNF-\u03b1 could elevate the expression of COX-2 in monocytes. The expression of COX-2 was upregulated by p38MAPK, which could be phosphorylated by Ang II, while there was an increasing tendency of p38MAPK phosphorylation after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. In addition, COX-2 expression and P38MAPK phosphorylation could be downregulated by miRNA-146b-3p and upregulated by the miRNA-146b-3p inhibitor. Ang II could increase miR-146b-3p expression, although there was no significant difference; however, the expression of miR-146b-3p was enhanced significantly by TNF-\u03b1. Conclusion Our data implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p was closely related to the progression of inflammation mediating the P38MAPK/COX-2 pathway.

However, in subgroup analysis, PTGS2 rs689466 (dominant model: CT vs TT \u2013 ORadjusted= 2.51, 95% CI: 1.22\u20135.16, p = 0.012; co-dominant model: CT/CC vs TT \u2013 ORadjusted= 2.53, 95% CI: 1.26\u20135.07, p = 0.009; additive model \u2013 ORadjusted= 2.26, 95% CI: 1.19\u20134.28, p = 0.013) and rs5275 (dominant model: GG vs AA \u2013 ORadjusted= 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12\u20130.80, p = 0.016; co-dominant model: GA/GG vs AA \u2013 ORadjusted= 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21\u20130.95, p = 0.036; additive model \u2013 ORadjusted= 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39\u20130.92, p = 0.020) were associated with IS type of small-vessel occlusion. Conclusion Our study suggested that PTGS2 rs689466 C and rs5275 A were potentially associated with IS subtype of small-vessel occlusion. Our result should be confirmed with further large sample sized studies.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the genetic variation of inflammatory genes, including PTGS2, in relation to ischemic stroke risk. Although it does not directly investigate the miR-146b-3p/p38MAPK/COX-2 pathway, it shares some similarities in the context of inflammation and disease. However, the connection to the source paper is not strong enough to be considered as inspired by or dependent on the source paper's findings."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Circular RNAs, a class of circularly closed non-coding RNAs, play essential roles in the formation of atherosclerosis, which is a frequent cause of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although many circular RNAs are found to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis, more circular RNA regulators still need to be identified, to improve the understanding of the regulatory networks of atherosclerosis. Here, we found that hsa_circ_0008896 was significantly up-regulated in both in vitro and in vivo atherosclerosis models, indicating hsa_circ_0008896 was involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Further functional analyses confirmed that knockdown of hsa_circ_0008896 decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs. In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and found that hsa-miR-633 could directly bind to hsa_circ_0008896, which was confirmed by RNA immune-precipitation (RIP) assays. Results of proliferation, migration, and invasion assays showed that hsa-miR-633 inhibitor reversed the si-circ_0008896 phenotypes, indicating that hsa_circ_0008896 functionally bound to hsa-miR-633. At last, combining bioinformatics and experimental analyses, we found the protein target of hsa_circ_0008896/hsa-miR-633, CDC20B (cell division cycle 20B). The expression level of CDC20B was regulated by hsa-miR-633, and knockdown of CDC20B decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs. Taken together, hsa_circ_0008896 regulated the expression of CDC20B by sponging hsa-miR-633, and then enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs to promote the progression of atherosclerosis.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background As one of the essential hypertension (EH)-mediated target organ damage, carotid plaque is a crucial subclinical precursor for cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is vital to identify the risk factors and pathogenesis for EH with carotid plaque. Methods Based on our previous microarray analysis, we selected four circRNAs as the candidate circRNAs and detected their expression levels in blood of 192 subjects (64 healthy controls, 64 EH patients, and 64 EH patients with carotid plaque) by qRT-PCR analysis. The regulatory mechanism of circRNAs involved in carotid plaque was predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Results The level of hsa_circ_0124782 increased significantly and the levels of hsa_circ_0131618 and hsa_circ_0127342 decreased significantly in the EH group and EH with carotid plaque group compared with the control group (P < .05). Functional enrichment analysis showed that three circRNAs might be implicated in pathogenesis for carotid plaque. Conclusion Our study revealed the relationship between three circRNAs and carotid plaque, suggesting that they may serve as potential biomarkers for EH with carotid plaque.",
