        "title": "Natural interferon-alpha versus its combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone in the therapy of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia: a long-term, randomized, controlled study.",
        "abstract": "Type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is an often progressive vasculitis characterized by circulating cold-precipitable proteins that usually consists of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM kappa with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity. Its etiology is unknown, although recent evidence strongly suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a major role. Plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, and cytotoxic drugs have been used in the therapy of MC patients. Recently, favorable results with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN alpha) have been reported. To further assess its effectiveness, we studied the effects of natural human interferon-alpha (nIFN alpha), alone and in combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone (PDN), in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with symptomatic MC. Sixty-five patients were enrolled onto the trial, 52 (80%) of whom presented serum anti-HCV antibodies and specific genomic RNA sequences. Fifteen patients received nIFN alpha (3 MU) intramuscularly (IM) three times weekly, whereas 17 patients also received 16 mg/d of PDN orally on non-IFN days. Moreover, 18 patients received 16 mg/d of PDN only, and 15 were untreated. Treatment was discontinued after 1 year and patients were monitored for 8 to 17 months (mean, 13). A complete response was achieved in eight of 15 patients (53.3%) treated with nIFN alpha and nine of 17 (52.9%) treated with nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with three of 18 patients (16.7%) who received PDN only (P < .05) and one of 15 (6.7%) untreated controls (P < .01). Partial response occurred in two of 15 (13.3%) patients treated with nIFN alpha, three of 17 (17.6%) who received nIFN alpha plus PDN, one of 18 (5.5%) who received PDN only, and one of 15 (6.7%) controls. A complete response in six patients (66.7%) was achieved within 3 months in the group that received nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with two patients (25%) of those who received nIFN alpha alone (P < .02). In anti-HCV-positive patients, the clinical response occurred in step with reduced or undetectable levels of HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. Quantification of circulating HCV RNA represented a good predictive response marker. The probability of relapse within 3 months after treatment was 100% (three of three patients) and 75% (six of eight patients), respectively, in patients who received PDN alone or nIFN alpha alone as compared with none of those who received nIFN alpha plus PDN (P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Immunochemical and biomolecular studies of circulating immune complexes isolated from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis C virus infection",
        "abstract": "Circulating immune complexes (ICs) were isolated by affinity chromatography and sucrose density gradient fractionation during acute and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Immunochemical and biomolecular studies showed that they basically consist of the virus component, IgG with specific anti\u2010HCV activity and IgM bearing 17.109 epitope (IgM 17.109), an antigenic determinant common to rheumatoid factors (RFs) with WA cross\u2010idiotype (XId). An antigen\u2010specific IC assay was used to demonstrate IgG anti\u2010HCV/IgM 17.109 ICs (IgG\u2010IgM ICs) in five out of the five patients with acute and in 8 out of the 10 patients with chronic hepatitis C who mounted an IgG anti\u2010HCV immune response. They were not detected in patients with no IgG anti\u2010HCV response. IgG\u2013IgM ICs appeared in step with IgG anti\u2010HCV seroconversion and remained detectable for a long period irrespective of clinical outcome, in that they were demonstrated over a 4\u2010year follow\u2010up of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Their presence was unrelated to the severity and progression of liver histology. Despite similar serum levels of IgM 17.109 XId, antigen\u2010specific IgG\u2010IgM ICs were not found in acute and chronic hepatitis B or in acute hepatitis A. Thus, these ICs appear to be uniquely associated with HCV infection, supporting the view that IgM 17.109 XId derive from an antigen\u2010driven response strictly related to the involved antigen. Even although they have no apparent effects on the progression of HCV\u2010related liver disease, their presence may help to explain the immunological abnormalities and extrahepatic disorders observed in HCV infection.",

        "title": "Hepatitis C virus infection, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: an emerging picture.",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA agent which expresses its genetic informations in the form of a single, large polyprotein encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) that extends through most of its genomic RNA. Proteolytic cleavage of the ORF product is essential for the virogenesis and the production of viral progeny. HCV is responsible for chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral persistence is considered the greatest problem in the management of HCV infection. It may result from several mechanisms, two of which are established. In the first, the high rate of genetic variations during viral replication results in the production of mutants capable of escaping the immune attack. In the second, the virus infects cells of the immune system itself, which represent a privileged site that cannot be reached by virus-specific T cell response. Involvement of lymphoid cells in the early stages of HCV infection may provide insight into the pathobiologic patterns of extrahepatic dissemination (lymph nodes, major salivary glands, kidneys, blood vessels). Dissemination of HCV-infected lymphoid cells throughout the organism is likely to maintain a mobile and extensive reservoir of the virus. In this respect, extrahepatic sites may act as a source of continuous reinfection of hepatocytes. Studies of intrahepatic B lymphocytes indicate that they are infected with HCV, clonally expanded and activated to secrete IgM molecules with rheumatoid factor activity. This strongly suggests that HCV directly stimulates B cell expansion, which may result in an indolent stage of lymphoproliferation (i.e., mixed cryoglobulinemia) or in frank B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The frequency of NHL, however, is much lower than that of HCV infection, suggesting that HCV alone is not able to induce tumors and that cellular events, in addition to the presence of virus and virus-encoded products, are necessary in order to obtain a malignant B cell phenotype. The demonstration of HCV productive infection in bone marrow-recruited and circulating pluripotent hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells indicates that HCV replication occurs in the early differentiation stages of hematopoietic progenitors. These are stable cell populations and are likely to represent the initial site of infection and a continuous source of virus production.",

        "title": "Sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin antigen receptor of hepatitis C virus-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas suggests that the malignant cells are derived from the rheumatoid factor-producing cells that occur mainly in type II cryoglobulinemia.",
        "abstract": "Analysis of the immunoglobulin receptor (IGR) variable heavy- and light-chain sequences on 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) (9 patients also had type II mixed cryoglobulinemia [MC] syndrome and 8 had NHL unrelated to MC) and analysis of intraclonal diversity on 8 of them suggest that such malignant lymphoproliferations derive from an antigen-driven pathologic process, with a selective pressure for the maintenance of a functional IgR and a negative pressure for additional amino acid mutations in the framework regions (FRs). For almost all NHLs, both heavy- and light-chain complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) showed the highest similarity to antibodies with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity that have been found in the MC syndrome, thus suggesting that a common antigenic stimulus is involved in MC syndrome and in HCV-associated lymphomagenesis. Moreover, because HCV is the recognized pathologic agent of MC and the CDR3 amino acid sequences of some HCV-associated NHLs also present a high homology for antibody specific for the E2 protein of HCV, it may be reasonable to speculate that HCV E2 protein is one of the chronic antigenic stimuli involved in the lymphomagenetic process. Finally, the use of specific segments, in particular the D segment, in assembling the IgH chain of IgR seems to confer B-cell disorders with the property to produce antibody with RF activity, which may contribute to the manifestation of an overt MC syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic data have shown a close association between chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In many countries of the developed world, HCV infection accounts for more than half of the cases of HCC. HCC usually arises after 2-4 decades of infection, typically in the context of an underlying cirrhosis. Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-alfa can lead to sustained clearance of HCV, and small prospective studies as well as larger retrospective analyses suggest that interferon therapy leads to a decrease in the incidence of HCC. Without a reliable tissue culture system or a small animal model of HCV infection, analysis of the mechanisms by which HCV leads to cancer has been difficult. Nevertheless, both in vitro expression systems and in vivo transgenic mice studies suggest that HCV has an inherent carcinogenic potential. Understanding the pathogenesis of HCV-associated HCC is important in developing effective means of prevention and treatment of this highly malignant form of cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe previously reported that impaired retinoid signaling in the liver causes steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, oxidative stress induced by hepatic iron overload has emerged as an important factor for the progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In this study, the relationship between retinoid signaling and iron metabolism in the liver was investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effect of retinoids on the iron metabolism was examined in HuH7 cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid and acyclic retinoid NIK-333. In in vivo experiments, we used the mice expressing the dominant negative form of retinoic acid receptor alpha gene under the control of albumin enhancer/promoter (RAR-E Tg) and iron-overloaded wild mice fed with retinoid-deficient and retinoid-excess diets.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHepatic iron accumulation and increased expression of hemojuvelin were observed in RAR-E Tg mouse liver. Retinoid treatment significantly suppressed expression of hemojuvelin and mildly suppressed expression of transferrin receptor type 2 and hepcidin, accompanied by decreased hepatic iron content and iron-induced oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of hemojuvelin in HuH7 hepatoma cells led to a significant increase in cellular iron content.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that retinoids are involved in hepatic iron metabolism through transcriptional regulation of hemojuvelin.

        "abstract": "Recent data link vitamin A and its retinoid metabolites to the regulation of adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis. Retinoid metabolism is tightly controlled by an enzymatic network in which retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (Aldh1-3) are the rate-limiting enzymes that convert retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Aldh1a1-deficient mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and hence diabetes. Here we investigated whether Aldh1a1 and the retinoid axis regulate hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism independent of adiposity. The impact of Aldh1a1 and the retinoid pathway on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism was analyzed in hepatocytes in vitro and in chow-fed, weight-matched Aldh1a1-deficient vs. wild-type (WT) mice in vivo. Aldh1a1-deficient mice displayed significantly decreased fasting glucose concentrations compared with WT controls as a result of attenuated hepatic glucose production. Expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes as well as the activity of Forkhead box O1 was decreased in Aldh1a1-deficient vs. WT livers. In vitro, retinoid or cAMP agonist stimulation markedly induced gluconeogenesis in WT but not Aldh1a1-deficient primary hepatocytes. Aldh1a1 deficiency increased AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 activity, decreased expression of lipogenic targets of AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 and significantly attenuated hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis. In metabolic cage studies, lean Aldh1a1-deficient mice manifested enhanced oxygen consumption and reduced respiratory quotient vs. WT controls, consistent with increased expression of fatty acid oxidation markers in skeletal muscle. Taken together, this work establishes a role for retinoid metabolism in glucose homeostasis in vivo and for Aldh1a1 as a novel determinant of gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism independent of adiposity.",

        "abstract": "The effects of retinoids, the structural derivatives of vitamin A (retinol), on post-natal peak bone density acquisition and skeletal remodeling are complex and compartment specific. Emerging data indicates that retinoids, such as all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its precursor all trans retinaldehyde (Rald), exhibit distinct and divergent transcriptional effects in metabolism. Despite these observations, the role of enzymes that control retinoid metabolism in bone remains undefined. In this study, we examined the skeletal phenotype of mice deficient in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a1), the enzyme responsible for converting Rald to ATRA in adult animals. Bone densitometry and micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) demonstrated that Aldh1a1-deficient (Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212) female mice had higher trabecular and cortical bone mass compared to age and sex-matched control C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice at multiple time points. Histomorphometry confirmed increased cortical bone thickness and demonstrated significantly higher bone marrow adiposity in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In serum assays, Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice also had higher serum IGF-1 levels. In vitro, primary Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressed significantly higher levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and demonstrated enhanced osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis versus WT MSCs. BMP2 was also expressed at higher levels in the femurs and tibias of Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice with accompanying induction of BMP2-regulated responses, including expression of Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase, and Smad phosphorylation. In vitro, Rald, which accumulates in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice, potently induced BMP2 in WT MSCs in a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent manner, suggesting that Rald is involved in the BMP2 increases seen in Aldh1a1 deficiency in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate Aldh1a1 as a novel determinant of cortical bone density and marrow adiposity in the skeleton in vivo through modulation of BMP signaling.",

At 2 weeks of age, the mandibular mineral density, alveolar bone volume, osteoblast numbers, and dental volume, dentin sialoprotein-immunopositive areas in the first molar were increased significantly in p27(-/-) mice and decreased dramatically in both Pthrp(KI/KI) and p27(-/-) Pthrp(KI/KI) mice compared with wild-type mice; however, these parameters were partly rescued in p27(-/-) Pthrp(KI/KI) mice compared with Pthrp(KI/KI) mice. These data demonstrate that the deletion of p27 in Pthrp(KI/KI) mice can partially rescue defects in dental and mandibular development. Furthermore, we found that deletion of p27 in Pthrp(KI/KI) mice partially corrected the dental and mandibular phenotype by modulating cell cyclin-regulating molecules and antioxidant enzymes. This study therefore indicates that the p27 pathway may function downstream in the action of PTHrP nuclear localization sequence to regulate dental and mandibular development.",

        "title": "Overexpressed Sirt1 in MSCs Promotes Dentin Formation in Bmi1-Deficient Mice",
        "abstract": "Sirt1 promotes odontoblastic gene expression in human dental pulp cells, whereas the inhibition of Sirt1 downregulates the expression of those genes. To investigate whether the overexpression of Sirt1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) driven by Prx1 promoter could rescue the dentin formation defects in Bmi1-deficient (Bmi1\u2212/\u2212) mice, we established the MSCs overexpressing Sirt1 in Bmi1 knockout mice (Sirt1TGBmi1\u2212/\u2212). First, we used Prx1-Cre/ROSAnTnG mice to demonstrate that Prx1 linage cells exist mainly in the pulp horns at 4 wk of age. Second, we found that 4-wk-old Sirt1TG mice had increased tooth volume as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. The expression level of Sirt1 was significantly higher in dental papilla mesenchymal cells of Sirt1TG mice than WT mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the tooth mineralization, dental volume, dentin sialoprotein\u2013immunopositive areas, odontoblastic gene expression, and percentage of proliferating BrdU-positive cells were significantly elevated in the Sirt1TG mice and dramatically reduced in the Bmi1\u2013/\u2013 mice versus the WT littermates at 4 wk of age. However, the areas of predentin and the percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were significantly reduced in the Sirt1TG mice but dramatically increased in the Bmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared with the WT littermates. All these parameters were rescued in the Sirt1TGBmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice versus the Bmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Finally, by using dental papilla mesenchymal cells, we found that the overexpression of Sirt1 rescued the reduced cell proliferation and differentiation and increased the cell apoptosis caused by Bmi1 deficiency, which was associated with increased p53 deacetylation. Therefore, this study indicates that Sirt1 is a potential therapeutic target for promoting dentin formation in an anabolic approach to the treatment of dental developmental defects.",

        "title": "Elevated interleukin\u201011 in systemic sclerosis and role in disease pathogenesis",
        "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease in which there is elevated inflammation, aberrant cytokine expression, and subsequent fibrosis. Interleukin\u201011 (IL\u201011) is a recently described profibrotic cytokine that can mediate fibrosis in the heart, lungs, and skin and is upregulated by transforming Growth Factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b21). The objective of this study was to quantify the serum levels of IL\u201011 in early diffuse SSc patients. Also, if IL\u201011 could regulate the alarmin IL\u201033 in dermal fibroblasts was quantified. Early diffuse SSc patient sera was isolated and IL\u201011 was quantified by specific commercial ELISA compared to healthy control (n\u2009=\u200917). Healthy dermal fibroblasts were cultured in vitro and then serum starved and incubated with or without recombinant IL\u201011. At specific early and late time points the supernatant was quantified for the alarmin IL\u201033 by specific ELISA. In early diffuse SSc patients it was demonstrated that they have elevated IL\u201011 in their sera. In a subgroup of SSc patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) this elevation was particularly pronounced compared to those devoid of fibrotic lung disease. In vitro incubation of healthy dermal fibroblasts led to a significant induction of IL\u201033 cytokine release into the cell media. IL\u201011 is a profibrotic cytokine that is elevated in early diffuse SSc and is particularly elevated in those with ILD. This suggests that IL\u201011 could be a possible biomarker of ILD in SSc. It was also found that IL\u201011 led to release of the cytokine alarmin IL\u201033 in fibroblasts at earlier time points but not late time points, suggesting early stimulation elicits an inflammatory response in the local microenvironment but prolonged stimulation leads to fibrosis.",

        "title": "IL-11 Expression in Systemic Sclerosis Is Dependent on Caspase-1 Activity but Does Not Increase Collagen Deposition",
        "abstract": "Background: Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is increased in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is thought to play a role in fibrosis. Many studies have reported decreased fibrosis when IL-11 is blocked, but few have examined factors that induce IL-11 expression. Because fibrosis has been linked to activated inflammasomes driving caspase-1 maturation and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, we set out to determine if IL-11 expression was dependent on caspase-1 activity. Methods: Primary lung fibroblast cell lines derived from patients with SSc, IPF (fibrotic control), and healthy individuals were cultured at low passage. Gene expression for IL-11 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R\u03b11) was analyzed using qPCR and normalized to the control, and collagen production was measured using Sirius Red. Results: SSc and IPF fibroblasts expressed significantly more IL-11 transcripts than normal cells (3.35-fold and 9.97-fold more, p = 0.0396 and p = 0.0023, respectively). IL-11R\u03b11 was expressed 2.32-fold and 2.27-fold more in SSc and IPF (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0032, respectively) than in normal cells. In SSc fibroblasts, inhibition of caspase-1 with YVAD decreased IL-11 expression by 49.59% (p = 0.0016) but did not affect IL-11R\u03b11 expression (p > 0.05). IL-11 expression was increased 2.97-fold with TGF-\u03b21 (p = 0.0030) and 22.24-fold with IL-1\u03b2 (p < 0.0001), while the expression of IL-11R\u03b11 was not induced with these two cytokines. LPS increased IL-11 expression in normal fibroblasts 1.52-fold (p = 0.0042), which was abolished with YVAD (p < 0.0001). IL-11R\u03b11 gene transcripts were also increased with LPS 1.50-fold (p = 0.0132), but YVAD did not inhibit this expression. In these studies, we were unable to detect IL-11 protein nor were we able to induce COL1A1 expression or increase the total amount of collagen secreted by fibroblasts with human recombinant IL-11. Conclusions: IL-11 and its receptor, IL-11R\u03b11, are both elevated in fibrosis. IL-11 expression is dependent on inflammasome activation of caspase-1 and the downstream cytokines TGF-\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b2, while IL-11R\u03b11 was only dependent on NF-kB.",
