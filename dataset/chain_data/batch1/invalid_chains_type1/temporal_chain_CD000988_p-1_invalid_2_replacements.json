        "title": "Buflomedil in Arterial Occlusive Disease: Results of a Controlled Multicenter Study",
        "abstract": "In a double-blind, randomised multicentre study buflomedil, a vasoactive substance, was compared with placebo in the treatment of 93 patients with chronic arterial occlusive disease. After a run-in period of four weeks the patients received either buflomedil (600 mg daily) or placebo over 12 weeks. The pain-free and the total walking distances improved significantly in both groups. However, the differences in the improvement between the two groups were highly signifi cant and in favour of buflomedil: for the pain-free walking distance p<0.001 and for the total walking distance p<0.01. The results indicate that buflomedil has a beneficial effect on the symptoms and lengthens the walking distance in patients with arterial occlusive disease.",

        "title": "Multicenter Double-Blind Study of Ticlopidine in the Treatment of Intermittent Claudication and the Prevention of its Complications",
        "abstract": "In this multicenter trial 169 patients with chronic intermittent claudication due to obstructive peripheral vascular disease were randomized in a double- blind fashion into two parallel groups receiving either 250 mg ticlopidine or placebo, twice daily. At entry, the two groups (83 ticlopidine, 86 placebo) were well matched for the major clinical features apart from an excess of women in the ticlopidine group. At six months, 167 patients were alive, 2 having died of malignant disease (1 from each group). At this stage, 39 patients from the ticlo pidine group and 29 from the placebo group (p = 0.04) had increased their walking distance by more than 50% of baseline values. For the groups as a whole pain-free and total walking distance were greater in the ticlopidine group than in the placebo group (194 vs 124 meters, p = 0.03 and 236 vs 170 meters, p = 0.04, respectively). Two patients from the ticlopidine group vs 9 patients from the placebo group (p = 0.03) developed significant cardiovascular events during the study. These results indicate that ticlopidine has a beneficial effect both in the treatment of the symptoms and the prevention of vascular complica tions in patients with intermittent claudication.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the treatment of intermittent claudication using ticlopidine, which is a different approach from the source paper that focused on buflomedil in arterial occlusive disease. However, both papers deal with the treatment of similar conditions, indicating that the key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the understanding of the disease and its treatment options, which may include the findings from the source paper."

        "title": "Clinical Efficacy of Picotamide in Long-Term Treatment of Intermittent Claudication",
        "abstract": "The clinical efficacy of picotamide was investigated in a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs at functional stage II of the Fontaine classification. Forty patients with a history of claudication for at least six months were admit ted to the study and were given either 3 x 300 mg tablets of picotamide (20 subjects) or three identical placebo tablets (20 subjects) for six months. The two groups of patients were similar in regard to clinical features and potential risk factors. At the end of treatment painfree walking distance and systolic ankle-arm pressure ratio improved more in the picotamide than in the placebo group (p=0.05). Systolic ankle pressure curves, determined before and after the six- month treatment, showed a positive trend to a higher postexercise ankle pres sure and a faster return to the preexercise levels in the picotamide group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Laboratory monitoring revealed a slight prolongation of bleeding time, a significant decrease in arachi donic acid-induced platelet aggregation, and an enhanced fibrinolysis with ab sence of interference with hemostasis in the picotamide group. One patient in the placebo group developed a major cardiovascular event (angina pectoris) during the study. These results indicate that picotamide is an effective drug that may modify the natural course of intermittent claudication and associated vascular prob lems.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is not directly dependent on the source paper. Picotamide is a different drug from ticlopidine, and the study explores its efficacy in treating intermittent claudication. While both studies deal with the same condition, they are not directly connected."

        "abstract": "A 63-year-old woman was referred to our division because of massive hemoptysis (200 ml) after administration of ticlopidine, an anti-thrombotic drug, for prevention of recurrent brain infarction. Ticlopidine treatment was stopped on the first hospital day, thereafter the patient's hemoptysis immediately disappeared. A chest roentgenogram and broncho-fiberscopic examination did not reveal any organic lesion associated with hemoptysis. Laboratory data revealed prolonged bleeding time and decreased platelet aggregation, suggesting that the patient had had a hemorrhagic diathesis associated with the administration of ticlopidine. Although many anti-thrombotic drugs have been recently employed in a variety of clinical cases, the patient's hemoptysis was considered to be due to side effects.",

        "abstract": "Background Ticlopidine, an antiplatelet agent with a unique mechanism of action, is now available for clinical use in the United States and Canada. Summary of Comment Recently two large randomized trials demonstrated that ticlopidine can reduce the risk of subsequent stroke in patients presenting with a transient ischemic attack or stroke. One study found that ticlopidine was more effective than aspirin for stroke prevention; however, it was less well tolerated than aspirin and was associated with severe but reversible neutropenia in almost 1% of patients. Conclusions Ticlopidine is effective for both primary and secondary stroke prevention. It has a favorable risk/benefit ratio and is a particularly attractive option for patients who are unable to take aspirin.",

        "title": "Ticlopidine hydrochloride use and threatened stroke.",
        "abstract": "Ticlopidine hydrochloride is an antiplatelet agent of proven antithrombotic efficacy that in December 1991 became available for general clinical use in the United States. The relative value of ticlopidine compared with aspirin, also an effective antiplatelet agent, has become a key clinical issue. Whereas ticlopidine is somewhat more effective than aspirin for preventing stroke in certain populations, it is also more expensive and potentially toxic. We recommend its use for patients with threatened stroke who are intolerant of aspirin and for patients who have cerebral ischemic symptoms despite aspirin therapy. Patients surviving major ischemic stroke make up a third group for whom ticlopidine use may be recommended in preference to aspirin. The use of ticlopidine rather than aspirin in patients with other cerebrovascular conditions is not strongly supported by existing data. The risk-benefit-cost equation involving ticlopidine versus other antithrombotic therapies is complex, rendering a wide range of acceptable management practices. If reliable laboratory monitoring for neutropenia during the first 3 months of therapy is not feasible, ticlopidine should not be used.",

This paper builds upon the source paper's findings and uses them as a basis for its recommendations, so its relevance is higher."
