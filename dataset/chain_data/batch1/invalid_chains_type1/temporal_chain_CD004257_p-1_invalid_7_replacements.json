        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose.",

        "abstract": "1. Whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) usage in the elderly elevates blood pressure or antagonises the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive medication is presently unknown. The primary aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of NSAID usage, to evaluate the prescription of NSAIDs for arthritis and to determine whether NSAID usage was an independent predictor of hypertension in a large elderly community. 2. All non-institutionalised elderly (> 60 years) residents of Dubbo, NSW who attended for a baseline assessment were enrolled (1237 males, 1568 females). A questionnaire was administered and blood pressure was measured according to the Prineas protocol. The frequency of NSAID usage was determined, with stratification by age, sex, blood pressure group and history of arthritis. 3. NSAID usage was 26% overall (females 28%, males 23%), increased with age and was higher in females than males for every age group studied. Amongst patients with a past history of 'arthritis', 45% were using NSAIDs. Twelve percent were taking NSAIDs and antihypertensive medication concurrently, constituting the population at risk of an adverse drug-drug interaction. Employing a multiple logistic regression model which adjusted for several confounders in the cross-sectional analysis, NSAID usage significantly predicted the presence of hypertension (odds ratio: 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-1.7) with an attributable risk of 29%. 4. Amongst non-institutionalised elderly persons, NSAID usage may be an independent risk factor for hypertension. Considering the substantial consumption of NSAIDs by elderly patients, physicians should review their NSAID prescribing patterns for this community group.",

Persistence rates with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors were significantly higher than those seen with cholestyramine (64.3% vs 36.6% of days with drug available, respectively). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease had significantly higher rates of persistence with lipid-lowering regimens. In New Jersey, multivariable analysis indicated that the poorest patients (those enrolled in Medicaid) had lower rates of drug use than less indigent patients (those enrolled in Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled) after adjusting for possible confounders, despite virtually complete drug coverage in both programs. When rates of use were measured in the US population for the 5 years following the study year, only 52% of surviving patients who were initially prescribed lipid-lowering drugs were still filling prescriptions for this drug class.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn all populations studied, patients who were prescribed lipid-lowering drug regimens remained without filled prescriptions for over a third of the study year on average. Rates of persistence varied substantially with choice of agent prescribed, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status, despite universal coverage of prescription drug costs. After 5 years, about half of the surviving original cohort in the United States had stopped using lipid-lowering therapy altogether.",

This study characterizes and identifies predictors of the persistence of use of statins in a clinical cohort of subsidized new users of similar age to the WOSCOPS trial subjects.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMedical, pharmaceutical, and demographic records for the period January 1, 1987 through December 31, 1994 were extracted from the databases of Qu\u00e9bec's provincial health plan for a 10% random sample of social assistance recipients. Patients remained eligible for inclusion if they had received a first dispensation of a statin between January 1, 1987 and July 31, 1994. Persistence was defined as the number of days on treatment with a statin while continuing to renew dispensations within a defined time limit.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNew users of statins included 983 social assistance recipients who were observed for a total of 2,439,153 person-days. Median persistence on statin treatment was 173 (95% CI = 155, 204) days. Only 13% of patients persisted for 5 years of treatment. A higher index of chronic morbidity, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and previous use of nicotinic acid were predictive of longer persistence on statin medication. Those patients whose first statin dispensation was for lovastatin discontinued treatment earlier than those whose first dispensation was for pravastatin or simvastatin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNew users showed low persistence on statins in a cohort of socially assisted persons aged 45-64, in spite of the minimal financial cost of the drug for such beneficiaries of Qu\u00e9bec's provincial health plan.",

Using The Health Improvement Network database, patients who had received atorvastatin for \u2265 six months were identified. They were classified as 'switch' if they were subsequently switched to simvastatin, and were matched to up to four 'control' patients who remained on atorvastatin. Time to death or first major cardiovascular event was compared, controlling for the matching co-variates, prior statin exposure and baseline cholesterol concentration. A total of 2,511 switch patients and 9,009 controls were identified. The risk of death or first major cardiovascular event was significantly associated with switching therapy (hazard ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.64) compared with patients who did not switch. Major cardiovascular events and stroke were also significantly associated with switching. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality. While recognising the observational nature of database research, this study has highlighted the potential for poorer cardiovascular outcomes in patients switching statin therapy, compared with patients maintained on their current treatment. This raises concerns for policies that encourage widespread statin switching without careful consideration of individual patient circumstances and cardiovascular risk, and highlights the need for formal trials to assess the consequences of switching statin treatment.",

Methods: In a retrospective cohort analysis among adult enrollees in over 90 US health plans, the authors identified adult patients who switched from a branded to generic statin from July\u2013December 2006 (simvastatin became generic in June 2006). Patients were classified by type of statin switch: GS (e.g., branded simvastatin\u2009\u2192\u2009generic simvastatin), and TS (e.g., branded atorvastatin\u2009\u2192\u2009generic simvastatin). Demographic and clinical data were collected from claims before switch through 6 months follow-up. Separate outcomes of interest included proportion of patients that switched to a less potent daily dose, that switched back to previous branded statin after switch, and that were at least 80% adherent during the 6 months after initial switch. Significant predictors of each clinical outcome were identified using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for differences between groups in covariates and potential confounders. Results: The 6-month TS (n\u2009=\u20093807) and GS (n\u2009=\u200940,165) groups were generally similar demographically. Compared to GS, TS patients were significantly more likely to be switched to a less potent dose (26.2% vs. 0.5%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] in patients with high-potency index medication\u2009=\u200983.4, p\u2009<\u20090.0001); 33% less likely to be adherent in the 6 months after switch (67.7% vs. 75.9%, AOR in patients with no switch in first 6 months follow-up = 0.67, p\u2009<\u20090.0001); and four times more likely to switch back to previous branded statin (11.3% vs. 2.9%, AOR = 4.1, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Limitations: This study did not account for co-payment changes, lipid measurements, or changes in pill burden. Conclusions: While this study did not have data on why patients had TS (e.g., for cost or clinical reasons), TS was more likely to involve a subsequent disruption to statin therapy than GS. TS could potentially lead to adverse impacts on patients\u2019 outcomes, and should be studied further.",

Analyses of large medical claims databases suggest that generic substitution of antiepileptic drugs is associated with increased morbidity and greater use of healthcare resources. While a single brand-to-generic switch may be associated with a slight increase in overall medical costs, multiple switches may be associated with higher costs, perhaps because different generic agents are not required to be bioequivalent to each other. Generic substitution also affects the individual: along with the possible increased risk of seizures or adverse events, inconsistency of supply may make the medication appear unfamiliar, thus discouraging adherence. Importantly, substitution is often carried out at the dispensing level, without the knowledge or consent of physicians and affected individuals. Therefore, regulatory and professional bodies advocate that substitution should not be carried out without specific counseling of the individual by healthcare professionals on the details and implications of the change.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Cardiologists, who often treat patients with CVD and T2DM, are faced with the unmet need for an agent that provides glycaemic control yet does not pose CV risk. No antidiabetic therapy is currently indicated to improve macrovascular outcomes. Results of studies assessing the association between intensive antidiabetic therapy and a reduction in the risk of major CV events in patients with T2DM have been inconsistent, and independent reports have linked certain T2DM therapies (e.g. rosiglitazone, sulphonylureas) with negative CV outcomes. These findings prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to develop guidelines for assessing CV risk in investigational antidiabetic therapies. The FDA guidelines specifically call for metaanalyses of completed phase 2 and 3 trials; long-term, prospective, CV safety studies; or both. Results from meta-analyses involving dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, including those approved before the issuance of the FDA guidelines, suggest that these agents are not associated with an increase in CV risk and may potentially provide CV benefits. Prospective, large-scale, long-term trials designed in accordance with the FDA guidelines examining the CV risks and potential benefits of DPP4 inhibitors are under way. This review discusses the current evidence and ongoing trials that may support the potential CV benefit of DPP-4 inhibitors in T2DM.",

Healthy adherer effect (HAE) is a type of bias reflecting patient behaviour. It cannot be easily monitored in study population and can favourably affect health outcomes that may be incorrectly attributed to drug therapy. The aim of this paper was to assess the HAE impact on health outcomes of studies concerning medication adherence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic review of literature from PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials identified all randomized controlled or observational studies dealing with HAE. Included studies were analysed with respect to relationships between HAE, adherence to therapy and health outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven studies were identified - two randomized controlled and five cohort studies. Significant occurrence of HAE in relation to mortality was not observed while one study indicated the presence of HAE in relation to surrogate (bone mineral density). Cohort studies were mainly based on drug class effect, but HAE was not revealed. Factors associated with patient behaviour (e.g. smoking, regular preventive screening) were also not clearly associated with the occurrence of HAE, but their inclusion in design of cohort studies can help to detect health seeking behaviour.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOnly a few studies concerning HAE were found, but they did not obtain any consistent conclusions. HAE impact was supposed particularly on treatment outcomes that may be easier affected by patient behaviour. However, researchers and clinicians should be still aware of HAE, interpret results carefully and verified them in further studies.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nSuboptimal adherence to medications taken chronically for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g., aspirin) continues to burden the healthcare system despite the well-established benefits of prevention. We conducted a literature search to examine patient adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD-as evaluated by prescription refill data, electronic medication monitors, pill counts, and physiologic markers-to better identify an unmet need for measures to improve patient adherence to these therapies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEnglish-language articles were obtained from the PubMed database using the following key words or combinations thereof \"adherence,\" \"compliance,\" \"secondary prevention,\" and \"cardiovascular disease.\" Publications that provided adherence data only for primary prevention, lacked data on medication adherence (e.g., focus on guideline adherence), emphasized quality-of-care outcomes, or focused on outcomes of acute interventions were excluded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultiple patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors may contribute to poor adherence to treatment regimens, and therefore, a multifactorial approach will likely be needed to improve compliance with prescribed treatments for CVD. Although no magic bullet exists to assure full adherence, adherence programs coupled with patient counseling and education (inclusive of over-the-counter therapies), along with treatments that are less complex or avoid bothersome adverse effects, are more likely to be associated with successful outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven the burden of CVD to the community and the healthcare system, nonadherence to CVD-preventative medications such as aspirin remains a substantial area of unmet need and represents a key opportunity for the development of quality-of-care enhancement programs to improve health outcomes in this patient population.",

        "abstract": "Use of statin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recommended by most clinical guidelines. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among T2DM patients. It has been proved that statins are effective for primary or secondary CVD prophylaxis. Reports have highlighted the underutilization of statins in clinical practice and the suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations. This review article points to summarize the current evidence confirming the role of statins in T2DM patients and to provide an overview of factors that may affect statins' prescribing patterns and compliance in clinical practice. Initiatives to enhance statin therapy prescribing should recognize the comprehensive nature of the prescribing process. Attempts to assure proper statin prescribing and utilization can help in achieving better clinical outcomes of statin therapy.",

        "abstract": "Importance\nHigh-intensity statin use after myocardial infarction (MI) varies by patient characteristics, but little is known about differences in use by hospital or region.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore the relative strength of associations of region and hospital and patient characteristics with high-intensity statin use after MI.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis retrospective cohort analysis used Medicare administrative claims and enrollment data to evaluate fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who were hospitalized for MI from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2015, with a statin prescription claim within 30 days of discharge. Data were analyzed from January 4, 2017, through May 12, 2019.\n\n\nExposures\nBeneficiary characteristics were abstracted from Medicare data. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the 2014 American Hospital Association Survey and Hospital Compare quality metrics. Nine regions were defined according to the US Census.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nIntensity of the first statin claim after discharge characterized as high (atorvastatin calcium, 40-80 mg, or rosuvastatin calcium, 20-40 mg/d) vs low to moderate (all other statin types and doses). Trends in high-intensity statins were examined from 2011 through 2015. Associations of region and beneficiary and hospital characteristics with high-intensity statin use from January 1, 2014, to June 15, 2015, were examined using Poisson distribution mixed models.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 139 643 fee-for-service beneficiaries included (69 968 men [50.1%] and 69 675 women [49.9%]; mean [SD] age, 76.7 [7.5] years), high-intensity statin use overall increased from 23.4% in 2011 to 55.6% in 2015, but treatment gaps persisted across regions. In models considering region and beneficiary and hospital characteristics, region was the strongest correlate of high-intensity statin use, with 66% higher use in New England than in the West South Central region (risk ratio [RR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.47-1.87). Hospital size of at least 500 beds (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.23), medical school affiliation (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17), male sex (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13), and patient receipt of a stent (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.31-1.39) were associated with greater high-intensity statin use. For-profit hospital ownership, patient age older than 75 years, prior coronary disease, and other comorbidities were associated with lower use.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study's findings suggest that geographic region is the strongest correlate of high-intensity statin use after MI, leading to large treatment disparities.",

        "title": "Lipid Management in Patients Presenting With Acute Coronary Syndromes: A Review",
        "abstract": "Abstract Despite many improvements in its prevention and management, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Lipid management is an important part of secondary prevention after ACS, but many patients currently remain undertreated and do not attain guideline\u2010recommended levels of low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. This review details the current state of evidence on lipid management in patients presenting with ACS, provides directions for identification of patients who may benefit from early escalation of lipid\u2010lowering therapy, and discusses novel lipid\u2010lowering medication that is currently under investigation in clinical trials. Moreover, a treatment algorithm aimed at attaining guideline\u2010recommended low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is proposed. Despite important advances in the initial treatment and secondary prevention of ACS, \u224820% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months, and 5\u2010year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. Knowledge of the current state of evidence\u2010based lipid management after ACS is of paramount importance to improve outcomes after ACS.",

        "title": "Ethnic differences in guideline-indicated statin initiation for people with type 2 diabetes in UK primary care, 2006\u20132019: A cohort study",
        "abstract": "Background Type 2 diabetes is 2\u20133 times more prevalent in people of South Asian and African/African Caribbean ethnicity than people of European ethnicity living in the UK. The former 2 groups also experience excess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) complications of diabetes. We aimed to study ethnic differences in statin initiation, a cornerstone of ASCVD primary prevention, for people with type 2 diabetes. Methods and findings Observational cohort study of UK primary care records, from 1 January 2006 to 30 June 2019. Data were studied from 27,511 (88%) people of European ethnicity, 2,386 (8%) people of South Asian ethnicity, and 1,142 (4%) people of African/African Caribbean ethnicity with incident type 2 diabetes, no previous ASCVD, and statin use indicated by guidelines. Statin initiation rates were contrasted by ethnicity, and the number of ASCVD events that could be prevented by equalising prescribing rates across ethnic groups was estimated. Median time to statin initiation was 79, 109, and 84 days for people of European, South Asian, and African/African Caribbean ethnicity, respectively. People of African/African Caribbean ethnicity were a third less likely to receive guideline-indicated statins than European people (n/N [%]: 605/1,142 [53%] and 18,803/27,511 [68%], respectively; age- and gender-adjusted HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.76], p < 0.001). The HR attenuated marginally in a model adjusting for total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (0.77 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.85], p < 0.001), with no further diminution when deprivation, ASCVD risk factors, comorbidity, polypharmacy, and healthcare usage were accounted for (fully adjusted HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.68, 0.85], p < 0.001). People of South Asian ethnicity were 10% less likely to receive a statin than European people (1,489/2,386 [62%] and 18,803/27,511 [68%], respectively; fully adjusted HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.98], p = 0.008, adjusting for all covariates). We estimated that up to 12,600 ASCVD events could be prevented over the lifetimes of people currently affected by type 2 diabetes in the UK by equalising statin prescribing across ethnic groups. Limitations included incompleteness of recording of routinely collected data. Conclusions In this study we observed that people of African/African Caribbean ethnicity with type 2 diabetes were substantially less likely, and people of South Asian ethnicity marginally less likely, to receive guideline-indicated statins than people of European ethnicity, even after accounting for sociodemographics, healthcare usage, ASCVD risk factors, and comorbidity. Underuse of statins in people of African/African Caribbean or South Asian ethnicity with type 2 diabetes is a missed opportunity to prevent cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective To compare the effectiveness of three commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs added to metformin for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring second line treatment in routine clinical practice. Design Cohort study emulating a comparative effectiveness trial (target trial). Setting Linked primary care, hospital, and death data in England, 2015-21. Participants 75\u2009739 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who initiated second line oral antidiabetic treatment with a sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitor, or SGLT-2 inhibitor added to metformin. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was absolute change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between baseline and one year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were change in body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at one year and two years, change in HbA1c at two years, and time to \u226540% decline in eGFR, major adverse kidney event, hospital admission for heart failure, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), and all cause mortality. Instrumental variable analysis was used to reduce the risk of confounding due to unobserved baseline measures. Results 75\u2009739 people initiated second line oral antidiabetic treatment with sulfonylureas (n=25\u2009693, 33.9%), DPP-4 inhibitors (n=34\u2009464 ,45.5%), or SGLT-2 inhibitors (n=15\u2009582, 20.6%). SGLT-2 inhibitors were more effective than DPP-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas in reducing mean HbA1c values between baseline and one year. After the instrumental variable analysis, the mean differences in HbA1c change between baseline and one year were \u22122.5 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval (CI) \u22123.7 to \u22121.3) for SGLT-2 inhibitors versus sulfonylureas and \u22123.2 mmol/mol (\u22124.6 to \u22121.8) for SGLT-2 inhibitors versus DPP-4 inhibitors. SGLT-2 inhibitors were more effective than sulfonylureas or DPP-4 inhibitors in reducing BMI and systolic blood pressure. For some secondary endpoints, evidence for SGLT-2 inhibitors being more effective was lacking\u2014the hazard ratio for MACE, for example, was 0.99 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.62) versus sulfonylureas and 0.91 (0.51 to 1.63) versus DPP-4 inhibitors. SGLT-2 inhibitors had reduced hazards of hospital admission for heart failure compared with DPP-4 inhibitors (0.32, 0.12 to 0.90) and sulfonylureas (0.46, 0.20 to 1.05). The hazard ratio for a \u226540% decline in eGFR indicated a protective effect versus sulfonylureas (0.42, 0.22 to 0.82), with high uncertainty in the estimated hazard ratio versus DPP-4 inhibitors (0.64, 0.29 to 1.43). Conclusions This emulation study of a target trial found that SGLT-2 inhibitors were more effective than sulfonylureas or DPP-4 inhibitors in lowering mean HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure and in reducing the hazards of hospital admission for heart failure (v DPP-4 inhibitors) and kidney disease progression (v sulfonylureas), with no evidence of differences in other clinical endpoints.",
