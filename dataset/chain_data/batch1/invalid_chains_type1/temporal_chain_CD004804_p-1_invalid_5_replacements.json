        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare medication adherence calculated from four different data sources including a pill count and self-report obtained during a home medication history, as well as calculations based on refill frequency derived from a provincial prescription claims database (manual and electronic). DESIGN: Baseline medication adherence was collected as part of a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Mean medication adherence results obtained from the four data sources were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple range test. SETTING: A pharmacy consultation service located at an interdisciplinary wellness center for noninstitutionalized elderly. PATIENTS: 65 years or older, noninstitutionalized, taking one or more prescribed or nonprescribed medications. Clients would either present to the wellness center or be referred by the Provincial Home Care program. RESULTS: When calculated from self-report or manual or electronic prescription claims data, mean percent adherence by drug was high and not statistically different (95.8% \u00b1 17.1%, 107.6% \u00b1 40.3%, and 94.6% \u00b1 24.0%, respectively), whereas the pill count adherence was significantly lower at 74.0% \u00b1 41.5% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An unexpected finding was that the pill count technique used in this study of elderly clients using chronic, repeat medications appeared to underestimate medication adherence. Numerous other limitations of pill count, self-report, and a province-wide prescription claims database in estimating medication adherence are presented. When using medication adherence as a process measure, the researcher and practitioner should be aware of the limitations unique to the data source they choose, and interpret data cautiously.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between level of use of recombinant deoxyribonuclease I (rhDNase) therapy and costs of respiratory-related care in patients with cystic fibrosis. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study using healthcare claims data from a large New England health insurer. PATIENTS: All cystic fibrosis patients five years of age and older who began therapy with rhDNase in 1994 (the year it was first marketed in the US). Healthcare claims were compiled for six months prior to first receipt of rhDNase (pretreatment) and for 30 months subsequently (follow-up). Patients were stratified according to their level of rhDNase use during follow-up, based on whether it was above or below the median number of therapy days for the sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of rhDNase, all antibiotics, and all respiratory-related outpatient (physician, home health, hospital outpatient) and inpatient care were included. All costs were expressed on an annualized basis. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with cystic fibrosis who began treatment with rhDNase in 1994 met all entry criteria; the median number of therapy days over a 30-month period was 355. Among patients with low (i.e., below the median) rhDNase use (n = 12), mean \u00b1 SD annualized costs of respiratory-related care increased by almost $17000 between pretreatment and follow-up, from $29251 \u00b1 $37919 to $46109 \u00b1 $40944. Among high-use patients (n = 12), costs decreased by approximately $2500, from $37178 \u00b1 $48476 to $34592 \u00b1 $22591. The change in both groups was accounted for primarily by a change in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged use of rhDNase may reduce costs of respiratory-related care in patients with cystic fibrosis; further study is required, however, to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "Summary: Knowledge of factors associated with medication adherence could help HIV clinicians to target persons in need of intervention, design these interventions, and help researchers to plan studies of adherence. This review summarizes the results of 20 studies investigating the issue of barriers to optimal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Only a few determinants were consistently associated with nonadherence. Symptoms and adverse drug effects, psychologic distress, lack of social or family support, complexity of the HAART regimen, low patient self\u2010efficacy, and inconvenience of treatment were the factors most consistently associated with nonadherence. There were inconsistent findings regarding the relationship of adherence and the following variables: sociodemographic characteristics, substance abuse, depressive symptoms, quality of life, CD4+ cell count, knowledge and beliefs about treatment, patients' satisfaction with health care, and patient\u2010provider relationship. A synthesis of findings relating various factors to adherence to HAART is difficult to reach because of several limitations of the existing body of research. These limitations concern the measurement of adherence, the assessment of correlates and predictors of adherence, the study population, and the study design.",

Two reviewers independently rated study quality by using predefined criteria, and the investigative team jointly graded the overall strength of evidence.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\n96 relevant good- or fair-quality studies in 111 articles were identified: 98 articles on health literacy, 22 on numeracy, and 9 on both. Low health literacy was consistently associated with more hospitalizations; greater use of emergency care; lower receipt of mammography screening and influenza vaccine; poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications appropriately; poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages; and, among elderly persons, poorer overall health status and higher mortality rates. Poor health literacy partially explains racial disparities in some outcomes. Reviewers could not reach firm conclusions about the relationship between numeracy and health outcomes because of few studies or inconsistent results among studies.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nSearches were limited to articles published in English. No Medical Subject Heading terms exist for identifying relevant studies.

We studied whether patients enrolled in such plans who receive generic or preferred brand-name agents when initiating chronic therapy were more adherent to treatment than those who received nonpreferred brand-name medications.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed pharmacy claims filled between October 1, 2001, and October 1, 2003, from a large health plan for 6 classes of chronic medications: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, oral contraceptives, orally inhaled corticosteroids, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We measured adherence as the proportion of days covered (PDC) in each drug class during the first year of therapy. We evaluated how the formulary status of the initial prescription (generic, preferred, or nonpreferred) influenced PDC and adequate adherence, defined as PDC greater than 80%, over the subsequent year.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7532 new prescriptions were filled in 1 of the classes evaluated: 1747 (23.2%) for nonpreferred medications, 4376 (58.1%) for preferred drugs, and 1409 (18.7%) for generic drugs. After controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics and drug class, PDC was 12.6% greater for patients initiated on generic medications vs nonpreferred medications (58.8% vs 52.2%; P<.001). The PDC was 8.8% greater for patients initiated on preferred vs nonpreferred medications (56.8% vs 52.2%; P<.001). Patients initiated on generic and preferred medications had 62% and 30% greater odds, respectively, of achieving adequate adherence compared with those who received nonpreferred medications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn 3-tier pharmacy benefit plans, prescribing generic or preferred medications within a therapeutic class is associated with improvements in adherence to therapy.",

Methods:We prospectively assessed CD4 cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and alcohol consumption for up to 7 years in 595 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems recruited between 1997 and 2003. We investigated the relation of these markers of HIV disease progression to alcohol consumption using longitudinal regression models controlling for known prognostic factors, including adherence and depressive symptoms, and stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results:Among subjects who were not on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a lower CD4 cell count (adjusted mean decrease of 48.6 cells/\u03bcL compared with abstinence; P = 0.03) but not with higher log10 HIV RNA. Among subjects who were on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was not associated with a lower CD4 cell count or higher log10 HIV RNA. Conclusions:Heavy alcohol consumption has a negative impact on the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected persons not receiving ART. In addition to the known deleterious effects of alcohol on ART adherence, these findings suggest that avoiding heavy alcohol consumption in patients not on ART may have a beneficial effect on HIV disease progression.",

The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993\u20131995 in four US cities. The participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, CD4+T-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until March 2000. Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. There was no significant association between level of alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell counts. When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, the association between alcohol and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance. The association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). Depression had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. Moreover, depression is associated with HIV disease progression. Our findings have implications for the provision of alcohol use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with HIV.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Understanding gender-specific predictors of Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) outcomes of HIV/AIDS treatment is necessary in the latent feminization of HIV epidemics in Vietnam. This study assessed HRQL and its predictors among men and women with HIV/AIDS. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 155 patients (36.8% women, mean age=31.4) registering for antiretroviral treatment (ART) at Vietnam-Sweden Uong Bi General Hospital, Quang Ninh Province. The Vietnamese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV brief version (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) was developed. Factor analysis was applied to assess the construct validity of the measurement. Six major domains of the Vietnamese WHOQOL-HIV BREF were determined, namely physical; performance; morbidity; environment; psychological; and social support. Internal consistency reliability of the six domains ranged from 0.52 to 0.71. Multivariate linear regression models, constructed using step-wise forward selection, determined different predictors of HRQL domain scores in men and women with HIV/AIDS. The results showed that men reported higher scores or better in Morbidity (p=0.02), Environment (p=0.07) and Psychological dimensions (p=0.02); meanwhile, women had higher scores in Performance (p=0.09). Alcohol and injection drug use negatively predicted HRQL outcomes in both men and women. Employment was associated with better performance in men, and better physical but poorer environment status in women. Female patients who have a child experienced decrements in social support, psychological, environment, and performance. Findings of this study highlight the need to develop comprehensive interventions for HIV/AIDS patients, including HIV/AIDS treatment support and gender-specific impact mitigation interventions strategies.",

        "abstract": "Background Discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the immunological benefit of treatment and increases complications related to human immune-deficiency virus (HIV). However, the risk factors for ART discontinuation are poorly understood in developing countries particularly in Ethiopia. This review aimed to assess the best available evidence regarding risk factors for ART discontinuation in Ethiopia. Methods Quantitative studies conducted in Ethiopia between 2002 and 2015 that evaluated factors associated with ART discontinuation were sought across six major databases. Only English language articles were included. This review considered studies that included the following outcome: ART treatment discontinuation, i.e. \u2018lost to follow up\u2019, \u2018defaulting\u2019 and \u2018stopping medication\u2019. Meta- analysis was performed with Mantel Haenszel method using Revman-5 software. Summary statistics were expressed as pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals at a p-value of <0.05. Results Nine (9) studies met the criteria of the search. Five (5) were retrospective studies, 3 were case control studies, and 1 was a prospective cohort study. The total sample size in the included studies was 62,156. Being rural dweller (OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.5\u20132.7, I2 = 60%), being illiterate (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1\u20132.1), being not married (OR = 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1\u20131.8), being alcohol drinker (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.9\u20134.4, I2 = 39%), being tobacco smoker (OR = 2.6, 95%CI: 1.6\u20134.3, I2 = 74%), having mental illness (OR = 2.7, 95%CI: 1.6\u20134.6, I2 = 0%) and being bed ridden functional status (OR = 2.3, 95%CI: 1.5\u20133.4, I2 = 37%) were risk factors for ART discontinuation. Whereas, having HIV positive partner (OR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.3\u20130.6, I2 = 69%) and being co-infected with Tb/HIV (OR = 0.6, 95%CI: 0.4\u20130.9, I2 = 0%) were protective factors. Conclusion Demographic, behavioral and clinical factors influenced ART treatment discontinuation. Hence, we recommend strengthening decentralization of HIV care services in remote areas, strengthening of ART task shifting, application of seek-test-treat-succeed model, and integration of smoking cession strategies and mental health care into the routine HIV care program.",

        "abstract": "Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a major global public health problem with more than 35 million people worldwide infected so far. Evidence shows that HIV has been compromising the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLWH) even in this era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). There has been little research into the quality of life of PLWH receiving HAART in Ethiopia. Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life among PLWH attending anti-retroviral therapy at public health facilities of Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia, in 2019. Patients and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study design on 391 randomly selected PLWH who were attending HAART. We used a systematic random sampling technique to select participants in public health facilities of Arba Minch town from February 16 to April 26, 2019. The interviewers administered a structured questionnaire consisting of the WHOQOL-HIV BREF tool to measure the quality of life. Socio-demographic variables of study participants were collected, together with variables related to their clinical status extracted from their clinical records. Percentage mean scores were calculated and the mean of percentage mean scores was taken as the cutoff to categorize participants into two groups representing poor and good quality of life. Simple binary logistic regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine significant variables. All variables with p-value \u2264 0.25 in simple binary logistic regression were considered as eligible variables for multivariable logistic regression. Variables with p-value \u2264 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were considered as predictor variables. Results Out of the 391 enrolled adult PLWH, 184 of them (47.1%) had poor of overall quality of life status, as estimated by the WHOQOL-HIV BREF tool. Good quality of life was positively associated with recent CD4 count greater than or equal to 500 cell/mm3 (AOR=1.96, 95% CI; 1.18\u20133.27), absence of depression (AOR=10.59, 95% CI; 6.16\u201318.21), normal body mass index (AOR=2.66, 95% CI; 1.18\u20133.27), social support (AOR= 6.18, 95% CI; 3.56\u201310.75) and no perceived stigma (AOR=2.75, 95% CI; 1.62\u20134.67). Conclusion Nearly half of the adult PLWH receiving HAART at Arba Minch town had poor quality of life. High CD4 count, lack of social support, depression, and perceived stigma were associated with poor quality of life of PLWH. PLWH should be encouraged to be part of structured social support systems, such as associations of people living with HIV and mother support groups, in order to improve their social and psychological health. The health system should give attention to counseling on chronic care adherence and nutritional support to improve the quality of life of PLWH receiving HAART.",

However, questions have been raised about the use of antiretroviral therapy and how it affects quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The study hence aimed to assess the QoL of PLWHA who were taking HAART at Mizan\u2013Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH) and identify factors associated with QoL. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among PLWHA receiving HAART at MTUTH from March 04-April 1, 2018. Patients were recruited consecutively and interviewed with structured questionnaire. A data abstraction tool was used to extract data from patient medical records. Quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV- BREF (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF) standard tool. Data was entered to Epi-Info version 3.5.3 and analyzed using SPSS version 22 for windows. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify factors associated with QoL. A statistical significance was established at a p value <0.05. Results A total of 240 participants with the mean age of 35.11 (SD = 9.08) years were included in the study. This study found that 57.1% of the patients had high global score of QoL.

        "abstract": "Objective The main objective of this study was to describe the perceived quality of life (QoL) in patients living with AIDS (PLWA) and their chosen coping strategies in a cohort of individuals managed with HAART. Methods This is a prospective cohort study conducted at the Medication Dispensing Unit of a university hospital (MDU-UH) located in southeastern Brazil. Study population comprised HIV/AIDS patients starting antiretroviral treatment at MDU. The final sample comprised 99 participants. Patients were followed up for 24 months from their recruitment. We used a face-to-face questionnaire to determine sociodemographic and behavioural variables. Quality of life (QoL) and coping strategies (CS) were measured through validated instruments. Results Regarding the QoL dimensions, the general perception of QoL among these participants was considered good. Regarding CS, the adherent patients scored higher than the nonadherents. Conclusions The present study revealed that the perceived QoL can be maintained in individuals treated for HIV/AIDS. There is an association between high score of coping strategies and adherence to HAART.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life (QOL) and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, Brazil. A cross-sectional study with a sample of 385 patients followed-up on an outpatient basis. Interviews were conducted using the Sociodemographic, Epidemiological and Clinical Form, the World Health Organization\u2019s Quality of Life in PLWH Instrument, the Assessment of Adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. The odds ratio and confidence interval were calculated, considering P\u2009<\u20090.05 as statistically significant. Of the 385 PLWH, 134 (34.8%) had unsatisfactory QOL which was associated with unemployment (P\u2009=\u20090.0037), monthly income less than the minimum wage (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), sleep disorders (P\u2009=\u20090.0039) and not doing regular exercise (P\u2009=\u20090.0032). Inadequate adherence to ART occurred in 24 patients (6.23%) and was associated with detectable viral load (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) and unsatisfactory QOL (P\u2009=\u20090.0033). QOL was more unsatisfactory for those unemployed and with low income, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle. People with detectable viral load and unsatisfactory QOL had more inadequate adherence to ART.",

The paper's findings on the association between unsatisfactory QOL and inadequate adherence to ART are partially dependent on the source paper's findings on the association between high score of coping strategies and adherence to HAART."

        "title": "VIRAL LOAD AND OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION AS THE INDICATOR OF QUALITY-OF-LIFE PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS",
        "abstract": "Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant concern in the field of global health. However, studies on the relationship between viral load, opportunistic infections, and quality-of-life among them are limited. \nObjectives: This study aims to determine the relationship between viral load count, the presence of opportunistic infection, and the quality-of-life among people living with HIV. \nMethods: A cross-sectional study was used involving 35 respondents recruited through convenience sampling. The quality-of-life of individuals living with HIV was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life instrument for HIV. Statistical analysis using descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and proportion, and bivariate analysis with p-value<0.05. \nResults: Of the 35 participants, the majority were male (57.1%), with a mean age of 41.63 (9.09), and had a low education level (51.4%). The mean quality-of-life score was 86.88 (12.27), with a mean duration of ARV treatment of 7.23 years (5.36), undetectable viral load (68.6%), living with opportunistic infections (80%), and with tuberculosis being the most common (52.63%). There was a significant correlation between viral load and overall quality-of-life (p-value 0.04). \nConclusion: The results of viral load testing and the identification of opportunistic infections can serve as indicators to assess the quality-of-life among people living with HIV. The outcomes of this study have practical implications for enhancing healthcare services in clinical settings. This information can guide the implementation of targeted interventions to strengthen social relationships and these individuals' environmental quality-of-life.",
