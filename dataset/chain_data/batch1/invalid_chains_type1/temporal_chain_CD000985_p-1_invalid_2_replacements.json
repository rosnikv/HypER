        "abstract": "Sixty patients were recruited into a randomized parallel group comparison of three thrombolytic regimens for acute or subacute peripheral arterial thrombosis. There were no significant differences in age, duration of history, length of occlusion or presence of neurosensory deficit between the groups. Initially successful lysis was significantly greater with intra\u2010arterial (IA) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt\u2010PA) than with either streptokinase (Sk) (P < 0.04) or intravenous (IV) rt\u2010PA (P < 0.01). The duration of therapy varied from a median of 35 h with IA rt\u2010PA to 40 h with Sk (P > 0.5). The median (confidence interval) increase in ankle:brachial pressure index following IA rt\u2010PA of 0.57 (0.33\u20130.82) was significantly higher than for either Sk of 0.24 (0\u20130.57) or for IV rt\u2010PA of 0.18 (0\u20130.41). Limb salvage at 30 days was achieved in 80, 60 and 45 per cent respectively for IA rt\u2010PA, Sk and IV rt\u2010PA. Haemorrhagic complications occurred in six patients following Sk and in 13 following IV rt\u2010PA; only one minor haemorrhage occurred following a catheter perforation in a patient who received IA rt\u2010PA (P < 0.05). IA rt\u2010PA provides a more effective, safer fibrinolytic regimen than conventional therapy with Sk. IV rt\u2010PA has not been as successful and carries a significantly higher risk of haemorrhagic complications.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nIntra-arterial thrombolysis is commonly used as the initial treatment of acute or subacute lower extremity ischemia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the efficacy and cost of thrombolysis, we retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive cases (87 patients) in which intra-arterial lysis (urokinase) was used as the initial treatment for native arterial lower extremity occlusive disease. The mean age of patients was 67 years, 57% of the patients were male, and preexisting peripheral vascular disease was present in 74%. Presenting symptoms were limb-threatening ischemia (53%) and claudication (47%). Acute symptoms (< 2 weeks' duration) were present in 48%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 30-day morbidity rate was 31%, and four patients died. Complications were significant bleeding (23%), ischemic stroke (1%), and renal failure with (2%) and without (2%) dialysis. Concomitant angioplasty was performed in 63%. Complete or significant lysis as demonstrated with angiography was achieved in 75% of iliac, 58% of femoropopliteal, and 41% of crural vessels (P <.001). Within 30 days of lysis, 9% of patients underwent major amputation and 20% surgical revascularization (in 3 patients the extent of revascularization was lessened by the lytic therapy). Amputation-free survival was 83% and 75% at 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Relief of ischemia (defined as relief of claudication or limb salvage without major surgical intervention) was achieved in only 70% and 43% of patients at 30 days and 2 years, respectively (Kaplan-Meier analysis; mean follow-up, 31 months). Patients with aortoiliac disease had significantly better outcomes than those with infrainguinal disease (P =.03). Duration or type of presenting symptoms did not predict outcome. The cost of the initial hospitalization per patient for thrombolysis was $18,490.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThrombolysis can be as or more costly than surgery and is associated with a suboptimal outcome in a significant number of patients. These data lead us to caution against a uniform policy of initial thrombolysis for patients who present with lower extremity ischemia.",

To decrease these complications, multiple different endovascular modalities have been developed and used to treat this challenging problem. Physicians are now left with a broad array of endovascular and surgical options. Unfortunately, there are little data that accurately compare these modalities. Therefore, an individual approach to each patient with acute ischemia from thromboembolic disease must be employed. In order to tailor the treatment to the needs of each patient, the physician must be familiar with the techniques, complications, technology, and relative strengths and weaknesses of each treatment modality. This article will first outline the main technical considerations for performing surgical thromboembolectomy. The complications of operative thromboembolectomy will then be discussed followed by the data comparing operative and nonoperative therapy.

        "abstract": "Purpose: To analyze alteplase solutions following delivery through the AngioJet Xpeedior rheolytic thrombectomy device to characterize the viability of proteins exposed to high shear stress. Methods: Alteplase solutions were prepared by reconstitution in sterile water to obtain a targeted concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. A baseline control sample was obtained. The AngioJet system was modified by occluding the return line to allow collection of the dispersed fluid volume. Alteplase solutions (n=5) were delivered through the 6-F, 120-cm Xpeedior catheter and collected. All samples were assayed and compared to baseline using qualitative visual inspection, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, size exclusion chromatography, and in vitro clot lysis assays. Results: Analysis of the test solutions demonstrated a mean protein recovery of 98.0%\u00b13.5% of targeted concentration; the collected protein was fully active, as determined by clot lysis assays (specific activity \u2265100%). All samples were clear and colorless. No significant fragmentation or aggregation of protein was observed. Conclusions: Alteplase solutions, when delivered through the AngioJet Xpeedior rheolytic thrombectomy device, remain stable and biologically active in vitro.

        "abstract": "Objectives: The study evaluated long\u2010term limb salvage and survival of an endovascular approach that incorporates mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in the management of arterial thrombosis. Background: Acute limb ischemia is associated with a high risk of amputation and death. Previous reports from the United States (U.S.) of surgical and nonsurgical treatments are limited to primarily 30 days to 1 year. Methods: Single\u2010center, retrospective review of 57 consecutive patients (30 male, 27 female; mean age 63.8 \u00b1 13.8 years) treated for limb threatening ischemia due to thrombotic arterial occlusions. Data includes baseline assessments, procedural outcomes, in\u2010hospital complications, 30\u2010day, and long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Results: Ninety\u2010three percent of patients (n = 53) presented with onset of symptoms (<14 days). Angiography following PMT showed thrombus removal complete/substantial 36 (63.6%), partial 16 (28.0%), and minimal 5 (8.8%), respectively. Catheter\u2010directed thrombolysis was used after PMT in 18 patients (31.6%). In\u2010hospital success with limb salvage was attained in 96.5% (n = 55) with mortality of 3.5% (n = 2). Thirty\u2010day limb salvage and mortality were 94.7% (n = 54) and 5.3% (n = 3), respectively. At mean 5\u2010year follow\u2010up (mean = 62 months), three patients have been lost to follow\u2010up. The results of 54/57 (94.7%) are available. Amputation free survival was 94.7% (n = 36/38) with long\u2010term mortality rate of 29.6% (n = 16/54). Conclusions: Acute limb ischemia treated with PMT alone or in combination with thrombolysis, followed by definitive therapy, results in favorable long\u2010term limb salvage. Allowing for appreciable long\u2010term mortality in vascular patients, survivors demonstrate amputation\u2010free success from the initial endovascular procedure with low reintervention rate. \u00a9 2008 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

Materials and Methods From July 2004 to March 2008, eleven patients with acute upper limb ischemia were enrolled in this study. They were initially treated with thrombolysis (n = 1), PAT (n = 6), or both (n = 4) via a femoral artery approach. However, all of the patients had residual thrombus in the brachial artery, which was subsequently managed by PAT via the transbrachial approach for removal of residual emboli. Results Successful re-canalization after PAT via a transbrachial approach was achieved in all patients. Two patients experienced early complications: one experienced a massive hematoma of the upper arm due to incomplete compression and was treated by stent deployment. The other patient experienced a re-occlusion of the brachial artery the day after the procedure due to excessive manual compression of the puncture site, but did not show recurrence of ischemic symptoms in the artery of the upper arm. Clinical success with complete resolution of ischemic symptoms was achieved in all patients. Conclusion PAT via a transbrachial approach is a safe and effective treatment for patients with acute upper limb ischemia.",
