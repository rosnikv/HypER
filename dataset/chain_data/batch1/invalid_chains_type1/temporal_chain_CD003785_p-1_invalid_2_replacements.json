        "title": "How antirheumatic drugs protect joints from damage in rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "Therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aims forthe containment of chronic inflammation as well asstructural protection of the affected joints. Both reduc-tion of inflammation and protection of joints fromdamage are considered central therapeutic goals in RA.Virtually all therapeutic agents used and developed forthe treatment of RA have been assessed for theirpotential to reach these 2 goals and, ideally, combine anantiinflammatory effect with a structure-sparing effect.Since the molecular mechanisms of synovitis, which areresponsible for the \u201cinflammatory\u201d signs of disease suchas swelling, pain, and stiffness, differ from the mecha-nisms leading to structural damage, antirheumatic drugsideally have to affect both mechanisms of disease.Inflammatory signs of RA are based on a chronicinflammatory process in the synovial membrane, whichis the result of an enhanced influx of immune cells aswell as synovial hyperplasia (1,2). Physiologically, only afew cells migrate into the normal synovium through thesynovial microvessels, and few cells escape this compart-ment to move toward regional lymph nodes through thelymphoendothelial microvessels. The enhanced influx ofimmune cells in inflammatory arthritis is regulated bychemokine and adhesion molecule expression in thesynovial tissue, which is induced by inflammatory cyto-kines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF ) andinterleukin-1 (IL-1). Thus, joints are literally flooded byimmune cells, which accumulate in the synovial spaceand overflow the efflux mechanism through the lym-phatic vessels (3). This influx of immune cells, includingmacrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils,and mast cells, is accompanied by a response of theresident synovial fibroblasts (synovial hyperplasia),which express genes rendering them resistant to apopto-tic cell death as well as angiogenesis. Importantly, how-ever, this chronic inflammatory process in the synovialmembrane leads to profound damage of the surroundingtissue, particularly cartilage and bone. These destructivemechanisms are a consequence of an imbalance betweencatabolic and anabolic pathways induced by cytokinesand mediated by matrix-degrading enzymes (aggre-canases and matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]) pro-duced by effector cells, including osteoclasts, fibroblasts,leukocytes, and chondrocytes.It is evident that inflammation is the driving forcein RA and gives rise to structural damage during thecourse of disease. The greater the inflammatory load towhich joints are exposed, the more likely it is forstructural damage to occur and the faster such damagewill progress. Risk predictors of structural damage inRA are thus the parameters that quantify inflammatoryload, such as the number of swollen joints or the level ofC-reactive protein (CRP) (4\u20136). Another key link be-tween inflammation and structural damage is time. Thelonger inflammation lasts, the more likely structuraldamage is to occur. Disease duration and parametersthat predict chronicity of arthritis, such as the presenceof anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and/orrheumatoid factor, are associated with structural dam-age in RA (3\u20136). It is thus the chronicity of inflamma-tion that gives rise to structural damage of joints, andthisiswellreflected,forexample,bytheobservationthata transitory decrease in the acute component ofinflammation upon treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not sufficient to achieve jointprotection. Accumulation of joint damage during thecourse of RA requires the presence of synovitis, which",

        "title": "How tumour necrosis factor blockers interfere with tuberculosis immunity",
        "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immunity to numerous bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept are anti\u2010TNF agents used to treat a range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The use of some of these drugs has been linked to reactivation TB. In addition to blocking TNF\u2010mediated immune responses, some anti\u2010TNF drugs have been found to interfere with innate immune responses, such as phagolysosomal maturation and monocyte apoptosis, as well as cell\u2010mediated responses, including interferon\u2010\u03b3 secretion by memory T cells, complement\u2010mediated lysis of Mtb\u2010reactive CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cell activity. This review summarizes some of the reported effects of TNF blockers on immune cell responses in the context of the observed clinical data on TB reactivation in patients on anti\u2010TNF therapy.",

        "title": "Incidence of Tuberculosis Among Korean Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis Who Are Taking Tumor Necrosis Factor Blockers",
        "abstract": "Objective. To assess the incidence and relative risk of new tuberculosis (TB) infections in Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and patients with AS who are undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Methods. New cases of TB were identified by reviewing the medical records of 919 patients with AS not treated with TNF blockers and those of 354 patients with AS treated with adalimumab (n = 66), infliximab (n = 78), or etanercept (n = 210) between 2002 and 2009. Reference data were obtained from the Korean National Tuberculosis Association. Results. The mean incidence rate of TB was 69.8 per 100,000 person-years (PY) in the general population, 308 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, and 561 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort. The incidence rate of TB in the infliximab-treated AS cohort (540 per 100,000 PY) was higher than that in the adalimumab-treated AS cohort (490 per 100,000 PY). No cases of TB occurred in the etanercept-treated AS cohort. Comparing the relative risks of TB infections between the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort and the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, no statistically significant difference was identified (risk ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.144\u20131.913). Conclusion. The risk of TB was higher in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort than it was in the general population. However, the risk of TB was not increased in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort compared with the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort. Among patients with AS, etanercept is associated with a lower risk of TB compared with monoclonal antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Background Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The objective of the present study was to determine the rate of active TB infection in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and to determine the results of their latent TB infection (LTBI) screening tests during the follow up. Methods This is a retrospective observational study of IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. Tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA), and chest radiography were used to determine LTBI. Active TB infection rate during anti-TNF treatment was determined. Results Seventy-six IBD patients (25 with ulcerative colitis, 51 with Crohn\u2019s disease; 53 male; mean age 42.0\u00b112.4 years) were included. Forty-four (57.9%) patients received infliximab and 32 (42.1%) adalimumab. Their median duration of anti-TNF therapy was 15 months. Forty-five (59.2%) patients had LTBI and received isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis. During the follow-up period, active TB was identified in 3 (4.7%) patients who were not receiving INH prophylaxis. There was a moderate concordance between the TST and the IGRA (kappa coefficient 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.76). Patients with or without immunosuppressive therapy did not differ significantly with respect to TST (P=0.318) and IGRA (P=0.157). Conclusion IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and prophylactic INH have a decreased risk of developing active TB infection. However, despite LTBI screening, the risk of developing active TB infection persists.",
