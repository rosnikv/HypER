        "title": "Effect of cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate on pancreatic replacement therapy in cystic fibrosis.",
        "abstract": "Fifteen patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency were studied during four randomised seven day treatment periods in which they received only pancreatic supplement (Pancrelipase, 27 capsules per day) or supplement plus cimetidine (20 mg/kg body weight/24 h) or sodium bicarbonate (15 g/m2/24 h) alone or in combination. Dietary intake was not fixed but was restricted to foods of known fat and nitrogen content from which daily intakes could be computed. Faecal fat and nitrogen were calculated as g/24 h and percentage of intake. Addition of either cimetidine or bicarbonate resulted in significant improvement in fat and nitrogen excretion, which was not greater with the combination of both drugs. Cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate in these doses are therefore sufficient to produce maximal improvement in digestive activity of pancreatic supplements. Fat excretion per gram of intake fell with cimetidine and bicarbonate from 12 times the normal level, to normal, in patients consuming less than 120 g fat daily. Above this intake the dose of pancreatic supplement appeared to be inadequate. Faecal nitrogen excretion increased with nitrogen intake in all four periods, but, in contrast with fat excretion, the response to cimetidine and bicarbonate was not affected by the level of intake. Dietary intake appears to be a significant factor in determining the faecal output of fat and nitrogen in patients with pancreatic insufficiency and should be considered when determining the optimum amount of pancreatic supplementation.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic lipase and colipase secretion was assessed in 64 patients with pancreatic disease, 24 of whom had steatorrhea, and in 14 control subjects. A wide range of lipase and colipase secretion was seen in patients both with and without steatorrhea. Considerable loss of pancreatic lipase and colipase secretion had to occur before steatorrhea developed, as the highest hourly secretion of lipase and colipase in this group of patients was less than 4% and less than 2%, respectively, of the lowest values recorded in normal subjects. Colipase and lipase outputs were very strongly correlated (r = 0.96) throughout the range of pancreatic function. Lipase was always unsaturated with respect to colipase, but in only a limited number of patients with relatively low pancreatic secretion was the degree of unsaturation greater than 2 standard deviations below the mean. The importance of low saturation or low colipase secretion was evident in a group of 11 patients with a narrow range of lipase secretion in a transitional zone between secretion rates associated with steatorrhea and with normal fat excretion. In this group, 7 patients were identified in whom colipase deficiency appeared to be the sole cause of steatorrhea. The correlation of colipase secretion with the level of fecal fat excretion was highly significant (p less than 0.001) and indicated that fat digestion and subsequent fat absorption depended on colipase secretion up to at least a level of 25% fecal fat excretion. Nonpancreatic factors could well govern the extent of fat absorption above this level, as colipase secretory values in this range were uniformly low.",

        "abstract": "In order to define basic biliary defects not related to steatorrhoea in cystic fibrosis, we studied 12 control and 18 cystic fibrosis subjects, with a wide range of pancreatic function. Duodenal aspirates were collected over three consecutive 20 minute periods, during continuous intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin and secretin using a marker perfusion technique, and analysed for pancreatic enzyme output (colipase, lipase, trypsin), bile acid output and concentration, and biliary lipids. Cystic fibrosis patients, at all levels of pancreatic function, had significantly reduced total bile acid output (mumol/kg/h) with delayed appearance of the bile acid peak, compared with control subjects. Actual duodenal bile acid concentrations were significantly higher in cystic fibrosis subjects than in controls, however, probably because of the markedly reduced water output shown in these patients. The lithogenic index was not raised in cystic fibrosis patients at any level of pancreatic function. The reduced bile acid output and the delayed peak appearance probably reflect a defect in gall bladder responsiveness which is independent of pancreatic function and steatorrhoea. Whether this defect is related to gall bladder filling or a defective peptide hormone response awaits further study.",

A total of 72 infants were confirmed as having CF during 4 years of screening. Twenty\u2010eight infants were found to have CF during 2 years in which screening was not performed. There were 29 false positive diagnoses during the screening years and six false negative diagnoses. Three of the false negative diagnoses occurred because of laboratory error, but three occurred because either the first or second measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) was normal. Faecal chymotrypsin was measured in samples from 434 infants at the time of the second IRT and assisted with the diagnosis for one infant which might otherwise have been missed. Only 42.5% of infants were asymptomatic at the time of the confirmatory sweat test. Significant morbidity and mortality was associated with meconium ileus which occurred in 24% of infants with CF. Improved ascertainment of cases of CF has occurred since screening began. Further follow\u2010up is required to determine other benefits of newborn screening.",

        "abstract": "Although enzymically active trypsin is not present in blood, a very small amount of the zymogen secreted by the endocrine pancreas appears to enter the circulation directly and is normally detectable in the blood by immunoassay (immunoreactive trypsin, lRT). An early stage of the exocrine pancreatic pathology in newborn infants affected by cystic fibrosis (CF) results in greater than normal amounts of IRT entering the circulation, and this occurs whether or not there are clinical symptoms and signs of the disease. For this reason measurement of IRT in whole blood spots has been proposed as a method for the detection of CF through newborn population screening. During the past decade the performance of this test has been evaluated in several population screening trials; this review describes the assays used and the results obtained. The screening strategy generally adopted is aimed at identifying infants who have prolonged neonatal hypertrypsinaemia, who are then sweat tested to confirm the diagnosis. With fairly few exceptions these trials have succeeded in detecting 91-981170 of affected infants following repeat IRT testing of 0'3-0\u00b77% of the population initially screened, with a predictive value for CF in infants with positive repeat tests of 52-86%.

        "abstract": "Familial defective apoB-100 (R3500Q) [FDB (R3500Q)] is caused by a mutation in the apoB gene (2p23.24). Almost all individuals with this disorder are of European descent, and in almost all cases the mutation is on a chromosome with a rare haplotype (194) at the apoB locus, suggesting that all FDB (R3500Q) probands are descended from a common ancestor in whom the original mutation occurred. The distribution of the mutation is consistent with an origin in Europe 6000-7000 years ago. We have estimated the amount of recombination between the apoB gene and markers on chromosome 2 in 34 FDB (R3500Q) probands in whom the mutation is on a 194 haplotype. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found between the apoB gene and marker D2S220. We have identified three YACs that contain the apoB gene and D2S220. The shortest restriction fragment common to the three YACs that contained both loci was 240 kb long. No shorter fragments with both loci were identified. On the assumption that 1000 kb corresponds to 1 cM, we deduce that the recombination distance between D2S220 and the apoB gene is about 0.24 cM. Combining this value with the linkage disequilibrium observed between the two loci in the probands, we estimate that the ancestral mutation occurred about 270 generations ago. We postulate that the original mutation occurred in the common ancestor of living FDB (R3500Q) probands, who lived in Europe about 6750 years ago. The errors in this estimate are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Familial defective apolipoprotein B100 (FDB) is a genetic disorder in which low density lipoproteins (LDL) bind defectively to the LDL receptor, resulting in hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. FDB is caused by a mutation (R3500Q) that changes the conformation of apolipoprotein (apo) B100 near the receptor-binding site. We previously showed that arginine, not simply a positive charge, at residue 3500 is essential for normal receptor binding and that the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 is necessary for mutations affecting arginine 3500 to disrupt LDL receptor binding. Thus, normal receptor binding involves an interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369 in the carboxyl tail of apoB100. W4369Y LDL and R3500Q LDL isolated from transgenic mice had identically defective LDL binding and a higher affinity for the monoclonal antibody MB47, which has an epitope flanking residue 3500. We conclude that arginine 3500 interacts with tryptophan 4369 and facilitates the conformation of apoB100 required for normal receptor binding of LDL. From our findings, we developed a model that explains how the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 interacts with the backbone of apoB100 that enwraps the LDL particle. Our model also explains how all known ligand-defective mutations in apoB100, including a newly discovered R3480W mutation in apoB100, cause defective receptor binding.",

Our aim was to determine whether the presence of the -516C/T polymorphism in the APOB gene promoter modifies insulin sensitivity to dietary fat. We studied fifty-nine healthy volunteers (thirty men and twenty-nine women, thirty-six homozygotes for the -516C allele (C/C) (nineteen males and seventeen females) and twenty-three heterozygotes for the -516T allele (C/T) (eleven males and twelve females)). Subjects consumed three diets during the feeding study, 4 weeks each: an SFA-rich diet (38 % fat, 20 % SFA), followed by a carbohydrate (CHO)-rich diet (30 % fat, 55 % CHO) or a MUFA-rich diet (38 % fat, 22 % MUFA) following a randomised cross-over design. For each diet, we investigated peripheral insulin sensitivity with the insulin suppression test. Male carriers of the -516T allele showed a significantly greater decrease in steady-state plasma glucose concentrations when changing from the SFA-rich diet (9.18 (sd 1.35) mmol/l) to the MUFA (6.55 (sd 0.74) mmol/l) or the CHO (6.31 (sd 0.93) mmol/l) diets than did those who were homozygous for the C allele (P = 0.040). Furthermore, C/T subjects presented higher plasma NEFA values after consumption of the SFA diet compared with the MUFA and CHO diets (P = 0.001). This effect was not observed in females (P = 0.908). Our findings show that male carriers of the -516T allele, C/T, have a significant increase in insulin resistance after consumption of all diets, but the difference is more exaggerated after the SFA diet compared with the MUFA- and CHO-rich diets.",

        "abstract": "Gene polymorphisms provide a means to obtain unconfounded associations between carotenoids and various health outcomes. In the present study, we tested whether gene polymorphisms and gene scores linked to low serum carotenoid status are related to metabolic disturbance and depressive symptoms in African-American adults residing in Baltimore city, MD, using cross-sectional data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (age range 30\u201364 years, n 873\u2013994). We examined twenty-four SNP of various gene loci that were previously shown to be associated with low serum carotenoid status (SNPlcar). Gene risk scores were created: five low specific-carotenoid risk scores (LSCRS: \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lutein+zeaxanthin, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and lycopene) and one low total-carotenoid risk score (LTCRS: total carotenoids). SNPlcar, LSCRS and LTCRS were entered as predictors for a number of health outcomes. These included obesity, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III metabolic syndrome and its components, elevated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, hyperuricaemia and elevated depressive symptoms (EDS, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression score \u2265 16). Among the key findings, SNPlcar were not associated with the main outcomes after correction for multiple testing. However, an inverse association was found between the LTCRS and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) dyslipidaemia. Specifically, the \u03b1-carotene and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin LSCRS were associated with a lower odds of HDL-C dyslipidaemia. However, the \u03b2-cryptoxanthin LSCRS was linked to a higher odds of EDS, with a linear dose\u2013response relationship. In summary, gene risk scores linked to low serum carotenoids had mixed effects on HDL-C dyslipidaemia and EDS. Further studies using larger African-American population samples are needed.",

Serum \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotenoid concentrations were measured in \u223c570 (\u03b1-carotene in 565 and \u03b2-carotene in 572) of these children with the use of an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-photodiode array. We determined heritabilities for both carotenoids and examined their genetic relation with 10 obesity-related traits [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, fat mass (FM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin and glucose, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance] by using family data and a variance components approach. For these analyses, carotenoid values were inverse normalized, and all traits were adjusted for significant covariate effects of age and sex.Results: Carotenoid concentrations were highly heritable and significant [\u03b1-carotene: heritability (h2) = 0.81, P = 6.7 \u00d7 10-11; \u03b2-carotene: h2 = 0.90, P = 3.5 \u00d7 10-15].

This study aimed to estimate the contribution of both genetic and common environmental effects to the variance of carotenoid concentrations and to test whether their phenotypic correlations with cardiometabolic risk factors are explained by shared genetic and environmental effects. Plasma carotenoid concentrations (\u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids) of 48 healthy subjects were measured. Heritability estimates of carotenoid concentrations were calculated using the variance component method.

Significant phenotypic correlations between carotenoid concentrations and cardiometabolic risk factors were obtained for \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and zeaxanthin. Familial resemblances in lycopene concentrations were mainly attributable to common environmental effects, while for lutein concentrations they were attributable to genetic and common environmental effects. Common genetic and environmental factors may influence carotenoids and cardiometabolic risk factors, but further studies are needed to better understand the potential impact on disease development.",
