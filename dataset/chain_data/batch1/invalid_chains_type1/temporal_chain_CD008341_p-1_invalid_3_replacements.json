        "title": "Non-infectious pulmonary complications of newer biological agents for rheumatic diseases--a systematic literature review.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewAdvances in genetics and clinical diagnostics, along with recently described clinical entities and refined classification schemes, have improved our understanding of diffuse and interstitial lung diseases in children. This review presents recent updates in these disorders in the context of systemic inflammatory conditions. Recent findingsClassification of childhood diffuse lung disease (DLD) using adult paradigms is not useful. Distinct clinical\u2013pathologic entities exist in children. Infants are more likely to present with genetic and developmental disorders, and older children with inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions. A combination of clinical evaluation, high-resolution computed tomography scanning, pulmonary function testing and serology, with bronchoscopy and surgical lung biopsy in selected cases, is most useful in the evaluation of DLD in the context of rheumatologic conditions. Common causes of DLD, such as infection, especially in the setting of immunodeficiency, must be ruled out. Optimal therapy for specific disorders will require careful analysis of data from national registries. Emerging use of biomarkers and high-throughput molecular analysis will yield novel insight into these disorders. SummaryIn the setting of known or suspected rheumatologic disorders, diagnosis and management of DLD are challenging, and require close collaboration among rheumatologists, pulmonologists, and other specialists.",

        "title": "Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease: Safety of Biological Antirheumatic Drugs and Assessment of Pulmonary Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accompanying the increased number of reports on the development or exacerbation of ILD in RA patients following therapy with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) has aroused renewed interest. Although such cases have been reported mainly in association with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the use of other biological DMARDs has also become a matter of concern. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between the use of biological DMARDs and either the development or exacerbation of ILD. Such pulmonary complications may occur in the natural course of RA regardless of the use of biological DMARDs. Since rheumatologists currently aim to achieve remission in RA patients, the administration of biological DMARDs is increasing, even for those with RA-ILD. However, there are no reliable, evidence-based guidelines for deciding whether biological DMARDs can be safely introduced and continued in RA-ILD patients. A standardized staging system for pulmonary conditions of RA-ILD patients is needed when making therapeutic decisions at baseline and monitoring during biological DMARD therapy. Based on the available information regarding the safety of biological DMARDs and the predictive factors for a worse prognosis, this review discusses candidate parameters for risk evaluation of ILD in RA patients who are scheduled to receive biological antirheumatic therapy.",

        "title": "Acute Respiratory Events in Connective Tissue Disorders",
        "abstract": "Subacute-acute, hyperacute, or even catastrophic and fulminant respiratory events occur in almost all classic connective tissue disorders (CTDs); they may share systemic life-threatening manifestations, may precipitously lead to respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support as well as a combination of specific therapeutic measures, and in most affected patients constitute the devastating end-of-life event. In CTDs, acute respiratory events may be related to any respiratory compartment including the airways, lung parenchyma, alveolar capillaries, lung vessels, pleura, and ventilatory muscles. Acute respiratory events may also precipitate disease-specific extrapulmonary organ involvement such as aspiration pneumonia and lead to digestive tract involvement and heart-related respiratory events. Finally, antirheumatic drug-related acute respiratory toxicity as well as lung infections related to the rheumatic disease and/or to immunosuppression complete the spectrum of acute respiratory events. Overall, in CTDs the lungs significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality, since they constitute a common site of disease involvement; a major site of infections related to the \u2018mater' disease; a major site of drug-related toxicity, and a common site of treatment-related infectious complications. The extreme spectrum of the abovementioned events, as well as the \u2018vicious' coexistence of most of the aforementioned manifestations, requires skills, specific diagnostic and therapeutic means, and most of all a multidisciplinary approach of adequately prepared and expert scientists. Avoiding lung disease might represent a major concern for future advancements in the treatment of autoimmune disorders.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent and severe complication of connective tissue disease (CTD). Areas covered In this narrative review, we update the most relevant differential characteristics of fibrotic ILD associated with CTD (CTD-ILD) and propose a diagnostic and therapeutic approach based on a review of the articles published between 2002 and 2022 through PubMed. Expert opinion The subset of ILD, mainly the radiological/histological pattern and the degree of fibrotic component, usually determines the prognosis and therapeutic strategy for these patients. Some patients with CTD-ILD can develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) with severe deterioration of lung function, rapid progression to chronic respiratory failure, and high mortality. PPF has been described in many CTDs, mainly in systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and requires a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic approach to improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a growing concern as the immunocompromised population expands. Current laboratory approaches are limited. This systematic review aimed to evaluate metagenomic next-generation sequencing (MNGS) tests\u2019 performance in detecting PCP. Methods Five databases were searched through December 19, 2022, to identify original studies comparing MNGS with clinically diagnosed PCP. To assess the accuracy, symmetric hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models were used. Results Eleven observational studies reporting 1442 patients (424 with PCP) were included. Six studies focused exclusively on recipients of biologic immunosuppression (none with HIV-associated immunosuppression). Six were exclusively on bronchoalveolar lavage, while 1 was on blood samples. The sensitivity of MGNS was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90\u20130.99), and specificity was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92\u20130.98), with negative and positive likelihood ratios of 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01\u20130.05) and 19.31 (95% CI, 10.26\u201336.36), respectively. A subgroup analysis of studies exclusively including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78\u20130.99) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80\u20130.98) and a specificity of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88\u20130.99) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.76\u20131.00), respectively. The sensitivity analysis on recipients of biologic immunosuppression showed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90\u20130.98) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.84\u20130.98), respectively. The overall confidence in the estimates was low. Conclusions Despite the low certainty of evidence, MNGS detects PCP with high sensitivity and specificity. This also applies to recipients of biologic immunosuppression and tests performed exclusively on blood samples without the need for BAL. Further studies are required in individuals with HIV-associated immunosuppression.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Metagenomic next-generation sequencing(mNGS) is a novel molecular diagnostic technique. For nucleic acid extraction methods, both whole-cell DNA (wcDNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are widely applied with the sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We aim to evaluate the clinical value of mNGS with cfDNA and mNGS with wcDNA for the detection of BALF pathogens in non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis. Methods mNGS with BALF-cfDNA, BALF-wcDNA and conventional microbiological tests (CMTs) were performed in suspected non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnostic value of different assays for pulmonary aspergillosis was compared. Results BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) outperformed CMTs in terms of microorganisms detection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) was superior to culture and BALF-GM. Combination diagnosis of either positive for BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) or CMTs is more sensitive than CMTs alone in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis (BALF-cfDNA+CMTs/BALF-wcDNA+CMTs vs. CMTs: ROC analysis: 0.813 vs.0.66, P=0.0142/0.796 vs.0.66, P=0.0244; Sensitivity: 89.47% vs. 47.37%, P=0.008/84.21% vs. 47.37%, P=0.016). BALF-cfDNA showed a significantly greater reads per million (RPM) than BALF-wcDNA. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for RPM of Aspergillus detected by BALF-cfDNA, used to predict \u201cTrue positive\u201d pulmonary aspergillosis patients, was 0.779, with a cut-off value greater than 4.5. Conclusion We propose that the incorporation of BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) with CMTs improves diagnostic precision in the identification of non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis when compared to CMTs alone. BALF-cfDNA outperforms BALF-wcDNA in clinical value.",
