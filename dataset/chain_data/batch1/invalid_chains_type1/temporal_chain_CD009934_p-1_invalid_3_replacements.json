        "title": "Antioxidative and Antidiabetic Effects of Natural Polyphenols and Isoflavones",
        "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Soy and soy\u2010based foods are considered healthy, particularly in many Asia\u2013Pacific countries, where soy products have long been consumed. Soy and soy\u2010related products have been found to help prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. These products can also have antioxidative effects that alleviate hot flashes during menopause and bone loss. These biological and therapeutic functions are primarily due to the isoflavones derived from soy, whose structure is similar to the structure of 17\u2010\u03b2\u2010oestradiol. Despite the many health benefits for humans and animals, the application of isoflavones remains controversial because of their anti\u2010oestrogenic properties. We focused on general information regarding isoflavones, as well as their structure, function, and application. We summarized evidence showing that dietary or supplemental isoflavones exert protective effects on the health of humans and animals. Based on the literature, we conclude that soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe; however, more high\u2010quality trials are needed to fully substantiate their potential use.",

        "title": "Potential of phytochemicals in breast cancer prevention and therapy",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide among females (Bray et al., 2018). Breast cancer alone accounts for 30% of all new cancer diagnoses in women in the United States (Siegel, Miller, & Jemal, 2019), with 1,762,450 new cancer cases (and 606,880 cancer deaths) projected to occur in 2019 (Siegel et al., 2019). The situation is even worse in developing countries, which have limited healthcare resources and use different strategies to diagnose breast cancer (da Costa Vieira, Biller, Uemura, Ruiz, & Curado, 2017). Breast cancer patients seek for alternative therapies, mostly herbal remedies, as supportive care during cancer treatment, although the evidence of effectiveness is very limited (Greenlee et al. 2017). Moreover, phytochemicals are frequently examined for search of new bioactive molecules as well as potential adjuvants in conventional anticancer therapies with numerous examples in the recent literature in our Journal and elsewhere (Newman & Cragg, 2016; Thakur & Ahirwar, 2017; Tariq et al., 2017; Liao, Apaya, & Shyur, 2013; Bae et al., 2017; Lin, Gong, Song, & Cui, 2017; Pagano, Romano, Izzo, & Borrelli, 2018; Marian, 2017; Lukong, Ogunbolude, & Kamdem, 2017 Salehi et al., 2018; Erices, Torres, Niechi, Bernales, & Quezada, 2018; Hsiao, Lin, Wang, Hsin, & Yang, 2019). This PTR Virtual Issue\u2014freely available at https://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/journal/10991573\u2014focuses on the experimental and clinical pharmacology of plant\u2010derived compounds in breast cancer. The issue includes three review articles, one clinical trial, and 19 experimental studies. The published review articles highlight the potential of green tea and phytoestrogens in breast cancer prevention (Anandhi Senthilkumar, Fata, & Kennelly, 2018; Najaf Najafi, Salehi, Ghazanfarpour, Hoseini, & Khadem\u2010Rezaiyan, 2018; Xiao, Zhang, Tong, & Shi, 2018). Similarly, there is evidence in the literature that the consumption of both green tea and phytoestrogens\u2010containing vegetables could be correlated with a low incidence of other chronic pathologies, such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Peluso & Serafini, 2017; Andrew & Izzo, 2017; Rietjens, Louisse, & Beekmann, 2017; Bedrood, Rameshrad, & Hosseinzadeh, 2018;).

        "abstract": "Revision operations have become a new issue after successful artificial joint replacements, and periprosthetic osteolysis leading to prosthetic loosening is the main cause of why the overactivation of osteoclasts (OCs) plays an important role. The effect of biochanin A (BCA) has been examined in osteoporosis, but no study on the role of BCA in prosthetic loosening osteolysis has been conducted yet. In this study, we utilised enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, computed tomography imaging, and histological analysis. Results showed that BCA downregulated the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), and IL\u20101\u03b2 to suppress inflammatory responses. The secretion levels of receptor\u2010activated nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB ligand, CTX\u20101, and osteoclast\u2010associated receptor as well as Ti\u2010induced osteolysis were also reduced. BCA effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed hydroxyapatite resorption by downregulating OC\u2010related genes in vitro. Analysis of mechanisms indicated that BCA inhibited the signalling pathways of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (P38, extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase, and c\u2010JUN N\u2010terminal kinase) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (inhibitor \u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and P65), thereby downregulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 and c\u2010Fos. In conclusion, BCA may be an alternative choice for the prevention of prosthetic loosening caused by OCs.",

Its abnormal activation can cause serious osteolysis related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Paget\u2019s disease and osteoporosis. In recent years, the adverse effects caused by anabolic anti-osteolytic drugs have increased the interest of researchers in the potential therapeutic and preventive effects of natural plant derivatives and natural compounds against osteolytic diseases caused by osteoclasts. Natural plant derivatives and natural compounds have become major research hotspots for the treatment of osteolysis-related diseases due to their good safety profile and ability to improve bone. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of RANKL and downstream signaling pathways in osteoclast differentiation, and briefly outlines potential natural compounds with antiosteoclast activity and molecular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Periodontal disease and arthroplasty prosthesis loosening and destabilization are both associated with osteolysis, which is predominantly caused by abnormal bone resorption triggered by pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Osteoclasts (OCs) are critical players in the process. Concerns regarding the long\u2010term efficacy and side effects of current frontline therapies, however, remain. Alternative therapies are still required. The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of Tenacissoside H (TDH) in RANKL\u2010mediated OC differentiation, as well as inflammatory osteolysis and associated processes. In vitro, bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (BMMs) cultured with RANKL and M\u2010CSF were used to detect TDH in the differentiation and function of OCs. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of specific genes and inflammatory factors in OCs. Western blot was used to identify NFATc1, IKK, NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPK pathway, and oxidative stress\u2010related components. Finally, an LPS\u2010mediated calvarial osteolysis mouse model was employed to explore TDH's role in inflammatory osteolysis. The results showed that in vivo TDH inhibited the differentiation and resorption functions of OCs and down\u2010regulated the transcription of osteoclast\u2010specific genes, as well as Il\u20101\u03b2, Il\u20106 and Tnf\u2010\u03b1. In addition, TDH inhibited the IKK and NF\u2010\u03baB signalling pathways and down\u2010regulated the level of ROS. In vivo studies revealed that TDH improves the bone loss caused by LPS. TDH may be a new candidate or treatment for osteoclast\u2010associated inflammatory osteolytic disease.",
