        "title": "Hypoxaemia and Supplemental Oxygen Therapy in the First 24 Hours after Myocardial Infarction: The Role of Pulse Oximetry",
        "abstract": "Objective To assess the incidence and degree of hypoxaemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate the nation-wide perception and usage of oxygen therapy. Design Postal survey of all coronary care units (CCU) in England of their use of prescribed oxygen and pulse oximetry. Prospective randomised study of 50 patients presenting within 24 hours of onset of myocardial infarction, half of whom received oxygen therapy. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) as continuously measured by pulse oximetry, and arrhythmias and ST segment changes were recorded on simultaneous 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitors. Results In 53% of UK coronary care units oxygen is not routinely prescribed but in only 3% is a pulse oximeter used to aid management. In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction the incidence of hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 90%) was 70% and severe hypoxaemia 35% in those not given oxygen, compared with only 27% and 4% in patients given oxygen therapy. The only patient to receive oxygen on clinical grounds had an oxygen saturation of 71%. Severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 80%) occurred significantly less often (1 and 7 patients, p < 0.05) in patients given oxygen. There were no differences in arrhythmias or ST segment changes between groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemia occurs frequently in patients in the first 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction. It is effectively and easily treated with supplemental oxygen which can be guided by pulse oximetry. This is rarely done. Measurements of oxygen saturation are therefore justified in all patients to guide oxygen therapy unless there is a decision to give all patients supplemental oxygen: this we believe to be unnecessary.",

        "abstract": "Context: International guidelines recommend the routine use of oxygen therapy in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). Objective: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. Data sources: Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and CINHAL. Study selection: Randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. Data extraction: The primary clinical outcome was mortality. Results: Two of 51 potential studies met the inclusion criteria. The one study with substantive clinical outcome data reported that in uncomplicated MI, high-flow oxygen was associated with a non-significant increased risk of death (risk ratio 2.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 10.3, p\u200a=\u200a0.08) and a greater serum aspartate aminotransferase level (difference 19.2 IU/ml, 95% CI 0 to 38.4, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) than room air. Conclusion: The limited evidence that does exist suggests that the routine use of high-flow oxygen in uncomplicated MI may result in a greater infarct size and possibly increase the risk of mortality.",

        "abstract": "Background Although the haemodynamic effects of oxygen in healthy subjects are well documented, there have been no well-controlled studies of the effects of oxygen in patients with heart failure (HF). Aims To non-invasively evaluate haemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of oxygen in patients with HF at rest. Methods and results 13 men with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) were randomised in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to receive medical air or oxygen (40% and high concentration via Hudson non-rebreathing mask). Haemodynamic measurements were made with applanation tonometry, impedance cardiography and venous occlusion plethysmography. Plasma C-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and A-type natriuretic peptide were measured. Data were analysed with paired t tests. Cardiac output fell by \u22120.58 (0.62)\u2005l/min on high-flow oxygen compared with \u22120.02 (0.58)\u2005l/min on air, p=0.031. Oxygen caused a reduction in heart rate (\u22124.02 (4.21) vs 0.41 (5.35)\u2005beats/min, respectively, p=0.021) and a trend towards increased systemic vascular resistance (875 (1174) vs 235 (321)\u2005dyne/s/m5, p=0.050). Oxygen led to a paradoxical increase in forearm blood flow (0.513 (0.391) vs 0.024 (0.246)\u2005ml/min/100\u2002ml forearm volume on air, p=0.01). Natriuretic peptides were unchanged with oxygen. Conclusions High-concentration inhaled oxygen has significant haemodynamic effects in patients with LVSD and mild HF. Such effects may be detrimental in patients with decompensated HF.",

        "abstract": "During and after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, high concentrations of oxygen are routinely administered, with the intention of preventing cellular hypoxia. We systematically reviewed the literature addressing the effects of arterial hyperoxia. Extensive evidence from pre\u2010clinical experiments and clinical studies in other patient groups suggests predominant harm, caused by oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, perfusion heterogeneity and myocardial injury. Whether these alterations are temporary and benign, or actually affect clinical outcome, remains to be demonstrated. In nine clinical cardiac surgical studies in low\u2010risk patients, higher oxygen targets tended to compromise cardiovascular function, but did not affect clinical outcome. No data about potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia, such as reduction of gas micro\u2010emboli or post\u2010cardiac surgery infections, were reported. Current evidence is insufficient to specify optimal oxygen targets. Nevertheless, the safety of supraphysiological oxygen suppletion is unproven. Randomised studies with a variety of oxygen targets and inclusion of high\u2010risk patients are needed to identify optimal oxygen targets during and after cardiac surgery.",

        "title": "The Pathophysiology of Nitrogen Dioxide During Inhaled Nitric Oxide Therapy.",
        "abstract": "Administration of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) with the existing compressed gas delivery systems is associated with unavoidable codelivery of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), an unwanted toxic contaminant that forms when mixed with oxygen. The NO2 is generated when NO is diluted with O2-enriched air before delivery to the patient. When NO2 is inhaled by the patient, it oxidizes protective antioxidants within the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and triggers extracellular damage in the airways. The reaction of NO2 within the ELF triggers oxidative stress (OS), possibly leading to edema, bronchoconstriction, and a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Nitrogen dioxide has been shown to have deleterious effects on the airways of high-risk patients including neonates, patients with respiratory and heart failure, and the elderly. Minimizing co-delivery of NO2 for the next generation delivery systems will be a necessity to fully optimize the pulmonary perfusion of NO because of vasodilation, whereas minimizing the negative ventilatory and histopathological effects of NO2 exposure during inhaled NO therapy.",

        "title": "Observations on the ex situ perfusion of livers for transplantation",
        "abstract": "Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion might allow viability assessment of livers before transplantation. Perfusion characteristics were studied in 47 liver perfusions, of which 22 resulted in transplants. Hepatocellular damage was reflected in the perfusate transaminase concentrations, which correlated with posttransplant peak transaminase levels. Lactate clearance occurred within 3 hours in 46 of 47 perfusions, and glucose rose initially during perfusion in 44. Three livers required higher levels of bicarbonate support to maintain physiological pH, including one developing primary nonfunction. Bile production did not correlate with viability or cholangiopathy, but bile pH, measured in 16 of the 22 transplanted livers, identified three livers that developed cholangiopathy (peak pH < 7.4) from those that did not (pH > 7.5). In the 11 research livers where it could be studied, bile pH > 7.5 discriminated between the 6 livers exhibiting >50% circumferential stromal necrosis of septal bile ducts and 4 without necrosis; one liver with 25\u201050% necrosis had a maximum pH 7.46. Liver viability during normothermic perfusion can be assessed using a combination of transaminase release, glucose metabolism, lactate clearance, and maintenance of acid\u2010base balance. Evaluation of bile pH may offer a valuable insight into bile duct integrity and risk of posttransplant ischemic cholangiopathy.",

        "abstract": "Ex-situ machine perfusion (MP) techniques are increasingly used in clinical settings, especially on grafts derived from donors after cardiac death (DCD). However, comprehension of biological effects elicited during MP are largely unknown and a substantial number of animal studies are presently focused on this topic. The aim of the present study was to describe a model of DCD based on ex-situ perfusion of liver grafts derived from animals dedicated to food production. Procurement took place within a slaughterhouse facility. A clinically fashioned closed circuit normothermic MP (NMP) was built up. Autologous blood-enriched perfusion fluid was adopted. Perfusate and tissue samples were collected to asses NMP functionality. Grafts were classified as transplantable (LT-G) or not (n-LT) according to clinical criteria, while histopathological analysis was used to confirm graft viability. After cold storage, the liver grafts were connected to the NMP. During the rewarming phase, temperature and flows were progressively increased to reach target values. At the end of NMP, 4 grafts were classified as LT-G and 3 nLT-G. Histology confirmed absence of major damage in LT-G, while diffuse necrosis appeared in nLT-G. Interestingly, in nLT-G an early impairment of hepatocyte respiratory chain, leading to cell necrosis and graft non-viability, was documented for the first time. These parameters, together with indocyanine-green dye and citrate clearance could contribute to graft evaluation in clinical settings. In conclusion, this model provides a promising and reproducible method to replace dedicated experimental animals in DCD and MP research, in line with the 3Rs principles.",

Background: HOPE might improve outcomes in LT, particularly in high-risk settings such as ECD organs after DBD, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, 46 patients undergoing ECD-DBD LT from four centers were randomly assigned to HOPE (n = 23) or SCS (n = 23). Peak-ALT levels within 7 days following LT constituted the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included incidence of postoperative complications [Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)], length of intensive care- (ICU) and hospital-stay, and incidence of early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Results: Demographics were equally distributed between both groups [donor age: 72 (IQR: 59\u201378) years, recipient age: 62 (IQR: 55\u201365) years, labMELD: 15 (IQR: 9\u201325), 38 male and 8 female recipients]. HOPE resulted in a 47% decrease in serum peak ALT [418 (IQR: 221\u2013828) vs 796 (IQR: 477\u20131195) IU/L, P = 0.030], a significant reduction in 90-day complications [44% vs 74% CD grade \u22653, P = 0.036; 32 (IQR: 12\u201356) vs 52 (IQR: 35\u201398) CCI, P = 0.021], and shorter ICU- and hospital-stays [5 (IQR: 4\u20138) vs 8 (IQR: 5\u201318) days, P = 0.045; 20 (IQR: 16\u201327) vs 36 (IQR: 23\u201362) days, P = 0.002] compared to SCS. A trend toward reduced EAD was observed for HOPE (17% vs 35%; P = 0.314). Conclusion: This multicenter RCT demonstrates that HOPE, in comparison to SCS, significantly reduces early allograft injury and improves post-transplant outcomes in ECD-DBD liver transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic organ preservation is a relatively old technique which has regained significant interest in the last decade. Machine perfusion (MP) techniques are applied in various fields of solid organ transplantation today. The first clinical series of ex situ MP in liver transplantation was presented in 2010. Since then, the number of research and clinical applications has substantially increased. Despite the notable beneficial effect on organ quality and recipient outcome, MP is still not routinely used in liver transplantation. Based on the enormous need to better preserve organs and the subsequent demand to continuously innovate and develop perfusion equipment further, this technology is also beneficial to test and deliver future therapeutic strategies to livers before implantation. This article summarizes the various challenges observed during the current shift from static to dynamic liver preservation in the clinical setting. The different organ perfusion strategies are discussed first, together with ongoing clinical trials and future study design. The current status of research and the impact of costs and regulations is highlighted next. Factors contributing to costs and other required resources for a worldwide successful implementation and reimbursement are presented third. The impact of research on cost-utility and effectivity to guide the tailored decision-making regarding the optimal perfusion strategy is discussed next. Finally, this article provides potential solutions to the challenging field of innovation in healthcare considering the various social and economic factors and the role of clinical, regulatory, and financial stakeholders worldwide.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHypothermic Oxygenated machine PErfusion (HOPE) can reduce ischemic reperfusion injury and improve outcomes for liver transplant recipients. However, the effect of HOPE on high-risk extended criteria donor (ECD) and donation after circulatory death determination (DCDD) grafts is incomplete, despite the expectation that this cohort benefit maximally from HOPE. Accordingly, this paper aims to characterize the effect of HOPE on ECD and DCDD grafts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study includes all papers comparing HOPE to static cold storage for high-risk ECD and DCDD grafts. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and Scopus were completed using the terms \"HOPE\" OR \"hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion\" AND \"liver transplantation\". Data were extracted and analyzed using IBM SPSS to perform the meta-analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 2286 records were identified, with 10 meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, the quality of evidence is heterogenous with many papers relying on retrospective controls. However, pooled analysis demonstrates HOPE to significantly reduce the rate of early allograft dysfunction, 12-month graft failure, re-transplantation, total biliary complications, and non-anastomotic strictures for high-risk grafts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is good evidence that HOPE improves outcomes following liver transplantation across a number of biochemical and clinical endpoints for high-risk grafts. Of note, the reduction in biliary complications and re-transplantation is particularly significant given the morbidity associated with these endpoints. However, further, high-quality prospective trials with contemporary controls and clinically relevant primary endpoints are needed to better define the impact of HOPE for this cohort of grafts.",
