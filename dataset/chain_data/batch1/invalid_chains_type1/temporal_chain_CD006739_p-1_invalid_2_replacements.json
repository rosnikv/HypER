        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the 12- and 52-week efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor LAF237 versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes continuing metformin treatment.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 107 patients with type 2 diabetes with a 40-week extension in those completing the core study and agreeing, together with the investigator, to extend treatment to 1 year. Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P <0.0001). Mean prandial glucose and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P <0.0001) and 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P=0.0001), 40 +/- 16 pmol/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (P=0.0312), respectively. HbA1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in LAF237-treated patients (n=42) but increased in participants given placebo (n=29). The between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c after 1 year was -1.1 +/- 0.2% (P <0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nData from this study demonstrate that LAF237 effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to metformin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes.",

        "title": "Effect of single oral doses of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, on incretin and plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test in patients with type 2 diabetes.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIn response to a meal, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are released and modulate glycemic control. Normally these incretins are rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors are a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The degree of DPP-4 inhibition and the level of active incretin augmentation required for glucose lowering efficacy after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the study was to examine the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of sitagliptin.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, single-dose crossover study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted at six investigational sites.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nThe study population consisted of 58 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not on antihyperglycemic agents.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nInterventions included sitagliptin 25 mg, sitagliptin 200 mg, or placebo.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMeasurements included plasma DPP-4 activity; post-OGTT glucose excursion; active and total incretin GIP levels; insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentrations; and sitagliptin pharmacokinetics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSitagliptin dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity over 24 h, enhanced active GLP-1 and GIP levels, increased insulin/C-peptide, decreased glucagon, and reduced glycemic excursion after OGTTs administered at 2 and 24 h after single oral 25- or 200-mg doses of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with no hypoglycemic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study in patients with type 2 diabetes, near maximal glucose-lowering efficacy of sitagliptin after single oral doses was associated with inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity of 80% or greater, corresponding to a plasma sitagliptin concentration of 100 nm or greater, and an augmentation of active GLP-1 and GIP levels of 2-fold or higher after an OGTT.",

        "abstract": "The Coalition for Clinical Research\u2014Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Scientific Board convened a meeting in San Francisco, CA, July 20\u201321, 2011, to discuss the current practice of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in non-insulin-treated (NIT) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Twelve physician panel members from academia, practice, and government attended this meeting. These experts came from the United States, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In addition, three consultants from Australia, Germany, and the United States contributed to the group's final report. This coalition was organized by Diabetes Technology Society. Self-monitoring of blood glucose was studied from eight perspectives related to patients with NIT T2DM: (1) epidemiological studies; (2) randomized controlled trials (RCT)s and meta-analyses; (3) targets, timing, and frequency of SMBG use; (4) incidence and role of SMBG in preventing hypoglycemia with single-drug regimens and combination regimens consisting of antihyperglycemic agents other than secretagogues and insulin; (5) comparison of SMBG with continuous glucose monitoring; (6) technological capabilities and limitations of SMBG; (7) barriers to appropriate use of SMBG; and (8) methods and end points for appropriate future clinical trials. The panel emphasized recent studies, which reflect the current approach for applying this intervention. Among the participants there was consensus that: SMBG is an established practice for patients with NIT T2DM, and to be most effective, it should be performed in a structured format where information obtained from this measurement is used to guide treatment; New, high-quality efficacy data from RCTs have demonstrated efficacy of SMBG in NIT T2DM in trials reported since 2008; Both patients and health care professionals require education on how to respond to the data for SMBG to be effective; and Additional well-defined studies are needed to assess the benefits and costs of SMBG with end points not limited to hemoglobin A1c.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To assess treatment adherence to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin compared with sulphonylureas (SU) in Muslim patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were fasting during Ramadan in the UK. Research design and methods: This prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in four UK centres. Patients already taking vildagliptin (50\u2009mg twice a day) or an SU as add-on therapy to metformin were followed up for \u226416 weeks. They were asked to record all missed doses of anti-diabetes medications. Results: Of the 72 patients enrolled (vildagliptin, n\u2009=\u200930; SU, n\u2009=\u200941; not allocated to treatment, n\u2009=\u20091), 59 (81.9%) completed the study (vildagliptin, n\u2009=\u200923; SU, n\u2009=\u200936), including one patient in the SU arm who completed but failed to provide information on missed doses; all patients in the SU arm were taking gliclazide. In the vildagliptin arm one patient (4.3%) missed a total of four doses while in the SU arm 10 patients (27.8%) missed a total of 266 doses (mean [SD] number of doses missed per patient: 26.6 [16.5]). The mean (SD) proportions of doses missed during fasting were 0.2% (0.9) and 10.4% (21.7) in the vildagliptin and SU arms, respectively, with a significant mean between-group difference of \u221210.2% (95% CI: \u221219.3%, \u22121.1%; p\u2009=\u20090.0292). There were no patients in the vildagliptin arm who missed more than 20% of OAD doses compared with 19.4% in the SU arm (p\u2009=\u20090.0358). Of the patients receiving an SU, 15 (42%) collectively reported 34 hypoglycaemic events (HEs) and one grade 2 HE; of these, fewer were non-adherent (n\u2009=\u20096, 40%) than adherent (n\u2009=\u20099, 60%). No patients reported HEs in the vildagliptin arm. Conclusion: During Ramadan fasting, treatment with vildagliptin resulted in better treatment adherence compared with SU in Muslim patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study limitations are the sample size and the lack of diet and exercise data.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT There are no studies evaluating the glucose variability in different periods of Ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This study examined the effect of Ramadan fasting on interstitial glucose (IG) variability in early,- late-, and post-Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan days in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. Participants had a CGM system connected 2 or 3 days before Ramadan start, which was removed on the third or fourth day of Ramadan. CGM performance continued for a total of 6 days. A second CGM performance started on the 27th or 28th day of Ramadan and ended on the 4th or 5th post-Ramadan day. First, CGM recordings were divided into pre-Ramadan and early-Ramadan CGM, and second recordings into late-Ramadan and post-Ramadan. At each visit, blood pressure, body weight, and waist circumference were measured, and fasting blood samples were collected for HbA1c and plasma glucose. All patients received recommended Ramadan education before Ramadan. Thirty-three patients (mean age 55.0 \u00b1 9.8 years, 73% males) were prospectively included. IG variability, estimated as mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), increased significantly in early-Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan (P = 0.006) but not in late-Ramadan and post-Ramadan recording days. Only patients on >2 anti-diabetic drugs (n = 16, P = 0.019) and those on sulphonylureas (n = 14, P = 0.003) showed significant increase in MAGE in early-Ramadan. No significant changes were seen in coefficient of variation, time in range, time in hyperglycaemia, or time in hypoglycaemia. Except for an initial increase in glucose variability, fasting Ramadan for patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes did not cause any significant changes in glucose variability or time in hypoglycaemia during CGM recording days compared to non-fasting pre-Ramadan period.",

        "abstract": "Ramadan fasting is associated with changes in eating, physical activity, sleeping patterns, and medication. Unfortunately, only limited studies examine glucose variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes who fast in Ramadan. Our study aims to evaluate glucose variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes on oral antidiabetic agents using continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) during and after Ramadan fasting. This observational study was done in The Indonesian Medical Education and Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia, which recruited 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes who underwent Ramadan fasting in 2019. These subjects were free from cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, severe liver disease, chronic gastrointestinal disease and autoimmune disease. Insertion of CGMS for measuring interstitial glucose was performed after at least 2 weeks of Ramadan fasting and 4 weeks after the end of the Ramadan fasting, with a minimum of 3 days observation. The mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) during and after Ramadan were similar (p = 0.94). In line with this, the average interstitial glucose (p = 0.48), the maximum interstitial glucose (p = 0.35), the minimum interstitial glucose (p = 0.24), and the duration of hypoglycemia (p = 0.25) were also similar in both periods. Overall, nutritional intake and energy expenditure during both periods were comparable. Ramadan fasting is not associated with increased glucose variability in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

        "abstract": "Purpose Impact of ramadan fasting on healthy and women with diabetes is already known. However, there is a scarcity of data on impact of fasting on pregnant women with diabetes. Moreover, religious and medical recommendations advise pregnant women against fasting as it is unsafe. Despite being exempted, many pregnant Muslim women with diabetes still choose to fast during ramadan. This study investigated different glycemic marker as an indicator for diabetes control in fasting pregnant women. Patients and Methods This is a prospective observational study. A total of 89 pregnant diabetes women were recruited. Blood glucose was self-monitored in all the pregnant women using glucose monitoring device at home. We measure the fructosamine, HbA1c levels before, during and after ramadan. Results Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes were 14 (25%), type 2 diabetes were 21 (37.5%), and gestational diabetes were 21 (37.5%). The mean fructosamine level decreased during and after ramadan in gestation diabetes pregnant women compared to type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes pregnant women subjects (p = 0.009). Conclusion The present study indicates that pregnant women with diabetes were able to fast during ramadan and there fructosamine level reduced during fasting. Utilization of fructosamine for short-term monitoring of glycemic control in addition to home glucose monitoring in pregnant women with diabetes will provide a good index of glycemic control. Recommendation Religious and medical recommendations advise pregnant women against fasting as it is unsafe, and they are under high risk. However, if they insist to do fast, they must do under strict medical supervision and fructosamine can be used as a glycemic control marker.",
