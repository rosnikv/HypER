        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation is significantly reduced by prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulins (HBIG) or antiviral drugs in nonreplicating patients and by the combination of both drugs in replicating patients. However, the load of HBV DNA, which defines replicating status in patients undergoing liver transplantation, remains unclear. This study analyzes the correlation between the viral load, tested with a single amplified assay, at the time of liver transplantation, and the risk of hepatitis B recurrence in 177 HBV carriers who underwent transplantation in a single center from 1990 to 2002. Overall, HBV relapsed after surgery in 15 patients (8.5%) with a 5\u2010 and 8\u2010year actuarial rate of recurrence of 8% and 21%, respectively. After liver transplantation hepatitis B recurred in 9% of 98 selected subjects treated only with immune globulins and in 8% of 79 viremic patients who received immune globulins and lamivudine (P = NS). A linear correlation was observed between recurrence and viral load at the time of surgery. In transplant patients with HBV DNA higher than 100,000 copies/mL, 200\u201399,999 copies/mL, and DNA undetectable by amplified assay, hepatitis B recurred in 50%, 7.5%, and 0% of patients, respectively. Overall, a viral load higher than 100,000 copies/mL at the time of liver transplantation was significantly associated with hepatitis B recurrence (P = .0003). In conclusion, spontaneous or antiviral\u2010induced HBV DNA viral load at the time of surgery classifies the risk of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation and indicates the best prophylaxis strategy.

        "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the outcomes of liver transplant recipients receiving either lamivudine (LAM) monotherapy or LAM combined with low\u2010dose intramuscular (IM) hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) therapy. We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of patients that had had liver transplantation in a single center for HBV\u2010related liver diseases from December 1999 to June 2004. A total of 165 patients received LAM monotherapy (51 patients) or combined prophylaxis (114 patients) post\u2010liver transplantation (LT) with a mean follow\u2010up of 20.13 months. Hepatitis B relapsed in 21 patients of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers who received LAM monotherapy, with a 1\u2010 and 2\u2010yr actuarial risk of 27.4% and 39.7%. Recurrence occurred in 16 patients of 114 patients receiving the combined prophylaxis, with a 1\u2010 and 2\u2010yr recurrence rate of 13.5% and 15.2% (P= 0.024). A total of 25 cases (67.6%) with YMDD mutants were detected in all the 37 patients, 14 cases (66.7%) in the monotherapy group and 11 cases (68.8%) in the combination group. In conclusion, LAM and low\u2010dose intramuscular HBIG treatment demonstrates a better result than LAM monotherapy, as prophylaxis against post\u2010LT reinfection of the graft, but the safety and efficacy as a substitution for high\u2010dose intravenous HBIG with LAM needs to be investigated further.

Accordingly, there have been many attempts to expand the Milan criteria, such as the University of California San Francisco criteria or the up-to-Seven criteria.2 In contrast to Western countries, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) accounts for the majority of LT in Asian countries. As the social organ allocation system does not control grafts from living related donors, the wishes of the donor sometimes outweigh the recipient's overall prognosis or the risk of HCC recurrence after LT.",

        "abstract": "Background. Tenofovir therapy has been found to be efficient in treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) in nontransplant patients. However, in the setting of solid-organ transplantation, the efficacy of tenofovir has not been tested. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the clinical and biologic response and tolerance to tenofovir therapy in HBV-positive organ transplant recipients. Methods. Seven patients, three kidney, three liver, and one cardiac transplant recipients, with chronic HBV infection were partial responders to adefovir (n=7), lamivudine (n=7), or entecavir (n=5) therapy. Consequently, they were placed on tenofovir therapy (245 mg daily, which was adapted to renal function) alone (n=4) or in combination with lamivudine (n=3). Tenofovir therapy was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinitiation or at the last follow-up. Results. HBV DNA viral load (4.16 [2.03\u20135.56] log10 copies/mL at baseline) became significantly decreased to 3.15 (1.08\u20135.17), 2.88 (1.3\u20134.3), 3.53 (1.3\u20135.75), 3.33 (1.3\u20137.57), and 2.31 (1.3\u20134.81) log copies/mL at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttenofovir initiation and at last follow-up, respectively (P=0.02). Three patients were HBV DNA negative at the last follow-up. Liver enzyme levels did not change significantly throughout the follow-up period. Clinical and biologic tolerance was excellent. Conclusions. Even though HBV DNA clearance was not achieved in all patients, the results of this pilot study are encouraging and demonstrate that tenofovir therapy is safe and efficacious in treating HBV-positive organ transplant patients. However, a larger trial is needed to confirm these preliminary results.",

Aim The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NUCs prophylaxis (\u00b1HBIG) against HBV recurrence after LTx. Patients and methods This was a retrospective cohort-longitudinal study on 44 HBV-related post-LTx patients on anti-HBV prophylactic therapy. They included the entecavir (ETV)-based (n=34, 30 males) and the other NUC-based (n=10, 7 males) groups\u00b1HBIG. Results The median age was 63.5 (60\u201370) years in ETV and 62.5 (55\u201365) years in other NUCs groups. The mean follow-up duration was 6.09\u00b11.83 years in ETV-based group and 6.3\u00b11.89 years in other NUCs-based group. The mean ETV duration was 3.47\u00b13.04 years. In ETV+HBIG patients, none of them developed HBV recurrence throughout the \u00b18 years. In the 14 patients on ETV+other NUC+HBIG, four developed HBsAg positive and then transformed to HbsAb positive at the end of \u00b18 years without hepatitis or detectable HBV-DNA. Liver graft function showed nonsignificant difference for ETV-based patients, in comparison with other NUC groups (P=0.09). With subdivision, the graft function was maintained significantly better in ETV+HBIG or other NUCs+HBIG (P=0.04) groups. None of our patients reported NUCs-related complications or adverse effects. Conclusion ETV and other NUCs were effective and safe as a long-term prophylaxis of HBV recurrence after LTx, leading to a good graft function. HBsAg temporally reappeared in a minority of patients, where all showed HBsAb seroconversion without detectable HBV-DNA or clinical hepatitis.",

Methods: A total of 104 patients with ascites caused by hepatitis B-related cirrhosis were randomly divided into a control group (n=52, routine nursing) and study group (n=52, empowerment education model + nutritional care). The self-management behaviors, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores, and nutritional indices [upper arm circumference (AC), upper arm muscle circumference (AMC), triceps skin fold thickness (TSF), body mass index (BMI), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), and hemoglobin (Hb)] were compared between the two groups. Results: (1) There was no significant difference in the total scores of dietary management, daily life management, medication management, disease monitoring management, and self-management behavior between the two groups before intervention (P>0.05); after intervention, these scores were all increased (P<0.05), and scores of the study group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.05). (2) There was no significant difference in SAS and SDS scores between the two groups before intervention (P>0.05); the SAS and SDS scores of both groups decreased after intervention (P<0.05), and the scores of the study group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05).

        "abstract": "Nucleos(t)ide analogues with high barrier to resistance are regarded as the principal therapeutic option for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Treatment with entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) and the later released tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is highly effective at controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and, in the vast majority of patients, is well tolerated. No significant differences in viral suppression have been described among the different regimens, although an earlier achievement in biochemical response has been suggested first under TDF and recently under TAF. High barrier to resistance NAs rarely achieve hepatitis B surface antigen sero-clearance, and therefore should be maintained life-long in most cases. This has increased concerns about treatment-related toxicity, especially in patients under TDF with additional risk factors for kidney and bone impairment. TAF has shown a better bone and kidney safety profile than TDF, although it is not yet available worldwide due to its higher cost. Emergence of adverse events should be monitored since treatment-switch to ETV/TAF seems to be effective and safe in HBV mono-infected subjects. Finally, although an effective antiviral treatment leads to a clear improvement in clinical outcome of CHB patients; the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely avoided with viral suppression. Whether tenofovir-based regimens provide any additional benefit over ETV in HCC prevention remains unclear and requires further investigation.",
