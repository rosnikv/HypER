        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory disorders and commonly presents during childhood or adolescence. Occurring during a critical period of growth and development, pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis require special consideration. Children often experience growth failure, malnutrition, pubertal delay and bone demineralization. Medical treatment must be optimized to promote clinical improvement and reverse growth failure with minimal toxicity. In addition to pharmacologic and surgical interventions, nutritional therapies play a vital role in the management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This review will outline the epidemiology and clinical complications that are unique to pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, current trends, and recent advances in nutritional and pharmacologic treatment, and projected future therapeutic direction.",

Management of CGD colitis is a challenge because standard immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of infection in already immunocompromised hosts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe report the use of infliximab in 5 patients with CGD.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInfliximab administration predisposed patients to severe infections with typical CGD pathogens but not mycobacteria, as reported with infliximab in other conditions. In addition to infections, infliximab administration led to successful closure of fistulae, sometimes with other untoward consequences. Infliximab-associated complications were associated with 2 deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInfliximab use in the treatment of CGD inflammatory bowel disease requires aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis, assiduous surveillance for infection, and vigilance for untoward gastrointestinal complications. This experience suggests that infliximab therapy is effective but has untoward consequences in patients with CGD.",

Interestingly, Aspergillus (Emericella) nidulans is the second most encountered mold in CGD patients, causing almost exclusively invasive infections in this specific host, and is characterized by its aggressive behavior. A proper diagnosis is complicated by the often mild clinical presentation, the low sensitivity of the currently used diagnostic tools, and the difficulties in accurate identification of the Emericella species. According to the hitherto accepted view on the role of the NADPH-oxidase in the innate host-defense pathway, the pathogenesis of A. nidulans in CGD cannot be explained. This synopsis covers the current understanding of invasive infections caused by A. nidulans in the CGD patient and is intended to direct further research by indicating gaps in our knowledge and to guide optimal management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Invasive aspergillosis is a major threat to patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Fungal pathogenesis is the result of a diminished antifungal capacity and dysregulated inflammation. A deficient NADPH-oxidase complex results in defective phagolysosomal alkalization. To investigate the contribution of defective pH regulation in phagocytes among patients with CGD during fungal pathogenesis, we evaluated the effect of the acidotropic, antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) on the antifungal capacity of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and on the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Chloroquine exerted a direct pH-dependent antifungal effect on Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans; it increased the antifungal activity of PMNs from patients with CGD at a significantly lower concentration, compared with the concentration for PMNs from healthy individuals; and decreased the hyperinflammatory state of PBMCs from patients with CGD, as observed by decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 1\u03b2 release. Chloroquine targets both limbs of fungal pathogenesis and might be of great value in the clearance of invasive aspergillosis in patients with CGD.",

        "abstract": "NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms together have multiple functions that are important for normal physiology and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2) is critical for antimicrobial host defence. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder of NOX2 characterized by severe life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and by excessive inflammation, including Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NOX2 defends against microbes through the direct antimicrobial activity of reactive oxidants and through activation of granular proteases and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETosis involves the breakdown of cell membranes and extracellular release of chromatin and neutrophil granular constituents that target extracellular pathogens. Although the immediate effects of oxidant generation and NETosis are predicted to be injurious, NOX2, in several contexts, limits inflammation and injury by modulation of key signalling pathways that affect neutrophil accumulation and clearance. NOX2 also plays a role in antigen presentation and regulation of adaptive immunity. Specific NOX2-activated pathways such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional factor that induces antioxidative and cytoprotective responses, may be important therapeutic targets for CGD and, more broadly, diseases associated with excessive inflammation and injury.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency characterized by a deficient neutrophil oxidative burst and the inadequate killing of microbes, is well known to cause a significantly increased risk of invasive infection. However, infectious complications are not the sole manifestations of CGD; substantial additional morbidity is driven by noninfectious complications also. These complications can include, for example, a wide range of inflammatory diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract, lung, skin, and genitourinary tract and overt autoimmune disease. These diseases can occur at any age and are especially problematic in adolescents and adults with CGD. Many of these noninfectious complications present a highly challenging therapeutic conundrum, wherein immunosuppression must be balanced against an already markedly increased risk of invasive fungal and bacterial infections. In this review, the myriad noninfectious complications of CGD are discussed, as are important gaps in our understanding of these processes, which warrant further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with a very high mortality rate. Early diagnosis of the disease, the utilization of more potent pharmacological agents, and more effective drug delivery systems are essential to achieve an optimal treatment plan. The applications of nanotechnology to improve therapeutic efficacy and early diagnosis for melanoma treatment have received great interest among researchers and clinicians. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of utilizing various nanomaterials for theranostics of melanoma. The key importance of using nanomaterials for theranostics of melanoma is to improve efficacy and reduce side effects, ensuring safe implementation in clinical use. As opposed to conventional in vitro diagnostic methods, in vivo medical imaging technologies have the advantages of being a type of non-invasive, real-time monitoring. Several common nanoparticles, including ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and carbon-based nanoparticles, have been applied to deliver chemotherapeutic agents for the theranostics of melanoma. The application of nanomaterials for theranostics in molecular imaging (MRI, PET, US, OI, etc.) plays an important role in targeting drug delivery of melanoma, by monitoring the distribution site of the molecular imaging probe and the therapeutic drug in the body in real-time. Hence, it is worthwhile to anticipate the approval of these nanomaterials for theranostics in molecular imaging by the US Food and Drug Administration in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Cancer vaccine therapy is promising, though its efficacy is compromised in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have the potential to be repolarized to an antitumor subtype, and their antigen-presenting ability might enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccination. Here, we aimed to develop a nanoparticle with adjuvant effect that could be a carrier for neoantigen-based vaccine to target and repolarize TAMs in situ. Therefore, we prepared a hyaluronic acid and mannose dual-modified iron oxide nanoparticle, and the enhanced efficiency of nanoparticle intake of macrophages was confirmed. It could repolarize macrophages and outperformed a commercialized iron oxide nanoparticle, ferumoxytol. Combined with peptides, this nanoparticle strongly inhibited TC1 tumor growth, and 40% of mice reached complete regression. This is the first report using mannose, hyaluronic acid, and iron oxide to target TAMs and achieve ideal outcomes in vivo. This study provides a facile nanoplatform for neoantigen-based vaccine therapy and a reference for repolarizing TAMs to promote immunotherapy. Abstract Neoantigen-based cancer vaccine therapy is a breakthrough in the field of immunotherapy. However, it is difficult for vaccines against neoantigens to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, where tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a significant role. Herein, we report an iron oxide nanoparticle modified with hyaluronic acid and mannose to reshape the tumor microenvironment by targeting and repolarizing TAMs from protumor M2 to antitumor M1 phenotype. Mannose decoration could confer the nanoparticle-enhanced TAM targeting ability, while hyaluronic acid and iron oxide could repolarize M2-like macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combined with antigenic peptides, this nanovaccine could significantly increase the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor tissue and strongly activate dendritic cells in sentinel lymph nodes. Finally, we used the dual-modified nanoparticles to first convert the tumor microenvironment and then the nanovaccine administration in a TC1 tumor model to further enhance efficacy. This strategy inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 40% cure rate in mice (two of five). In summary, this study provides a potent and rationally designed nanoadjuvant to enhance antitumor efficiency and facilitate delivery of neoantigen vaccines by repolarizing TAMs and harmonizing immune cells.",

        "abstract": "Tumor vaccines aim to activate dormant or unresponsive tumor-specific T lymphocytes by using tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens, thus enhancing the body\u2019s natural defense against cancer. However, the effectiveness of tumor vaccines is limited by the presence of tumor heterogeneity, low immunogenicity, and immune evasion mechanisms. Fortunately, multifunctional nanoparticles offer a unique chance to address these issues. With the advantages of their small size, high stability, efficient drug delivery, and controlled surface chemistry, nanomaterials can precisely target tumor sites, improve the delivery of tumor antigens and immune adjuvants, reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and enhance the body\u2019s anti-tumor immune response, resulting in improved efficacy and reduced side effects. Nanovaccine, a type of vaccine that uses nanotechnology to deliver antigens and adjuvants to immune cells, has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy due to its ability to stimulate immune responses and induce tumor-specific immunity. In this review, we discussed the compositions and types of nanovaccine, and the mechanisms behind their anti-tumor effects based on the latest research. We hope that this will provide a more scientific basis for designing tumor vaccines and enhancing the effectiveness of tumor immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) technology has revolutionized cellular immunotherapy, particularly with the success of CAR-T cells in treating hematologic malignancies. However, CAR-T cells have the limited efficacy of against solid tumors. To address these limitations, CAR-macrophages (CAR-Ms) leverage the innate properties of macrophages with the specificity and potency of CAR technology, offering a novel and promising approach to cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical studies have shown that CAR-Ms can effectively target and destroy tumor cells, even within challenging microenvironments, by exhibiting direct cytotoxicity and enhancing the recruitment and activation of other immune cells. Additionally, the favorable safety profile of macrophages and their persistence within solid tumors position CAR-Ms as potentially safer and more durable therapeutic options compared to CAR-T cells. This review explores recent advancements in CAR-Ms technology, including engineering strategies to optimize their anti-tumor efficacy and preclinical evidence supporting their use. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in developing CAR-Ms therapies, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize cellular immunotherapy. By harnessing the unique properties of macrophages, CAR-Ms offer a groundbreaking approach to overcoming the current limitations of CAR-T cell therapies, paving the way for more effective and sustainable cancer treatments.",
