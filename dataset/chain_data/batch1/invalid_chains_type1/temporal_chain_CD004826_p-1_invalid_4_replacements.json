        "title": "Crohn's disease and Escherichia coli. A new approach in therapy to maintain remission of colonic Crohn's disease?",
        "abstract": "Involvement of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has long been suggested because, among other reasons, the inflammatory response resembles that in infectious bowel diseases. Elevated antibody levels to pathogen antigens and a changed metabolic activity of the intestinal microflora have been detected in patients with Crohn's disease. Several studies have revealed a possible etiologic link between intestinal microorganisms and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, several therapeutic strategies, including reduction or dilution of bacterial components in the intestine by antibiotics or intestinal lavage, respectively, inactivation of inflammatory bacterial products, and reconstitution of intestinal microflora have been employed, substantiating the idea that dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier and an alteration of bacterial composition contribute to the inflammatory disease. However, the beneficial effect of restoration of the physiologic intestinal microflora in colonic inflammation by exogenous administration of a viable nonpathogenic bacterium has not been investigated before in a placebo-controlled study. Promising results came from the present pilot study in which the nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 was tested for efficacy and tolerance in maintaining remission in patients with colonic Crohn's disease. Application of the physiologic bacteria reduced the risk for relapse and minimized the need for glucocorticoids. Therefore we are convinced that in Crohn's disease parts of the intestinal microflora, including the host's immune response toward indigenous flora or an impairment of the gut flora's metabolic activity are involved in the development or at least in the onset of relapse from remissive of colonic Crohn's disease. However, more data are necessary to prove the benefit of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 as a new therapy to maintain remission of colonic Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Background Lactobacillus GG is a safe probiotic bacterium known to transiently colonize the human intestine. It has been found to be useful in treatment of several gastrointestinal conditions characterized by increased gut permeability. In the current study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG was investigated in children with Crohn's disease. Methods In this open-label pilot evaluation viewed as a necessary preliminary step for a possible subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trial, four children with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease were given Lactobacillus GG (1010 colony-forming units [CFU]) in enterocoated tablets twice a day for 6 months. Changes in intestinal permeability were measured by a double sugar permeability test. Clinical activity was determined by measuring the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. Results There was a significant improvement in clinical activity 1 week after starting Lactobacillus GG, which was sustained throughout the study period. Median pediatric Crohn's disease activity index scores at 4 weeks were 73% lower than baseline. Intestinal permeability improved in an almost parallel fashion. Conclusions Findings in this pilot study show that Lactobacillus GG may improve gut barrier function and clinical status in children with mildly to moderately active, stable Crohn's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted for a final assessment of the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of probiotics, once discussed primarily in the context of alternative medicine, is now entering mainstream medicine. However, only a few of the potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of exciting promises and many unanswered questions.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. Setting Primary care. Participants Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. Intervention Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. Results 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. Conclusions Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data.

        "abstract": "This review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus), and Lactobacillus reuteri. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. Few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or Clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. Overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. On the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. Most commonly employed probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. They consistently show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains\u2014mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii, but also L. reuteri\u2014in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. Such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. The effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10\u2009billion/d being necessary.",

METHODS: Healthy children (born at term, aged 6\u201336 months) attending day care centers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They received L reuteri DSM 17938 (dose 108 colony-forming unit; n = 168) or identical placebo (n = 168) by mouth, daily for 3 months, after which they were followed-up after a further 3 months without supplementation. RESULTS: Data from all children were included in the final analysis. L reuteri DSM 17938 significantly reduced the frequency and duration of episodes of diarrhea and respiratory tract infection at both 3 and 6 months (P < .05). Additionally, the number of doctor visits, antibiotic use, absenteeism from day school and parental absenteeism from work were significantly reduced in the L reuteri group (P < .05). A cost-benefit analysis revealed significant reductions in costs in the L reuteri-treated children. No adverse events related to the study product were reported.

Even though the previous version of our review showed benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, at risk of acute URTIs.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), Web of Science (1900 to July 2014), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to July 2014), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to July 2014) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to July 2014). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 31 July 2014.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute URTIs.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials, and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 13 RCTs, although we could only extract data to meta-analyse 12 trials, which involved 3720 participants including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people. We found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI (at least one episode: odds ratio (OR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.76, P value < 0.001, low quality evidence; at least three episodes: OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.80, P value = 0.002, low quality evidence); the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI (mean difference (MD) -1.89; 95% CI -2.03 to -1.75, P value < 0.001, low quality evidence); reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, moderate quality evidence) and cold-related school absence (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.47, very low quality evidence). Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI (rate ratio 0.83; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05, P value = 0.12, very low quality evidence) and adverse events (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.19, P value = 0.40, low quality evidence). Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. We found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when we conducted pooled analyses and the evidence level was low or very low quality.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nProbiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI, the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotic use and cold-related school absence. This indicates that probiotics may be more beneficial than placebo for preventing acute URTIs. However, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.",

Commensal microbiota is critical for orchestrating tissue homeostasis and immunity in the intestine. Probiotics represent an interesting source of immune modulators and several clinical studies have addressed the potential beneficial effects of probiotics against respiratory infections. Therefore, we have investigated the mechanisms of protection conferred by L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 strain in a mouse model of influenza infection. Notably, local myeloid cells accumulation is generated in the lungs after seven days feeding with L. paracasei prior to viral infection. L. paracasei-fed mice showed reduced susceptibility to the influenza infection, associated with less accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs, faster viral clearance and general health improvement. Interestingly, Allobaculum was significantly increased in L. paracasei-fed mice 7 days after influenza infection, even if the gut microbiota composition was not altered overall. L. paracasei-purified peptidoglycan partially recapitulated the protective phenotype observed with the entire bacteria. Collectively, our results demonstrate that oral consumption of L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 modulates lung immunity was associated with an improved control of influenza infection. These results further extend the beneficial role for certain lactobacilli to alleviate the burden of respiratory tract infections.",

        "abstract": "Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that require the protein synthesis machinery of the host cells to replicate. These microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to avoid detection from the host immune innate and adaptive response, which are known as viral evasion mechanisms. Viruses enter the host through skin and mucosal surfaces that happen to be colonized by communities of thousands of microorganisms collectively known as the commensal microbiota, where bacteria have a role in the modulation of the immune system and maintaining homeostasis. These bacteria are necessary for the development of the immune system and to prevent the adhesion and colonization of bacterial pathogens and parasites. However, the interactions between the commensal microbiota and viruses are not clear. The microbiota could confer protection against viral infection by priming the immune response to avoid infection, with some bacterial species being required to increase the antiviral response. On the other hand, it could also help to promote viral evasion of certain viruses by direct and indirect mechanisms, with the presence of the microbiota increasing infection and viruses using LPS and surface polysaccharides from bacteria to trigger immunosuppressive pathways. In this work, we reviewed the interaction between the microbiota and viruses to prevent their entry into host cells or to help them to evade the host antiviral immunity. This review is focused on the influence of the commensal microbiota in the viruses' success or failure of the host cells infection.",

Besides the limited effect of vaccines, the problem is exacerbated by the lack of drugs with strong antiviral activity against all flu strains. Currently, there are two classes of antiviral drugs available that are chemosynthetic and approved against influenza A virus for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, but the appearance of drug-resistant virus strains is a serious issue that strikes at the core of influenza control. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new antiviral drugs. Many reports have shown that the development of novel bioactive plant extracts and microbial extracts has significant advantages in influenza treatment. This paper comprehensively reviews the development and effects of chemosynthetic drugs, plant extracts, and microbial extracts with influenza antiviral activity, hoping to provide some references for novel antiviral drug design and promising alternative candidates for further anti-influenza drug development.",

        "title": "Akkermansia muciniphila in neuropsychiatric disorders: friend or foe?",
        "abstract": "An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila exhibits positive systemic effects on host health, mainly by improving immunological and metabolic functions, and it is therefore regarded as a promising potential probiotic. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that A. muciniphila plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that A. muciniphila and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, A. muciniphila was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of A. muciniphila remains much controversial. This review summarizes the proposed roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and autism spectrum disorders, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic application of A. muciniphila for the treatment of these conditions.",

        "title": "The Role of Intestinal Microbiota and Diet as Modulating Factors in the Course of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s Diseases",
        "abstract": "Many researchers propose manipulating microbiota to prevent and treat related diseases. The brain\u2013gut axis is an object that remains the target of modern research, and it is not without reason that many researchers enrich it with microbiota and diet in its name. Numerous connections and mutual correlations have become the basis for seeking answers to many questions related to pathology as well as human physiology. Disorders of this homeostasis as well as dysbiosis itself accompany neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. Heavily dependent on external factors, modulation of the gut microbiome represents an opportunity to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Probiotic interventions, synbiotic interventions, or fecal transplantation can undoubtedly support the biotherapeutic process. A special role is played by diet, which provides metabolites that directly affect the body and the microbiota. A holistic view of the human organism is therefore essential.",
