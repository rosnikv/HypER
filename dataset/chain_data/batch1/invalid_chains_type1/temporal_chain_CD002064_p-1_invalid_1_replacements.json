        "title": "Subcutaneous IGF-1 is not beneficial in 2-year ALS trial",
        "abstract": "Background: Previous human clinical trials of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been inconsistent. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to address whether IGF-1 benefited patients with ALS. Methods: A total of 330 patients from 20 medical centers were randomized to receive 0.05 mg/kg body weight of human recombinant IGF-1 given subcutaneously twice daily or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome measure was change in their manual muscle testing score. Secondary outcome measures included tracheostomy-free survival and rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale. Intention to treat analysis was used. Results: There was no difference between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcome measures after the 2-year treatment period. Conclusions: Insulin-like growth factor type I does not provide benefit for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. GLOSSARY: ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-r = revised ALS functional rating scale; AUC = area under the curve; DVT = deep venous thromboses; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor type I; MMT = manual muscle testing; PE = pulmonary embolisms.",

        "title": "The natural history of ALS is changing: Improved survival",
        "abstract": "In the past two decades new practice parameters for clinical care in ALS were developed and several clinical trials were performed. We sought to review information in these prospective datasets and assess whether natural history of ALS has changed over time. Survival and the rate of functional decline were compared across the placebo arms of efficacy trials conducted from 1999 to 2005 by the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS). Similar data from the placebo arms of 12 other published efficacy ALS trials conducted between 1990 and 2008 were compared descriptively. In the three NEALS clinical trials, survival improved over time in the placebo cohort (p=0.05) while the rate of change in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) (p=0.15), ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) (p=0.6) and vital capacity (%VC) (p=0.5) was unchanged. No differences were observed in the mean rates of decline of these outcome measures in the published clinical trials. However, survival improved in the more recently conducted trials. Survival improved over time in placebo controlled participants enrolled in clinical trials in ALS since 1990. However, the decline in measures of function appears unchanged since then. These changes in natural history reflect improvements in symptomatic care of ALS.",

        "title": "Toward more efficient clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
        "abstract": "Abstract More than 30 phase II or III clinical trials have been carried out in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Only riluzole, however, has been shown to extend survival and/or time to tracheostomy. Many early ALS trials lacked solid pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data for the treatment being tested, challenging the interpretation of the efficacy and pathway relevance. Understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of ALS has improved considerably in the past decade, but biomarkers of disease activity remain lacking. A more efficient approach to early phase clinical trials is needed to accelerate the identification of useful agents for ALS. Here we summarize our current thinking about phase II design options and the potential benefits of a clinical trial network for phase II trials in ALS.",

        "title": "Electrical impedance myography as a biomarker to assess ALS progression",
        "abstract": "Abstract Electrical impedance myography (EIM), a non-invasive, electrophysiological technique, has preliminarily shown value as an ALS biomarker. Here we perform a multicenter study to further assess EIM\u2019s potential for tracking ALS. ALS patients were enrolled across eight sites. Each subject underwent EIM, handheld dynamometry (HHD), and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) regularly. Techniques were compared by assessing the coefficient of variation (CoV) in the rate of decline and each technique\u2019s correlation to survival. Results showed that in the 60 patients followed for one year, EIM phase measured from the most rapidly progressing muscle in each patient had a CoV in the rate of decline of 0.62, compared to HHD (0.82) and the ALSFRS-R (0.74). Restricting the measurements to the first six months gave a CoV of 0.55 for EIM, 0.93 for HHD, and 0.84 for ALSFRS-R. For both time-periods, all three measures correlated with survival. Based on these data, a six-month clinical trial designed to detect a 20% treatment effect with 80% power using EIM would require only 95 patients/arm compared to the ALSFRS-R, which would require 220 subjects/arm. In conclusion, EIM can serve as a useful ALS biomarker that offers the prospect of greatly accelerating phase 2 clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare electrical impedance myography (EIM) 50 kHz phase to weight, motor score, paw grip endurance (PGE), CMAP amplitude, and MUNE for the identification of disease progression and the effect of riluzole in the SOD1 G93A mouse. Methods Twenty-three animals received 8 mg/kg/day riluzole in the drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age; 22 animals served as controls. Weight, motor score, PGE, CMAP, MUNE, and EIM were performed weekly to evaluate disease progression. Results No difference in clinical disease onset or survival was found between treated and untreated groups. In addition, all methods failed to identify any beneficial effect of riluzole. Thus, data from all animals were combined for additional analyses. Of the 4 parameters, EIM phase showed the earliest change from baseline and the most linear decline throughout the entire measurement period. In addition, EIM phase correlated with PGE, CMAP amplitude, and MUNE (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a0.92, 0.90, and 0.72, respectively, p<0.01 for all). The rate of EIM phase decline also correlated with individual animal survival (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.31, p<0.05). Conclusions At this dose, riluzole is ineffective in slowing progression of ALS. However, EIM phase shows early linear declines, supporting its potential as a useful new biomarker for preclinical drug testing.",

The relationship between EIM values and standard assessment measures, however, is unknown. Methods: EIM 50 kHz phase data from 60 subjects who participated in a longitudinal natural history study of ALS were correlated with handheld dynamometry (HHD), the ALS Functional Rating Scale\u2010Revised (ALSFRS\u2010R) score, and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Results: Moderate strength correlations between EIM parameters and HHD were observed for both whole\u2010body and individual upper and lower extremity values. Similarly, moderate strength correlations were observed between EIM and ALSFRS\u2010R upper and lower extremity subscores, but not total ALSFRS\u2010R scores. MUNE correlated significantly with single muscle EIM data but not with whole body or upper or lower extremity values.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Electrical impedance myography (EIM) can quantify muscle health at a range of frequencies, including that most commonly employed, 50 kHz. However, disease\u2010related changes in EIM data suggest the distinction between normal and patient EIM values could be more apparent at frequencies of >50 kHz. We investigated at what other selected frequencies tongue EIM may differentiate healthy individuals and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, remain reliable, and correlate with a standard metric of bulbar function. Methods: Tongue EIM phase data from 30 volunteers and 11 ALS patients were analyzed at 6 discrete frequencies from 50 to 500 kHz. Results: Of the frequencies assessed, EIM demonstrated maximal separation and reliability at 100 kHz, where phase value was also significantly correlated with the bulbar subscore on the revised version of the ALS Functional Rating Scale.

        "abstract": "Objective: Electrical impedance myography (EIM) performed on the centre of the tongue shows promise in detecting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Lateral recordings may improve diagnostic performance and provide pathophysiological insights through the assessment of asymmetry. However, it is not known if electrode proximity to the muscle edge, or electrode rotation, distort spectra. We evaluated this using finite element-based modelling. Approach: Nine thousand EIM from patients and healthy volunteers were used to develop a finite element model for phase and magnitude. Simulations varied electrode proximity to the muscle edge and electrode rotation. LT-Spice simulations assessed disease effects. Patient data were assessed for reliability, agreement and classification performance. Main results: No effect on phase spectra was seen if all electrodes remained in contact with the tissue. Small effects on magnitude were observed. Cole-Cole circuit simulations indicated capacitance reduced with disease severity. Lateral tongue muscle recordings in both patients and healthy volunteers were reproducible and symmetrical. Combined lateral/central tongue EIM improved disease classification compared to either placement alone. Significance: Lateral EIM tongue measurements using phase angle are feasible. Such measurements are reliable, find no evidence of tongue muscle asymmetry in ALS and improve disease classification. Lateral measurements enhance tongue EIM in ALS.",

        "title": "Electrical impedance myography combined with quantitative assessment techniques in paretic muscle of stroke survivors: Insights and challenges",
        "abstract": "Aging is a non-modifiable risk factor for stroke and the global burden of stroke is continuing to increase due to the aging society. Muscle dysfunction, common sequela of stroke, has long been of research interests. Therefore, how to accurately assess muscle function is particularly important. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) has proven to be feasible to assess muscle impairment in patients with stroke in terms of micro structures, such as muscle membrane integrity, extracellular and intracellular fluids. However, EIM alone is not sufficient to assess muscle function comprehensively given the complex contributors to paretic muscle after an insult. This article discusses the potential to combine EIM and other common quantitative methods as ways to improve the assessment of muscle function in stroke survivors. Clinically, these combined assessments provide not only a distinct advantage for greater accuracy of muscle assessment through cross-validation, but also the physiological explanation on muscle dysfunction at the micro level. Different combinations of assessments are discussed with insights for different purposes. The assessments of morphological, mechanical and contractile properties combined with EIM are focused since changes in muscle structures, tone and strength directly reflect the muscle function of stroke survivors. With advances in computational technology, finite element model and machine learning model that incorporate multi-modal evaluation parameters to enable the establishment of predictive or diagnostic model will be the next step forward to assess muscle function for individual with stroke.",
