        "title": "Crohn's disease and Escherichia coli. A new approach in therapy to maintain remission of colonic Crohn's disease?",
        "abstract": "Involvement of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has long been suggested because, among other reasons, the inflammatory response resembles that in infectious bowel diseases. Elevated antibody levels to pathogen antigens and a changed metabolic activity of the intestinal microflora have been detected in patients with Crohn's disease. Several studies have revealed a possible etiologic link between intestinal microorganisms and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, several therapeutic strategies, including reduction or dilution of bacterial components in the intestine by antibiotics or intestinal lavage, respectively, inactivation of inflammatory bacterial products, and reconstitution of intestinal microflora have been employed, substantiating the idea that dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier and an alteration of bacterial composition contribute to the inflammatory disease. However, the beneficial effect of restoration of the physiologic intestinal microflora in colonic inflammation by exogenous administration of a viable nonpathogenic bacterium has not been investigated before in a placebo-controlled study. Promising results came from the present pilot study in which the nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 was tested for efficacy and tolerance in maintaining remission in patients with colonic Crohn's disease. Application of the physiologic bacteria reduced the risk for relapse and minimized the need for glucocorticoids. Therefore we are convinced that in Crohn's disease parts of the intestinal microflora, including the host's immune response toward indigenous flora or an impairment of the gut flora's metabolic activity are involved in the development or at least in the onset of relapse from remissive of colonic Crohn's disease. However, more data are necessary to prove the benefit of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 as a new therapy to maintain remission of colonic Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Background Lactobacillus GG is a safe probiotic bacterium known to transiently colonize the human intestine. It has been found to be useful in treatment of several gastrointestinal conditions characterized by increased gut permeability. In the current study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG was investigated in children with Crohn's disease. Methods In this open-label pilot evaluation viewed as a necessary preliminary step for a possible subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trial, four children with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease were given Lactobacillus GG (1010 colony-forming units [CFU]) in enterocoated tablets twice a day for 6 months. Changes in intestinal permeability were measured by a double sugar permeability test. Clinical activity was determined by measuring the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. Results There was a significant improvement in clinical activity 1 week after starting Lactobacillus GG, which was sustained throughout the study period. Median pediatric Crohn's disease activity index scores at 4 weeks were 73% lower than baseline. Intestinal permeability improved in an almost parallel fashion. Conclusions Findings in this pilot study show that Lactobacillus GG may improve gut barrier function and clinical status in children with mildly to moderately active, stable Crohn's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted for a final assessment of the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of probiotics, once discussed primarily in the context of alternative medicine, is now entering mainstream medicine. However, only a few of the potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of exciting promises and many unanswered questions.",

Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. Setting Primary care. Participants Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. Intervention Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. Results 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. Conclusions Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data.

        "abstract": "This review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus), and Lactobacillus reuteri. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. Few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or Clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. Overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. On the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. Most commonly employed probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. They consistently show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains\u2014mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii, but also L. reuteri\u2014in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. Such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. The effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10\u2009billion/d being necessary.",

Identification of feasible strategies to combat this disease burden is an important public health need. We evaluated the efficacy of adding prebiotic oligosaccharide and probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 to milk, in preventing diarrhea, respiratory infections and severe illnesses, in children aged 1\u20134 years as part of a four group study design, running two studies simultaneously. Methods and Findings In a community based double-masked, randomized controlled trial, children 1\u20133 years of age, willing to participate, were randomly allocated to receive either control milk (Co; n\u200a=\u200a312) or the same milk fortified with 2.4 g/day of prebiotic oligosaccharide and 1.9\u00d7107 colony forming unit (c.f.u)/day of probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (PP; n\u200a=\u200a312). Children were followed up for 1 year providing data for 1\u20134 years. Biweekly household surveillance was conducted to gather information on compliance and morbidity. Both study groups were comparable at baseline; compliance to intervention was similar. Overall, there was no effect of prebiotic and probiotic on diarrhea (6% reduction, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: \u22121 to 12%; p\u200a=\u200a0.08). Incidence of dysentery episodes was reduced by 21% (95% CI: 0 to 38%; p\u200a=\u200a0.05). Incidence of pneumonia was reduced by 24% (95% CI: 0 to 42%; p\u200a=\u200a0.05) and severe acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) by 35% (95% CI: 0 to 58%; p\u200a=\u200a0.05). Compared to children in Co group, children in PP group had 16% (95% CI: 5 to 26%, p\u200a=\u200a0.004) and 5% (95% CI: 0 to 10%; p\u200a=\u200a0.05) reduction in days with severe illness and high fever respectively. Conclusions/Significance Milk can be a good medium for delivery of prebiotic and probiotic and resulted in significant reduction of dysentery, respiratory morbidity and febrile illness.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of calcium and probiotics on the incidence and duration of acute diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in low-socioeconomic communities of Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 494 healthy children aged 1 to 6 years who received low-lactose milk with low calcium content (LC; \u223c50 mg/day; n = 124), regular calcium content (RC; \u223c440 mg/day; n = 126), RC with 5.108 colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus casei CRL431 (casei; n = 120), or RC with 5.108 colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 (reuteri; n = 124). Number and duration of diarrhea and ARTIs episodes were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Incidence of World Health Organization\u2013defined diarrhea (\u22653 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was not significantly different between RC and LC (relative risk [RR]: 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62\u20131.58]), between casei and RC (RR: 1.21 [95% CI: 0.76\u20131.92]), or between reuteri and RC (RR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.46\u20131.25]) groups. Incidence of all reported diarrhea (\u22652 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was significantly lower in the reuteri versus RC group (RR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.46\u20130.99]). Irrespective of the definition used, reuteri significantly reduced diarrhea incidence in children with lower nutritional status (below-median height-and-weight-for-age z score). None of the interventions affected ARTIs. CONCLUSIONS: RC milk, alone or with L casei, did not reduce diarrhea or ARTIs in Indonesian children.

Commensal microbiota is critical for orchestrating tissue homeostasis and immunity in the intestine. Probiotics represent an interesting source of immune modulators and several clinical studies have addressed the potential beneficial effects of probiotics against respiratory infections. Therefore, we have investigated the mechanisms of protection conferred by L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 strain in a mouse model of influenza infection. Notably, local myeloid cells accumulation is generated in the lungs after seven days feeding with L. paracasei prior to viral infection. L. paracasei-fed mice showed reduced susceptibility to the influenza infection, associated with less accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs, faster viral clearance and general health improvement. Interestingly, Allobaculum was significantly increased in L. paracasei-fed mice 7 days after influenza infection, even if the gut microbiota composition was not altered overall. L. paracasei-purified peptidoglycan partially recapitulated the protective phenotype observed with the entire bacteria. Collectively, our results demonstrate that oral consumption of L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 modulates lung immunity was associated with an improved control of influenza infection. These results further extend the beneficial role for certain lactobacilli to alleviate the burden of respiratory tract infections.",

        "abstract": "Antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, are widely used for treatment of influenza virus infection. We reported previously that oseltamivir inhibits the viral growth cycle, ameliorates symptoms, and reduces viral antigen quantities. Suppressed viral antigen production, however, induces a reduction of acquired antiviral humoral immunity, and increases the incidence of re-infection rate in the following year. To achieve effective treatment of influenza virus infection, it is necessary to overcome these adverse effects of antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors. Feeding of yogurt fermented with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) OLL1073R-1 is reported to have immune-stimulatory effects on influenza virus infection in mice and humans. In the present study, we assessed the effect of feeding L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 yogurt cultures (YC) on local and systemic humoral immune responses, which were suppressed by oseltamivir treatment, in mice infected with influenza A virus. Yogurt culture (1.14 \u00d7 108 cfu/0.4 mL per mouse per day) or sterile water (vehicle) was administered by intragastric gavage for 35 d. At d 22, influenza A virus/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8; 0.5 pfu/15 \u03bcL per mouse) was instilled intranasally, followed immediately by oral administration of oseltamivir (50 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcL per mouse, twice daily) or 5% methylcellulose (100 \u03bcL/mouse) as a vehicle for 13 d. Titers of anti-PR8-specific IgG and IgA in serum and mucosal secretory IgA (S-IgA) and IgG in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed by ELISA at 14 d after infection. Oseltamivir significantly suppressed the induction of anti-PR8-specific IgG and IgA in serum and S-IgA and IgG in BALF after infection. Feeding YC mildly but significantly stimulated production of PR8-specific IgA in serum, S-IgA in BALF, and IgG in serum without changing the IgG2a:IgG1 ratio. We analyzed the neutralizing activities against PR8 in serum and BALF and found that oseltamivir also reduced protective immunity, and YC feeding abrogated this effect. The immune-stimulatory tendency of YC on anti-PR8-specific IgA and IgG titers in serum and BALF was also detected in mice re-infected with PR8, but the effect was insignificant, unlike the effect of YC in the initial infection.",

        "abstract": "Influenza virus infection can alter the composition of the gut microbiota, while its pathogenicity can, in turn, be highly influenced by the gut microbiota. However, the details underlying these associations remain to be determined. The H7N9 influenza virus is an emerging zoonotic pathogen which has caused the death of 616 humans and has incurred huge losses in the poultry industry. Here, we investigated the effects of infection with highly pathogenic H7N9 on gut microbiota and determined potential anti-influenza microbes. 16S rRNA sequencing results show that H7N9 infection alters the mouse gut microbiota by promoting the growth of Akkermansia, Ruminococcus 1, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, and reducing the abundance of Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group and Lachnoclostridium. Although the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila is positively related to H7N9 infection, the oral administration of cultures, especially of pasteurized A. muciniphila, can significantly reduce weight loss and mortality caused by H7N9 infection in mice. Furthermore, oral administration of live or pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly reduces pulmonary viral titers and the levels IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 but enhances the levels of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-10 in H7N9-infected mice, suggesting that the anti-influenza role of A. muciniphila is due to its anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. Taken together, we showed that the changes in the gut microbiota are associated with H7N9 infection and demonstrated the anti-influenza role of A. muciniphila, which enriches current knowledge about how specific gut bacterial strains protect against influenza infection and suggests a potential anti-influenza probiotic.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Akkermansia muciniphila, an intestinal microorganism, belongs to Verrucomicrobia, one of the most abundant microorganisms in the mammalian gut. It is a mucin-degrading bacterium that can colonise intestines of mammals such as humans and mice by utilising mucin as the only nitrogen and carbon source. When A. muciniphila colonises the intestine, its metabolites interact with the intestinal barrier, affecting host health by consolidating the intestinal barrier, regulating metabolic functions of the intestinal and circulatory systems, and regulating immune functions. This review summarised the mechanisms of A. muciniphila-host interactions that are relevant to host health. We focussed on characteristics of A. muciniphila in relation to its metabolites to provide a comprehensive understanding of A. muciniphila and its effects on host health and disease processes.",

        "abstract": "An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila exhibits positive systemic effects on host health, mainly by improving immunological and metabolic functions, and it is therefore regarded as a promising potential probiotic. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that A. muciniphila plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that A. muciniphila and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, A. muciniphila was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of A. muciniphila remains much controversial. This review summarizes the proposed roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and autism spectrum disorders, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic application of A. muciniphila for the treatment of these conditions.",

        "abstract": "Many researchers propose manipulating microbiota to prevent and treat related diseases. The brain\u2013gut axis is an object that remains the target of modern research, and it is not without reason that many researchers enrich it with microbiota and diet in its name. Numerous connections and mutual correlations have become the basis for seeking answers to many questions related to pathology as well as human physiology. Disorders of this homeostasis as well as dysbiosis itself accompany neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. Heavily dependent on external factors, modulation of the gut microbiome represents an opportunity to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Probiotic interventions, synbiotic interventions, or fecal transplantation can undoubtedly support the biotherapeutic process. A special role is played by diet, which provides metabolites that directly affect the body and the microbiota. A holistic view of the human organism is therefore essential.",
