        "abstract": "Background: Various studies indicate that the green tea has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. Moreover, a few studies have been carried out that demonstrate beneficial effects of green tea on burned patients. Materials and Methods: In this study, green tea, Vaseline, and silver sulfadiazine dressings were used as first-aid treatment to deep dermal contact burns in rats, compared with a control of nothing. After creating second-degree burn on the dorsum of rats, the treatments were applied for 15 min in four groups. Wound dressing changes were daily. Macroscopic study was performed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 by using a digital camera and software processing of photos. Microscopic examination was done by pathologic evaluation of skin specimens on day 14. Results: We observed that green tea usage significantly decreased burn size in comparison to the control group (P = 0.004). Conclusion: Green tea is effective on healing process of second degree burn wounds.",

        "title": "Antioxidative and Antidiabetic Effects of Natural Polyphenols and Isoflavones",
        "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

        "title": "Comprehensive evaluation of the role of soy and isoflavone supplementation in humans and animals over the past two decades",
        "abstract": "Soy and soy\u2010based foods are considered healthy, particularly in many Asia\u2013Pacific countries, where soy products have long been consumed. Soy and soy\u2010related products have been found to help prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. These products can also have antioxidative effects that alleviate hot flashes during menopause and bone loss. These biological and therapeutic functions are primarily due to the isoflavones derived from soy, whose structure is similar to the structure of 17\u2010\u03b2\u2010oestradiol. Despite the many health benefits for humans and animals, the application of isoflavones remains controversial because of their anti\u2010oestrogenic properties. We focused on general information regarding isoflavones, as well as their structure, function, and application. We summarized evidence showing that dietary or supplemental isoflavones exert protective effects on the health of humans and animals. Based on the literature, we conclude that soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe; however, more high\u2010quality trials are needed to fully substantiate their potential use.",

        "title": "Isoflavone biochanin A, a novel nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element activator, protects against oxidative damage in HepG2 cells.",
        "abstract": "Isoflavones are one group of the major flavonoids and possess multiple biological activities due to their antioxidant properties. However, a clear antioxidant mechanism of dietary isoflavones is still remained to be answered. In this study, the effects of isoflavones on the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Results showed that isoflavones are potential Nrf2-ARE activators while their activities were structure dependent. Biochanin A (BCA), an O-methylated isoflavone with low direct antioxidant activity, can effectively protect HepG2 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative damage via activation of the Nrf2 signaling, and thereby the induction of downstream cytoprotective enzymes including NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, heme oxygenasae-1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. A molecular docking study revealed that BCA could directly bind into the pocket of Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a cytoplasmic suppressor of Nrf2, to facilitate Nrf2 activation. The upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were also involved in the activation of Nrf2 signaling. These findings indicate that the protective actions of dietary isoflavones against oxidative damage may be at least partly due to their ability to enhance the intracellular antioxidant response system by modulating the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Revision operations have become a new issue after successful artificial joint replacements, and periprosthetic osteolysis leading to prosthetic loosening is the main cause of why the overactivation of osteoclasts (OCs) plays an important role. The effect of biochanin A (BCA) has been examined in osteoporosis, but no study on the role of BCA in prosthetic loosening osteolysis has been conducted yet. In this study, we utilised enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, computed tomography imaging, and histological analysis. Results showed that BCA downregulated the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), and IL\u20101\u03b2 to suppress inflammatory responses. The secretion levels of receptor\u2010activated nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB ligand, CTX\u20101, and osteoclast\u2010associated receptor as well as Ti\u2010induced osteolysis were also reduced. BCA effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed hydroxyapatite resorption by downregulating OC\u2010related genes in vitro. Analysis of mechanisms indicated that BCA inhibited the signalling pathways of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (P38, extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase, and c\u2010JUN N\u2010terminal kinase) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (inhibitor \u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and P65), thereby downregulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 and c\u2010Fos. In conclusion, BCA may be an alternative choice for the prevention of prosthetic loosening caused by OCs.",

        "abstract": "Natural alkaloids are polycyclic, nitrogen-containing, and basic compounds obtained from plants. In this review, the advances in bioactive alkaloids with respect to their chemical structures, herbal sources, and effects for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are discussed. Anti-osteoporosis alkaloids are classified into six categories based on the chemical structure, namely, isoquinoline alkaloids, quinolizidine alkaloids, piperidine alkaloids, indole alkaloids, pyrrolizidine alkaloids and steroidal alkaloids. They promote mesenchymal stem cells differentiation, improve osteoblast proliferation, stimulate osteoblast autophagy and suppress osteoclast formation. These natural alkaloids can regulate multiple signaling pathways, including interrupting the tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6- receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B interaction, inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B pathway in osteoclasts, activating the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway in osteoblasts, and triggering the wingless and int-1 pathway in mesenchymal stem cells. This review provides evidence and support for novel drug and clinical treatment of osteoporosis using natural alkaloids.",

        "title": "IKK/NF\u2010\u03baB and ROS signal axes are involved in Tenacissoside H mediated inhibitory effects on LPS\u2010induced inflammatory osteolysis",
        "abstract": "Periodontal disease and arthroplasty prosthesis loosening and destabilization are both associated with osteolysis, which is predominantly caused by abnormal bone resorption triggered by pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Osteoclasts (OCs) are critical players in the process. Concerns regarding the long\u2010term efficacy and side effects of current frontline therapies, however, remain. Alternative therapies are still required. The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of Tenacissoside H (TDH) in RANKL\u2010mediated OC differentiation, as well as inflammatory osteolysis and associated processes. In vitro, bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (BMMs) cultured with RANKL and M\u2010CSF were used to detect TDH in the differentiation and function of OCs. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of specific genes and inflammatory factors in OCs. Western blot was used to identify NFATc1, IKK, NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPK pathway, and oxidative stress\u2010related components. Finally, an LPS\u2010mediated calvarial osteolysis mouse model was employed to explore TDH's role in inflammatory osteolysis. The results showed that in vivo TDH inhibited the differentiation and resorption functions of OCs and down\u2010regulated the transcription of osteoclast\u2010specific genes, as well as Il\u20101\u03b2, Il\u20106 and Tnf\u2010\u03b1. In addition, TDH inhibited the IKK and NF\u2010\u03baB signalling pathways and down\u2010regulated the level of ROS. In vivo studies revealed that TDH improves the bone loss caused by LPS. TDH may be a new candidate or treatment for osteoclast\u2010associated inflammatory osteolytic disease.",
