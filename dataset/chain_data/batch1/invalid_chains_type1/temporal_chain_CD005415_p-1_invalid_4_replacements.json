        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Pharmacotherapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding has been difficult to evaluate because clinical end points are infrequent and affected by other factors. AIMS To evaluate whether blood in the stomach at endoscopy reflected severity of bleeding, predicted clinical outcomes, and could be altered by therapeutic agents. METHODS We studied 414 consecutive admissions with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were randomised to receive lansoprazole 60 mg followed by 30 mg four times daily, tranexamic acid 2 g followed by 1 g four times daily, both drugs, or placebo for four days, until discharge or a clinical end point occurred. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of endoscopic changes and clinical outcomes, and to investigate the effects of drug treatments on blood in the stomach. RESULTS Of 414 patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 379 were endoscoped. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was confirmed in 316. Sixteen required surgery within 30 days and 16 died on the index admission. Trial treatments were evaluable on a per protocol basis in 228 patients. The amount of blood in the stomach was found to reflect initial risk, with significant associations with high risk categorisation (odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.5\u20139.4) for more than a trace v none/trace), age (1.5 (1.1\u20131.9) per decade), and initial pulse (1.02 (1.00\u20131.04) per beat), and to predict rebleeding (9.2 (4.6\u201318.7)) and surgery (8.2 (2.9\u201322.9)). Other stigmata were less significant in these respects. The amount of blood in the stomach at endoscopy was reduced significantly by both lansoprazole (0.22 (0.07\u20130.63)) and tranexamic acid (0.27 (0.09\u20130.81)), although there was no evidence of synergy. CONCLUSIONS Blood in the stomach reflects clinical features in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is reduced by treatment with lansoprazole and tranexamic acid.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a pilot, non-randomized trial we tested the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent fibrinolytic inhibitor, as adjunctive therapy in standard treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty consecutive patients (12 male, eight female; 63+/-8 years) with 36 episodes of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding were included in the study. In 16 episodes of bleeding TXA was used (in a dosage of 20 mg intravenously, followed for the next 4 weeks by 10 mg/kg/48 h orally), whereas in 20 other cases of bleeding, TXA was not used. The decision to use TXA was left to the attending physician's clinical judgement, resulting in all the more severe cases of bleeding being treated with TXA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment including TXA was shown to be beneficial (relative to cases not treated with TXA) in terms of decreasing the rate of early re-bleeding (in the first week, 0 vs 6, P<0.05), the rate of early and late re-bleeding (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05), the rate of repeated endoscopic procedures (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05) and the number of blood transfusions needed (in the first month, 1.4+/-1.3 vs 2.6+/-1.5 units, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this pilot study suggest that TXA can be beneficial in the treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients. This remains to be definitely confirmed in a randomized study.",

        "abstract": "Summary Some previous studies suggest that activation of the fibrinolytic system may induce platelet dysfunction in haemodialysis patients. Accordingly, inhibition of fibrinolysis may improve platelet dysfunction, and speculatively increase haemoglobin levels. We tested this hypothesis. The study group comprised 22 patients (14 male, 8 female, median age 62), who had been on maintenance haemodialysis for more than one year. Patients were treated for three months with low-dose tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent anti-fibrinolytic agent. The dosages of erythropoietin and the haemodialysis procedure were not changed significantly during the study. We primarily followed platelet function (by in vitro closure time test) and haemoglobin values. Patients were divided into those with substantially prolonged (N=9) and those with slightly delayed or normal (N=13) in vitro closure time. Treatment with TXA resulted in a significant improvement of platelet function and increased levels of haemoglobin in the first group, and no changes in either platelet function or haemoglobin values in the second group. TXA in the dosage used was biologically active, since a significant decrease in plasminogen and D-dimer were found in both groups. No significant changes in other fibrinolytic parameters or von Willebrand factor were found. No complications in terms of arterial or venous thrombosis were observed. Our pilot study suggests that long term, low-dose TXA treatment of haemodialysis patients with substantially prolonged in vitro closure time results in a significant improvement of platelet dysfunction and a significant increase in haemoglobin values. These new, promising results merit further investigation in larger studies.",

        "abstract": "We describe a successful treatment of a severe, persistent bleeding from both kidneys in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent antifibrinolytic agent. The bleeding could not be controlled by intensive conservative treatment, it became life-threatening and urgent bilateral nephrectomy was intended. Since local and systemic hyperfibrinolysis play a role in bleeding in ADPKD patients, we tried TXA treatment. In fact, the massive bleeding promptly stopped, and haematuria gradually ceased. Removal of both kidneys was prevented. After 5 days both ureters became obstructed by blood clots, but placing J-catheters in each pyelon successfully solved this complication. Our case shows that it is reasonable to try antifibrinolytic treatment with TXA in such devastating uncontrolled bleeding.",

        "abstract": "This is the first report of a case of a reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function in a patient with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) receiving rapamycin. A 42-year-old man with ADPKD and a severe persistent bleeding from his solitary left kidney was successfully treated with tranexamic acid (TXA). He also received low-dose rapamycin for 8 months, and this was associated with a 23.5% reduction in kidney volume, improvement and stabilization of renal function, and normalization of haemoglobin levels. When treatment with rapamycin was interrupted, renal function deteriorated within an 8-month period and haemodialysis (HD) became necessary. Kidney volume increased at once, and life-threatening bleeding prompted a nephrectomy 4 months after the onset of HD. These data suggest that the reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function with rapamycin could be the result of the antiangiogenic, antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.",

To address this limitation, we tested the efficacy of rapamycin in a mouse model that results from conditional inactivation of Pkd1. Mosaic deletion of Pkd1 resulted in PKD and replicated characteristic features of human PKD including aberrant mTOR activation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis, and progressive fibrosis. Treatment with rapamycin was highly effective: It reduced cyst growth, preserved renal function, inhibited epithelial cell proliferation, increased apoptosis of cyst-lining cells, and inhibited fibrosis. These data provide in vivo evidence that rapamycin is effective in a human-orthologous mouse model of PKD.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) lead to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a leading cause of renal failure for which no treatment is available. PC1 is an integral membrane protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that membrane-anchored PC1 activates STAT3 in a JAK2-dependent manner, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC1 can undergo proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation. Tail-cleavage abolishes the ability of PC1 to directly activate STAT3 but the cleaved PC1 tail now coactivates STAT3 in a mechanism requiring STAT phosphorylation by cytokines or growth factors. This leads to an exaggerated cytokine response. Hence, PC1 can regulate STAT activity by a dual mechanism. In ADPKD kidneys PC1 tail fragments are overexpressed, including a unique \u223c15-kDa fragment (P15). STAT3 is strongly activated in cyst-lining epithelial cells in human ADPKD, and orthologous and nonorthologous polycystic mouse models. STAT3 is also activated in developing, postnatal kidneys but inactivated in adult kidneys. These results indicate that STAT3 signaling is regulated by PC1 and is a driving factor for renal epithelial proliferation during normal renal development and during cyst growth.",

        "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a most common genetic cause of chronic renal failure, is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of cysts in kidneys and other organs. The cystogenic process is highly complex and involves a high proliferative rate, increased apoptosis, altered protein sorting, changed secretory characteristics, and disorganization of the extracellular matrix. ADPKD is caused by mutations in the genes encoding polycystin-1 (PC-1) or polycystin-2 (PC-2). PC-1 undergoes multiple cleavages that intervene in several signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation mechanisms. One of these cleavages releases the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PC-1. In addition, the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of PC-1 and PC-2 interact in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature that suggests that PC-1 and PC-2 may function through a common signaling pathway necessary for normal tubulogenesis. We hope that a better understanding of PC-1 and PC-2 protein function will lead to progress in diagnosis and treatment for ADPKD.",

        "abstract": "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is an important cause of chronic kidney disease in children. The care of ARPKD patients has traditionally been the realm of pediatric nephrologists; however, the disease has multisystem effects, and a comprehensive care strategy often requires a multidisciplinary team. Most notably, ARPKD patients have congenital hepatic fibrosis, which can lead to portal hypertension, requiring close follow-up by pediatric gastroenterologists. In severely affected infants, the diagnosis is often first suspected by obstetricians detecting enlarged, echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios on prenatal ultrasounds. Neonatologists are central to the care of these infants, who may have respiratory compromise due to pulmonary hypoplasia and massively enlarged kidneys. Surgical considerations can include the possibility of nephrectomy to relieve mass effect, placement of dialysis access, and kidney and/or liver transplantation. Families of patients with ARPKD also face decisions regarding genetic testing of affected children, testing of asymptomatic siblings, or consideration of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for future pregnancies. They may therefore interface with genetic counselors, geneticists, and reproductive endocrinologists. Children with ARPKD may also be at risk for neurocognitive dysfunction and may require neuropsychological referral. The care of patients and families affected by ARPKD is therefore a multidisciplinary effort, and the general pediatrician can play a central role in this complex web of care. In this review, we outline the spectrum of clinical manifestations of ARPKD and review genetics of the disease, clinical and genetic diagnosis, perinatal management, management of organ-specific complications, and future directions for disease monitoring and potential therapies.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induces the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-\u03baB) and cytokine expression in gastric epithelial cells. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat) cascade is the inflammatory signaling in various cells. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether H. pylori-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) are mediated by the activation of Jak1/Stat3 in gastric epithelial (AGS) cells. Thus, gastric epithelial AGS cells were infected with H. pylori in Korean isolates (HP99) at bacterium/cell ratio of 300:1, and the level of IL-8 in the medium was determined by enzyme-linked immonosorbent assay. Phospho-specific and total forms of Jak1/Stat3 and I\u03baB\u03b1 were assessed by Western blot analysis, and NF-\u03baB activation was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results showed that H. pylori induced the activation of Jak1/Stat3 and IL-8 production, which was inhibited by a Jak/Stat3 specific inhibitor AG490 in AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. H. pylori-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, determined by phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB-DNA binding activity, were inhibited by AG490. In conclusion, Jak1/Stat3 activation may mediate the activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of IL-8 in H. pylori-infected AGS cells. Inhibition of Jak1/Stat3 may be beneficial for the treatment of H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation, since the activation of NF-\u03baB is inhibited and inflammatory cytokine expression is suppressed.",

        "abstract": "Estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol, E2) undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP1B1 to form 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2), a putative carcinogenic metabolite of estrogen. Our previous study showed that 4-OHE2-induced production of reactive oxygen species contributed to neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cells. In this study, 4-OHE2, but not E2, increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a sensor and regulator of oxidative stress, in MCF-10A cells. Silencing the HO-1 gene in MCF-10A cells suppressed 4-OHE2-induced cell proliferation and transformation. In addition, subcutaneous administration of 4-OHE2 markedly enhanced the growth of the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts, which was retarded by zinc protoporphyrin, a pharmacological inhibitor of HO-1. 4-OHE2-induced HO-1 expression was mediated by NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). We speculate that an electrophilic quinone formed as a consequence of oxidation of 4-OHE2 binds directly to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), an inhibitory protein that sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. This will diminish association between Nrf2 and Keap1. 4-OHE2 failed to interrupt the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 and to induce HO-1 expression in Keap1-C273S or C288S mutant cells. Lano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis in MCF-10A-Keap1-WT cells which were treated with 4-OHE2 revealed that the peptide fragment containing Cys288 gained a molecular mass of 287.15 Da, equivalent to the addition of a single molecule of 4-OHE2-derived ortho-quinones.",

        "abstract": "Aims: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress and has also been shown to regulate processes related to cancer progression. In this regard, HO-1 has been shown to display a dual effect with either antitumor or protumor activity, which is also true for breast cancer (BC). In this work, we address this discrepancy regarding the role of HO-1 in BC. Results: HO-1 was detected in human BC tissues, and its protein levels correlated with reduced tumor size and longer overall survival time of patients, thus suggesting the clinical importance of HO-1 in this type of cancer. Contrariwise, nuclear localization of HO-1 correlated with higher tumor grade suggesting that the effect of HO-1 is dependent on its cellular localization. In vivo experiments showed that both pharmacological activation and genetic overexpression of HO-1 reduce the tumor burden in two different animal models of BC. Furthermore, the pharmacological and genetic activation of HO-1 in several BC cell lines reduce the cellular viability by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and decrease the cellular migration and invasion rates by modulating pathways involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, HO-1 activation impaired in vivo the metastatic dissemination. Innovation and Conclusion: By using various BC cell lines and animal models as well as human tumor samples, we demonstrated that total HO-1 displays antitumor activities in BC. Furthermore, our study suggests that HO-1 subcellular localization may explain the differential effects observed for the protein in different tumor types.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Despite decades of extensive study into targeting cell death in breast cancer, including apoptosis, the clinical treatment remains challenging due to its high probability of recurrence. As an emerging form of cell death, ferroptosis features suppression of drug resistance and augmentation of antitumor immunity. The advances in the development of clinical drugs targeting ferroptosis provide growing silver linings for breast cancer treatment. Research into biomarkers to precisely trace ferroptosis in patients with cancer, and the development and subsequent application of novel ferroptosis-based therapies will be of critical importance in the next few years. Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. The discovery of regulated cell death processes has enabled advances in the treatment of BC. In the past decade, ferroptosis, a new form of iron-dependent regulated cell death caused by excessive lipid peroxidation has been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of BC. Intriguingly, the induction of ferroptosis acts to suppress conventional therapy-resistant cells, and to potentiate the effects of immunotherapy. As such, pharmacological or genetic modulation targeting ferroptosis holds great potential for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers. In this review, we present a critical analysis of the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks involved in ferroptosis, the potential physiological functions of ferroptosis in tumor suppression, its potential in therapeutic targeting, and explore recent advances in the development of therapeutic strategies for BC.",
