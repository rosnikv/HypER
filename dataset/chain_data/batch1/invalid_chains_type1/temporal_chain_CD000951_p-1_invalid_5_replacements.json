        "title": "Supplementation with Folic Acid during Methotrexate Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "The folic acid antagonist methotrexate (n-10-methyl-aminopterin) is useful in low doses (2.5 to 20 mg/wk) for treating chronic inflammatory diseases [1-7]. Many trials have established the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis [7-13]. Compared with other disease-modifying drugs, methotrexate has the highest probability of drug continuation at 10 years. Dose response-related toxic effects have been reported in 30% to 90% of patients given methotrexate [13]. Toxic effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic abnormalities, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity [14-22]. Some side effects of methotrexate administration, such as gastrointestinal intolerance, mimic complicated folate deficiency [23]. Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; further, folate stores are decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate, suggesting that impaired folate status is related to toxicity [24-26]. Folic acid supplementation has been reported anecdotally to lessen toxicity in patients receiving methotrexate treatment [27, 28]. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7 mg of folic acid weekly (1 mg/d or 2265 nmol/d) decreased methotrexate toxicity without affecting efficacy [29]. This was confirmed by Stewart and colleagues [30] in a retrospective chart review. Folinic acid (leucovorin, citrovorum factor) is a one-carbon-substituted, fully reduced folate that has also been administered during methotrexate therapy [31-36]. Low doses of the vitamin (1 to 7 mg/wk) have decreased methotrexate toxicity [35, 36]. Higher doses negate efficacy and lessen toxicity [31, 32]. Thus, the folinic acid dose may critically affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The influence of the folic acid dose on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy remains controversial, and the effects of different doses of folic acid are not known [37, 38]. Some investigators argue that if toxic effects occur, the most rational approach is to reduce the dose of methotrexate rather than to provide folic acid supplements [37]. We designed a larger and longer study to evaluate different doses of folic acid, assuming that toxicity could be reduced without changing the efficacy of methotrexate. Methods Participants Patients aged 19 to 78 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology's revised criteria for rheumatoid arthritis consented to participate in the trial [39]. Enrollment criteria included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed more than 6 months previously, onset after the age of 16 years, and at least three of the following signs or symptoms: 3 or more swollen joints, 6 or more tender joints, at least 45 minutes of morning stiffness, and a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h. Referring rheumatologists and the principal investigator did the screening. Exclusion criteria included serious concomitant medical illnesses, liver enzyme levels twice the upper limit of normal, leukocyte counts less than 3.5 109/L or platelet counts less than 150 109/L, and use of methotrexate within the past 6 months. Gold salts were stopped for at least 10 days before the trial. This short washout period mirrors actual rheumatology practice. Patients remained under the care of their rheumatologists, abstained from alcohol use, did not become pregnant, and received stable doses of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If prednisone was taken at entry, the dose could not exceed 10 mg/d. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was allowed during the study. Study Design Figure 1 shows the trial design. To maintain the double-blind status of the trial, the statistician carried out the randomization using a computer program in which the algorithm was transparent and a coded vial number represented the treatment assignment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups by a sequential treatment assignment process designed to balance the sample with respect to baseline features, including age, sex, folate-containing vitamin use, rheumatoid factor status, and prednisone use [40]. Patients agreed to discontinue therapy with folate-containing vitamins during the trial. Rheumatoid factor was considered positive if the level was more than 30 IU/mL or if the titer was more than 1:160. Patients received either visually identical placebo or 5 mg (low-dose folic acid group) or 27.5 mg folic acid (high-dose folic acid group) each week, prepared by the Hospital Investigational Drug Service. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the mean SD folic acid content was 1 0.15 mg (2.3 0.3 mol) and 5.5 0.3 mg (12.5 0.7 mol) per capsule in the low-dose and high-dose folic acid groups, respectively. Lederle Laboratories provided the methotrexate (Rheumatrex; Pearl River, New York), which was started in a median oral dose of 16.5 mol (7.5 mg) per week and increased in 5.5-mol (2.5 mg) increments at the rheumatologist's discretion. Methotrexate was taken either in an undivided or a divided dose (that is, every 12 hours for three doses). The methotrexate dosing regimens were identical among the study groups. Folic acid supplements were given 5 days per week when methotrexate was not ingested. Compliance with the regimen was reinforced using a digital reminder cap (Counter Cap; Senetics, Boulder, Colorado). All participants and investigators were blinded to vitamin capsule content until the study was complete. Figure 1. Study design for the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical Assessment Patients were evaluated immediately before methotrexate initiation at a mean of 13, 26, 39, and 53 weeks (Figure 1). Each patient was assessed by the same physician-nutritionist (SLM). Two research assistants (JSA or WHV) did the joint evaluations. In most cases, patients were examined by the same observer throughout the study. The joint counts for tenderness and swelling were not significantly different between the two observers (P = 0.6 for tenderness; P = 0.9 for swelling). The following variables were evaluated at each visit: 1) number of the 58 diarthrodial joints with swelling; 2) number of the 60 joints with tenderness on pressure or with pain on passive motion (or both); 3) joint swelling and tenderness indices, expressed as a sum, with each joint graded for swelling as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 [severe]; 4) mean grip strength (three measurements) for both hands expressed in mm Hg; 5) duration of morning stiffness expressed in hours; 6) patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity graded as 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (very severe); 7) current medications and doses; 8) a 1-day dietary recall using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software, Food Database version 6A, Nutrient Database version F21 [41]; 9) eight activities of daily living assessed and averaged at baseline and at 12 months using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and scored on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) [42]; and 10) presence, duration, intensity, and severity of toxic effects at every follow-up visit and every 3 weeks by telephone interview (done by SLM). Laboratory Assessments At the initial visit, complete blood cell count, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzyme (aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase), rheumatoid factor by nephelometry, and serum creatinine values were obtained. The complete blood cell count, creatinine, and liver function tests were repeated at all visits. If laboratory values were obtained more frequently than stipulated in the protocol, they were recorded and became part of the toxicity score. Blood for plasma and erythrocyte folate levels, using a methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay, was drawn at all visits [43]. At baseline, blood was drawn for a vitamin panel (plasma and erythrocyte folate, vitamins B12, A, C, and E, carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, pyridoxine) [44-51]. If patients had abnormal values for any of the vitamins, other than folate, the abnormality was treated with single vitamin supplements. Radiographic Assessment Hand and wrist radiographs taken within 6 months of entering the trial were assessed by one of the rheumatologists (GSA) without knowledge of study status. Joint erosions and space narrowing were determined by the modified method of Sharp [52]. Results were expressed as the mean raw scores for joint erosion and joint space narrowing. Toxicity: Frequency and Severity Toxic effects and discontinuation of therapy with study medications due to toxicity were considered primary outcomes. We determined a toxicity score, modified from the one previously used, for each patient at each visit or until methotrexate therapy was discontinued [29] (Appendix). Efficacy We determined patient response to treatment using a modification of the criteria used in our previous folic acid supplementation trial and by others [8, 29, 53]. We defined marked improvement in the joint swelling index and the joint tenderness and pain index as a net decrease of 50% or more in value at any follow-up visit compared with visit 1. We defined moderate improvement as a 30% to 49% net decrease in the index, and no change as the index value remaining within 30% of the original value. We defined worsening as an increase in the index value of 30% or more. We examined the effects of folic acid supplementation on changes in physician and patient global assessments, grip strength, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, findings of the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, complete blood cell counts, blood folate levels, and dietary folate and vitamin B12 intake.

Long-term low-dose methotrexate therapy (25 mg or less once a week) inhibits production of thymidylate, purines, and methionine and leads to accumulation of adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory substance. These actions inhibit cellular proliferation, decrease formation of antibodies, and decrease production of mediators of inflammation such as interleukins and eicosanoids. Three uncontrolled trials and two controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy of low-dose methotrexate therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease and have also suggested possible benefit for ulcerative colitis and for remission maintenance indications in both diseases. Although methotrexate is generally well tolerated for long-term use at a low dose, several serious toxicities potentially limit its use.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethotrexate is a promising new agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Methotrexate is currently used as a treatment for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. This study sought to evaluate the hepatic effects of long-term methotrexate therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to determine whether the established guidelines for monitoring methotrexate-related hepatotoxicity with surveillance liver biopsy in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis are applicable to these patients.METHODS:Thirty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving cumulative methotrexate doses of \u22651500 mg were studied. Liver chemistry tests were obtained before and during therapy. Twenty patients underwent liver biopsies as recommended for methotrexate-treated patients with psoriasis; the biopsies were reviewed and graded according to Roenigk's criteria for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity (a grading system for methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis patients) by a liver pathologist blinded to the methotrexate dose.RESULTS:In patients who had liver biopsies, the mean cumulative methotrexate dose was 2633 mg (range, 1500\u20135410 mg), given for a mean of 131.7 wk (range, 66\u2013281 wk). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had mild histological abnormalities (Roenigk's grade I and II), and one patient had hepatic fibrosis (Roenigk's grade IIIB). Abnormal liver chemistry tests, present in 6 of 20 (30%) patients, did not identify the patient with Roenigk's grade IIIB hepatotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS:Cumulative methotrexate doses up to 5410 mg given up to 281 wk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are associated with little hepatotoxicity. Surveillance liver biopsies based on cumulative methotrexate doses are not warranted in these patients.",

        "abstract": "We investigated whether polymorphisms in reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1 G80A) and gamma-glutamyl-hydrolase (GGH-401C/T) are predictive of methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG) levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with weekly low-dose methotrexate (MTX). Adult patients treated with MTX were enrolled in a multicentred study. Blood was drawn at the time of the visit, DNA was extracted and red blood cell (RBC) MTXPG levels (up to the penta-order of glutamation) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorometry. A G80A polymorphism in SLC19A1 and a -401C/T promoter polymorphism in GGH were measured by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were used to predict long-chain RBC MTXPG3-5. In 226 adult patients receiving MTX (median 15 mg range: 5-25 mg) median RBC long-chain MTXPG3-5 was 56 nmol/l (range < 5-224 nmol/l). A total of 35 patients carried the SLC19A1 80AA genotype whereas 36 patients carried the GGH-401TT genotype. Weekly MTX dose, age, presence of the SLC19A1 80AA and GGH-401TT genotypes predicted independently and significantly MTXPG3-5 levels (global r = 0.38; P < 0.0001). Patients with the GGH-401TT genotype were 4.8-fold [odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-13.0; P = 0.002] more likely to have MTXPG3-5 below the group median compared to patient carriers of the GGH-401CC or CT genotype. Conversely, those with the SLC19A1 80AA genotype were 3.4-fold more likely to have MTXPG3-5 levels above the group median compared to those with the SLC19A1 80GG or 80GA genotype (OR CI 95% 1.4-8.4; P = 0.007).

If the Disease Activity Score in 44 joints (DAS44) was >2.4 at 3 months, MTX was increased to 25 mg/week. MTX efficacy was evaluated at 3 and 6 months and compared for genotypes in 3 analyses: patients with and without good response (DAS44<or=2.4), patients with and without good improvement (DeltaDAS44>1.2), and patients with and without moderate improvement (DeltaDAS44>0.6). The association between MTX-related adverse drug events (ADEs) and genotype was evaluated by comparing genotypes between patients with and without ADEs, specifically pneumonitis, gastrointestinal ADEs, skin and mucosal ADEs, and elevated liver enzyme levels. The following SNPs were analyzed: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) -473G>A, DHFR 35289G>A, and reduced folate carrier 80G>A.

If the Disease Activity Score (DAS) was >2.4 at 3 months, the dosage of MTX was increased up to 25 mg/week. Twenty-four baseline variables possibly influencing disease state and drug response were selected. In addition, 17 polymorphisms in 13 genes related to the MTX mechanism of action, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, were determined. Factors were compared between responders (defined as patients with a DAS < or = 2.4 at 6 months) and nonresponders. In case of differences, a stepwise selection procedure identified the predictors for response. A clinical score was designed by simplifying regression coefficients of the independent variables.

        "abstract": "Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are uptake transporters for a broad range of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. To investigate the physiologic and pharmacologic roles of OATPs of the 1A and 1B subfamilies, we generated mice lacking all established and predicted mouse Oatp1a/1b transporters (referred to as Slco1a/1b-/- mice, as SLCO genes encode OATPs). Slco1a/1b-/- mice were viable and fertile but exhibited markedly increased plasma levels of bilirubin conjugated to glucuronide and increased plasma levels of unconjugated bile acids. The unexpected conjugated hyperbilirubinemia indicates that Oatp1a/1b transporters normally mediate extensive hepatic reuptake of glucuronidated bilirubin. We therefore hypothesized that substantial sinusoidal secretion and subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated reuptake of glucuronidated compounds can occur in hepatocytes under physiologic conditions. This alters our perspective on normal liver functioning. Slco1a/1b-/- mice also showed drastically decreased hepatic uptake and consequently increased systemic exposure following i.v. or oral administration of the OATP substrate drugs methotrexate and fexofenadine. Importantly, intestinal absorption of oral methotrexate or fexofenadine was not affected in Slco1a/1b-/- mice. Further analysis showed that rifampicin was an effective and specific Oatp1a/1b inhibitor in controlling methotrexate pharmacokinetics. These data indicate that Oatp1a/1b transporters play an essential role in hepatic reuptake of conjugated bilirubin and uptake of unconjugated bile acids and drugs. Slco1a/1b-/- mice will provide excellent tools to study further the role of Oatp1a/1b transporters in physiology and drug disposition.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nWe review recent advances in the biologic understanding and treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), identify therapeutically challenging subgroups, and suggest future directions of research.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA review of English literature on childhood acute leukemias from the past 5 years was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nContemporary treatments have resulted in 5-year event-free survival rates of approximately 80% for childhood ALL and almost 60% for pediatric AML. The advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses has provided new insights into leukemogenesis and identified many novel subtypes of leukemia. Virtually all ALL and the vast majority of AML cases can be classified according to specific genetic abnormalities. Cooperative mutations involved in cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, drug responsiveness, and apoptosis have also been identified in many cases. The development of new formulations of existing drugs, molecularly targeted therapy, and immunotherapies promises to further advance the cure rates and improve quality of life of patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe application of new high-throughput sequencing techniques to define the complete DNA sequence of leukemia and host normal cells and the development of new agents targeted to leukemogenic pathways promise to further improve outcome in the coming decade.",

        "title": "Impact of drug transporter pharmacogenomics on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability \u2013 considerations for drug development",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Drug transporter proteins are expressed on the cell membrane, regulating substrate exposure in systemic circulation and/or peripheral tissues. Genetic polymorphism of drug transporter genes encoding these proteins could alter the functional activity and/or protein expression, having effects on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), efficacy and adverse effects. Areas covered: The authors provide the reader with an overview of the pharmacogenetics (PGx) of 12 membrane transporters. The clinical literature is summarized as to the quantitative significance on pharmacokinetics (PK) and implications on pharmacodynamics (PD) and adverse effects, due to transporter influence on intracellular drug concentrations. Expert opinion: Unlike polymorphisms for cytochrome P450s (CYPs) resulting in large magnitude of PK variation, genetic mutations for membrane transporters are typically less than threefold alteration in systemic PK for drugs with a few exceptions. However, substantially greater changes in intracellular drug levels may result. We are aware of 1880 exome variants in 12 of the best-studied transporters to date, and nearly 40% of these change the amino acid. However, the functional consequences of most of these variants remain to be determined, and have only been empirically evaluated for a handful. To the extent that genetic polymorphisms impact ADME, it is a variable that will contribute to ethnic differences due to substantial frequency differences for the known variants.",

        "abstract": "Interindividual variability in protein expression of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and multidrug resistance-linked P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or ABCB1 was quantified in frozen human livers (n = 64) and cryopreserved human hepatocytes (n = 12) by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method. Membrane isolation, sample workup, and LC-MS/MS analyses were as described before by our laboratory. Briefly, total native membrane proteins, isolated from the liver tissue and cryopreserved hepatocytes, were trypsin digested and quantified by LC-MS/MS using signature peptide(s) unique to each transporter. The mean \u00b1 S.D. (maximum/minimum range in parentheses) protein expression (fmol/\u00b5g of membrane protein) in human liver tissue was OATP1B1- 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 (7), OATP1B3- 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 (8), OATP2B1- 1 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 (5), and P-gp- 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 (8). Transporter expression in the liver tissue was comparable to that in the cryopreserved hepatocytes. Most important is that livers with SLCO1B1 (encoding OATP1B1) haplotypes *14/*14 and *14/*1a [i.e., representing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), c.388A > G, and c.463C > A] had significantly higher (P < 0.0001) protein expression than the reference haplotype (*1a/*1a). Based on these genotype-dependent protein expression data, we predicted (using Simcyp) an up to \u223c40% decrease in the mean area under the curve of rosuvastatin or repaglinide in subjects harboring these variant alleles compared with those harboring the reference alleles. SLCO1B3 (encoding OATP1B3) SNPs did not significantly affect protein expression. Age and sex were not associated with transporter protein expression. These data will facilitate the prediction of population-based human transporter-mediated drug disposition, drug-drug interactions, and interindividual variability through physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.",

        "title": "Nucleoside transporter proteins as biomarkers of drug responsiveness and drug targets",
        "abstract": "Nucleoside and nucleobase analogs are currently used in the treatment of solid tumors, lymphoproliferative diseases, viral infections such as hepatitis and AIDS, and some inflammatory diseases such as Crohn. Two gene families are implicated in the uptake of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs into cells, SCL28 and SLC29. The former encodes hCNT1, hCNT2, and hCNT3 proteins. They translocate nucleosides in a Na+ coupled manner with high affinity and some substrate selectivity, being hCNT1 and hCNT2 pyrimidine- and purine-preferring, respectively, and hCNT3 a broad selectivity transporter. SLC29 genes encode four members, being hENT1 and hENT2 the only two which are unequivocally implicated in the translocation of nucleosides and nucleobases (the latter mostly via hENT2) at the cell plasma membrane. Some nucleoside-derived drugs can also interact with and be translocated by members of the SLC22 gene family, particularly hOCT and hOAT proteins. Inter-individual differences in transporter function and perhaps, more importantly, altered expression associated with the disease itself might modulate the transporter profile of target cells, thereby determining drug bioavailability and action. Drug transporter pharmacology has been periodically reviewed. Thus, with this contribution we aim at providing a state-of-the-art overview of the clinical evidence generated so far supporting the concept that these membrane proteins can indeed be biomarkers suitable for diagnosis and/or prognosis. Last but not least, some of these transporter proteins can also be envisaged as drug targets, as long as they can show \u201ctransceptor\u201d functions, in some cases related to their role as modulators of extracellular adenosine levels, thereby providing a functional link between P1 receptors and transporters.",

        "abstract": "P-glycoprotein is one of the most well-studied drug transporters, significant for its role in cancer multiple drug resistance. However, using P-gp inhibitors with the aim of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-cancer drugs has led to disappointing outcomes. Furthermore, several lead compounds suggested by in vitro and pre-clinical studies have shown variable pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacies when applied in the clinical setting. This review will highlight the need to revisit a sound approach to better design and apply P-gp inhibitors in light of safety and efficacy. Challenges confronting the issue hinge upon myriad studies that do not necessarily represent the heterogeneous target population of this therapeutic approach. The application of P-gp modulators has also been complicated by the promiscuous substrate-binding behaviour of P-gp, as well as toxicities related to its intrinsic presence in healthy tissue. This review capitalizes on information spanning genetics, energetics, and pharmacology, bringing to light some fundamental aspects that ought to be reconsidered in order to improve upon and design the next generation of P-gp inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Organic cation transporters collectively called OCTs belong to three gene families (SLC22A1 OCT1, SLC22A2 OCT2, SLC22A3 OCT3, SLC22A4 OCTN1, SLC22A5 OCTN2, SLC29A4 PMAT, SLC47A1 MATE1, and SLC47A1 MATE2-K). OCTs transport structurally diverse drugs with overlapping selectivity. Some OCTs were shown to be critically involved in pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of cationic drugs. Drug-drug interactions at individual OCTs were shown to result in clinical effects. Procedures for in vitro testing of drugs for interaction with OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K have been recommended. Areas covered: An overview of functional properties, cation selectivity, location, and clinical impact of OCTs is provided. In addition, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in OCTs are compiled. Because it was observed that the half maximal concentration of drugs to inhibit transport by OCTs (IC 50) is dependent on the transported cation and its concentration, an advanced protocol for in vitro testing of drugs for interaction with OCTs is proposed. In addition, it is suggested to include OCT3 and PMAT for in vitro testing. Expert opinion: Research on clinical roles of OCTs should be reinforced including more transporters and drugs. An improvement of the in vitro testing protocol considering recent data is imperative for the benefit of patients.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Successful neuropharmacology requires optimization of CNS drug delivery and, by extension, free drug concentrations at brain molecular targets. Detailed assessment of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) physiological characteristics is necessary to achieve this goal. The \u2018next frontier\u2019 in CNS drug delivery is targeting BBB uptake transporters, an approach that requires evaluation of brain endothelial cell transport processes so that effective drug accumulation and improved therapeutic efficacy can occur. Areas covered BBB permeability of drugs is governed by tight junction protein complexes (i.e., physical barrier) and transporters/enzymes (i.e., biochemical barrier). For most therapeutics, a component of blood-to-brain transport involves passive transcellular diffusion. Small molecule drugs that do not possess acceptable physicochemical characteristics for passive permeability may utilize putative membrane transporters for CNS uptake. While both uptake and efflux transport mechanisms are expressed at the brain microvascular endothelium, uptake transporters can be targeted for optimization of brain drug delivery and improved treatment of neurological disease states. Expert opinion Uptake transporters represent a unique opportunity to optimize brain drug delivery by leveraging the endogenous biology of the BBB. A rigorous understanding of these transporters is required to improve translation from the bench to clinical trials and stimulate the development of new treatment paradigms for neurological diseases.",
