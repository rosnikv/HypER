        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C (non-A, non-B hepatitis) is a common and often progressive viral liver disease. To assess the efficacy of therapy with the antiviral agent interferon alfa, we randomly assigned 166 patients with chronic hepatitis C to treatment with either 3 million or 1 million units of recombinant interferon alfa three times weekly for 24 weeks, or to no treatment. The probability of normalization or near normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase levels after six months of interferon therapy was 46 percent in patients treated with 3 million units of interferon (P less than 0.001) and 28 percent in those treated with 1 million units (P less than 0.02), but only 8 percent in untreated patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase level became completely normal in 22 of the 26 patients (85 percent) who responded to treatment with 3 million units of interferon and 9 of the 16 patients (56 percent) who responded to treatment with 1 million units. The patients who received 3 million units of interferon had histologic improvement because of the regression of lobular and periportal inflammation. Relapse within six months after the completion of treatment occurred in 51 percent of the patients treated with 3 million units of interferon and 44 percent of those treated with 1 million units. We conclude that a 24-week course of interferon therapy is effective in controlling disease activity in many patients with hepatitis C, although relapse after the cessation of treatment is common.",

        "abstract": "In previous studies employing interferons (IFNs) in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, there have been few reliable predictors of sustained responses. We retrospectively evaluated the predictive value of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010RNA measurements in the first few months during consensus interferon (CIFN) treatment using a sensitive reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay to determine sustained responses. Data from two large treatment trials, one of IFN\u2010naive patients and one of retreated relapsers and nonresponders, were used, including serum samples at 2\u2010week intervals in the naive study and 8\u2010week intervals in the retreatment study. Patients received initial CIFN (9 \u03bcg) treatment for 6 months and were assessed 6 months after treatment. There were 28 sustained viral responders of 232 CIFN\u2010treated patients. Of the sustained responders, 48% had already cleared HCV RNA from serum (<100 copies/mL) by week 2, 78% by week 4, 81% by week 6, and 96% by week 12. Patients with early HCV\u2010RNA clearance were more likely to have sustained responses than those who responded later. Early clearance of HCV from serum was also associated with greater likelihood of a sustained response to 48 weeks of retreatment with 15 \u03bcg CIFN. Ninety\u2010five percent of the sustained responders were HCV\u2010RNA\u2013negative by week 8 of retreatment.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is prevalent worldwide and has become a major cause of liver dysfunction and hepatocellular carcinoma. The high prevalence of HCV reflects the persistent nature of infection and the large frequency of cases that resist the current interferon (IFN)-based anti-HCV therapeutic regimens. HCV resistance to IFN has been attributed, in part, to the function of the viral nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein. NS5A from IFN-resistant strains of HCV can repress the PKR protein kinase, a mediator of the IFN-induced antiviral and apoptotic responses of the host cell and a tumor suppressor. Here we examined the relationship between HCV persistence and resistance to IFN therapy. When expressed in mammalian cells, NS5A from IFN-resistant HCV conferred IFN resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which normally is sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFN. NS5A blocked viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced PKR activation and phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1 in IFN-treated cells, resulting in high levels of VSV mRNA translation. Mutations within the PKR-binding domain of NS5A restored PKR function and the IFN-induced block to viral mRNA translation. The effects due to NS5A inhibition of PKR were not limited to the rescue of viral mRNA translation but also included a block in PKR-dependent host signaling pathways. Cells expressing NS5A exhibited defective PKR signaling and were refractory to apoptosis induced by exogenous dsRNA. Resistance to apoptosis was attributed to an NS5A-mediated block in eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Moreover, cells expressing NS5A exhibited a transformed phenotype and formed solid tumors in vivo. Disruption of apoptosis and tumorogenesis required the PKR-binding function of NS5A, demonstrating that these properties may be linked to the IFN-resistant phenotype of HCV.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C is a necroinflammatory disease of the liver that is caused by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (1). Uniquely adapted to establish persistent infections within the human liver, the major pathologic hallmark of this flavivirus infection is the insidious progression of hepatic fibrosis and loss of functioning hepatocyte mass (2-4). Typically, this occurs against a background of chronic hepatic inflammation and associated macroand microvesicular steatosis. A significant proportion of infected persons ultimately develop cirrhosis, hepatic failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (5-7). These lethal manifestations of hepatitis C are currently thought to result in approximately 8,000-10,000 deaths annually among the 3.9 million Americans infected with this virus (8). This makes hepatitis C the single most common cause of clinically significant liver disease in the United States today. Despite this, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the chronic hepatic changes that are associated with this viral infection. However, it is generally believed that most if not all of the pathologic consequences of hepatitis C arise as a result of the cellular immune response to the infection, and that the infection itself is likely to be noncytopathic. Existing therapies for chronic hepatitis C include recombinant human interferon, either alone or in combination with ribavirin (9,10).

        "abstract": "The role of host immunity in the development of virus-induced cancers has been difficult to elucidate, in part because of our inability to effectively measure multiple immune parameters using available amounts of biological material. The objective of the present study was to validate the use of a newly developed multiplex assay, the LINCOplex assay, for the simultaneous measurement of multiple cytokines [interleukin/(IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha]. Supernatants obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures stimulated with various different mitogens and antigens (including phytohemagglutinin, influenza, tetanus, HPV16 E6 and E7 peptides, and media alone) were selected for study. In total, 750 specimens obtained from 26 participants were tested in replicate using the 8-plex LINCOplex assay (25 micro l of specimen required per well). Every specimen was included in duplicate in a blinded fashion. For some specimens, multiple 2-fold dilutions of the same specimen were included to evaluate the linearity of results. The availability of independently obtained IL-2 and IFN-gamma results from standard single cytokine (simplex) assays allowed for a direct comparison between the LINCOplex results and those obtained from the simplex assays. Spearman correlation coefficients for continuous results, and exact agreement rates and weighted kappa statistics for quartiled variables, were computed to evaluate intra- and interassay agreement. IL-4 levels were consistently below the detectable level of the assay (3 pg/ml) whereas IL-6 and IL-8 levels were consistently above the highest detectable level of the assay (10,000 pg/ml), and these three cytokines were, therefore, not evaluated further. For the remaining five cytokines, excellent intra-assay reproducibility was observed, with Spearman correlation coefficients consistently above 0.90 for all five cytokines. Exact agreement rates ranging from 77.6-90.3% and weighted kappas ranging from 0.81-0.92 were observed. Similar results were observed when analysis was restricted to supernatants obtained from cultures that had been stimulated with HPV16 peptides and when analysis was restricted to supernatants obtained from cultures containing no antigen or mitogen, suggesting that the LINCOplex assay is applicable under conditions where moderate or weak cytokine responses/levels are expected. Linearity of results was observed when dilutions of a single specimen were blindly tested, with the exception of IL-2 and IL-10, where deviations from linearity were sometimes observed. For IL-2 and IFN-gamma, where results from simplex assays were available for comparison, the LINCOplex assay and the simplex assay results agreed well. Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.86 and 0.93 for IL-2 and IFN-gamma, respectively. Exact agreement and weighted kappa values were 68.5% and 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.79), respectively, for IL-2 and 67.3% and 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.80), respectively, for IFN-gamma. These results indicate the applicability of the LINCOplex assay for the simultaneous measurement of multiple cytokines using small amounts of biological material.",

        "abstract": "Enhanced T helper 1 (Th1)-type immunity was observed in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during investigations on the efficiency of interferon (IFN) therapy. The mechanism for the shift to Th1-type immunity is, however, obscure in HCV infection. In this study, we examined the in vitro effect of IFN-\u03b1 subtypes (IFN-\u03b11, -\u03b12, -\u03b15, -\u03b18 and -\u03b110) on the Th1/Th2 balance in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy control volunteers and HCV-infected patients. A two-day incubation without IFN stimulation did raise the Th1-type cell percentage but not the Th2-type cell percentage in the PBMC of the control group. The Th1-type cell percentage and Th1/Th2 ratio were significantly larger in the PBMC of patients when compared to controls both before and after treatment with the IFNs. IFN-\u03b15 treatment induced an increase of the Th2-type cell percentage in both control and patient PBMC but did not show any significant changes in the Th1/Th2 ratio. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b18 treatment slightly promoted an increase in the Th1/Th2 ratio only in patient PBMC. Statistical analysis revealed that effects of the IFN-\u03b1 subtypes on the Th1/Th2 balance differed between two patient groups with severe liver damage (alanine aminotransferase; ALT: \u2265 80 IU/ml) and mild liver damage (ALT: \u2329 80 IU/ml). IFN-\u03b15 treatment lowered the Th1/Th2 ratio in patients with mild liver damage, whereas IFN- \u03b1 8 treatment raised the Th1/Th2 ratio in patients with severe liver damage without IFN-\u03b15-induced decrease in the ratio.

        "abstract": "While interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) subtypes share a common specific receptor composed of two subunits, interferon-alpha receptor (IFNAR)-1 and IFNAR-2, their subtype activities are exhibited via several intracellular signaling pathways and thus subsequently show different biological effects. Anti-proliferative effects of single treatment with IFN-alpha subtypes or 5-fluorouracil (FU), and of combined treatment with each IFN-alpha subtype and 5-FU were examined on three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, HepG2, HLE and PLC/PRF/5. HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were susceptible to the combination treatment, but HLE cells were not. Proliferation of PLC/PRF/5 cells was also inhibited by the IFN-alpha subtypes singly. In addition, apoptosis was observed in HepG2 cells upon treatment with 5-FU alone and with the combination treatment, and in PLC/PRF/5 cells after single treatment with the IFN-alpha subtypes and after the combination treatment. IFN-alpha subtypes induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5. Analyses by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation revealed increased p53 phosphorylation in HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells but not in HLE cells after combined treatment. Single treatment with IFN-alpha subtypes promoted p53 activation only in PLC/PRF/5 cells. These results propose that IFN-alpha subtypes induce cells to undergo apoptosis through p53 activation directly and indirectly, in collaboration with 5-FU, further suggesting the presence of distinct signal pathways for IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) usually results into chronic hepatitis that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Type 1 interferons (IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2) constitute the primary cellular defense against viral infection including HCV. IFN binding to their receptors activates associated Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases, which ultimately leads to phosphorylation and assembly of a signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT)1\u2010STAT2\u2010interferon regulatory factor (IRF)9 trimetric complex called interferon\u2010stimulated gene factor 3 that translocates into the nucleus and binds to the interferon\u2010 stimulated response elements (ISRE), leading to transcriptional induction of several antiviral genes, including double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010activated protein kinase (PKR), 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA). Understanding the mechanisms of how the virus evades this cellular innate defense and establishes a chronic infection is the key for the development of better therapeutics against HCV infection. Here, we demonstrate that p53 could have a crucial role in the cellular innate defense against HCV. We observed significantly higher levels of HCV RNA replication and viral protein expression in the Huh7 cells when their p53 expressions were knocked down. Moreover, IFN treatment was less effective in inhibiting the HCV RNA replication in the p53\u2013knocked\u2010down (p53kd) Huh7 cells. In fact, the activation of the ISRE and the induction of ISGs were significantly attenuated in the p53kd Huh7 cells and p53 was found to directly interact with IRF9. Conclusion: These observations underscore the potential contributions of the tumor suppressor p53 in cellular antiviral immunity against HCV with possible therapeutic implications.

        "abstract": "Tumor suppressor p53 is activated by several stimuli, including DNA damage and oncogenic stress. Previous studies (Takaoka, A., S. Hayakawa, H. Yanai, D. Stoiber, H. Negishi, H. Kikuchi, S. Sasaki, K. Imai, T. Shibue, K. Honda, and T. Taniguchi. 2003. Nature. 424:516\u2013523) have shown that p53 is also induced in response to viral infections as a downstream transcriptional target of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Moreover, many viruses, including SV40, human papillomavirus, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus, adenoviruses, and even RNA viruses such as polioviruses, have evolved mechanisms designated to abrogate p53 responses. We describe a novel p53 function in the activation of the IFN pathway. We observed that infected mouse and human cells with functional p53 exhibited markedly decreased viral replication early after infection. This early inhibition of viral replication was mediated both in vitro and in vivo by a p53-dependent enhancement of IFN signaling, specifically the induction of genes containing IFN-stimulated response elements. Of note, p53 also contributed to an increase in IFN release from infected cells. We established that this p53-dependent enhancement of IFN signaling is dependent to a great extent on the ability of p53 to activate the transcription of IFN regulatory factor 9, a central component of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex. Our results demonstrate that p53 contributes to innate immunity by enhancing IFN-dependent antiviral activity independent of its functions as a proapoptotic and tumor suppressor gene.",

        "abstract": "Type I IFN-induced expression of dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) during viral infection is a well-established antiviral mechanism. However, little is known about the expression of PKR in the context of p53 and about PKR involvement in p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here, we report that PKR is a p53 target gene and plays an important role in the tumor-suppressor function of p53. Activation of p53 by genotoxic stress induces a significant level of PKR expression by acting on the newly identified cis-acting element (ISRE), which is separated from the IFN-stimulated responsive element on the PKR promoter, resulting in translational inhibition and cell apoptosis. The genotoxin-mediated inhibition of translation is associated with the p53/PKR/elF2a (eukaryotic initiation factor-2\u03b1) pathway. To some extent, p53 activation induced by DNA damage facilitates cell apoptosis by activating PKR. PKR-knockdown human colon cancer cells grew rapidly in nude mice and proved resistant to anti-cancer drugs. These data indicate that p53-mediated tumor suppression can be attributed at least in part to the biological functions of PKR induced by p53 in genotoxic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Tumour cells generally become more susceptible to virus infection than normal cells due, in part, to a deficient interferon (IFN)induced antiviral pathway. One of the key IFN-induced enzymes with potent antiviral action is the ds-RNA dependent protein kinase PKR, that once activated blocks protein synthesis, triggers apoptosis and prevents cell growth. Among viruses, vaccinia virus (VACV) lacking selected viral genes or armed with cytokines or tumour specific antigens has been used in preclinical and clinical studies as a therapeutic agent against different tumours. Here we showed in a mouse model of aggressive cancer by subcutaneous inoculation with prostate TRAMP-C1 cells, that a VACV recombinant expressing low levels of human PKR (VV-PKR) and lacking thymidine kinase (TK), is capable of reducing tumour burden when administered by a systemic route in immunocompetent C57/BL6 mice. In addition, expression of PKR was found to attenuate the virus, thus ensuring safety. A catalitically inactive enzyme PKR with a point mutation (K296R) induced similar oncolytic activity as the control virus lacking TK. These find",
