        "title": "Randomised controlled trial of azathioprine withdrawal in ulcerative colitis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether azathioprine can prevent relapse in ulcerative colitis. DESIGN--One year placebo controlled double blind trial of withdrawal or continuation of azathioprine. SETTING--Outpatient clinics of five hospitals. SUBJECTS--79 patients with ulcerative colitis who had been taking azathioprine for six months or more. Patients in full remission for two months or more (67), and patients with chronic low grade or corticosteroid dependent disease (12) were randomised separately. 33 patients in remission received azathioprine and 34 placebo; five patients with chronic stable disease received azathioprine and seven placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of relapse. Relapse was defined as worsening of symptoms or sigmoidoscopic appearance. RESULTS--For the remission group the one year rate of relapse was 36% (12/33) for patients continuing azathioprine and 59% (20/34) for those taking placebo (hazard rate ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.0). For the subgroup of 54 patients in long term remission (greater than six months before entry to trial) benefit was still evident, with a 31% (8/26) rate of relapse with azathioprine and 61% (17/28) with placebo (p less than 0.01). For the small group of patients with chronic stable colitis (six were corticosteroid dependent and six had low grade symptoms) no benefit was found from continued azathioprine therapy. Adverse events were minimal. CONCLUSIONS--Azathioprine maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis is beneficial for at least two years if patients have achieved remission while taking the drug. Demonstration of the relapse preventing properties of azathioprine has implications for a large number of patients with troublesome ulcerative colitis, who may benefit from treatment with azathioprine.",

        "title": "Safety of Drug Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Pregnant and Nursing Women",
        "abstract": "&NA; Drug therapy is justified in pregnant patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. Selection of medical treatment depends on disease severity and the potential for fetal toxicity. Preferably, pregnancy should be planned to coincide with periods of disease quiescence, so that drug requirements can be minimized. Sulphasalazine and prednisolone are clearly safe in pregnancy and lactation. Preliminary studies suggest that lowto\u2010moderate\u2010dose mesalazine is well tolerated in pregnant and nursing mothers. Immunosuppressive therapy during pregnancy in transplant and nontransplant recipients may be associated with an increased risk of fetal growth retardation and prematurity. The risk of congenital malformations from azathioprine and cyclosporin is not markedly increased, although exposure to methotrexate during the first trimester may cause fetal loss and characteristic anomalies. Short\u2010term therapy with metronidazole in the first trimester is not associated with an increased risk of teratogenicity, although the safety of this drug in pregnancy as primary therapy for Crohn's disease using higher doses for prolonged periods has not been confirmed.",

This article provides a review of such studies, particularly in relation to Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, dental disease and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as references to possible mechanisms. The association between coronary heart disease and H. pylori or between heart disease and dental disease may be accounted for by residual confounding. Although markers of C. pneumoniae infection are around twenty times more common in atherosclerotic plaques than in disease-free blood vessels, the sequence of infection and disease is uncertain. For CMV, a limited number of patients with classic atherosclerotic coronary heart disease have been investigated in seroepidemiological studies. For all such agents, better and larger seroepidemiological and pathology-based studies are needed to resolve these uncertainties, as well as - at some stage - large-scale, randomised intervention studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe approval of azathioprine (AZA) for the long-term therapy of patients with Crohn's disease in The Netherlands.\n\n\nMETHODS\nReview and update of the literature on clinical efficacy and safety of AZA in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAZA and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the onset of the clinical response is delayed, requiring combination with other active medication in the early phase of treatment. Maintenance therapy with AZA/6-MP is also effective in the prevention of relapses in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Indications for AZA/6-MP therapy further include refractory, fistulizing and steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. It is not known whether or when AZA/6-MP can be withdrawn in patients in long-term remission, but most clinicians discontinue therapy after 3-5 years. Although fewer data are available, AZA/6-PM appears to be effective also in the therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis. Side effects of AZA/6-MP occur in about 15% of patients and include skin rash, pancreatitis and hepatitis, dose-related neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and risk of increased occurrence and severity of infections. Recent data suggest that the risk of malignancy, other than colorectal cancer, is not increased. Safety in pregnancy has not been studied extensively, but no increased prevalence of birth defects has been reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAZA/6-MP therapy is efficacious in patients with active Crohn's disease, but the drug is especially valuable in the long-term treatment of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Drug-related side effects are frequent and require discontinuation or dose-reduction of the AZA/6-MP therapy. Due to an increased risk of infections secondary to myelosuppression, careful follow-up is mandatory. Insufficient data are available on safety in pregnancy and on the risk of malignancies, but the limited data available in patients with inflammatory bowel disease appear to be reassuring.",

        "abstract": "Treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflect a continuing shift from empiricism to strategies based on improved understanding of the pathophysiology of disease. In susceptible individuals, IBD appears to be the result of defective regulation of mucosal immune interactions with the enteric microflora. This has prompted research directed at the interface of the traditional disciplines of immunology, microbiology, and epithelial cell biology. Whereas immunodiagnostics have been of limited clinical value in IBD, assessments of mucosal rather than systemic immune function are promising. Therapeutically, there is an increasing trend toward more aggressive and earlier use of immunomodulatory agents, particularly for prevention of relapse, with cytokine manipulation as a bridge therapy to achieve remission in patients with acute severe disease. Although most drug treatments are directed toward altering the host response, the rationale for manipulating the enteric flora appears sound and will be the basis of additional future therapeutic strategies. Notwithstanding the widening range of options for drug therapy in IBD, other outcome modifiers and well-established principles of managing chronic disease are as important as ever.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease presents in various forms. Its increasing incidence indicates that modern lifestyle triggers disease in genetically susceptible individuals. We present a model for inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology and review the new biological therapies available. These biological agents have been developed to antagonise the processes of pathogenic inflammation, such as the reduction in T\u2010lymphocyte apoptosis, increase in T\u2010lymphocyte proliferation and increase in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking into the intestinal mucosa. Inhibitors of various inflammatory cytokines, including some antagonists to tumour necrosis factor, are effective therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. However, this class is associated with the risk of rare, but serious, side\u2010effects, such as opportunistic infections and demyelinating diseases. The administration of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin\u201010 and interleukin\u201011, may theoretically be effective in reducing inflammation, although the clinical development of some of these therapies has been terminated. The selective inhibition of the adhesion molecules involved in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking can be effective in reducing gut inflammation. Of the selective adhesion molecule inhibitors under investigation, natalizumab has demonstrated efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease.

        "abstract": "The migration of macrophages and lymphocytes that produce cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) causes -cell death, leading to type 1 diabetes. Similarly, in type 2 diabetes, the adipocyte-derived cytokines including TNF- are elevated in the circulation, causing inflammation and insulin resistance. Thus, the studies described in this article using TNFare relevant to furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. We used RINr1046-38 (RIN) insulin-producing -cells, which constitutively express calbindin-D28k, to characterize the effect of TNF- on apoptosis, replication, insulin release, and gene and protein expression. Western blots of TNF--treated RIN cells revealed a decrease in calbindinD28k. By ELISA, TNF--treated -cells had 47% less calbindin-D28k than controls. In association with the decline in calbindin-D28k, TNF- treatment of RIN cells led to a 73% greater increase in changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 ]i) in TNF--treated cells as compared to that in control RIN cells upon treatment with 50 mM KCl; caused a greater increase in the [Ca 2 ]i following the addition of 5.5 M ionomycin; increased by more than threefold the apoptotic rate, expressed as the percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei to total nuclei; decreased the rate of cell replication by 36%; and increased and decreased selectively the expression of specific genes as determined by microarray analysis. The subcellular localizations of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, and Bax, a proapoptotic protein, within RIN cells were altered with TNF- treatment such that the two were colocalized with mitochondria in the perinuclear region. We conclude that the proapoptotic action of TNF- on -cells is manifested via decreased expression of calbindin-D28k and is mediated at least in part by [Ca 2 ]i.",

        "abstract": "Background: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with disturbances in vascular physiology, including permeability and angiogenesis, that are in part regulated by the endothelial intercellular junctions. These junctions are composed of several adhesion molecules including the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (PECAM\u20101, CD31) and the more recently described CD146 (S\u2010Endo1 Ag, MUC18). Aim: To study the expression of tissue and soluble form of CD146 in patients with CD or UC in relation to disease activity and location. This study was made in comparison with the soluble form of CD31 (sCD31). Results: In active disease, a high expression of CD146 was observed on endothelial cells in intestinal biopsies from both CD and UC. In addition, we observed a decrease of sCD146 in relation to active disease and extensive location of CD and UC. Lower levels of sCD31 were also detected in active and extensive location of UC, but no difference could be observed in CD. Conclusion: sCD146 is a novel marker of the endothelial intercellular junction that reflects endothelial remodeling more effectively than soluble CD31. Further studies are warranted to determine whether sCD146 will provide a serological assay reflecting alterations in vascular permeability and vessel proliferation in the inflamed IBD intestine.",

        "abstract": "Transendothelial migration of circulating leukocytes into the colonic wall is a key step in the development of the inflammatory infiltrate in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 PECAM-1 (CD31) is expressed in the tight junction area of endothelial cells, where it is supposed to support the transmigration process. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PECAM-1 in experimental IBD and to show whether blockade of PECAM-1 has therapeutic effects. Chronic colitis was induced in female BALB/c mice by cyclic oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) 3% (wt/vol). Expression of PECAM-1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. In the treatment group animals received 1 mg/kg anti-PECAM-1 (2H8) ip daily starting on day 26. On day 30 leukocyte adhesion and migration was measured during N(2)O-isoflurane anesthesia in the distal colon by intravital microscopy. Disease activity index (DAI), histology, and MPO levels were compared with healthy and diseased controls. PECAM-1 was expressed in colitic mice. Chronic DSS colitis was characterized by a marked increase in rolling, adherent, and transmigrated leukocytes compared with healthy controls. Immunoblockade of PECAM-1 reduced leukocyte transmigration significantly and also diminished leukocyte rolling and sticking in an indirect manner. It also resulted in a significantly diminished DAI and MPO levels, as well as an amelioration of the histological inflammation score. PECAM-1 plays an important role in transendothelial leukocyte migration in DSS colitis. PECAM-1 could be a novel target for antibody-based treatment in IBD.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Evidence suggests haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can migrate to injured liver and influence tissue repair. However, mechanisms governing HSC recruitment to injured hepatic microcirculation are poorly understood. These were investigated in vivo following hepatic ischaemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) injury and in vitro using flow-based adhesion assays. Design: Partial IR was induced in anaesthetised WT or PECAM-1\u2212/\u2212 mice for 90 min. Recruitment of systemically administered HSCs was monitored and effects of function blocking antibodies against \u03b14\u03b21 integrin, CD18, CD44, PECAM-1 or VCAM-1 investigated. The kinetics and molecular events governing adhesion to murine cardiac endothelial cells in vitro were also determined. Effects of conditioned media from IR injured liver on HSC adhesion molecule expression was determined by FACS. Results: Administered HSCs homed predominantly to lungs rather than liver, highlighting a potential therapeutic hurdle. Hepatic HSC recruitment following IR injury was inhibited by anti-\u03b14\u03b21 and anti-VCAM-1 antibodies. A role for \u03b14\u03b21 was also confirmed using flow-based adhesion assays. Incubating HSCs with conditioned media from IR injured liver increased \u03b14\u03b21 expression. CD18, CD44 and PECAM-1 were not involved in recruitment. Conclusions: This novel study demonstrates that the \u03b14\u03b21/VCAM-1 pathway mediates HSC recruitment to injured liver. Manipulating this pathway may enhance delivery of HSCs to the liver.",

Efficient delivery of cells to target organs is critical to improving their effectiveness. This requires an understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular engraftment into the liver. Binding of hMSCs to normal/injured liver tissue, purified extracellular matrices, and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) were quantified in static and flow conditions. To define the mechanisms underpinning hMSC interactions, neutralizing adhesion molecule antibodies were used. Fluorescently labelled hMSCs were infused intraportally into CCl4\u2013injured mice with and without neutralizing antibodies. hMSCs expressed high levels of CD29/\u03b21\u2010integrin and CD44. Using liver tissue binding assays, hMSC adhesion was greatest in diseased human liver versus normal liver (32.2 cells/field versus 20.5 cells/field [P = 0.048]). Neutralizing antibodies against CD29 and CD44 reduced hMSC binding to diseased liver by 34% and 35%, respectively (P = 0.05). hMSCs rolled at 528 \u03bcm/second on HSECs in flow assays. This rolling was abolished by CD29 blockade on hMSCs and vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (VCAM\u20101) blockade on HSECs. Firm adhesion to HSECs was reduced by CD29 (55% [P = 0.002]) and CD44 (51% [P = 0.04]) blockade. Neutralizing antibodies to CD29 and CD44 reduced hepatic engraftment of hMSCs in murine liver from 4.45 cells/field to 2.88 cells/field (P = 0.025) and 2.35 cells/field (P = 0.03), respectively. hMSCs expressed modest levels of chemokine receptors including CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3, but these made little contribution to hMSC adhesion in this setting. Conclusion: hMSCs bind preferentially to injured liver. Rolling of hMSCs is regulated by CD29/VCAM\u20101, whereas CD29/CD44 interactions with VCAM\u20101, fibronectin, and hyaluronan on HSECs determine firm adhesion both in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated using a murine model of liver injury.

However, the treatment uptake has been generally low due to numerous side effects and contraindications to IFN\u03b1-based regimens. Because of these limitations, the overall HCV-related health burden could only gradually be decreased, even though treatment efficacy was increased over recent years.1 ,2\n\nThe lack of cell culture systems to grow HCV had been a key limitation for the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Nevertheless, in 1997, only a few years after the discovery of HCV, the first subgenomic HCV replicons were obtained allowing researchers to develop and assay DAAs with a robust methodology.3\u20135 In 2004, the safety and efficacy of the first DAA, the protease inhibitor BILN2061, were assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial.6 Now, a few years later, IFN\u03b1-containing or IFN\u03b1-free regimens based on DAAs showed the potential to cure HCV infection in very high percentages with overall good tolerability.7\n\nDAAs targeting two major steps of the HCV life cycle have reached clinical development: (1) inhibitors of the NS3-4A protease, which block HCV polyprotein processing and (2) inhibitors of viral replication, including several drug families, such as nucleoside/nucleotide and non-nucleoside inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and inhibitors of the NS5A viral protein which have a regulatory role in HCV replication.8\u201312\n\nA perspective of the future treatment landscape for chronic HCV infection is depicted in figure 1.

The European Union has pursued a similar goal. Despite these efforts, there is limited published information that describes cell therapy product administration across both cell types and indications.

In order to achieve relevant cell numbers of human MSC for clinical applications, it is crucial to develop scalable culture systems that allow bioprocess control and monitoring, combined with the use of serum/xenogeneic (xeno)-free culture media. In the present study, we firstly established a spinner flask culture system combining gelatin-based Cultispher(\u00ae) S microcarriers and xeno-free culture medium for the expansion of umbilical cord matrix (UCM)-derived MSC. This system enabled the production of 2.4 (\u00b11.1) x10(5) cells/mL (n = 4) after 5 days of culture, corresponding to a 5.3 (\u00b11.6)-fold increase in cell number. The established protocol was then implemented in a stirred-tank bioreactor (800 mL working volume) (n = 3) yielding 115 million cells after 4 days. Upon expansion under stirred conditions, cells retained their differentiation ability and immunomodulatory potential. The development of a scalable microcarrier-based stirred culture system, using xeno-free culture medium that suits the intrinsic features of UCM-derived MSC represents an important step towards a GMP compliant large-scale production platform for these promising cell therapy candidates.",

        "title": "The Challenge of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Expansion: Current and Prospective Answers",
        "abstract": "In the field of cell therapy, allogenic human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are often used in clinical trials, creating a demand for cell mass production using efficient dynamic bioreactor systems. As an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP), such cells should meet certain special requirements, including product specifications requiring a production process compatible with good manufacturing practice (GMP). The development of processes in which the cells are the product therefore remains a significant challenge. This chapter describes the requirements at different steps in the upstream and downstream phases of such dynamic processes. Potential solutions are presented and future prospects are discussed, including the selection of media and carriers for the strictly adherent growing cells, allowing efficient cell adhesion and detachment. Strategies for dynamic cultivation in bioreactors are described in detail for fixed\u2010bed and stirred\u2010tank reactors based on GMP requirements and the integration of process analytical technology (PAT). Following cell harvest, separation and purification, the formulation and storage of the product are also described. Finally, the chapter covers important cell quality characteristics necessary for the approval of ATMPs.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been the focus of intense research by academia and industry due to their unique features. MSC can be easily isolated and expanded through in vitro culture by taking full advantage of their self-renewing capacity. In addition, MSC exert immunomodulatory effects and can be differentiated into various lineages, which makes them highly attractive for clinical applications in cell-based therapies. In this review, we attempt to provide a brief historical overview of MSC discovery, characterization, and the first clinical studies conducted. The current MSC manufacturing platforms are reviewed with special attention regarding the use of bioreactors for the production of GMP-compliant clinically relevant cell numbers. The first commercial MSC-based products are also addressed, as well as the remaining challenges to the widespread use of MSC-derived products.",

        "abstract": "Optimizing bioprocesses requires an in-depth understanding, from a bioengineering perspective, of the cultivation systems used. A bioengineering characterization is typically performed via experimental or numerical methods, which are particularly well-established for stirred bioreactors. For unstirred, non-rigid systems such as wave-mixed bioreactors, numerical methods prove to be problematic, as often only simplified geometries and motions can be assumed. In this work, a general approach for the numerical characterization of non-stirred cultivation systems is demonstrated using the CELL-tainer bioreactor with two degree of freedom motion as an example. In a first step, the motion is recorded via motion capturing, and a 3D model of the culture bag geometry is generated via 3D-scanning. Subsequently, the bioreactor is characterized with respect to mixing time, and oxygen transfer rate, as well as specific power input and temporal Kolmogorov length scale distribution. The results demonstrate that the CELL-tainer with two degrees of freedom outperforms classic wave-mixed bioreactors in terms of oxygen transport. In addition, it was shown that in the cell culture version of the CELL-tainer, the critical Kolmogorov length is not surpassed in any simulation.",

        "title": "Automated Shape and Process Parameter Optimization for Scaling Up Geometrically Non-Similar Bioreactors",
        "abstract": "Scaling bioprocesses remains a major challenge. Since it is physically impossible to increase all process parameters equally, a suitable scale-up strategy must be selected for a successful bioprocess. One of the most widely used criteria when scaling up bioprocesses is the specific power input. However, this represents only an average value. This study aims to determine the Kolmogorov length scale distribution by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and to use it as an alternative scale-up criterion for geometrically non-similar bioreactors for the first time. In order to obtain a comparable Kolmogorov length scale distribution, an automated geometry and process parameter optimization was carried out using the open-source tools OpenFOAM and DAKOTA. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test statistic was used for optimization. A HEK293-F cell expansion (batch mode) from benchtop (Infors Minifors 2 with 4 L working volume) to pilot scale (D-DCU from Sartorius with 30 L working volume) was carried out. As a reference cultivation, the classical scale-up approach with constant specific power input (233 W m\u22123) was used, where a maximum viable cell density (VCDmax) of 5.02\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121 was achieved (VCDmax at laboratory scale 5.77\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121). Through the automated optimization of the stirrer geometry (three parameters), position and speed, comparable cultivation results were achieved as in the small scale with a maximum VCD of 5.60\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121. In addition, even on the pilot scale, cell aggregate size distribution was seen to strictly follow a geometric distribution and can be predicted with the help of CFD with the previously published correlation.",
