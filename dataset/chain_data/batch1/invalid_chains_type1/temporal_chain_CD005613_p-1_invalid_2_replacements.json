        "title": "Glimepiride Combined with Morning Insulin Glargine, Bedtime Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Insulin, or Bedtime Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Context Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin preparation that has recently become available. Its optimal role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is being defined. Contribution In this randomized, controlled trial of patients who were taking the sulfonylurea glimepiride, those receiving morning glargine had greater improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels and less frequent nocturnal hypoglycemia than did patients receiving either bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or bedtime glargine. Implications Morning glargine may be a better option for optimizing glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are also taking sulfonylureas than is either bedtime glargine or bedtime NPH. The Editors Type 2 diabetes is an increasing health problem in all western societies (1); the development of macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality rates (1, 2). It has also been demonstrated that achieving good glycemic control substantially contributes to the prevention of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (3). In addition, epidemiologic association analysis of the data suggests that macrovascular complications can also be prevented (4). However, current therapeutic approaches have not attained the defined targets of good metabolic control in most patients with type 2 diabetes (5). During the natural course of type 2 diabetes, -cell function is progressively lost (6), which limits the period when lifestyle modification, diet, and oral antidiabetic drug therapy are sufficient to meet targets of glycemic control. Thus, the therapeutic regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes have to be continually adapted to allow patients to consistently achieve and maintain good glycemic control. Patients with type 2 diabetes benefit from the addition of insulin to their therapeutic regimen (7-9). However, some patients express reservations regarding the administration and side effects of insulin therapy (10); therefore, effective and convenient regimens must be developed. Combination therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs and bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin has proven to be as effective as other, more complex insulin regimens and is associated with less weight gain (11, 12). Combination therapy with insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs is a regimen that can be managed at outpatient visits and that can be conveniently adapted to the patient's needs by adjusting the insulin dose on the basis of self-measured fasting blood glucose levels (13)a therapeutic target predictive of overall glycemic control (13). There are, however, limitations to achieving optimal results in daily practice with a combination of oral antidiabetic drugs and NPH insulin. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin exhibits a peak in its timeaction profile 4 to 6 hours after injection; thus, bedtime NPH insulin is associated with a risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia (14). This risk may limit the feasibility of titrating the NPH insulin dose to reach adequately low fasting blood glucose target values. Furthermore, the activity profile of NPH insulin is too short to provide optimal 24-hour insulin supplementation. Insulin glargine (Lantus, Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) is a recently introduced human insulin analogue that exhibits a 24-hour action profile with no pronounced peak (15-17). One study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with basal and bolus insulin (18) and one study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving oral antidiabetic drugs (14) have suggested that the addition of insulin glargine, injected at bedtime, decreases the risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin. Thus, insulin glargine is an improved basal component for combination regimens with oral antidiabetic drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It remains unclear whether insulin glargine provides both better metabolic control and decreases the risk for hypoglycemia than compared with NPH insulin when used with sulfonylureas, such as glimepiride. The best timing for insulin glargine administration is also unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy of sulfonylurea (3 mg of glimepiride) with either morning insulin glargine, bedtime insulin glargine, or bedtime NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes whose diabetes was poorly controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs alone. Methods Study Design Our study was a 28-week, open-label, randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes who did not achieve good metabolic control while receiving oral antidiabetic drugs had their oral agents replaced by 3 mg of glimepiride for 4 weeks and were then randomly assigned to receive additional treatment for 24 weeks with insulin glargine in the morning or at bedtime or NPH insulin at bedtime. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of the different treatment regimens on glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) and on the percentage of patients who experienced hypoglycemia. Secondary objectives were to compare the three different interventions in terms of response rates, blood glucose levels, insulin dose, and body weight, as well as adjustment of insulin dose by the investigator. A total of 111 centers in 13 European countries participated in this study. The institutional ethics committee of each participating center approved the trial, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study. Patients We recruited patients from January 2000 to October 2000; treatment took place between February 2000 and June 2001. Criteria for study inclusion were as follows: 1) type 2 diabetes, 2) age younger than 75 years, 3) body mass index less than 35 kg/m2, and 4) previous oral therapy with any sulfonylurea as monotherapy or in combination with metformin or acarbose. Furthermore, the fasting blood glucose level had to be 6.7 mmol/L or greater [ 120 mg/dL], and the HbA1c level had to be between 7.5% and 10.5%. Main exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) pregnancy or breast-feeding, 2) pretreatment with insulin or any investigational drugs within the previous 3 months, or 3) presence of any clinically relevant somatic or mental diseases. Screening Phase The study consisted of a 4-week screening phase and a 24-week treatment phase. Before the start of the study, patients gave informed consent, medical histories were recorded, physical examinations were performed, and inclusion as well as exclusion criteria were satisfied. Blood samples were taken for determination of HbA1c levels, complete hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses, and lipid status. Patients were trained to use the OptiPen Pro (Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) insulin injection device and the One Touch II (LifeScan, Milpitas, California) blood glucose meter. Patients discontinued use of their previous oral antidiabetic drug treatment and received 3 mg of glimepiride in the morning. Patients provided a complete 8-point, 24-hour blood glucose profile on the 2 consecutive days of the screening phase. Randomization A sequence of screening patient numbers was assigned to each study center. All patients who had entered the screening phase received a patient number. With a randomization schedule generated by the sponsor, eligible patients were linked sequentially to treatment codes allocated at random. This schedule was stratified by center on a 1:1:1 basis. Intervention During the treatment phase, patients visited the investigation sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after randomization. At these visits, patients had to provide daily self-measured fasting blood glucose values, and episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded in a standardized diary. The investigators checked these values, and the insulin dose was adjusted according to a predefined titration regimen. Furthermore, vital signs (including blood pressure and body weight) were recorded at every visit. At baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after randomization, blood was drawn for measurement of complete hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses. At baseline and 8, 12, and 24 weeks, blood was drawn for measurement of HbA1c levels, and patients had to provide an 8-point daily blood glucose profile on 2 consecutive days. When combination therapy was initiated, insulin glargine or NPH insulin was injected subcutaneously once daily. The insulin glargine and NPH insulin formulation consisted of a cartridge containing 3 mL of either insulin preparation. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin had to be mixed thoroughly by rotating the injection device. The insulin dose for the first day of the treatment phase was calculated according to the formula of Holman and Turner (19) by subtracting 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) from the actual fasting blood glucose value and dividing the result by 0.56 mmol/L (10 mg/dL). During the treatment phase, the insulin dose was titrated every visit by using a predefined regimen: If the fasting blood glucose level was greater than 5.6, 6.7, 7.8, or 8.9 mmol/L (>100, 120, 140, 160 mg/dL) for at least 1 of 2 consecutive days before the visit with no hypoglycemia, the insulin dose was increased by 2, 4, 6, or 8 units, respectively. Doses of glimepiride remained unchanged throughout the study. Analytical Methods Hemoglobin A1c levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Diamat, Munich, Germany) in the central laboratory (INTERLAB, Munich, Germany); the reference range was 4.4% to 6.1%. Hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses were measured in local laboratories according to standard laboratory procedures. Statistical Analysis The primary efficacy assessment was the change in HbA1c level from baseline to end point and the frequency of patients who experienced hypoglycemic episodes during the study. Secondary efficacy measurements were HbA1c level ( 7.5%), fasting blood g",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInsulin glargine (LANTUS) is a once-daily basal insulin analog with a smooth 24-h time-action profile that provides effective glycemic control with reduced hypoglycemia risk (particularly nocturnal) compared with NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. A recent \"treat-to-target\" study has shown that more patients on insulin glargine reached HbA(1c) levels < or =7.0% without confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin. We further assessed the risk for hypoglycemia in a meta-analysis of controlled trials of a similar design for insulin glargine versus once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nAll studies were 24-28 weeks long, except one 52-week study, for which interim 20-week data were used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatient demographics were similar between the insulin glargine (n = 1,142) and NPH insulin (n = 1,162) groups. The proportion of patients achieving target HbA(1c) (< or =7.0%) was similar between insulin glargine-and NPH insulin-treated patients (30.8 and 32.1%, respectively). There was a consistent significant reduction of hypoglycemia risk associated with insulin glargine, compared with NPH insulin, in terms of overall symptomatic (11%; P = 0.0006) and nocturnal (26%; P < 0.0001) hypoglycemia. Most notably, the risk of severe hypoglycemia and severe nocturnal hypoglycemia were reduced with insulin glargine by 46% (P = 0.0442) and 59% (P = 0.0231), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results confirmed that insulin glargine given once daily reduces the risk of hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin, which can facilitate more aggressive insulin treatment to a HbA(1c) target of < or =7.0% in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with exenatide or insulin glargine, added to oral therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with combination oral agents in the UK setting. Methods: A published and validated computer simulation model of diabetes was used to project long-term complications, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs. Probabilities of diabetes-related complications were derived from published sources. Treatment effects and patient characteristics were extracted from a recent randomised controlled trial comparing exenatide with insulin glargine. Simulations incorporated published quality of life utilities and UK-specific costs from 2004. Pharmacy costs for exenatide were based on 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the US value (as no price for the UK was available at the time of analysis). Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base\u2013case analysis exenatide was associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.057 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.442 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus insulin glargine. Long-term projections demonstrated that exenatide was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of most cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications and CVD-related death than insulin glargine. Using the range of cost values, evaluation results showed that exenatide is likely to fall in a range between dominant (cost and life saving) at 20% of the US price and cost-effective (with an ICER of \u00a322\u2009420 per QALY gained) at 100% of the US price, versus insulin glargine. Conclusions: Based on the findings of a recent clinical trial, long-term projections indicated that exenatide is likely to be associated with improvement in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy compared to insulin glargine. The results from this modelling analysis suggest that that exenatide is likely to represent good value for money by generally accepted standards in the UK setting in individuals with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral therapy.",

        "title": "Renal and Cardiac Effects of DPP4 Inhibitors \u2013 from Preclinical Development to Clinical Research",
        "abstract": "Inhibitors of type 4 dipeptidyl peptidase (DDP-4) were developed and approved for the oral treatment of type 2 diabetes. Its mode of action is to inhibit the degradation of incretins, such as type 1 glucagon like peptide (GLP-1), and GIP. GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells and suppresses glucagon release from alpha-cells, thereby improving glucose control. Besides its action on the pancreas type 1 glucagon like peptide has direct effects on the heart, vessels and kidney mainly via the type 1 glucagon like peptide receptor (GLP-1R). Moreover, there are substrates of DPP-4 beyond incretins that have proven renal and cardiovascular effects such as BNP/ANP, NPY, PYY or SDF-1 alpha. Preclinical evidence suggests that DPP-4 inhibitors may be effective in acute and chronic renal failure as well as in cardiac diseases like myocardial infarction and heart failure. Interestingly, large cardiovascular meta-analyses of combined Phase II/III clinical trials with DPP-4 inhibitors point all in the same direction: a potential reduction of cardiovascular events in patients treated with these agents. A pooled analysis of pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, registration studies of linagliptin further showed a significant reduction of urinary albumin excretion after 24 weeks of treatment. The observation suggests direct renoprotective effects of DPP-4 inhibition that may go beyond its glucose-lowering potential. Type 4 dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors have been shown to be very well tolerated in general, but for those excreted via the kidney dose adjustments according to renal function are needed to avoid side effects. In conclusion, the direct cardiac and renal effects seen in preclinical studies as well as meta-analysis of clinical trials may offer additional potentials \u2013 beyond improvement of glycemic control - for this newer class of drugs, such as acute kidney failure, chronic kidney failure as well as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Kidney fibrosis is the final common pathway of all progressive chronic kidney diseases, of which diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has emerged as one of the most important origins of matrix-producing fibroblasts. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been introduced into the market as antidiabetes drugs. Here, we found that the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin ameliorated kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice without altering the blood glucose levels associated with the inhibition of EndMT and the restoration of microRNA 29s. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic CD-1 mice exhibited kidney fibrosis and strong immunoreactivity for DPP-4 by 24 weeks after the onset of diabetes. At 20 weeks after the onset of diabetes, mice were treated with linagliptin for 4 weeks. Linagliptin-treated diabetic mice exhibited a suppression of DPP-4 activity/protein expression and an amelioration of kidney fibrosis associated with the inhibition of EndMT. The therapeutic effects of linagliptin on diabetic kidneys were associated with the suppression of profibrotic programs, as assessed by mRNA microarray analysis. We found that the induction of DPP-4 observed in diabetic kidneys may be associated with suppressed levels of microRNA 29s in diabetic mice; linagliptin restored microRNA 29s and suppressed DPP-4 protein levels. Using cultured endothelial cells, we found that linagliptin inhibited TGF-\u03b22\u2013induced EndMT, and such anti-EndMT effects of linagliptin were mediated through microRNA 29 induction. These results indicate the possible novel pleiotropic action of linagliptin to restore normal kidney function in diabetic patients with renal impairment.",

        "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) cleaves a large number of chemokine and peptide hormones involved in the regulation of the immune system. Additionally, DPP-4 may also be involved in macrophage-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance. Thus, the current study investigated the effect of linagliptin, an inhibitor of DPP-4, on macrophage migration and polarization in white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver of high-fat diet\u2013induced obese (DIO) mice. DPP-4+ macrophages in lean and obese mice were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. DPP-4 was predominantly expressed in F4/80+ macrophages in crown-like structures compared with adipocytes in WAT of DIO mice. FACS analysis also revealed that, compared with chow-fed mice, DIO mice exhibited a significant increase in DPP-4+ expression in cells within adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), particularly M1 ATMs. Linagliptin showed a greater DPP-4 inhibition and antioxidative capacity than sitagliptin and reduced M1-polarized macrophage migration while inducing an M2-dominant shift of macrophages within WAT and liver, thereby attenuating obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Loss of macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1, a chemokine and DPP-4 substrate, in DIO mice abrogated M2 macrophage-polarizing and insulin-sensitizing effects of linagliptin. Therefore, the inhibition of DPP-4 by linagliptin reduced obesity-related insulin resistance and inflammation by regulating M1/M2 macrophage status.",

Changes in glycolipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and autophagy in the liver were evaluated. Body weight gain, lipid metabolic disorder, and hepatic steatosis as well as systemic and hepatic insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice were significantly attenuated after sitagliptin treatment. Furthermore, sitagliptin decreased inflammatory responses by regulating macrophage M1/M2 polarization and inhibiting the activities of NF-\u03baB and JNK. Moreover, sitagliptin increased the levels of phosphorylation of AMPK and decreased those of mTOR. This study indicates that sitagliptin significantly ameliorates the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in ob/ob mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and activating autophagy via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.",

For that purpose, the N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced HCC mouse model was used in the present study using a dose of 100 mg/kg/week, i.p., for 8 weeks. NDEA-induced HCC mice received STGPT 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg starting on day 61 up to day 120. The present study revealed that STGPT inhibited HIF-1\u03b1 activation via the interference with the AKT-AMPK\u03b1-mTOR axis and the interruption of IKK\u03b2, P38\u03b1, and ERK1/2 signals as well. Accordingly, STGPT prolonged the survival, restored the histological features and improved liver function. Additionally, STGPT inhibited angiogenesis, as revealed by a significant downregulation in the VEGF and mRNA expression of CD309 with concomitant inhibition of tissue invasion was evident by an increased ratio of TIMP-1/MMP-2. STGPT exhibited apoptotic stimulatory effect as indicated upon calculating the BCL-2/Bax ratio and by the gene expression of p53. The decrease in AFP and liver index calculation, gene expression of Ki-67 confirmed the antiproliferative activity of STGPT. The anti-inflammatory potential was revealed by the decreased TNF-\u03b1 level and the downregulation of MCP-1 gene expression. Moreover, an antifibrotic potential was supported by lower levels of TGF-\u03b2. These effects appear to be GLP1R-independent. The present study provides a potential basis for repurposing STGPT for the inhibition of HCC progression. Since STGPT is unlikely to cause hypoglycemia, it may be promising as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy to treat diabetic or even normoglycemic patients with HCC.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of FOXO3a plays a significant role in the progression of various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FOXO3a inactivation, driven by oncogenic stimuli, can lead to abnormal cell growth, suppression of apoptosis, and resistance to anticancer drugs. Therefore, FOXO3a emerges as a potential molecular target for the development of innovative treatments in the era of oncology. Linagliptin (LNGTN), a DPP\u20104 inhibitor known for its safe profile, has exhibited noteworthy anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010oxidative properties in previous in vivo studies. Several potential molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain these effects. However, the capacity of LNGTN to activate FOXO3a through AMPK activation has not been investigated. In our investigation, we examined the potential repurposing of LNGTN as a hepatoprotective agent against diethylnitrosamine (DENA) intoxication. Additionally, we assessed LNGTN's impact on apoptosis and autophagy. Following a 10\u2010week administration of DENA, the liver underwent damage marked by inflammation and early neoplastic alterations. Our study presents the first experimental evidence demonstrating that LNGTN can reinstate the aberrantly regulated FOXO3a activity by elevating the nuclear fraction of FOXO3a in comparison to the cytosolic fraction, subsequent to AMPK activation. Moreover, noteworthy inactivation of NF\u03baB induced by LNGTN was observed. These effects culminated in the initiation of apoptosis, the activation of autophagy, and the manifestation of anti\u2010inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic outcomes. These effects were concomitant with improved liver function and microstructure. In conclusion, our findings open new avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the AMPK/FOXO3a signaling pathway in the management of chronic liver damage.",
