        "abstract": "Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Barrett\u2019s esophagus were published by the American College of Gastroenterology in 1998 (1). These and other guidelines undergo periodic review. Significant advances have been made in the area of Barrett\u2019s esophagus over the past several years, leading us to review and revise our previous guidelines statements. These advances have included more information on the natural history of high-grade dysplasia and the chronic use of proton pump inhibitors. These and the original guidelines are intended to apply to all physicians who address Barrett\u2019s and are intended to indicate the preferable, but not only acceptable, approach. Physicians must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables that exist at the moment of the decision. These guidelines are intended to apply to adult patients with the diagnosis of Barrett\u2019s esophagus defined in the guidelines. Both these and the original guidelines were developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. The world literature was reviewed extensively for the original guidelines and was once again reviewed using the National Library of Medicine database. All appropriate studies were reviewed, and any additional studies found in the reference list of these papers were obtained and reviewed. Evidence was evaluated along a hierarchy, with randomized controlled trials given the greatest weight. Abstracts presented at national and international meetings were only used when unique data from ongoing trials were presented. When scientific data were lacking, recommendations were based on expert consensus. During preparation, the guidelines were reviewed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American Society for GI Endoscopy. Recommendations and comments obtained from these reviews were incorporated into the final document whenever possible.",

        "title": "Acid Suppression and Chemoprevention in Barrett\u2019s Oesophagus",
        "abstract": "Barrett\u2019s oesophagus is a pre-malignant condition affecting 1% of the population in the West. Even though most patients with Barrett\u2019s will not develop oesophageal cancer, the incidence of adenocarcinoma is 0.45\u20131%, conferring a 40-fold increased risk compared with the general population. The risk rises to 40\u201350% within 5 years for those with high grade dysplasia. Currently, the only strategies available to diminish adenocarcinoma rates are surveillance endoscopy, endoscopic thermal or photodynamic ablation or tissue resection. The latter options are reserved for those who already have dysplasia. 10\u201350% of patients undergoing oesophagectomy for high grade dysplasia have been shown to have adenocarcinoma. Therefore approaches are needed to be that either remove or prevent stimuli propelling patients down the dysplasia-adenocarcinoma pathway. Both gastric acid and bile acids have been reported as potential insults involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett\u2019s oesophagus. This is thought to be mediated by a range of molecules including cyclo-oxygenase-2, c-myc and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Proton pump inhibitors not only suppress acid but also bile reflux, although symptom control is a poor guide as to adequacy of acid suppression. There is some evidence that proton pump inhibitors cause partial regression in Barrett\u2019s oesophagus length, although the data is contradictory. Proton pump inhibitors have also been shown to increase cell differentiation and apoptosis, reduce proliferation and COX-2 levels, with the supposition that this may diminish cancer risk. However this role in decreasing cancer risk has not yet been evaluated. The use of NSAIDS and aspirin, most likely via inhibition of COX-2 and other inflammatory pathways, is associated with a reduction of adenocarcinoma rates. Both PPIs and NSAIDs/Aspirin may therefore be potential chemopreventative agents but further studies are required to appraise their use.",

        "title": "Role of chemoprophylaxis with either NSAIDs or statins in patients with Barrett's esophagus.",
        "abstract": "The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a poor prognosis neoplasia, has risen dramatically in recent decades. Barrett's esophagus represents the best-known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma development. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs through cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and prostaglandin metabolism regulation could control cell proliferation, increase cell apoptosis and regulate the expression of growth and angiogenic factors. Statins can achieve equivalent effects through prenylation and subsequently control of cellular signaling cascades. At present, epidemiological studies are small and underpowered. Their data could not justify either medication as a chemo-preventive agent. Population based studies have shown a 43% reduction of the odds of developing an esophageal adenocarcinoma, leaving out or stating a 25% reduction in patients consuming non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a 50% reduction in those patients consuming aspirin. They have also stated a 19% reduction of esophageal cancer incidence when statins have been used. Observational studies have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could reduce the adenocarcinoma incidence in patients with Barrett's esophagus by 41%, while statins could reduce the risk by 43%. The cancer preventive effect has been enhanced in those patients taking a combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins (a 74% decrease). Observational data are equivocal concerning the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug subclasses. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs clearly have substantial potential for toxicity, while statins are rather safe drugs. In conclusion, both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins are promising chemopreventive agents and deserve further exploration with interventional studies. In the meanwhile, their use is justified only in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "The burden of illness from esophageal adenocarcinoma continues to rise in the Western world, and overall prognosis is poor. Given that Barrett's esophagus (BE), a metaplastic change in the esophageal lining is a known cancer precursor, an opportunity to decrease disease development by screening and surveillance might exist. This review examines recent updates in the pathogenesis of BE and comprehensively discusses known risk factors. Diagnostic definitions and challenges are outlined, coupled with an in-depth review of management. Current challenges and potential solutions related to screening and surveillance are discussed. The effectiveness of currently available endoscopic treatment techniques, particularly with regards to recurrence following successful endotherapy and potential chemopreventative agents are also highlighted. The field of BE is rapidly evolving and improved understanding of pathophysiology, combined with emerging methods for screening and surveillance offer hope for future disease burden reduction.",

        "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leads to the accumulation of bile-induced reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in esophageal tissues, causing inflammation and DNA damage. The progression sequence from healthy esophagus to GERD and eventually cancer is associated with a microbiome shift. Lactobacillus species are commensal organisms known for their probiotic and antioxidant characteristics in the healthy esophagus. This prompted us to investigate how Lactobacilli survive in a bile-rich environment during GERD, and to identify their interaction with the bile-injured esophageal cells. To model human reflux conditions, we exposed three Lactobacillus species (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum) to bile. All species were tolerant to bile possibly enabling them to colonize the esophageal epithelium under GERD conditions. Next, we assessed the antioxidant potential of Lactobacilli and role in bile injury repair: we measured bile-induced DNA damage using the ROS marker 8-oxo guanine and COMET assay. Lactobacillus addition after bile injury accelerated repair of bile-induced DNA damage through recruitment of pH2AX/RAD51 and reduced NF\u03baB-associated inflammation in esophageal cells. This study demonstrated anti-genotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of Lactobacilli, making them of significant interest in the prevention of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with GERD.",

        "abstract": "General Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women, with increasing incidence worldwide. Specific Background: Recent research has focused on the role of epigenetic changes in DNA damage, repair mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic effects of probiotics. Probiotics have shown promise in promoting tissue regeneration and DNA repair. Knowledge Gap: However, the precise impact of probiotics on DNA repair in cancer cells, specifically breast cancer cells, remains underexplored. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on DNA damage repair in AMJ13 Iraqi breast cancer cells and assess the cytotoxic effects of probiotics on these cells. Results: Using the comet assay, we found significant increases in DNA damage repair in AMJ13 cells treated with Lactobacillus plantarum (T1) and a combination of eight probiotic strains (T2). Exposure to T1 for 48 hours resulted in significant increases in tail DNA (P\u22640.001), head DNA (P\u22640.001), and tail moment (P<0.001), while T2 showed similar significant increases at 72 hours (P<0.05). Image analysis further supported the DNA repair potential of probiotics, as indicated by a small tail curve for treated cells. Novelty: This study provides novel insights into the therapeutic potential of probiotics in breast cancer treatment by demonstrating their capacity to enhance DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. Implications: The findings suggest that probiotic therapy may be a promising adjunct treatment in breast cancer, offering a new avenue for cancer management through the enhancement of DNA repair and reduction of DNA damage. \nHighlights: \n\u00a0 \n \nProbiotics significantly repaired DNA damage in breast cancer cells. \nT1 and T2 enhanced DNA repair within 48-72 hours. \nProbiotics offer potential as breast cancer adjunct therapy. \n \n\u00a0 \nKeywords: Breast cancer, probiotics, DNA repair, AMJ13 cells, cytotoxicity",
