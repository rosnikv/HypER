        "title": "Evaluation of a Pharmaceutical Care Model on Diabetes Management",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care model on the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in urban African-American patients. DESIGN: Eligible patients were randomized to either a pharmacist intervention or control group and followed over a 4-month period. Patients in the intervention group received diabetes education, medication counseling, instructions on dietary regulation, exercise, and home blood glucose monitoring, and evaluation and adjustment of their hypoglycemic regimen. Patients in the control group continued to receive standard medical care provided by their physicians. SETTING: A university-affiliated internal medicine outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: The study population consisted of urban African-American patients with NIDDM currently attending the clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations. Secondary outcome endpoints included blood pressure, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, microalbumin to creatinine ratio, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein concentrations. Quality-of-life assessments were performed in both groups at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (17 intervention, 22 control) completed the study. The intervention group consisted of 12 women and 5 men with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 59 \u00b1 12 years, total body weight (TBW) of 93 \u00b1 22 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 34 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, and duration of NIDDM 6.8 \u00b1 6.5 years. The control group consisted of 15 women and 7 men with a mean age of 65 \u00b1 12 years, TBW of 88 \u00b1 19 kg, BMI of 33 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, and a duration of NIDDM of 6.2 \u00b1 4.8 y. Significant improvement in glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.015) was achieved in the intervention group. No change in glycemia was observed in the control subjects. Statistically significant differences in the final glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.022) concentrations were noted between groups. No significant changes in blood pressure control, lipid profile, renal function parameters, weight, or quality-of-life measures were noted within or between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care in the reduction of hyperglycemia associated with NIDDM in a group of urban African-American patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe and evaluate published pharmaceutical care research and make recommendations to improve the quality of the literature. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts using the key word \u201cpharmaceutical care,\u201d limited to research articles published January 1988\u2013December 1996. STUDY SELECTION Articles that evaluated the provision of pharmaceutical care in a defined population. DATA EXTRACTION Citations (title and abstract) identified were reviewed. Articles potentially meeting the inclusion criteria were screened and scored according to the Pharmaceutical Care Research Checklist for the presence of criteria including pharmaceutical care process, methodology, and measures/outcomes. RESULTS A total of 979 citations were identified. Of 57 abstracts identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria, 43 articles were eliminated, 2 were rejected, and 12 were accepted for analysis. Deficiencies identified included: a lack of research in community practice (n = 2), randomized controlled trials (n = 3), workload measurement (n = 6), and patient satisfaction (n = 1). Scoring according to the Pharmaceutical Care Research Checklist also identified the following deficiencies (maximum Composite Criterion Score [CCS] of 24): description of population sample (CCS 17), dropouts (CCS 13), informed consent (CCS 8), pharmacist training/qualifications (CCS 9), instrument validity (CCS 10), structure criteria (CCS 4), patient outcomes (CCS 11), and economic outcomes (CCS 12). The mean total checklist score was 37 of 50 (range 31\u201346). CONCLUSIONS Few research studies have evaluated the provision of pharmaceutical care in a defined population. Deficiencies identified by low CCSs demonstrate the need for quality research design and a clear description of the pharmaceutical care process to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical care. Recommendations for improvement in research design were made. OBJETIVO: Describir y examinar cr\u00edticamente los estudios de investigaci\u00f3n que se han publicado en atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica y proveer recomendaciones para mejorar la calidad de la investigaci\u00f3n y los art\u00edculos publicados. FUENTES DE INFORMACI\u00d3N: B\u00fasqueda principal fue en las bases de datos de MEDLINE e IPA. Se utiliz\u00f3 como palabra clave \u201cpharmaceutical care\u201d (cuidado farmac\u00e9utico) y se limit\u00f3 a art\u00edculos de estudios de investigaci\u00f3n en ingl\u00e9s publicados entre 1988\u20131996. SELECCI\u00d3N DE ESTUDIOS: Art\u00edculos que evaluaron la provisi\u00f3n de atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica en una poblaci\u00f3n definida. Para inclusi\u00f3n, el estudio ten\u00eda que demostrar que el proceso de brindar atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica cumpl\u00eda con los criterios siguientes: (1) se establec\u00eda la relaci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utico-paciente para involucrar al paciente en las decisiones farmacoterap\u00e9uticas, (2) los resultados deseados se establec\u00edan en conjunto con el paciente, (3) se identificaban problemas farmacoterap\u00e9uticos, (4) se presentaban las recomendaciones farmacoterap\u00e9uticas al paciente y al m\u00e9dico, (5) se establec\u00eda un m\u00e9todo de seguimiento del paciente, y (6) las intervenciones del farmac\u00e9utico se documentaban. M\u00c9TODO DE EXTRACCI\u00d3N DE INFORMACI\u00d3N: Dos personas revisaron las citaciones identificadas. Los art\u00edculos de aquellas citaciones que parec\u00edan cumplir con los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n establecidos se analizaron utilizando el iustrumento Pharmaceutical Care Research Checklist creado con el prop\u00f3sito de formalmente evaluar la investigaci\u00f3n en cuidado farmac\u00e9utico. En el instrumento se identifican 25 criterios a los cuales le asignan puntuaci\u00f3n. Se incluyen criterios para objetivos del estudio, el proceso de brindar cuidado farmac\u00e9utico, metodolog\u00eda, medici\u00f3n de resultados y discusi\u00f3n de conclusiones, y limitaciones de la investigaci\u00f3n. S\u00cdNTESIS: Se identificaron 979 citaciones de las cuales 57 extractos parec\u00edan que los estudios cumpl\u00edan los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n. Al revisar los art\u00edculos s\u00f3lo 12 se aceptaron para an\u00e1lisis. Este an\u00e1lisis identific\u00f3 deficiencias en: investigaci\u00f3n de cuidado farmac\u00e9utico en farmacia comunitaria (n = 2), estudios con dise\u00f1o de muestreo aleatorio y muestra de control (n = 3), medici\u00f3n de asignaci\u00f3n de tareas (n = 6), y satisfacci\u00f3n de paciente (n = 1). Adem\u00e1s, al examinar en el Pharmaceutical Care Research Checklist la puntuaci\u00f3n compuesta por criterio (PCC m\u00e1ximo = 24) se encontraron omisiones comunes en metodolog\u00eda: descripci\u00f3n de la muestra (PCC = 17), explicaci\u00f3n para pacientes que no completaron el estudio (PCC = 13), obtenci\u00f3n de consentimiento del paciente para participar en el estudio (PCC = 8), y explicaci\u00f3n de competencia profesional del farmac\u00e9utico (PCC = 9). Cinco de siete estudios que usaron instrumentos o cuestionarios para la colecci\u00f3n de datos lo validaron (PCC = 10). Los doce estudios informaron medici\u00f3n de resultados de proceso (PCC = 24). Se identific\u00f3 una PCC baja para el criterio de estructura (PCC = 4) y para medici\u00f3n de resultados en pacientes (PCC = 11) y econ\u00f3micos (PCC = 12). La media de puntuaci\u00f3n total por estudio fue 37 de un m\u00e1ximo de 50 (fluctu\u00f3 entre 31\u201346). CONCLUSIONES: Pocos estudios de investigaci\u00f3n han evaluado la provisi\u00f3n de cuidado farmac\u00e9utico en una poblaci\u00f3n definida. Los hallazgos de esta evaluaci\u00f3n de los art\u00edculos publicados de estudios de investigaci\u00f3n en la provisi\u00f3n de cuidado farmac\u00e9utico demuestran la necesidad de mejorar la calidad de los dise\u00f1os de investigaci\u00f3n y de una descripci\u00f3n clara del proceso de cuidado f\u00e2rmac\u00e9utico para evaluar el impacto de cuidad farmac\u00e9utico y poder justificar el proveerlo en un sistema de salud con recursos escasos. Se presentan 15 recomendaciones con el prop\u00f3sito de mejorar la claidad de la investigaci\u00f3n futura. OBJECTIF: D\u00e9crire et commenter les \u00e9tudes publi\u00e9s sur les soins pharmaceutiques et \u00e9mettre des recommandations dans le but d'am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 de cette litt\u00e9rature.

S\u00c9LECTION DES \u00c9TUDES: Les articles retenus furent ceux traitant des soins pharmaceutiques pour des populations d\u00e9finies. S\u00c9LECTION DE L'INFORMATION: Des titres d'articles et des R\u00c9SUM\u00c9s furent r\u00e9vis\u00e9s. Les articles qui semblaient rencontrer les crit\u00e8res d'inclusion furent examin\u00e9s. Les articles furent not\u00e9s selon la Pharmaceutical Care Research Checklist pour la pr\u00e9sence de crit\u00e8res comme le processus de soins pharmaceutiques, la m\u00e9thodologie, et les mesures/r\u00e9sultats. R\u00c9SULTATS: Pr\u00e8s de 979 documents furent identifi\u00e9s. Des 57 R\u00e9sum\u00e9s identifi\u00e9s comme rencontrant potentiellement les crit\u00e8res d'inclusion, 43 articles furent \u00e9limin\u00e9s, 2 rejet\u00e9s, et 12 accept\u00e9s aux fins d'analyse. Les lacunes identifi\u00e9s incluaient: un manque de recherche en pharmacie communautaire (n = 2), \u00e9tudes contr\u00f4l\u00e9es randomis\u00e9es (n = 3), mesure de la charge de travail (n = 6), et la satisfaction des patients (n = 1). La notation suivant la Pharmaceutical Care Research Checklist a aussi identifi\u00e9e les lacunes suivants: (maximum Composite Criterion Score (CCS) = 24), description de l'\u00e9chantillonnage de la population (CCS = 17), arr\u00eats (CCS = 13), consentement (CSS = 8), qualif\u00edcations/ entra\u00eenement du pharmacien (CCS = 9), validit\u00e9 des instruments (CCS = 10), crit\u00e8res structur\u00e9s (CCS = 4), r\u00e9sultats th\u00e9rapeutiques (CCS = 11), et r\u00e9sultats \u00e9conomiques (CCS = 12). La moyenne du Total Checklist Score \u00e9tait de 37 sur 50 (intervalle de 31 \u00e0 46.) CONCLUSIONS Peu d'\u00e9tudes ont \u00e9valu\u00e9es la dispensation des soins pharmaceutiques chez une population d\u00e9finie. Les lacunes identifi\u00e9es par le CCS d\u00e9montrent le besoin pour une recherche avec des devis de qualit\u00e9 et une description claire du processus des soins pharmaceutiques pour permettre d'en \u00e9valuer l'impact. Des recommandations pour am\u00e9liorer les devis des \u00e9tudes furent faites.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify the baseline frequency of eye examinations for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in Montana and to determine whether a direct mail reminder increased eye examinations. Using Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B claims data, a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes was defined. Eye examination claims were identified using billing codes specific for retinal examinations, as well as visits to ophthalmologists and optometrists during which retinal exams were likely to have been performed. A random sample of the identified beneficiaries with diabetes received a letter encouraging regular annual retinal examinations. In the first 3-month period after the mailing, the billed eye examination rate for those to whom letters were sent was 2.2 percentage points greater than the rate for those to whom letters were not sent (19.4% vs 17.2%; relative risk, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.26). However, 6 months after the letters were sent, there was no longer a significant difference in the rates for these 2 groups (32.9% vs 32.4%; relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.10). In this study, direct mail outreach initially influenced the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries receiving an eye examination, but this pattern was not sustained over the 6-month follow-up period.",

        "abstract": "The glycemic control of patients with diabetes in a physician\u2010supervised, pharmacist\u2010managed primary care clinic was compared with that of patients receiving standard care in the same health care system. We retrospectively analyzed the glycemic control of 87 men with type 1 or type 2 diabetes whose diabetes\u2010related drug therapy was managed by clinical pharmacists compared with a control group of 85 similar patients whose care was not augmented by clinical pharmacists. Primary outcomes were differences in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels between groups. Secondary outcomes were relative risk (RR) for achieving an A1C of 7% or below, frequency of diabetes\u2010related scheduled and unscheduled clinic visits, and frequency of hypoglycemic events. The study group had 864 clinic visits and the control group had 712 between October 1997 and June 2000. No statistical differences were noted in FBG or A1C between groups. The RR of achieving an A1C of 7% or below was significantly higher in the study cohort (RR 5.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.62\u201010.26). The frequency of hypoglycemic events did not differ between groups. The mean \u00b1 SD frequency of unscheduled diabetes\u2010related clinic visits/patient/year was higher in the control group (1.33 \u00b1 3.74) than in the study group (0.11 \u00b1 0.46, p=0.003). Pharmacist\u2010managed diabetes care was effective in improving glycemic control and was not associated with an increased risk for hypoglycemic events or unscheduled diabetes\u2010related clinic visits.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pharmacists' responsibilities in caring for patients with diabetes mellitus are expanding. However, few data are available to support pharmacists optimizing therapy and improving outcomes in these patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a clinical pharmacist\u2014directed diabetes management clinic on glycemic control and cardiovascular and renal parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS A nonrandomized, prospective study was conducted in 70 Veterans Affairs patients. Patients met with the pharmacist every 6\u20138 weeks for approximately 30 minutes for education, medication counseling, monitoring, and management. The primary endpoint was the impact of 9\u201312 months of participation in the clinic on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). Secondarily, we evaluated body weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and level of microalbuminuria. All comparisons were made using a paired t-test at a significance level of p \u2264 0.05. RESULTS HbA1C significantly decreased from 10.3% \u00b1 2.2% at baseline to 6.9% \u00b1 1.1% (mean \u00b1 SD) during the 9- to 12-month evaluation period (p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported a positive impact of pharmacists on care of patients with chronic illnesses. The impact of the clinical pharmacist on hospital readmission in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has yet to be evaluated, as of this writing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the clinical pharmacist as a direct patient-care team member on cardiac-related readmission in patients admitted to the general cardiology unit with ACS. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized observational study compared patients who received standard practice care with patients admitted to a service with a clinical pharmacist to provide care at the bedside. Patients admitted to and discharged from the general cardiology unit for ACS were included. The primary endpoint of the study was cardiac-related readmission at 30 days following hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints included length of stay and medication utilization. Interventions provided by the clinical pharmacist in the study group were documented. RESULTS: Cardiac readmission at 30 days was similar between the groups (p = 0.59%). In the subset of patients with unstable angina, readmission in the study group was significantly lower than in the control group (1.3% vs 9.1%; p = 0.04%). Patients in both groups were similarly managed using drug therapy and invasive coronary interventions. The medical staff's rate of acceptance of recommendations provided by the pharmacist was 94.4%. The most common interventions were medication education and identification of indicated therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pharmacists did not decrease readmission in patients with ACS. The finding of significant reduction in readmission in the subset of patients with unstable angina should be considered \u201chypothesis generating\u201d for future randomized studies to confirm the results.",

        "abstract": "Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in health care and health outcomes are well documented. Disparities research is evolving from documenting these disparities, to understanding their causes and mechanisms, and finally to conducting interventional research to reduce or eliminate disparities. Unfortunately, few studies to date have demonstrated substantial reductions in health outcomes disparities. Traditional experimental models of research that test a single intervention held constant throughout the study period may not have the power to impact complex clusters of comorbid health disparities in patients who receive care in underresourced primary care safety net practice settings. New models of research will be required to test dynamic, multidimensional interventions that triangulate on patients, providers, and communities and are continuously improved with every radar-sweep of feedback from rapid-cycle measurement of population health outcomes on a community-wide basis. In this article, we review 12 promising strategies that could substantially increase the impact of research on eliminating health disparities in America.",

        "title": "Community Pharmacist\u2013Provided Extended Diabetes Care",
        "abstract": "Background Pharmacists in various settings have been effective in initiating diabetes treatment. Patients with diabetes require ongoing disease management, and community pharmacists are in a strategic position to provide such extended care. Little is known, however, about the effects of community pharmacist\u2013provided interventions beyond the initial treatment period. Objective To evaluate the effect of community pharmacist\u2013provided extended diabetes care service on primary clinical outcomes, including hemoglobin A1c (A1C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood pressure, and on patients' reported self-care activities. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with diabetes. Participants had already completed at least 2 diabetes education sessions at a local diabetes education center. Nine specially trained pharmacists administered interventions during up to 4 quarterly visits per patient. Interventions included discussing medications, clinical goals, and self-care activities with patients and recommending medication changes to physicians when appropriate. The main outcome measures were 12-month changes in A1C, LDL-C, blood pressure, and self-report of self-care activities. Results Seventy-eight patients participated in the study (36 intervention, 42 control); 66 were included in the final analysis (31 intervention, 35 control). Compared with changes in the control group, patients who received interventions significantly increased the number of days per week that they engaged in a set of diet and diabetes self-care activities (1.25 and 0.73 more days/wk, respectively). The mean 12-month changes for A1C, LDL-C, and blood pressure were not significantly different between the 2 study groups. Conclusions Although pharmacist-provided interventions did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes over the study period, study results did show that pharmacists were effective at increasing the number of days that patients spent engaging in healthy diet and diabetes self-care activities. Addressing lifestyle and self-care behaviors can be a beneficial component of a pharmacist-provided extended diabetes care service.",

        "title": "Pharmacist Recommendations to Improve the Quality of Diabetes Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus continues to result in substantial morbidity and mortality despite receiving much attention from health care providers. Automated clinician reminder systems have been developed to improve adherence to diabetes care guidelines, but these reminder systems do not always provide actionable information and may be unable to detect relevant, subjective patient information that affects clinical decision making. Face-to-face visits with pharmacists, who have knowledge of care guidelines and medication management strategies, may assist in improving diabetes care. It is unknown if the combination of pharmacist chart review and clinician reminders could improve diabetes care without requiring face-to-face visits. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a comprehensive, pharmacist delivered, primary care, physician-focused intervention in a large hospital-based primary care practice to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes including rates of semiannual hemoglobin A1c testing and other biomarker and process measures. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study conducted in a hospital-based, primary care practice, composed of 37 faculty primary care physicians (PCPs) and 95 internal medicine residents. The initial sample included 346 patients with diabetes and 72 PCPs caring for them. PCPs were randomized to receive either a personalized letter from a practicing pharmacist containing treatment recommendations for patients with upcoming primary care visits (intervention, n = 33) or to usual care without the letters (control, n = 39). The letter included patient-specific recommendations regarding overdue testing as well as drug therapy to achieve diabetes-related treatment targets. The intervention included addition of the letter to the electronic medical record (EMR) and presentation of the letter to the PCP at the time of the index primary care visit that occurred between November 2003 and August 2004. Follow-up chart review was performed after the primary care visit to determine changes in 5 process and 3 biomarker outcome measures of diabetes care within 30 days of the index visit. The primary study outcome was a process measure, change in rates of semiannual A1c testing from baseline to 30-day follow-up. Baseline differences were tested for statistical significance using Pearson chisquare. The statistical significance of the intervention's effect was tested using logistic regression models predicting achievement of each study outcome, with randomization status (intervention vs. control) as the predictor variable of interest, controlling for baseline performance for each measure. RESULTS: 171 patients were in the 4 medical clinic suites with 33 PCPs who received the intervention, and 175 patients were in the 4 suites with 39 PCPs in usual care. 30-day outcomes were analyzed for 301 patients (87.0%) who attended their scheduled index primary care visit. Of these 301 patients, 44.5% were black, 65.8% were female, and the mean age was 63 years. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the intervention group (n = 150) and the usual care (control) group (n = 151) in the 3 biomarker measures (proportion with A1c less than 7%, proportion with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] less than 100 milligrams per deciliter [mg per dL], or blood pressure less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mm Hg]). There were no significant baseline differences in 4 of the 5 process measures; however, the rate of annual LDL-C testing was significantly higher for the intervention than for the control group at baseline (86.0% vs. 74.8%, respectively, P = 0.015). In logistic regression analysis, rates of semiannual A1c testing were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups, increasing from baseline to follow-up by 16% in the intervention group and 9% in the control group (P = 0.146). The proportion of patients with A1c less than 7% at follow-up was 43.3% in the intervention group versus 37.7% in the control group (intervention effect P = 0.099). The only statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the 8 outcome measures was a higher proportion with an annual eye exam at follow-up in the intervention group (60.0%) versus the usual care group (50.3%, intervention effect P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-generated recommendations delivered by letter to PCPs in an academic medical practice were not associated with statistically significant improvements in most quality measures for diabetes care assessed at 30 days following the intervention. Further research is needed with more patients and a longer follow-up time to determine how best to improve the quality of care of patients with diabetes using focused recommendations for therapy changes and reminder notices to clinicians.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo catalogue study designs used to assess the clinical effectiveness of CDSSs and KMSs, to identify features that impact the success of CDSSs/KMSs, to document the impact of CDSSs/KMSs on outcomes, and to identify knowledge types that can be integrated into CDSSs/KMSs.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nMEDLINE(\u00ae), CINAHL(\u00ae), PsycINFO(\u00ae), and Web of Science(\u00ae).\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nWe included studies published in English from January 1976 through December 2010. After screening titles and abstracts, full-text versions of articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Included articles were abstracted to evidence tables by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed for seven domains in which sufficient studies with common outcomes were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 15,176 articles, from which 323 articles describing 311 unique studies including 160 reports on 148 randomized control trials (RCTs) were selected for inclusion. RCTs comprised 47.5 percent of the comparative studies on CDSSs/KMSs. Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs effectively improved health care process measures related to performing preventive services (n = 25; OR 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.58), ordering clinical studies (n = 20; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.00), and prescribing therapies (n = 46; OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.82). Fourteen CDSS/KMS features were assessed for correlation with success of CDSSs/KMSs across all endpoints. Meta-analyses identified six new success features: Integration with charting or order entry system. Promotion of action rather than inaction. No need for additional clinician data entry. Justification of decision support via research evidence. Local user involvement. Provision of decision support results to patients as well as providers. Three previously identified success features were confirmed: Automatic provision of decision support as part of clinician workflow. Provision of decision support at time and location of decisionmaking. Provision of a recommendation, not just an assessment. Only 29 (19.6%) RCTs assessed the impact of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, 22 (14.9%) assessed costs, and 3 assessed KMSs on any outcomes. The primary source of knowledge used in CDSSs was derived from structured care protocols.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nStrong evidence shows that CDSSs/KMSs are effective in improving health care process measures across diverse settings using both commercially and locally developed systems. Evidence for the effectiveness of CDSSs on clinical outcomes and costs and KMSs on any outcomes is minimal. Nine features of CDSSs/KMSs that correlate with a successful impact of clinical decision support have been newly identified or confirmed.",

        "abstract": "Enabling clinical decision support (CDS) across multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems has been a desired but largely unattained aim of clinical informatics, especially in commercial EHR systems. A potential opportunity for enabling such scalable CDS is to leverage vendor-supported, Web-based CDS development platforms along with vendor-supported application programming interfaces (APIs). Here, we propose a potential staged approach for enabling such scalable CDS, starting with the use of custom EHR APIs and moving towards standardized EHR APIs to facilitate interoperability. We analyzed three commercial EHR systems for their capabilities to support the proposed approach, and we implemented prototypes in all three systems. Based on these analyses and prototype implementations, we conclude that the approach proposed is feasible, already supported by several major commercial EHR vendors, and potentially capable of enabling cross-platform CDS at scale.",

        "abstract": "Context: The recent explosion in available electronic health record (EHR) data is motivating a rapid expansion of electronic health care predictive analytic (e-HPA) applications, defined as the use of electronic algorithms that forecast clinical events in real time with the intent to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. There is an urgent need for a systematic framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA to ensure that the field develops in a scientifically sound, ethical, and efficient manner. Objectives: Building upon earlier frameworks of model development and utilization, we identify the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA, propose a framework that enables us to realize these opportunities, address these challenges, and motivate e-HPA stakeholders to both adopt and continuously refine the framework as the applications of e-HPA emerge. Methods: To achieve these objectives, 17 experts with diverse expertise including methodology, ethics, legal, regulation, and health care delivery systems were assembled to identify emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA and to propose a framework to guide the development and application of e-HPA. Findings: The framework proposed by the panel includes three key domains where e-HPA differs qualitatively from earlier generations of models and algorithms (Data Barriers, Transparency, and Ethics) and areas where current frameworks are insufficient to address the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-HPA (Regulation and Certification; and Education and Training). The following list of recommendations summarizes the key points of the framework: Data Barriers: Establish mechanisms within the scientific community to support data sharing for predictive model development and testing. Transparency: Set standards around e-HPA validation based on principles of scientific transparency and reproducibility. Ethics: Develop both individual-centered and society-centered risk-benefit approaches to evaluate e-HPA. Regulation and Certification: Construct a self-regulation and certification framework within e-HPA. Education and Training: Make significant changes to medical, nursing, and paraprofessional curricula by including training for understanding, evaluating, and utilizing predictive models.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Early prediction of undesired outcomes among newly hospitalized patients could improve patient triage and prompt conversations about patients\u2019 goals of care. We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, and elastic net regression models, with and without unstructured clinical text data, to predict a binary composite outcome of in-hospital death or ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days using data from the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Design: Retrospective cohort study with split sampling for model training and testing. Setting: A single urban academic hospital. Patients: All hospitalized patients who required ICU care at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, from 2001 to 2012. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Among eligible 25,947 hospital admissions, we observed 5,504 (21.2%) in which patients died or had ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days. The gradient boosting machine model had the highest discrimination without (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81\u20130.84) and with (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88\u20130.90) text-derived variables. Both gradient boosting machines and random forests outperformed logistic regression without text data (p < 0.001), whereas all models outperformed logistic regression with text data (p < 0.02). The inclusion of text data increased the discrimination of all four model types (p < 0.001). Among those models using text data, the increasing presence of terms \u201cintubated\u201d and \u201cpoor prognosis\u201d were positively associated with mortality and ICU length of stay, whereas the term \u201cextubated\u201d was inversely associated with them. Conclusions: Variables extracted from unstructured clinical text from the first 48 hours of hospital admission using natural language processing techniques significantly improved the abilities of logistic regression and other machine learning models to predict which patients died or had long ICU stays. Learning health systems may adapt such models using open-source approaches to capture local variation in care patterns.",

        "abstract": "Background Successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are exceedingly rare, and barriers to its adoption are poorly characterized in the literature. Objective This study aims to report a quality improvement effort to integrate a deep learning sepsis detection and management platform, Sepsis Watch, into routine clinical care. Methods In 2016, a multidisciplinary team consisting of statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, and clinicians was assembled by the leadership of an academic health system to radically improve the detection and treatment of sepsis. This report of the quality improvement effort follows the learning health system framework to describe the problem assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation plan of Sepsis Watch. Results Sepsis Watch was successfully integrated into routine clinical care and reshaped how local machine learning projects are executed. Frontline clinical staff were highly engaged in the design and development of the workflow, machine learning model, and application. Novel machine learning methods were developed to detect sepsis early, and implementation of the model required robust infrastructure. Significant investment was required to align stakeholders, develop trusting relationships, define roles and responsibilities, and to train frontline staff, leading to the establishment of 3 partnerships with internal and external research groups to evaluate Sepsis Watch. Conclusions Machine learning models are commonly developed to enhance clinical decision making, but successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are rare. Although there is no playbook for integrating deep learning into clinical care, learnings from the Sepsis Watch integration can inform efforts to develop machine learning technologies at other health care delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "Background: Discharge date prediction plays a crucial role in healthcare management, enabling efficient resource allocation and patient care planning. Accurate estimation of the discharge date can optimize hospital operations and facilitate better patient outcomes. Materials and Methods: In this study, we employed a systematic approach to develop a discharge date prediction model. We collaborated closely with clinical experts to identify relevant data elements that contribute to the prediction accuracy. Feature engineering was used to extract predictive features from both structured and unstructured data sources. XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, was employed for the prediction task. Furthermore, the developed model was seamlessly integrated into a widely used Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, ensuring practical usability. Results: The model achieved a performance surpassing baseline estimates by up to 35.68% in the F1-score. Post-deployment, the model demonstrated operational value by aligning with MS GMLOS and contributing to an 18.96% reduction in excess hospital days. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the effectiveness and potential value of the developed discharge date prediction model in clinical practice. By improving the accuracy of discharge date estimations, the model has the potential to enhance healthcare resource management and patient care planning. Additional research endeavors should prioritize the evaluation of the model's long-term applicability across diverse scenarios and the comprehensive analysis of its influence on patient outcomes.
