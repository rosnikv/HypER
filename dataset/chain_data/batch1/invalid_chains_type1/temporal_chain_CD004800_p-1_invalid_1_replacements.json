Treatment response was based on morning stiffness, back pain, and physician and patient global assessments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhile longitudinal analysis revealed a trend favoring SSZ in the middle of treatment, no difference was seen at the end of treatment. Response rates were 38.2% for SSZ and 36.1% for placebo (P = 0.73). The Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined more with SSZ treatment than with placebo (P < 0.0001). AS patients with associated peripheral arthritis showed improvement that favored SSZ (P = 0.02). Adverse reactions were fewer than expected and were mainly due to nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSSZ at a dosage of 2,000 mg/day does not seem to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of AS patients with chronic, longstanding disease. SSZ is well tolerated and may be more effective than placebo in the treatment of AS patients with peripheral joint involvement. This effect is more pronounced in treatment of the peripheral arthritis in this subgroup of AS patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine if the peripheral articular manifestations of the seronegative spondylarthropathies (SNSA) respond differently than the axial manifestations to treatment with sulfasalazine (SSZ).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a reanalysis of a previously reported series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials comparing the effects of SSZ, 2,000 mg/day, and placebo on the axial and peripheral articular manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and reactive arthritis (ReA; Reiter's syndrome). Patients were classified as treatment responders on the basis of meeting predefined improvement criteria in 4 outcome measures: namely, patient and physician global assessments in all patients, morning stiffness and back pain in patients with axial manifestations, and joint pain/tenderness scores and joint swelling scores in patients with peripheral articular manifestations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix hundred nineteen SNSA patients (264 AS, 221 PsA, and 134 ReA) were studied. One hundred eighty-seven of these patients had only axial manifestations of their disease, while 432 patients had peripheral articular manifestations. Of the patients with axial disease, 40.2% of the SSZ group and 43.3% of the placebo group met the predefined response criteria (P = 0.67).

These data demonstrate that the axial and peripheral articular manifestations of SNSA respond differently to treatment with SSZ. In SNSA patients with persistently active peripheral arthritis, SSZ is safe, well tolerated, and effective.",

        "title": "Psoriatic Arthritis: Pathogenesis and Targeted Therapies",
        "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disease characterized by musculoskeletal inflammation (arthritis, enthesitis, spondylitis, and dactylitis), generally occurs in patients with psoriasis. PsA is also associated with uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis). To capture these manifestations as well as the associated comorbidities, and to recognize their underlining common pathogenesis, the name of psoriatic disease was coined. The pathogenesis of PsA is complex and multifaceted, with an interplay of genetic predisposition, triggering environmental factors, and activation of the innate and adaptive immune system, although autoinflammation has also been implicated. Research has identified several immune-inflammatory pathways defined by cytokines (IL-23/IL-17, TNF), leading to the development of efficacious therapeutic targets. However, heterogeneous responses to these drugs occur in different patients and in the different tissues involved, resulting in a challenge to the global management of the disease. Therefore, more translational research is necessary in order to identify new targets and improve current disease outcomes. Hopefully, this may become a reality through the integration of different omics technologies that allow better understanding of the relevant cellular and molecular players of the different tissues and manifestations of the disease. In this narrative review, we aim to provide an updated overview of the pathophysiology, including the latest findings from multiomics studies, and to describe current targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effects of treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) on synovial histology in patients with spondylarthropathy (SpA) in order to confirm the effect on peripheral synovitis and to investigate the immunologic mechanisms involved in anti-TNFalpha therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with treatment-resistant SpA were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, and 6 in an open-label pilot study. In 8 patients, synovial biopsy tissues obtained at baseline, week 2, and week 12 were used for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn all 8 patients (3 with ankylosing spondylitis, 1 with undifferentiated SpA, and 4 with psoriatic arthritis), there was a clear clinical improvement in the peripheral arthritis after anti-TNFalpha therapy. Histologic analysis of the synovial biopsy tissues indicated that the synovial lining layer thickness tended to decrease, with a significant reduction of CD55+ synoviocytes, at week 12. In the sublining layer, vascularity was reduced at week 12, with a decreased endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 but not intercellular adhesion molecule 1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin. Although at week 2 and week 12, the number of neutrophils and CD68+ macrophages in the sublining layer was decreased, the overall degree of inflammatory infiltration remained unchanged. This could be related to the lymphocyte infiltration since at week 12, only CD4+ cells (but not CD3+, CD45RO+, and CD8+ cells) tended to decrease, while CD20+ lymphocytes and plasma cells were clearly increased.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe reduction in lining layer thickness, vascularity, and infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages paralleled the beneficial effect of anti-TNFalpha therapy on peripheral synovitis in 8 patients with different subtypes of SpA. The adhesion molecule expression, T cell infiltration, and, most important, B cell infiltration seemed to contrast with previous observations in RA. Although these preliminary data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort, they suggest distinct immunomodulatory mechanisms of anti-TNFalpha in SpA.",

As early as week 2 and sustained up to week 12, there was a highly statistically significant difference between the values for these 2 end points in the infliximab versus the placebo group. In most of the other assessments of disease activity (laboratory measures, assessments of specific peripheral and/or axial disease), significant improvements were observed in the infliximab group compared with the baseline value and compared with placebo.

        "abstract": "Infliximab, the chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has changed our therapy of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is indicated in refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. In patients with luminal disease, a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 5 mg/kg is efficacious; in fistulizing disease, an i.v. loading therapy of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is advocated. Because the majority of patients will relapse if not re-treated, a long-term strategy is necessary. The optimal long-term approach is systematic re-treatment with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Episodic therapy on relapse also is possible but is less efficacious and frequently is associated with problems resulting from the formation of antibodies to infliximab (ATI). If treatment is episodic, maintenance therapy with immunosuppression (azathioprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or methotrexate) is mandatory. Trial data suggest that systematic maintenance with 8 weekly doses of infliximab decreases the rate of complications, hospitalizations, and surgeries. These effects probably are achieved thanks to thorough healing of the bowel. Infliximab also is indicated in treating corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease and extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. There are no data yet that support its use as first-line therapy. The data in ulcerative colitis (UC) are conflicting and we should await the results of 2 large controlled trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to position infliximab in the treatment of UC. Other anti-TNF strategies have been less effective than infliximab in the treatment of IBD until now. The results with thalidomide are promising but much more research into small molecules inhibiting TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines is necessary. Safety problems with antibody treatment mainly concern immunogenicity leading to infusion reactions, loss of response, and serum sickness-like delayed infusion reactions. The rate of opportunistic infections is increased mainly in patients treated concomitantly with immunosuppression. Other adverse events associated with anti-TNF strategies are demyelinating disease and worsening of congestive heart failure. Malignancy rates in patients treated with anti-TNF strategies do not seem to be increased.",

There have been a number of reports of PG responding to infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor \u03b1. Aim: In the first randomised placebo controlled trial of any drug for the treatment of PG, we have studied the role of infliximab in this disorder. Subjects: Patients 18 years of age or older with a clinical diagnosis of PG were invited to take part. Methods: Patients were randomised to receive an infusion of infliximab at 5 mg/kg or placebo at week 0. Patients were then assessed at week 2 and non-responders were offered open labelled infliximab. The primary end point was clinical improvement at week 2, with secondary end points being remission and improvement at week 6. Results: Thirty patients were entered into the study. After randomisation, 13 patients received infliximab and 17 patients received placebo. At week 2, significantly more patients in the infliximab group had improved (46% (6/13)) compared with the placebo group (6% (1/17); p\u200a=\u200a0.025). Overall, 29 patients received infliximab with 69% (20/29) demonstrating a beneficial clinical response. Remission rate at week 6 was 21% (6/29). There was no response in 31% (9/29) of patients. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg is superior to placebo in the treatment of PG. Open label treatment with infliximab also produced promising results. Infliximab treatment should be considered in patients with PG.",

Current treatment approaches in these countries are also reviewed and discussed in the context of new, small molecule, orally administered therapies. Areas covered: Available data on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of ulcerative colitis in Africa and the Middle East are reviewed using a PubMed database search. Expert commentary: Epidemiologic studies from African and Middle Eastern countries suggest disease trends similar to the West, and an important health and economic burden. The management of ulcerative colitis within these developing countries is challenging, with the need to improve early diagnosis, access to healthcare, and patient education, along with facilitation of access to treatment options and improvement of medication adherence.",
