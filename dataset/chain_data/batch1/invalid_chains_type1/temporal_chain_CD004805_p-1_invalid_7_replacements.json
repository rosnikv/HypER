        "abstract": "Abstract Objective : To examine the effect of a reduced sodium and increased potassium and magnesium intake on blood pressure. Design : Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. Setting : General population of a suburb of Rotterdam. Subjects : 100 men and women between 55 and 75 years of age with untreated mild to moderate hypertension. Interventions : During 24 weeks the intervention group received a mineral salt (sodium: potassium: magnesium 8:6:1) and foods prepared with the mineral salt. Controls received common salt and foods. Main outcome measure : Change in blood pressure. Results - Complete follow up was achieved for 97 of the 100 randomised subjects. Systolic blood pressure (mean of measurements at weeks 8, 16, and 24) fell by 7.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 11.2) and diastolic blood pressure by 3.3 mm Hg (0.8 to 5.8) in the mineral salt group compared with the controls, with a 28% decrease in urinary sodium excretion and a 22% increase in urinary potassium excretion. Twenty five weeks after the study the difference in blood pressure between the groups was no longer detectable. Conclusion : Replacing common sodium salt by a low sodium, high potassium, high magnesium mineral salt could offer a valuable non -pharmacological approach to lowering blood pressure in older people with mild to moderate hypertension.",

        "abstract": "The INTERSALT Study is a standardized, worldwide epidemiologic study of large sample size (n = 10079 men and women aged 20-59 y from 32 countries) that tested both within- and cross-population prior hypotheses on 24-h sodium excretion and blood pressure. For individuals, a significant, positive, independent linear relation between 24-h sodium excretion and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found. With multivariate adjustment for underestimation, the estimated effect of a sodium intake higher by 100 mmol/d was higher SBP/DBP (diastolic blood pressure) by approximately 3-6/0-3 mm Hg. This relation prevailed for both men and women, for younger and older people, and for 8344 people without hypertension. In tests of prior cross-population hypotheses (n = 52), significant, independent relations were found between sample 24-h median urinary sodium excretion and sample median SBP and DBP, prevalence rate of hypertension, and slope of SBP and DBP from age 20 to 59 y (median sodium intake greater by 100 mmol/d was associated with a 30-y increase in SBP/DBP, i.e., at the age of 55 y compared with 25 y, of 10-11/6 mm Hg. The INTERSALT results, which agree with findings from other diverse studies, including data from clinical observations, therapeutic interventions, randomized controlled trials, animal experiments, physiologic investigations, evolutionary biology research, anthropologic research, and epidemiologic studies, support the judgment that habitual high salt intake is one of the quantitatively important, preventable mass exposures causing the unfavorable population-wide blood pressure pattern that is a major risk factor for epidemic cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nStudies of couples, who tend to share an environment but are genetically dissimilar, can shed light on the contribution of environmental factors to hypertension. There has been renewed interest in these environmental factors following the re-analysis of the INTERSALT study.\n\n\nAIM\nTo determine whether patients whose spouses have hypertension are at increased risk of hypertension, using a population-based case-control study.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe total study population consisted of all 3923 patients over 30 years old registered with one general practice. Male cases with hypertension were matched to male controls without hypertension. Female cases with hypertension were matched to female controls without hypertension. The variables were: diagnosed hypertension; having a spouse with diagnosed hypertension; age; sex; weight; height; body-mass index; couple status; diabetes; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn multivariate analysis, when age, body-mass index, diabetes, couple status, and having a blood pressure reading were included, men whose spouses had hypertension had a two-fold increased risk of hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.24; 95% CI 1.77-2.72; P = 0.001). Similarly, on multivariate analysis, women whose spouses had hypertension had a two-fold increased risk of hypertension (adjusted OR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.75-2.72; P = 0.001). The risk for both male and female subjects persisted after adjustment for other variables. There was a significant correlation between systolic (r = 0.41; P < 0.0001) and diastolic (r = 0.25; P < 0.0001) blood pressures between spouse pairs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe independent association between having a spouse with hypertension and increased risk of hypertension supports the view that there are significant environmental factors in the aetiology of hypertension. The finding has implications for the screening and treatment of hypertension in primary care.",

        "abstract": "The inverse relationship between intake of dairy products and blood pressure levels was first suggested by several epidemiologic surveys in the early 1980\u2019s that revealed low calcium intake in populations with increased prevalence of hypertension.

The recently published results of the large and carefully executed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Study, \u201cDASH,\u201d which demonstrated a dramatic blood-pressure lowering effect of diets rich in dairy products, fruits and vegetables, addressed many of the issues contributing to the inconsistencies in the blood pressure-calcium data.

        "abstract": "Recent clinical and biochemical evidence supporting the hypothesis that consumption of dairy products may be associated with reduced blood pressure and risk of stroke is reviewed. The two prospective studies of dairy food consumption and stroke incidence both indicate that a higher intake of dairy foods reduces risk. It is difficult to associate any one mineral in dairy products to reduction in blood pressure or stroke incidence because an appropriate metabolic balance of all three is important and because of the strong correlations among Ca, Mg and K intakes when dairy products are consumed. In fact, the evidence reviewed indicates that although K apparently has the greatest effect, all three minerals potentially contribute to blood pressure and stroke reduction, i.e., a dietary balance of all three is recommended. Milk and food products such as yogurt made from milk, which retain substantial amounts of K, Ca and Mg, are important dietary sources of all three of these minerals. In addition, milk is a low Na food, which, as seen in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) II, provides further benefit in blood pressure reduction. New studies have associated dairy food consumption with other potential mechanisms affecting stroke, mainly reduction of platelet aggregation and insulin resistance. Further research is required to explore the relationship of dairy food consumption and stroke.",

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 There is considerable variability in the antiplatelet effects of the thienopyridine agent \u201cclopidogrel.\u201d We tested for an association of gene sequence variations in P2Y12 and occurrence of neurological adverse events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) during clopidogrel treatment. Methods\u2014 We studied 137 patients undergoing antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and 336 patients with aspirin for the occurrence of neurological events (ischemic stroke and/or carotid revascularization). Prevalence of 2 previously described exonic polymorphisms of the P2Y12 gene, 34C>T and 52G>T, was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Results\u2014 Genotype frequencies for mutated, heterozygous, and wild-type alleles for the 34C>T and the 52G>T polymorphisms were 9% (n=40), 44% (n=210), and 47% (n=223), and 4% (n=17), 27% (n=127), and 70% (n=329), respectively. During the median follow-up of 21 months, neurological events occurred in 8% of patients. In patients with aspirin therapy, neither polymorphism was associated with neurological events. However, in clopidogrel patients, carriers of at least one 34T allele had a 4.02-fold increased adjusted risk for neurological events compared with carriers of only 34C alleles (95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 14.9). Neither polymorphism was associated with all-cause mortality. Conclusions\u2014 In PAD patients, clopidogrel response variability exists, which may result in increased risk for cerebrovascular events. Sequence alterations of the target receptor gene represent one possible mechanism for clopidogrel failure. Whether identification of the 34C>T polymorphism as a contributor to this process could serve as risk stratification tool, an indicator for higher clopidogrel doses, or the use of alternate agents warrants further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Clopidogrel is a pro-drug that requires oxidation to its active metabolite, 2-oxoclopidogrel, by CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes. This active thiol metabolite inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation by blocking the platelet P2Y12 receptor (Figure), resulting in \u224850% reduction in ADP-mediated platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel is standard of care in many patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and those experiencing acute coronary syndromes. However, it has been suggested that response to clopidogrel varies widely with nonresponse rates ranging from 4% to 30% at 24 hours.1,2 Suggested mechanisms for this variability have included under-dosing, drug interactions with CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors,3 and intrinsic interindividual differences resulting from genetic polymorphisms in the pathways of clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. \n\n\n\nClopidogrel metabolism and mechanism of action. Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme family. The CYP3A gene family is located on chromosome 7q21-q22. Genes are shown as block arrows. Select CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms (named according to the Human CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee) are shown with vertical black lines in relation to their position in the genes.

        "abstract": "Clopidogrel is approved for reduction of atherothrombotic events in patients with cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular disease. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel decreases the risk of major adverse cardiac events after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention, compared with aspirin alone. Due to concern about gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who are receiving clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, current guidelines recommend combined use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to decrease the risk of bleeding. Data from previous pharmacological studies have shown that PPIs, which are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome system, may decrease the ADP-induced platelet aggregation of clopidogrel. Results from retrospective cohort studies have shown a higher incidence of major CV events in patients receiving both clopidogrel and PPIs than in those without PPIs. However, other retrospective analyses of randomized clinical trials have not shown that the concomitant PPI administration is associated with increased CV events among clopidogrel users. These controversial results suggest that large specific studies are needed.

        "abstract": "Buchang naoxintong capsule (BNC) is a traditional Chinese medicine approved for the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about the specific protective function or mechanism by which BNC protects against myocardial injury. This research was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of BNC in vitro model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts. BNC intestinal absorption liquid was used in this study instead of drug-containing serum or extracting solution. Our study revealed that BNC preconditioning enhanced antioxidant function by increasing the activities of total-antioxygen capacity, total-superoxide dismutase, and catalase and by decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. BNC preconditioning also activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and inhibited apoptosis-related proteins such as poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. Additionally, preincubation with BNC reduced intracellular Ca2+ concentration, improved mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased the apoptosis rate of H9c2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrated that BNC protects H9c2 cardiomyoblasts from H2O2-induced oxidative injury by increasing antioxidant abilities, activating ERK1/2, and blocking Ca2+-dependent and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Based on our results, the potency of BNC for protecting H9c2 cells from oxidative damage is comparable to that of trimetazidine.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Buchang NaoXinTong (NXT) is a Chinese medicine that has been used for many years for treatment of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in China. Statins substantially reduce hypercholesterolemia and CHD mortality and morbidity. However, there is still a lot of CHD patients who do not respond well to statin therapy. Herein, we report the effects of NXT on atorvastatin-inhibited atherosclerosis and atorvastatin-induced hepatic side effects. After 10 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, apoE-deficient mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and received the following treatment for another 8 weeks: group 1, HFD; group 2, HFD containing NXT; group 3, HFD containing atorvastatin; and group 4, HFD containing both NXT and atorvastatin. After treatment, serum lipid profiles, atherosclerotic lesions, and hepatic lipid content and inflammation were determined. NXT moderately increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, although had little effect on atorvastatin-induced reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Both NXT and atorvastatin reduced en face lesions and sinus lesions of aortic root. In addition, NXT enhanced atorvastatin-induced lesion plaque stability by increasing smooth muscle cell/collagen content and reducing macrophage accumulation and calcification in lesion areas. The co-treatment of NXT and atorvastatin further reduced hepatic triglyceride levels by downregulating acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 while activating hormone-sensitive lipase, adipose triglyceride lipase, and comparative gene identification-58 expression. The AMPK&agr; pathway was also further activated by the co-treatment. More importantly, the liver injuries caused by atorvastatin, such as hepatic inflammation and elevated serum aminotransferase activities, were substantially attenuated by NXT. Therefore, our study demonstrates that NXT enhances atorvastatin-induced plaque stability and ameliorates atorvastatin-induced hepatic side effects.",

In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic acid (RA) and carnosic acid (CA) significantly reduced the contents of liver triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the liver of orotic acid induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related pathways of RO and its main metabolites against lipid disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of fatty acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Naoxintong Capsule (NXT), a Chinese medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in clinic. The present study was designed to clarify the effects of NXT on haemorheology, blood coagulation, hepatic function, antioxidant capacity and inflammatory responses in a rat model of blood stasis syndrome. Rats were placed in ice-cold water for 5\u2009min during the time interval of two adrenaline injections to induce blood circulation disorders after intragastric administration of 10 consecutive days. Blood was collected from abdominal aorta to determine whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (FIB), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonaldehyde (MDA), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), platelet activating factor (PAF). The results showed that NXT could significantly decrease the WBV, PV, FIB and prolong the APTT and PT. Meanwhile, NXT significantly decreased the serum contents of MDA, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, ALT, AST and PAF, while elevating T-AOC and SOD levels. These results indicate that NXT could improve coagulation function, enhance antioxidant capacity and suppress inflammation, which might partly account for its mechanisms of action in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases.",
