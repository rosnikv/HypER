        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension.\n\n\nDESIGN\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.\n\n\nSETTING\nCommunity-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\n--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.",

        "title": "Low diastolic blood pressure and atherosclerosis in elderly subjects. The Rotterdam study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA low diastolic blood pressure has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The following proposed mechanisms underlie this phenomenon: a low diastolic pressure that compromises coronary blood flow, a low diastolic pressure that is due to deteriorating health, and a low diastolic pressure that is a consequence of stiffening of the large arteries. Atherosclerosis may be the link between stiffening of the arteries, a low diastolic pressure, and an increased cardiovascular risk.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo study whether a low diastolic blood pressure in older subjects is a reflection of atherosclerosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Rotterdam (the Netherlands) Study is a population-based follow-up study of 7983 subjects (age, > or = 55 years) who are living in the suburb of Ommoord of Rotterdam. Baseline measurements included ultrasonographic evaluation of the carotid arteries, measurement of blood pressure, and determination of other cardiovascular risk factors. The main cross-sectional analyses were performed among 930 subjects who currently were not using blood pressure-lowering drugs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA J-shaped association of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery with diastolic blood pressure was found with a nadir from 60 to 69 mm Hg. The intima-media thickness was increased in subjects with a diastolic pressure that was less than 60 mm Hg compared with that in subjects with a diastolic pressure that was between 60 and 69 mm Hg (a difference of 0.033 mm [95% confidence limits; 0.001, 0.065]). Beyond a diastolic pressure of 70 mm Hg, a gradual increase in the intima-media thickness was observed. The association was most pronounced among subjects with relatively high pulse pressures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults of the present study indicate the existence of a J-shaped association between carotid atherosclerosis and diastolic pressure. These findings support the hypothesis that in elderly subjects, a low diastolic pressure may be a reflection of widespread atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNoninvasive assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) is widely used in observational studies and trials as an intermediate or proxy end point for cardiovascular disease. However, data showing that IMT predicts cardiovascular disease are limited. We studied whether common carotid IMT is related to future stroke and myocardial infarction.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe used a nested case-control approach among 7983 subjects aged > or =55 years participating in the Rotterdam Study. At baseline (March 1990 through July 1993), ultrasound images of the common carotid artery were stored on videotape. Determination of incident myocardial infarction and stroke was predominantly based on hospital discharge records. Analysis (logistic regression) was based on 98 myocardial infarctions and 95 strokes that were registered before December 31, 1994. IMT was measured from videotape for all case subjects and a sample of 1373 subjects who remained free from myocardial infarction and stroke during follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 years. Results were adjusted for age and sex. Stroke risk increased gradually with increasing IMT. The odds ratio for stroke per standard deviation increase (0.163 mm) was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.82). For myocardial infarction, an odds ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.16 to 1.78) was found. When subjects with a previous myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded, odds ratios were 1.57 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.94) for stroke and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.92) for myocardial infarction. Additional adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors attenuated these associations: 1.34 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.67) and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.58), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study, based on a short follow-up period, provides evidence that an increased common carotid IMT is associated with future cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "Objective. The goal of this study was to compare internal carotid artery (ICA) intima\u2010media thickness (IMT) with common carotid artery (CCA) IMT as global markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. Cross\u2010sectional measurements of the mean CCA IMT and maximum ICA IMT were made on ultrasound images acquired from the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 3316; mean age, 58 years; 52.7% women). Linear regression models were used to study the associations of the Framingham risk factors with CCA and ICA IMT. Multivariate logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to compare the associations of prevalent CVD with CCA and ICA IMT and determine sensitivity and specificity. Results. The association between age and the mean CCA IMT corresponded to an increase of 0.007 mm/y; the increase was 0.037 mm/y for the ICA IMT. Framingham risk factors accounted for 28.6% and 27.5% of the variability in the CCA and ICA IMT, respectively. Age and gender contributed 23.5% to the variability of the CCA IMT and 22.5% to that of the ICA IMT, with the next most important factor being systolic blood pressure (1.9%) for the CCA IMT and smoking (1.6%) for the ICA IMT. The CCA IMT and ICA IMT were statistically significant predictors of prevalent CVD, with the ICA IMT having a larger area under the ROC curve (0.756 versus 0.695). Conclusions. Associations of risk factors with CCA and ICA IMT are slightly different, and both are independently associated with prevalent CVD. Their value for predicting incident cardiovascular events needs to be compared in outcome studies.",

Cardiovascular-disease outcomes were evaluated for an average follow-up of 7.2 years. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were generated for intima-media thickness and risk factors. We evaluated the reclassification of cardiovascular disease on the basis of the 8-year Framingham risk score category (low, intermediate, or high) after adding intima-media thickness values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 296 participants had a cardiovascular event. The risk factors of the Framingham risk score predicted these events, with a C statistic of 0.748 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.719 to 0.776). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease with a 1-SD increase in the mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.24), with a nonsignificant change in the C statistic of 0.003 (95% CI, 0.000 to 0.007); the corresponding hazard ratio for the maximum intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.29), with a modest increase in the C statistic of 0.009 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.016). The net reclassification index increased significantly after addition of intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery (7.6%, P<0.001) but not intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (0.0%, P=0.99). With the presence of plaque, defined as intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery of more than 1.5 mm, the net reclassification index was 7.3% (P=0.01), with an increase in the C statistic of 0.014 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.025).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe maximum internal and mean common carotid-artery intima-media thicknesses both predict cardiovascular outcomes, but only the maximum intima-media thickness of (and presence of plaque in) the internal carotid artery significantly (albeit modestly) improves the classification of risk of cardiovascular disease in the Framingham Offspring Study cohort.

It is unclear whether measurement of mean common CIMT improves 10-year risk prediction of first-time myocardial infarction or stroke in individuals with elevated blood pressure.

In individuals with elevated blood pressure, we compared discrimination and calibration of the 2 models and calculated the net reclassification improvement (NRI).

Currently, diverse machine learning models have been applied to disease prediction and classification. However, most of them tend to focus on the performance of the algorithm and neglect the underlying variables for patients in different carotid atherosclerotic stages. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid machine learning method named Subset Learning (S-learning) to predict and discover the risk factors of these different stages. The S-learning algorithm can elucidate the variables that have significant influence on the outcome of carotid atherosclerotic. Performance comparisons are based on the dataset collected from both Shanghai Renji and Shanghai Huashan Hospital. The result shows that the proposed method has superior classification performance than other classification algorithms. Our findings point to the utility of predictive machine learning and the discovery of risk factors to refine the treatment plans.",
