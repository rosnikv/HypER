        "abstract": "Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Barrett\u2019s esophagus were published by the American College of Gastroenterology in 1998 (1). These and other guidelines undergo periodic review. Significant advances have been made in the area of Barrett\u2019s esophagus over the past several years, leading us to review and revise our previous guidelines statements. These advances have included more information on the natural history of high-grade dysplasia and the chronic use of proton pump inhibitors. These and the original guidelines are intended to apply to all physicians who address Barrett\u2019s and are intended to indicate the preferable, but not only acceptable, approach. Physicians must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables that exist at the moment of the decision. These guidelines are intended to apply to adult patients with the diagnosis of Barrett\u2019s esophagus defined in the guidelines. Both these and the original guidelines were developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. The world literature was reviewed extensively for the original guidelines and was once again reviewed using the National Library of Medicine database. All appropriate studies were reviewed, and any additional studies found in the reference list of these papers were obtained and reviewed. Evidence was evaluated along a hierarchy, with randomized controlled trials given the greatest weight. Abstracts presented at national and international meetings were only used when unique data from ongoing trials were presented. When scientific data were lacking, recommendations were based on expert consensus. During preparation, the guidelines were reviewed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American Society for GI Endoscopy. Recommendations and comments obtained from these reviews were incorporated into the final document whenever possible.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe diagnosis and management of Barrett's esophagus (BE) are controversial. We conducted a critical review of the literature in BE to provide guidance on clinically relevant issues.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multidisciplinary group of 18 participants evaluated the strength and the grade of evidence for 42 statements pertaining to the diagnosis, screening, surveillance, and treatment of BE. Each member anonymously voted to accept or reject statements based on the strength of evidence and his own expert opinion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was strong consensus on most statements for acceptance or rejection. Members rejected statements that screening for BE has been shown to improve mortality from adenocarcinoma or to be cost-effective. Contrary to published clinical guidelines, they did not feel that screening should be recommended for adults over age 50, regardless of age or duration of heartburn. Members were divided on whether surveillance prolongs survival, although the majority agreed that it detects curable neoplasia and can be cost-effective in selected patients. The majority did not feel that acid-reduction therapy reduces the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma but did agree that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are associated with a cancer risk reduction and are of promising (but unproven) value. Participants rejected the notion that mucosal ablation with acid suppression prevents adenocarcinoma in BE but agreed that this may be an appropriate strategy in a subgroup of patients with high-grade dysplasia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on this review of BE, the opinions of workshop members on issues pertaining to screening and surveillance are at variance with published clinical guidelines.",

        "title": "Lactoferrin Deficiency Promotes Colitis-Associated Colorectal Dysplasia in Mice",
        "abstract": "Nonresolving inflammatory processes affect all stages of carcinogenesis. Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family, is involved in the innate immune response and anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor activities. We previously found that lactoferrin is significantly down-regulated in specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and negatively associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and prognosis of patients with NPC. Additionally, lactoferrin expression levels are decreased in colorectal cancer as compared with normal tissue. Lactoferrin levels are also increased in the various phases of inflammation and dysplasia in an azoxymethane\u2013dextran sulfate sodium (AOM-DSS) model of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). We thus hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of lactoferrin may contribute to its anti-tumor activity. Here we generated a new Lactoferrin knockout mouse model in which the mice are fertile, develop normally, and display no gross morphological abnormalities. We then challenged these mice with chemically induced intestinal inflammation to investigate the role of lactoferrin in inflammation and cancer development. Lactoferrin knockout mice demonstrated a great susceptibility to inflammation-induced colorectal dysplasia, and this characteristic may be related to inhibition of NF-\u03baB and AKT/mTOR signaling as well as regulation of cell apoptosis and proliferation. Our results suggest that the protective roles of lactoferrin in colorectal mucosal immunity and inflammation-related malignant transformation, along with a deficiency in certain components of the innate immune system, may lead to serious consequences under conditions of inflammatory insult.",

        "abstract": "The burden of illness from esophageal adenocarcinoma continues to rise in the Western world, and overall prognosis is poor. Given that Barrett's esophagus (BE), a metaplastic change in the esophageal lining is a known cancer precursor, an opportunity to decrease disease development by screening and surveillance might exist. This review examines recent updates in the pathogenesis of BE and comprehensively discusses known risk factors. Diagnostic definitions and challenges are outlined, coupled with an in-depth review of management. Current challenges and potential solutions related to screening and surveillance are discussed. The effectiveness of currently available endoscopic treatment techniques, particularly with regards to recurrence following successful endotherapy and potential chemopreventative agents are also highlighted. The field of BE is rapidly evolving and improved understanding of pathophysiology, combined with emerging methods for screening and surveillance offer hope for future disease burden reduction.",

        "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leads to the accumulation of bile-induced reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in esophageal tissues, causing inflammation and DNA damage. The progression sequence from healthy esophagus to GERD and eventually cancer is associated with a microbiome shift. Lactobacillus species are commensal organisms known for their probiotic and antioxidant characteristics in the healthy esophagus. This prompted us to investigate how Lactobacilli survive in a bile-rich environment during GERD, and to identify their interaction with the bile-injured esophageal cells. To model human reflux conditions, we exposed three Lactobacillus species (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum) to bile. All species were tolerant to bile possibly enabling them to colonize the esophageal epithelium under GERD conditions. Next, we assessed the antioxidant potential of Lactobacilli and role in bile injury repair: we measured bile-induced DNA damage using the ROS marker 8-oxo guanine and COMET assay. Lactobacillus addition after bile injury accelerated repair of bile-induced DNA damage through recruitment of pH2AX/RAD51 and reduced NF\u03baB-associated inflammation in esophageal cells. This study demonstrated anti-genotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of Lactobacilli, making them of significant interest in the prevention of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with GERD.",

        "abstract": "General Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women, with increasing incidence worldwide. Specific Background: Recent research has focused on the role of epigenetic changes in DNA damage, repair mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic effects of probiotics. Probiotics have shown promise in promoting tissue regeneration and DNA repair. Knowledge Gap: However, the precise impact of probiotics on DNA repair in cancer cells, specifically breast cancer cells, remains underexplored. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on DNA damage repair in AMJ13 Iraqi breast cancer cells and assess the cytotoxic effects of probiotics on these cells. Results: Using the comet assay, we found significant increases in DNA damage repair in AMJ13 cells treated with Lactobacillus plantarum (T1) and a combination of eight probiotic strains (T2). Exposure to T1 for 48 hours resulted in significant increases in tail DNA (P\u22640.001), head DNA (P\u22640.001), and tail moment (P<0.001), while T2 showed similar significant increases at 72 hours (P<0.05). Image analysis further supported the DNA repair potential of probiotics, as indicated by a small tail curve for treated cells. Novelty: This study provides novel insights into the therapeutic potential of probiotics in breast cancer treatment by demonstrating their capacity to enhance DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. Implications: The findings suggest that probiotic therapy may be a promising adjunct treatment in breast cancer, offering a new avenue for cancer management through the enhancement of DNA repair and reduction of DNA damage. \nHighlights: \n\u00a0 \n \nProbiotics significantly repaired DNA damage in breast cancer cells. \nT1 and T2 enhanced DNA repair within 48-72 hours. \nProbiotics offer potential as breast cancer adjunct therapy. \n \n\u00a0 \nKeywords: Breast cancer, probiotics, DNA repair, AMJ13 cells, cytotoxicity",
