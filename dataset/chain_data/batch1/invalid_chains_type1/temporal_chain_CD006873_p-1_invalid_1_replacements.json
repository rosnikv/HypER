        "abstract": "Recurrence rate is high after operation for Crohn's disease. A multicenter trial was performed to study the effect of radical or nonradical operation and of sulfasalazine prophylaxis versus placebo on postoperative recurrence rate in 232 patients with Crohn's disease. Sixteen medical and surgical centers participated in the study, 7 operating radically and 9 nonradically. The follow-up period lasted 3 years, the allocation to drug treatment was randomized and double blind. Recurrence was significantly less frequent and occurred later in patients who were operated nonradically. Patients on sulfasalazine prophylaxis had a better prognosis than on placebo. This effect was statistically significant in the first 2 years of treatment. Both strategies were additive: nonradical operation and sulfasalazine had the best prognosis, radical operation and placebo was worst. It is concluded that postoperative recurrence is best prevented by resecting nonradically and prescribing 3 g of sulfasalazine daily at least over 2 years.",

        "abstract": "The choice of medical therapies for Crohn's disease continues to grow. Although our understanding of the mechanisms of the disease is incomplete, increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of inflammation in general and Crohn's disease in particular allows targeting of therapies at various points in the immunoinflammatory cascade. In addition, the division of Crohn's disease into subtypes by location, aggressiveness, and the presence or absence of perianal and fistulizing disease allows the tailoring of medical therapy to the individual patient. For those patients with moderate to severe symptoms or frequent flares of disease activity, and those who have required surgical resection, maintenance therapy can substantially reduce the rate of recurrence. Despite these advances, available medical therapies for Crohn's disease remain imperfect, as evidenced by their sometimes substantial toxicities and the continued frequent need for surgery.",

        "title": "Pharmacokinetics of Mesalazine Pellets in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease",
        "abstract": "Mesalazine is a first-line drug in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and is customarily used to induce and maintain remission in mild to moderate disease. In children, pharmacokinetic data are scarce, and dosage recommendations are largely extrapolated from studies in adults. Aim of the study was to obtain the pharmacokinetic profile of a new mesalazine pellet formulation in children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis. A single oral dose of 20 mg/kg mesalazine was administered to 13 patients (age 6\u201316 years). Serial blood and urine sampling for determination of mesalazine and acetylmesalazine was performed before and during 24 hours following ingestion. Maximum plasma concentration of mesalazine (Cmax) was 1332 ng/mL (geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation [CV]: 0.57), obtained 3.7 hours (tmax; CV: 0.31) after drug administration. Systemic exposure as determined by area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0\u2013\u221e ) was 8712 ng/ml*h (CV: 0.44). Terminal half-life of elimination of mesalazine was 3.5 hours (t1/2; CV: 1.43). This study presents extensive pharmacokinetic data on mesalazine in children with mild-moderately active ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis. In comparison with previous experience in adults, pharmacokinetics of mesalazine administered as pellets appear to be similar in both populations.",

        "abstract": "A randomized, 2\u2010way, crossover study was conducted in 30 volunteers to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of a new once\u2010daily dosing regimen of mesalazine (1 \u00d7 4 g/d) with the current twice\u2010daily dosage (2 \u00d7 2 g/d) used in many European countries. The 2 dosages were administrated orally for 8 days, separated by a 2\u2010week washout. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine were determined on days 1 and 8 by a validated high\u2010performance liquid chromatography method and Cmax, tmax, and AUCs calculated. The bioequivalence was obtained for a 90% confidence interval of the AUC0\u201324h ratio (test/reference) for mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine on days 1 and 8, within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. The bioequivalence was demonstrated on day 1 for mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine and on day 8 for mesalazine. As it is desirable to offer patients a preparation with a less frequent administration to enhance compliance, this once\u2010daily regimen may be an attractive dosing option.",

        "abstract": "5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the standard first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. A variety of 5-ASA delivery systems are available and in development, including both oral and rectal formulations; all of which aim to deliver the active drug to the colon while minimizing systemic absorption. Because the efficacy of most oral 5-ASA therapies is broadly similar, the appropriate selection of a given formulation often relies on other factors. This article explores the differences between oral 5-ASA formulations in terms of their delivery system, reviews the available data on oral 5-ASA treatment efficacy and tolerability, and examines the rationale for changing from one 5-ASA formulation to another if a patient does not respond to, or worsens on, their existing agent.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nIt is not clear what induction dose of mesalamine is optimal for treating patients with mildly and moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of mesalamine 4.8 g/day compared with 2.4 g/day for the treatment of moderately active UC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 6-week, active-control study (ASCEND III) was conducted to assess the noninferiority of delayed-release mesalamine 4.8 g/day (Asacol HD, 800-mg tablet; Procter & Gamble, Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Mason, Ohio) with 2.4 g/day (Asacol, 400-mg tablet; Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc) in 772 patients with moderately active UC. The primary endpoint was treatment success (overall improvement) at week 6, defined as improvement in the Physician's Global Assessment (based on clinical assessments of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and sigmoidoscopy), with no worsening in any individual clinical assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary objective of noninferiority was met. Seventy percent (273 of 389) of patients who received 4.8 g/day of mesalamine achieved treatment success at week 6, compared with 66% (251 of 383) of patients receiving 2.4 g/day (95% confidence interval for 2.4 g/day minus 4.8 g/day, -11.2 to 1.9). In addition, 43% of patients who received 4.8 g/day mesalamine achieved clinical remission at week 6 compared with 35% of patients who received 2.4 g/day (P = .04). A therapeutic advantage for the 4.8 g/day dose was observed among patients previously treated with corticosteroids, oral mesalamines, rectal therapies, or multiple UC medications. Both regimens were well-tolerated with similar adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDelayed-release mesalamine 4.8 g/day (800-mg tablet) is efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with moderately active UC.",

        "abstract": "Background:Ulcerative colitis (UC) substantially reduces patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The current study examined the burden of disease and the impact of daily multimatrix (MMX\u00ae) mesalamine treatment on HRQoL for patients with active or quiescent mild-to-moderate UC. Methods:Data were from a two-phase, multicenter, open-label study with mild-to-moderate UC patients. In the acute phase, 132 patients with active disease received MMX mesalamine 2.4\u20134.8 g/day QD for 8 weeks. In the maintenance phase, 207 patients with quiescent disease received MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day QD for 12 months. The Short Form-12 (version 2) (SF-12v2) measured HRQoL during each phase. Disease burden was examined by comparing acute-phase baseline scores with a U.S. general population sample. Repeated-measures analyses assessed change in SF-12v2 scores for each phase. Correspondence between HRQoL and disease activity was examined through correlations between SF-12v2 scores with patient-reported symptom measures. Results:Baseline SF-12v2 scores for patients with UC were generally much lower than for the general population sample, indicating a broad disease burden. In the acute phase, significant improvement was observed for most SF-12v2 scores at week 8; a comparison with the matched norms showed a complete elimination of burden. No changes in SF-12v2 scores were observed during the maintenance phase. Changes in symptom measures and SF-12v2 scores were moderately correlated. Conclusions:The sizeable burden of active mild-to-moderate UC on HRQoL was eliminated following 8 weeks' treatment with MMX mesalamine 2.4\u20134.8 g/day. HRQoL remained stable over 12 months of maintenance treatment in patients with quiescent UC.",

We assessed the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD) of the pouch and chronic antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at 5 academic referral centers in the United States. Adult patients with endoscopic inflammation of the pouch who received vedolizumab were included. The primary outcome was clinical response at any time point. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response, and remission. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed for the effect of the following variables on clinical response: fistula, onset of pouchitis less than 1 year after IPAA, younger than 35 years old, gender, previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-alpha use, and BMI >30.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-three patients were treated with vedolizumab for inflammation of the pouch between January 2014 and October 2017. Median follow-up was 1.3 years (interquartile range 0.7-2.1). The proportion of patients that achieved at least a clinical response was 71.1%, with 19.3% achieving clinical remission. Of the 74 patients with a follow-up pouchoscopy, the proportion of patients with endoscopic response and mucosal healing was 54.1% and 17.6%, respectively. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms less than 1 year after undergoing IPAA were less likely to respond to vedolizumab, even after controlling for other risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVedolizumab is safe and effective in the management of CD of the pouch and chronic pouchitis. Further studies are needed to compare vedolizumab with other biologic therapies for pouchitis and CD of the pouch.",

Background: Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Those with \u22653 episodes of pouchitis/year and symptoms despite antibiotics are considered to have chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis (CARP). While several agents including probiotics, steroids and immunomodulators have been used, treatment of CARP remains challenging. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the safety and efficacy of various biological agents in treatment of CARP. Methods: Multiple databases were searched through June 2020 for studies that reported the efficacy and safety of biological therapy including antitumor necrosis factor-alpha agents [infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA)], vedolizumab (VDZ), and ustekinumab in CARP. We excluded studies on Crohn\u2019s like and/or other inflammatory complications of the pouch. Meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled rates of clinical as well as endoscopic improvement and remission. Results: We included 15 studies with 311 patients in our final analysis. Ninety-two patients were treated with IFX, 42 with ADA, 144 with VDZ and 33 with ustekinumab. Pooled rate of clinical improvement was 71.4%, 58.2%, 47.9% and clinical remission was 65.7%, 31%, 47.4% with IFX, ADA, and VDZ, respectively.
