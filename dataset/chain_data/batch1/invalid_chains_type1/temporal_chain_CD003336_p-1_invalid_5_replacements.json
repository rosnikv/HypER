        "title": "Warfarin plus Aspirin after Myocardial Infarction or the Acute Coronary Syndrome: Meta-Analysis with Estimates of Risk and Benefit",
        "abstract": "Context Continued thrombin generation persists for several months after acute cardiac events. Contribution Data from 10 randomized trials involving 5938 patients with the acute coronary syndrome who were not stented showed that, compared with aspirin alone, warfarin plus aspirin decreased annual rates of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and revascularization and increased major bleeding rates. In patients with low or average bleeding risks, numbers of cardiovascular events prevented by warfarin plus aspirin exceeded numbers of major bleeding episodes caused by it. Implications Benefits of warfarin plus aspirin may exceed harms in patients with the acute coronary syndrome who are not stented and do not have high bleeding risks. The Editors Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of illness and death in the United States (1). Patients with a history of myocardial infarction are at increased risk for recurrent infarction, stroke, and death (2, 3). Several interventions have proven beneficial in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, including -blockers (4), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (5), lipid-lowering therapy (6), and aspirin (7). In addition, after acute cardiac events, a marked thrombin generation persists for months after clinical stabilization (8), suggesting a role for anticoagulation beyond the initial use of low-molecular-weight heparin (9). Although some studies have shown that addition of warfarin to aspirin decreases subsequent risk for cardiovascular events (10-14), other studies have not (15, 16). In a meta-analysis, Anand and Yusuf (17) suggested that only moderate- to high-intensity anticoagulation, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) more than 2.0, decreased cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone. A large randomized trial conducted in a primary care setting showed that adding warfarin to aspirin decreased combined cardiovascular end points of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death by 29% (12). Despite these findings, warfarin use has not been widely adopted, perhaps because of concern that the increased bleeding risk may counter the cardiovascular benefit (18) or that the benefits are too small to justify the inconvenience (19). The risks and benefits that are probably associated with warfarin therapy are not equally distributed. Patients at the highest risk for recurrent cardiovascular events should derive the most benefit, which may be offset in those with increased bleeding risk. To better quantify the risks and benefits of warfarin therapy for individuals, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials and then calculated the expected benefit for groups at varying risk for cardiovascular disease and bleeding. Methods Study Selection We searched MEDLINE using the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and text words: anticoagulant or anticoagulation or warfarin and aspirin, combined with myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary arteriosclerosis, or coronary artery disease. We limited our search to original, English-language articles published between 1 January 1990 and 1 October 2004; earlier trials were not likely to reflect current standards of care for secondary prevention, including lipid therapy and -blockers. Two reviewers scanned the titles independently for relevant randomized trials. We checked abstracts and then manuscripts of all potentially appropriate references. We included studies if they were randomized, controlled trials of warfarin and aspirin in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. We excluded studies of percutaneous coronary stenting (for which warfarin is generally not considered appropriate therapy) (20) and low-intensity warfarin therapy (target INR < 2.0). We assessed studies for proper randomization, blinding of patients and investigators to treatment allocation, and completeness of follow-up. Data Extraction The 2 reviewers extracted the following data independently: study size and duration; aspirin dose; target INR; and demographic characteristics of trial participants, including age, sex, number of patients with diabetes, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and whether the patient had a Q-wave infarction or received thrombolysis. We evaluated 7 end points: myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, death, minor bleeding, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Each study's authors defined major and minor bleeding, and most studies reported all 7 end points. When results were presented only as combined end points or were ambiguous, we contacted the study authors to obtain primary data. In the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS) study (13), a multicenter, international trial, investigators noted 35 days into the trial that compliance as measured by achievement of target INR was better in some countries than in other countries and designated a subset analysis of countries with good compliance before data collection was complete. We included only the compliant countries in our analysis. We contacted the OASIS authors for select data on compliant countries from OASIS (13) and individual end points from the OASIS pilot study (21), which were published only as combined end points. We contacted the authors of Huynh and colleagues' study (22), because the published results for all end points were incorrect. Statistical Analysis We used Stata, version 8.2 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas), for all analyses. We calculated the rate ratios and 95% CIs for recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding (major or minor) for each study. We used a half-integer correction if no events occurred in 1 group of the study. We pooled rate ratios by using random-effects models that used weighting based on the inverse-variance model according to DerSimonian and Laird (23). We used the MantelHaenszel test to evaluate heterogeneity among trial outcomes. We considered statistical significance at a P value less than 0.05. We performed an influence analysis in which we computed the summary rate ratio, omitting the largest trial (Warfarin, Aspirin, Reinfarction Study [WARIS II] [12]), to assess for any single study dominance in the analysis. We used the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test (24) and the Egger regression asymmetry test (25) to evaluate publication bias. Weighing Risks and Benefits To demonstrate the relative benefits of warfarin plus aspirin for individual patients at different degrees of risk, we calculated the number of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and major bleeding episodes expected to result from aspirin therapy, with or without warfarin, for 9 combinations of cardiovascular and bleeding risk. We calculated events in each risk group taking warfarin plus aspirin by multiplying the rate for the corresponding group of patients taking aspirin by the rate ratio derived from the meta-analysis. The absolute differences between these rates represent the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes prevented by adding warfarin to aspirin. Because the timing of events may be important in treatment decisions, we calculated outcomes at 3 months and 1 year. On the basis of 5059 patients in the Combination Hemotherapy and Mortality Prevention (CHAMP) study (16), we estimated that 51% of myocardial infarctions, 54% of strokes, and 50% of bleeding episodes in the first year after acute myocardial infarction would occur in the first 3 months. Event rates for all 3 outcomes continue to decrease over time. Thus, considering events in the first 2 years after an acute coronary syndrome, approximately 70% of all outcomes occur in the first year. To directly compare event rates across studies of differing duration, we converted all results into first-year rates by using the proportions just described. Cardiovascular Risk Many published instruments are available for determining short- and long-term risk for reinfarction, stroke, and mortality. To demonstrate the clinical usefulness of estimating both cardiovascular and bleeding risk before prescribing warfarin, we chose clinical examples of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. We derived our estimates of the rates for recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke for patients receiving aspirin by using the computed hazard ratios from a large population-based study of 2700 patients surviving hospitalization after a first myocardial infarction and followed for an average of 3.4 years (26). We chose this study for its large size, long follow-up period, emphasis on easily measured clinical predictors, and inclusion of stroke as an outcome. The following variables were associated with increased risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke: age, treated diabetes, chronic congestive heart failure, angina, and serum creatinine level greater than 123.76 mol/L (>1.4 mg/dL). We created examples of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients by applying the hazard ratios for specific risk variables to a baseline risk of 49 per 1000 patient-years of observation. Infarction rates per 1000 patient-years were 40 for a low-risk patient (no risk factors), 82 for a medium-risk patient (for example, diabetes and serum creatinine level >123.76 mol/L [>1.4 mg/dL]), and 188 for a high-risk patient (for example, diabetes and congestive heart failure). Stroke rates for the same patients were 13, 32, and 79, respectively. Other risk stratification tools, based on the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI II) (27), Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico (GISSI) (28), Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT) (29), or Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) (30) studies, produce similar ranges of low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. A detailed calculator based on the GRACE model is available at www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace. Bleeding Risk Several instruments are also available for predicting bleeding risk for patients taking warfarin (31-",

An age- and sex-matched control group with similar disease presentation (unstable or stable symptoms) was selected from the study period. Primary endpoint was defined as the occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 12 months. Warfarin treatment was an independent predictor of both primary endpoint (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0, P = 0.05) and major bleeding (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.3, P = 0.02). Triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was the most common (48%) option in stented patients in warfarin group, and there was a significant (P = 0.004) difference between the drug combinations in stent thrombosis with the highest (15.2%) incidence in patients receiving warfarin plus aspirin combination.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study shows that the prognosis is unsatisfactory in warfarin-treated patients irrespective of the drug combination used.

        "abstract": "The following chapter devoted to antithrombotic therapy for chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the \"Grades of Recommendation\" chapter by Guyatt et al in this supplement, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) we recommend daily oral aspirin (75-100 mg) [Grade 1A]. For patients with an aspirin allergy, we recommend clopidogrel, 75 mg/d (Grade 1A). For patients who have received clopidogrel and are scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, we suggest discontinuing clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery (Grade 2A). For patients after myocardial infarction, after ACS, and those with stable CAD and patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), we recommend daily aspirin (75-100 mg) as indefinite therapy (Grade 1A). We recommend clopidogrel in combination with aspirin for patients experiencing ST-segment elevation (STE) and NSTE-ACS (Grade 1A). For patients with contraindications to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel as monotherapy (Grade 1A). For long-term treatment after PCI in patients who receive antithrombotic agents such as clopidogrel or warfarin, we recommend aspirin (75 to 100 mg/d) [Grade 1B]. For patients who undergo bare metal stent placement, we recommend the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1A). We recommend that patients receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) receive aspirin (325 mg/d for 3 months followed by 75-100 mg/d) and clopidogrel 75 mg/d for a minimum of 12 months (Grade 2B). For primary prevention in patients with moderate risk for a coronary event, we recommend aspirin, 75-100 mg/d, over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist (Grade 1A).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin is a well-established antithrombotic strategy, with hemorrhage being the chief adverse event (AE) of concern. Outside of clinical trials, few published data describe the magnitude and nature of hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo estimate the numbers and rates of emergency department (ED) visits for hemorrhage-related AEs (hemorrhage or evaluation for potential hemorrhage) from DAT in the United States and put them in the context of those from warfarin, we analyzed AEs from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project, 2006-2008, and outpatient prescribing from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2006-2007.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBased on 384 cases, there were an estimated 7654 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3325-11 983) ED visits annually for hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT compared with 2926 cases and an estimated 60 575 (36 117-85 033) ED visits from warfarin. Approximately 60% of ED visits for DAT consisted of epistaxis or other minor hemorrhages (eg, bleeding from small cuts). The risk of hospitalization for ED visits involving acute hemorrhages was not significantly different between DAT and warfarin (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38-1.08). The estimated rate of ED visits involving acute hemorrhages from DAT was 1.2 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits vs 2.5 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits for warfarin (risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings indicate that the acute hemorrhagic risk with DAT is clinically significant and reinforce the importance of practitioners and patients recognizing and anticipating this risk.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe impact of some risk factors for stroke and bleeding, and the value of stroke and bleeding risk scores, in atrial fibrillation (AF), has been debated, as clinical trial cohorts have not adequately tested these. Our objective was to investigate risk factors for stroke and bleeding in AF, and application of the new CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED schemes for stroke and bleeding risk assessments, respectively.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe used the Swedish Atrial Fibrillation cohort study, a nationwide cohort study of 182 678 subjects with a diagnosis of AF at any Swedish hospital between 1 July 2005 and 31 December 2008, who were prospectively followed for an average of 1.5 years (260 000 years at risk). With the use of the National Swedish Drug Registry, all patients who used an oral anticoagulant anytime during follow-up were identified. Most of the analyses were made on a subset of 90 490 patients who never used anticoagulants. Risk factors for stroke, the composite thromboembolism endpoint (stroke, TIA, or systemic embolism), and bleeding, and the performance of published stroke and bleeding risk stratification schemes were investigated. On multivariable analysis, significant associations were found between the following 'new' risk factors and thromboembolic events; peripheral artery disease [hazard ratio (HR) 1.22 (95% CI 1.12-1.32)], 'vascular disease' [HR 1.14 (1.06-1.23)], prior myocardial infarction [HR 1.09 (1.03-1.15)], and female gender [HR 1.17 (1.11-1.22)]. Previous embolic events, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), hypertension, diabetes, and renal failure were other independent predictors of the composite thromboembolism endpoint, while thyroid disease (or hyperthyroidism) was not an independent stroke risk factor. C-statistics for the composite thromboembolic endpoint with the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc schemes were 0.66 (0.65-0.66) and 0.67 (0.67-0.68), respectively. On multivariable analysis, age, prior ischaemic stroke or thromboembolism, prior major bleeding events, and hypertension were significant predictors of ICH and major bleeding. Heart failure, diabetes, renal failure, liver disease, anaemia or platelet/coagulation defect, alcohol abuse, and cancer were other significant predictors for major bleeding, but not ICH. The ability for predicting ICH and major bleeding with both bleeding risk schemes (HEMORR(2)HAGES, HAS-BLED) were similar, with c-statistics of ~0.6.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSeveral independent risk factors (prior ICH, myocardial infarction, vascular disease, and renal failure) predict ischaemic stroke and/or the composite thromboembolism endpoint in AF, but thyroid disease (or hyperthyroidism) was not an independent risk factor for stroke. There is a better performance for CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc over CHADS(2) schemes for the composite thromboembolism endpoint. While both tested bleeding risk schemes have similar predictive value, the HAS-BLED score has the advantage of simplicity.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Current observational studies on warfarin use and the risk for stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing dialysis found conflicting results. Methods and Results\u2014 We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients aged \u226565 years admitted to a hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AF, in Quebec and Ontario, Canada from 1998 to 2007. The AF cohort was grouped into dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and nondialysis patients and into warfarin and no-warfarin users according to the first prescription filled for warfarin within 30 days after AF hospital discharge. We determined the association between warfarin use and the risk for stroke and bleeding in dialysis and nondialysis patients. The cohort comprised 1626 dialysis patients and 204 210 nondialysis patients. Among dialysis patients, 46% (756/1626) patients were prescribed warfarin. Among dialysis patients, warfarin users had more congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus, but fewer prior bleeding events in comparison with the no-warfarin users. Among dialysis patients, warfarin use, in comparison with no-warfarin use, was not associated with a lower risk for stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.78\u20131.67) but was associated with a 44% higher risk for bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.13\u20131.85) after adjusting for potential confounders. Propensity score\u2013adjusted analyses yielded similar results. Conclusions\u2014 Our results suggest that warfarin use is not beneficial in reducing stroke risk, but it is associated with a higher bleeding risk in patients with AF undergoing dialysis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Death in dialysis patients results mainly from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. To our knowledge, no prospective study has compared the rates of mortality or cardiovascular events between patients with and without atrial fibrillation (AF) at the time of dialysis initiation. Methods: This study included 1,516 patients who were initiated into dialysis between October 2011 and August 2013. Rates of mortality and cardiovascular events were compared between patients with and without AF, and between AF patients with and without warfarin (WF) treatment. Results: The study comprised 1,025 men and 491 women with a mean age of 67.5 \u00b1 13.1. Of these patients, 93 had AF, while 1,423 did not; 22.6% of the former group and 9.7% of the latter group died by March 2014 (p < 0.01). Cardiovascular events occurred in 34.4% of patients with AF and 15.1% of patients without (p < 0.01). Even after adjustments for various factors, AF remained an independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.873, 95% CI 1.168-3.002, p < 0.01). It was also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events (HR 1.872, 95% CI 1.262-2.778, p < 0.01). No difference in any parameter was noted between the groups that did and did not receive WF treatment. Conclusion: Patients with AF at the time of dialysis initiation show a poor prognosis and are at high risk of cardiovascular events.

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly occur together, which poses a therapeutic dilemma due to increased risk of both systemic thromboembolism and bleeding. Chronic kidney disease also has implications for medication selection. The objective of this review is to evaluate the options for anticoagulation for thromboembolism prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. We searched PubMed for studies of patients with atrial fibrillation and CKD on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for thromboembolism prevention through January 1 2018, in addition to evaluating major trials evaluating DOACs and warfarin use as well as society guidelines. For patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, primarily observational data supports the use of warfarin, and high quality trial data and meta\u2010analyses support the use and possible superiority of DOACs. For patients with severe chronic kidney disease, there are limited data on warfarin which supports its use, and data for DOACs is limited primarily to pharmacologic studies which support dose reductions but lack information on patient outcomes. For patients with end\u2010stage renal disease, studies on warfarin are conflicting, but the majority suggest a lack of benefit and possible harm; studies in DOACs are very limited, but apixaban is the least renally cleared and may be both safe and effective. In conclusion, warfarin or DOACs may be used based on the degree of severity of chronic kidney disease, but further study in needed in patients with end\u2010stage renal disease.",

        "abstract": "There has been limited evidence reported about the outcomes of oral anticoagulants among patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those with stage V/end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective cohort analysis of five U.S. claims databases evaluated the risk of recurrent VTE, major bleeding (MB), and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB) for apixaban versus warfarin among VTE patients diagnosed with CKD, including ESRD. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance patient characteristics between treatment cohorts. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for recurrent VTE, MB, and CRNMB among patients with CKD who experienced an index VTE. An interaction analysis was conducted to evaluate treatment effects across different stages of CKD. A total of 29,790 VTE patients with CKD were selected for analyses, of whom 10,669 (35.8%) initiated apixaban and 19,121 (64.2%) initiated warfarin. Among IPTW-balanced patient cohorts, the apixaban group had significantly lower risk of recurrent VTE (HR: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66\u20130.92), MB (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.65\u20130.88), and CRNMB (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80\u20130.93) than the warfarin group. When stratified by CKD stage (stage I/II: 8.2%; stage III: 49.4%; stage IV: 12.8%; stage V/ESRD: 12.0%; stage unspecified: 17.6%), no significant interaction was observed for effects of apixaban versus warfarin on recurrent VTE or MB. In summary, apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrent VTE and MB than warfarin among VTE patients with CKD. CKD stages did not have significant impact on treatment effects for recurrent VTE and MB.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Patients with end\u2010stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function. The optimal therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with ESKD is unknown. Objective To compare the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE. Design, Setting and Participants New\u2010user, active\u2010comparator retrospective United States population\u2010based cohort with inverse probability of treatment weighting, using the United States Renal Data System data from 2014 to 2018. We included adults with ESKD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who were newly initiated on apixaban or warfarin for an acute VTE. Main Outcome and Measures The coprimary outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all\u2010cause mortality within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation. Secondary outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. The primary analyses were based on intent\u2010to\u2010treat defined by the first drug received and accounted for competing risks of death. Sensitivity analyses included varied follow\u2010up time, as\u2010treated analyses, and dose\u2010specific apixaban subgroups. Results The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70\u20130.94), intracranial bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48\u20130.98), and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69\u20130.96). Recurrent VTE and all\u2010cause mortality were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of bleeding relative to warfarin when used to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD on dialysis.",

This paper focuses on a specific subgroup of patients, those with end-stage kidney disease, and uses a similar design and outcome measures. The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin in a more specific patient population."

        "title": "The Safety and Effectiveness of Apixaban in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease on Dialysis: A Retrospective Observational Study",
        "abstract": "Background: Apixaban has been increasingly utilized for various FDA-approved indications, including stroke prevention and venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis. However, the safety and efficacy of its use in this population is not well established. Hence, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of apixaban by examining outcomes in this population. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study that involved adults with ESKD who were on hemodialysis and prescribed apixaban from our hospital\u2019s outpatient pharmacy between 1 May 2015, and 31 March 2022. Demographics, apixaban indications, dose appropriateness, concomitant antiplatelet use, and comorbidities data were collected. Bleeding and thromboembolic events were also collected. Results: Sixty-six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 50% of them males. Median age was 71 (63.5\u201382) years, and the median BMI 28.2 (59.5\u201386.25) kg/m2. The median follow-up time was 5 (1.9\u201312.3) months. Concomitant antiplatelet use (39.4%) and high medication adherence (84.8%) were observed. During follow-up, major bleeding events occurred in 15.2% of cases, with minor bleeding being more common (36.4%), and VTE and stroke events occurred in 4.5% of cases; appropriate dosing was prevalent (62.1%), and there was an overall all-cause mortality rate of 34.8%. Most patients received a 2.5 mg BID apixaban dose (56.1%), including both NVAF and VTE groups. Notably, the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that weight, and daily dose were insignificant predictors of bleeding events (p = 0.104, 0.591), however, the BMI was the main independent risk factor for bleeding in this population [OR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8\u20130.99; p = 0.023]. Conclusions: Our analysis of apixaban-treated ESKD patients highlights that the risk of bleeding is significant, and BMI was the main independent risk factor. A larger prospective study is needed to confirm our findings.",
