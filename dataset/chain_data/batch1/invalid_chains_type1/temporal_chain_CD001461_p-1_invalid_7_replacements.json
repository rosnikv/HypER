        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy.

        "title": "Superantigens in Autoimmune Diseases: Still More Shades of Gray",
        "abstract": "Superantigens (SAgs) have the capacity of stimulating T cells polyclonally. The only requirement for T cells to respond is the expression of particular T-cell receptor (TCR) VP elements (Fleischer & Schrezemeier 1988, MacDonald et al. 1988, White et al. 1989). Any SAg can, therefore, stimulate between 1% and 40% ofthe total T-cell repertoire, with a wide range of peptide specificities. SAgs have the capacity of binding tightly to MHC class II molecules and are, because of the restricted distribution of these molecules, presented mostly by classical antigenpresenting cells (Held et al. 1994, MacDonald et al. 1993). They are produced by bacteria {Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia and Mycoplasma) as exotoxins, by viruses (rabies and cytomegalovirus) as components of the viral particle and by retroviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV) where they are produced after integration of the reverse transcribed genome into the host DNA (AchaOrbea & MacDonald, 1995). Autoreactivity in the absence of autoimmunity is more the rule than the exception. Autoreactive T and B cells can be easily isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals (He et al. 1993, Hohlfeld et al. 1984, Wucherpfennig et al. 1991). In experimental animals, autoimmunity can be induced by injection of autoantigens or can occur spontaneously in certain strains (see below). The discovery of SAgs immediately raised attractive models for the induction of autoimmunity, since the polyclonal activation of T and B cells by SAgs does not distinguish between autoimmune and normal lymphocytes. This activation might break the delicate balance of tolerance. After SAg encounter, a polyclonal activation of T cells occurs, which is usually",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

MTB and MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibit class II MHC (MHC-II) expression and Ag processing by a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent mechanism that is shown in this study to involve a defect in IFN-\u03b3 induction of class II transactivator (CIITA). Exposure of macrophages to MTB or MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced MHC-II expression, but not IL-4-induced MHC-II expression, by preventing induction of mRNA for CIITA (total, type I, and type IV), IFN regulatory factor-1, and MHC-II.

MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit translocation of phosphorylated Stat1 to the nucleus or Stat1 binding to and transactivation of IFN-\u03b3-sensitive promoter constructs. Thus, MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3 signaling independent of SOCS1 and without interfering with the activation of Stat1.

        "abstract": "From early on in evolution, organisms have had to protect themselves from pathogens. Mechanisms for discriminating \"self\" from \"non-self\" evolved to accomplish this task, launching a long history of host-pathogen co-evolution. Evolution of mechanisms of immune defense has resulted in a variety of strategies. Even unicellular organisms have rich arsenals of mechanisms for protection, such as restriction endonucleases, antimicrobial peptides, and RNA interference. In multicellular organisms, specialized immune cells have evolved, capable of recognition, phagocytosis, and killing of foreign cells as well as removing their own cells changed by damage, senescence, infection, or cancer. Additional humoral factors, such as the complement cascade, have developed that co-operate with cellular immunity in fighting infection and maintaining homeostasis. Defensive mechanisms based on germline-encoded receptors constitute a system known as innate immunity. In jaw vertebrates, this system is supplemented with a second system, adaptive immunity, which in contrast to innate immunity is based on diversification of immune receptors and on immunological memory in each individual.Usually, each newly evolved defense mechanism did not replace the previous one, but supplemented it, resulting in a layered structure of the immune system. The immune system is not one system but rather a sophisticated network of various defensive mechanisms operating on different levels, ranging from mechanisms common for every cell in the body to specialized immune cells and responses at the level of the whole organism. Adaptive changes in pathogens have shaped the evolution of the immune system at all levels.",

        "abstract": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 is a critical negative regulator of cytokine signaling and is induced by Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Gue\u0301rin (M. bovis BCG) in mouse macrophages. However, little is known about the early receptor proximal signaling mechanisms underlying mycobacteria-mediated induction of SOCS3. We demonstrate here for the first time that M. bovis BCG up-regulates NOTCH1 and activates the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, leading to the expression of SOCS3. We show that perturbing Notch signaling in infected macrophages results in the marked reduction in the expression of SOCS3. Furthermore, enforced expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in RAW 264.7 macrophages induces the expression of SOCS3, which can be further potentiated by M. bovis BCG. The perturbation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling resulted in marked reduction in SOCS3 levels and expression of the NOTCH1 target gene, Hes1. The down-regulation of MyD88 resulted in a significant decrease in SOCS3 expression, implicating the role of the TLR2-MyD88 axis in M. bovis BCG-triggered signaling. However, the SOCS3 inducing ability of M. bovis BCG remains unaltered also upon infection of macrophages from TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice. More importantly, signaling perturbation data suggest the involvement of cross-talk among members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades with NOTCH1 signaling in SOCS3 expression. Furthermore, SOCS3 expression requires the NOTCH1-mediated recruitment of Suppressor of Hairless (CSL) and nuclear factor-\u03baBtothe Socs3 promoter. Overall, these results implicate NOTCH1 signaling during inducible expression of SOCS3 following infection of macrophages with an intracellular bacillus-like M. bovis BCG.",

        "abstract": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are found to be accompanied with innate immunity dysregulation including abnormally macrophage activation. But the functional polarization of the activated macrophages and its underlying molecular mechanism during the pathogenesis of SLE remains unknown. As an important local cellular interaction mechanism responsible for cell fate determination, Notch signaling is reported to exert crucial functions in the development and differentiation of various immunocytes, whereas its role in macrophage polarization is not fully understood. In this study, in the SLE murine model generated by immunization with activated lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA), infiltrated macrophages in the nephritic tissues were found to exhibit activation and M2b functional polarization. Notch1 signaling activity was significantly upregulated in the ALD-DNA\u2013induced M2b macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ALD-DNA\u2013induced M2b polarization was found to be dependent on enhanced Notch1 signaling through accelerating NF-\u03baB p50 translocation into the nucleus mediated by PI3K and MAPK pathways. Moreover, blockade of Notch1 signaling with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor treatment before or after the disease initiation could ameliorate murine lupus through impeding macrophage M2b polarization. Our results implied that Notch1 signaling-dependent macrophage M2b polarization might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE, which could provide Notch1 signaling blockade as a potential therapeutic approach for SLE disease.",

In this study, we determined the molecular and functional roles of LHBs during HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. LHBs increased tumor formation of hepatoma cells. Moreover, expression of LHBs but not other HBV envelope glycoproteins specifically promoted proliferation of hepatoma and hepatic cells in vitro. Mechanistic investigations revealed that these effects were caused by activation of the Src/PI3K/Akt pathway through proximal stimulation of PKCa/Raf1 signaling by LHBs. Proliferation induced by stable LHBs expression was associated with increased G1\u2013S cell-cycle progression and apoptosis resistance mediated by Src kinase activation, as established in hepatocellular carcinoma clinical specimens. Importantly, LHBs-induced cellular proliferation and tumor formation were reversed by administration of the Src inhibitor saracatinib. Together, our findings suggest that LHBs promotes tumorigenesis of hepatoma cells by triggering a PKCa/Raf1 to Src/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, revealing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of HBVassociated hepatocarcinogenesis.

        "title": "DNA-dependent Activator of Interferon-regulatory Factors (DAI) Promotes Lupus Nephritis by Activating the Calcium Pathway*",
        "abstract": "Background: Macrophage M2b polarization conferred by self-DNA immunization initiates and propagates lupus nephritis. Results: Knockdown of DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) ameliorates SLE syndrome via blunting macrophage M2b polarization. Conclusion: DAI functions as a DNA sensor in self-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization and lupus nephritis. Significance: We disclose the mechanism by which self-DNA induces macrophage M2b polarization and lupus nephritis. DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) functions as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that activates the innate immune system. We previously found that activated lymphocyte-derived self-apoptotic DNA (ALD-DNA) immunization led to pathological macrophage activation and M2b polarization, which could initiate and propagate murine lupus nephritis. However, the specific DNA sensor(s) as well as underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease remains unknown. In this study, we reported that DAI expression was significantly increased in SLE patients as well as in lupus mice. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that DAI was involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage activation and M2b polarization. Moreover, ALD-DNA notably induced dimerization/oligomerization of DAI and consequently activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathways via calcium signaling, resulting in macrophage activation and M2b polarization. More importantly, blockade of DAI in vivo or selective knockdown of DAI in macrophages could ameliorate SLE syndrome via blunting macrophage M2b polarization and inhibiting inflammatory response in lupus mice. Our results suggest that DAI could function as a DNA sensor and a regulator in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization and lupus nephritis, providing the possible molecular mechanisms involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization in SLE disease and making DAI as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SLE.",

        "title": "HMGB1 Promotes Systemic Lupus Erythematosus by Enhancing Macrophage Inflammatory Response",
        "abstract": "Background/Purpose. HMGB1, which may act as a proinflammatory mediator, has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the precise mechanism of HMGB1 in the pathogenic process of SLE remains obscure. Method. The expression of HMGB1 was measured by ELISA and western blot. The ELISA was also applied to detect proinflammatory cytokines levels. Furthermore, nephritic pathology was evaluated by H&E staining of renal tissues. Results. In this study, we found that HMGB1 levels were significantly increased and correlated with SLE disease activity in both clinical patients and murine model. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function analysis showed that HMGB1 exacerbated the severity of SLE. Of note, the HMGB1 levels were found to be associated with the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in SLE patients. Further study demonstrated that increased HMGB1 expression deteriorated the severity of SLE via enhancing macrophage inflammatory response. Moreover, we found that receptor of advanced glycation end products played a critical role in HMGB1-mediated macrophage inflammatory response. Conclusion. These findings suggested that HMGB1 might be a risk factor for SLE, and manipulation of HMGB1 signaling might provide a therapeutic strategy for SLE.",

        "abstract": "A healthy immune system results from a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that allow effective responses to acute insults, without descending into chronic inflammation. Failed homeostasis is characteristic of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Although HMGB1 induces proinflammatory M1-like macrophage differentiation, we describe a mechanism by which C1q modulates this activity and collaborates with HMGB1 to induce the differentiation of monocytes to anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages. These anti-inflammatory macrophages are unresponsive to dendritic cell induction factors, effectively removing them from participation in an adaptive immune response. This pathway is mediated through a complex with RAGE and LAIR-1 and depends on relative levels of C1q and HMGB1. Importantly, these data provide insight into a homeostatic mechanism in which C1q and HMGB1 can cooperate to terminate inflammation, and which may be impaired in C1q-deficient patients with autoimmune disease.",

        "title": "High-Mobility Group Box 1-Induced Complement Activation Causes Sterile Inflammation",
        "abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a well-known danger-associated molecular pattern molecule, acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule when secreted by activated immune cells or released after necrotic cell damage. HMGB1 binds to immunogenic bacterial components and augments septic inflammation. In this study, we show how HMGB1 mediates complement activation, promoting sterile inflammation. We show that HMGB1 activates the classical pathway of complement system in an antibody-independent manner after binding to C1q. The C3a complement activation product in human plasma and C5b-9 membrane attack complexes on cell membrane surface are detected after the addition of HMGB1. In an acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity model, APAP injection reduced HMGB1 levels and elevated C3 levels in C1q-deficient mouse serum samples, compared to that in wild-type (WT) mice. APAP-induced C3 consumption was inhibited by sRAGE treatment in WT mice. Moreover, in a mouse model of brain ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury based on middle cerebral arterial occlusion, C5b-9 complexes were deposited on vessels where HMGB1 was accumulated, an effect that was suppressed upon HMGB1 neutralization. We propose that the HMGB1 released after cell necrosis and in ischemic condition can trigger the classical pathway of complement activation to exacerbate sterile inflammation.",

        "title": "Apolipoprotein E Triggers Complement Activation in Joint Synovial Fluid of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients by Binding C1q",
        "abstract": "Key Points ApoE was found in complex with C4d in RA patient SF. Deposited ApoE activates complement whereas ApoE in solution is inhibitory. Posttranslational modifications alter ApoE's capacity to bind FH and C4BP. We identified apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as one of the proteins that are found in complex with complement component C4d in pooled synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Immobilized human ApoE activated both the classical and the alternative complement pathways. In contrast, ApoE in solution demonstrated an isoform-dependent inhibition of hemolysis and complement deposition at the level of sC5b-9. Using electron microscopy imaging, we confirmed that ApoE interacts differently with C1q depending on its context; surface-bound ApoE predominantly bound C1q globular heads, whereas ApoE in a solution favored the hinge/stalk region of C1q. As a model for the lipidated state of ApoE in lipoprotein particles, we incorporated ApoE into phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes and found that the presence of ApoE on liposomes increased deposition of C1q and C4b from serum when analyzed using flow cytometry. In addition, posttranslational modifications associated with RA, such as citrullination and oxidation, reduced C4b deposition, whereas carbamylation enhanced C4b deposition on immobilized ApoE. Posttranslational modification of ApoE did not alter C1q interaction but affected binding of complement inhibitors factor H and C4b-binding protein. This suggests that changed ability of C4b to deposit on modified ApoE may play an important role. Our data show that posttranslational modifications of ApoE alter its interactions with complement. Moreover, ApoE may play different roles in the body depending on its solubility, and in diseased states such as RA, deposited ApoE may induce local complement activation rather than exert its typical role of inhibition.",

In the body, interactions of liposomes are mediated by the layer of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface, the protein corona. The review aims to collect the data of the last decade on liposome protein corona, tracing the path from interactions of individual proteins to the effects mediated by the protein corona in vivo. It offers a classification of the approaches to exploitation of the protein corona-rather than elimination thereof-based on the bilayer composition-corona composition-molecular interactions-biological performance framework. The multitude of factors that affect each level of this relationship urge to the widest implementation of bioinformatics tools to predict the most effective liposome compositions relying on the data on protein corona. Supplementing the picture with new pieces of accurately reported experimental data will contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of the predictions.",

Yet, the verdict is still out on the definitive role of P. copri in human health, and on the effect of different diets on its relative abundance in the gut microbiome. The puzzling discrepancies among P. copri studies have only recently been attributed to the diversity of its strains, which substantially differ in their encoded metabolic patterns from the commonly used reference strain. However, such strain differences cannot be resolved by common 16S rRNA amplicon profiling methods. Here, we scrutinize P. copri, its versatile metabolic potential, and the hypotheses behind the conflicting observations on its association with diet and human health. We also provide suggestions for designing studies and bioinformatics pipelines to better research P. copri.",

In this study, the intricate dynamics of Prevotella spp. in the human gut microbiota was investigated, based on the metagenomic method. First, 239 fecal samples from individuals across four regions of China revealed a bimodal distribution, highlighting the abundance and variability in Prevotella spp. within the Chinese population. Second, the longitudinal cohort study included 184 fecal samples from 52 time points collected from seven individuals who demonstrated either the outbreaks or disappearances of Prevotella spp., emphasizing the transient nature of Prevotella abundance levels and suggesting shifts in Prevotella \u201centerotypes.\u201d Furthermore, a turnover of the dominant Prevotella spp. was observed, indicating the potential presence of diverse subtypes of Prevotella enterotype. Notably, the genomic analysis demonstrated the persistence of specific Prevotella strains within individuals over extended periods, highlighting the enduring presence of Prevotella in the human gut. In conclusion, by integrating the temporal and geographical scales in our research, we gained deeper insights into the dynamics of Prevotella, emphasizing the importance of considering the dynamics at the time and species level in gut microbiota studies and their implications on human health.",
