        "abstract": "Periodontal disease is a common infection-induced inflammatory disease among individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of treatment of periodontal disease on the level of metabolic control of diabetes. A total of 113 Native Americans (81 females and 32 males) suffering from periodontal disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were randomized into 5 treatment groups. Periodontal treatment included ultrasonic scaling and curettage combined with one of the following antimicrobial regimens: 1) topical water and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 2) topical 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 3) topical povidone-iodine and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 4) topical 0.12% CHX and placebo; and 5) topical water and placebo (control group). Assessments were performed prior to and at 3 and 6 months after treatment and included probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque and determination of serum glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). After treatment all study groups showed clinical and microbial improvement. The doxycycline-treated groups showed the greatest reduction in probing depth and subgingival Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to the control group. In addition, all 3 groups receiving systemic doxycycline showed, at 3 months, significant reductions (P < or = 0.04) in mean HbA1c reaching nearly 10% from the pretreatment value. Effective treatment of periodontal infection and reduction of periodontal inflammation is associated with a reduction in level of glycated hemoglobin. Control of periodontal infections should thus be an important part of the overall management of diabetes mellitus patients.",

        "abstract": "Severe periodontal disease often coexists with severe diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a risk factor for severe periodontal disease. A model is presented whereby severe periodontal disease increases the severity of diabetes mellitus and complicates metabolic control. We propose that an infection-mediated upregulation cycle of cytokine synthesis and secretion by chronic stimulus from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and products of periodontopathic organisms may amplify the magnitude of the advanced glycation end product (AGE)-mediated cytokine response operative in diabetes mellitus. In this model, the combination of these 2 pathways, infection and AGE-mediated cytokine upregulation, helps explain the increase in tissue destruction seen in diabetic periodontitis, and how periodontal infection may complicate the severity of diabetes and the degree of metabolic control, resulting in a 2-way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease/infection. This proposed dual pathway of tissue destruction suggests that control of chronic periodontal infection is essential for achieving long-term control of diabetes mellitus. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that elimination of periodontal infection by using systemic antibiotics improves metabolic control of diabetes, defined by reduction in glycated hemoglobin or reduction in insulin requirements.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis has been linked to clinical cardiovascular disease but not to subclinical atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether periodontitis is associated with carotid artery intima-media wall thickness (IMT). Cross-sectional data on 6017 persons aged 52 to 75 years were obtained from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study 1996 to 1998 examination. The dependent variable was carotid IMT \u22651 mm. Periodontitis was defined by extent of attachment loss \u22653 mm: none/mild (<10%), moderate (10% to <30%), or severe (\u226530%). Covariates included age, sex, diabetes, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, smoking, waist-hip ratio, education, and race/study center. Odds of IMT \u22651 mm were higher for severe periodontitis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.53) and moderate periodontitis (OR 1.40, CI 1.17 to 1.67) compared with no periodontitis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, severe periodontitis (OR 1.31, CI 1.03 to 1.66) was associated with IMT \u22651 mm, while adjusting for the other factors in the model. These results provide the first indication that periodontitis may play a role in the pathogenesis of atheroma formation, as well as in cardiovascular events.",

        "title": "Systemic Effects of Periodontitis: Epidemiology of Periodontal Disease and Cardiovascular Disease.",
        "abstract": "There have been 42 published studies describing associations between oral conditions and cardiovascular diseases. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, the 16 longitudinal studies represent the highest level of evidence available. However, two databases produced eight of the 16 studies. There also is extensive variability in definitions of the oral exposure that include salivary flow, reported periodontal disease, number of teeth, oral organisms, antibodies to oral organisms, Total Dental Index, Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs, plaque scores, probing depth, attachment loss, and bone level. Variability also exists in the cardiovascular outcomes that include atherosclerosis measures and events, such as hospitalization for coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic CHD, fatal CHD, total stroke, ischemic stroke, and revascularization procedures. One of the criticisms of this research is that the exposure has not been represented by measures of infection. To begin to address this concern, we present new data showing that patterns of high and low levels of eight periodontal pathogens and antibody levels against those organisms are related to clinical periodontal disease as well as other characteristics of the individuals, such as age, race, gender, diabetic status, atherosclerosis, and CHD. As others before us, we conclude that the cumulative evidence presented above supports, but does not prove, a causal association between periodontal infection and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or its sequelae. A number of legitimate concerns have arisen about the nature of the relationship and, indeed, the appropriate definitions for periodontal disease when it is thought to be an exposure for systemic diseases. There is still much work needed to identify which aspects of the exposure are related to which aspects of the outcome. Principal component analyses illustrate the complexity of the interactions among risk factors, exposures, and outcomes. These analyses provide an initial clustering that describes and suggests the presence of specific syndromes.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular and periodontal diseases are common inflammatory conditions in the human population. In atherogenesis, inflammation plays a continuous role from endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules to the development of the fatty streak, established plaque, and finally plaque rupture. Exposures to infections like periodontal disease have been postulated to perpetuate inflammatory events in atherogenesis. Recent observational studies and meta-analyses continue to demonstrate a modest but statistically significant increased risk for cardiovascular disease among persons exposed to periodontal disease or infection. Experiments with animal models further indicate that periodontal infection can increase atherosclerosis in the presence or absence of hypercholesterolemia. While the available pilot data in patients suggest that periodontal interventions can improve surrogate serum biomarkers and vascular responses associated with cardiovascular disease, the effect of these interventions on true outcomes of cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and stroke is presently unknown. Nevertheless, clinicians and patients should be aware of the consistent association between cardiovascular and periodontal diseases along with the potential preventive benefits of periodontal interventions.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Periodontitis patients are known to suffer from endotoxemia, which may be among the major risk factors for atherosclerosis. In health, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mainly carried with high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Shift of LPS toward lipoproteins with lower densities may result in less effective endotoxin scavenging. Our aim was to determine plasma LPS activity and lipoprotein-distribution before and after treatment in periodontitis patients. Patients and Methods: Very low and intermediate density (VLDL-IDL), low density (LDL), HDL 2, HDL3, and lipoprotein-deficient plasma (LPDP) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Patients included 34 subjects aged 53.5 \u00b1 8.3 years, before and 6 months after periodontal treatment. Results: The mean LPS distribution decreased among lipoprotein classes as follows: VLDL-IDL 41.3 \u00b1 12.1%, LPDP 25.0 \u00b1 7.0%, HDL3 13.1 \u00b1 5.2%, LDL 11.5 \u00b1 3.7%, and HDL2 9.2 \u00b1 2.8%. Plasma and VLDL-IDL-associated LPS correlated positively, and LDL- and HDL-associated LPS negatively with clinical periodontal parameters and plasma cytokine concentrations. Mean plasma LPS activity increased after periodontal treatment from 44.0 \u00b1 17.0 to 55.7 \u00b1 24.2 EU/ml (P = 0.006). No significant changes were found in LPS lipoprotein distribution and lipoprotein compositions after the treatment. Conclusions: Endotoxemia increases with severity of periodontitis. In periodontitis, LPS associates preferentially with the pro-atherogenic VLDL-IDL fraction. Periodontal treatment has only minor effects on plasma LPS activity or distribution, which reflects persistence of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is an important determinant of inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions. It has also been documented that certain chronic infectious diseases, such as periodontitis and chlamydial infection, exacerbate clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. In addition, low-level but persistent metabolic endotoxemia is often found in diabetic and obese subjects and is induced in mice fed a high-fat diet. Objective: In this study, we examined cooperative macrophage activation by low levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by minimally oxidized LDL (mmLDL), as a model for subclinical endotoxemia-complicated atherosclerosis. Methods and Results: We found that both in vitro and in vivo, mmLDL and LPS (Kdo2-LipidA) cooperatively activated macrophages to express proinflammatory cytokines Cxcl2 (MIP-2), Ccl3 (MIP-1&agr;), and Ccl4 (MIP-1&bgr;). Importantly, the mmLDL and LPS cooperative effects were evident at a threshold LPS concentration (1 ng/mL) at which LPS alone induced only a limited macrophage response. Analyzing microarray data with a de novo motif discovery algorithm, we found that genes transcribed by promoters containing an activator protein (AP)-1 binding site were significantly upregulated by costimulation with mmLDL and LPS. In a nuclear factor\u2013DNA binding assay, the cooperative effect of mmLDL and LPS costimulation on c-Jun and c-Fos DNA binding, but not on p65 or p50, was dependent on mmLDL-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In addition, mmLDL induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent derepression of AP-1 by removing nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) from the chemokine promoters. Conclusions: The cooperative engagement of AP-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-&kgr;B by mmLDL and LPS may constitute a mechanism of increased transcription of inflammatory cytokines within atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "abstract": "Vascular calcification contributes to the high risk of cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Dysregulation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) metabolism is common in CKD patients and drives vascular calcification. In this article, we review the physiological regulatory mechanisms for Ca and P homeostasis and the basis for their dysregulation in CKD. In addition, we highlight recent findings indicating that elevated Ca and P have direct effects on VSMCs that promote vascular calcification, including stimulation of osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation, vesicle release, apoptosis, loss of inhibitors, and extracellular matrix degradation. These studies suggest a major role for elevated P in promoting osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation of VSMC, whereas elevated Ca has a predominant role in promoting VSMC apoptosis and vesicle release. Furthermore, the effects of elevated Ca and P are synergistic, providing a major stimulus for vascular calcification in CKD. Unraveling the complex regulatory pathways that mediate the effects of both Ca and P on VSMCs will ultimately provide novel targets and therapies to limit the destructive effects of vascular calcification in CKD patients.

        "abstract": "NLRP3 is the most crucial member of the NLR family, as it detects the existence of pathogen invasion and self\u2010derived molecules associated with cellular damage. Several studies have reported that excessive NLRP3 inflammasome\u2010mediated caspase\u20101 activation is a key factor in the development of diseases. Recent studies have reported that Syk is involved in pathogen\u2010induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation; however, the detailed mechanism linking Syk to NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Syk mediates NLRP3 stimuli\u2010induced processing of procaspase\u20101 and the consequent activation of caspase\u20101. Moreover, the kinase activity of Syk is required to potentiate caspase\u20101 activation in a reconstituted NLRP3 inflammasome system in HEK293T cells. The adaptor protein ASC bridges NLRP3 with the effector protein caspase\u20101. Herein, we find that Syk can associate directly with ASC and NLRP3 by its kinase domain but interact indirectly with procaspase\u20101. Syk can phosphorylate ASC at Y146 and Y187 residues, and the phosphorylation of both residues is critical to enhance ASC oligomerization and the recruitment of procaspase\u20101. Together, our results reveal a new molecular pathway through which Syk promotes NLRP3 inflammasome formation, resulting from the phosphorylation of ASC. Thus, the control of Syk activity might be effective to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and treat NLRP3\u2010related immune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of Leishmaniasis, a disease that can be lethal and affects 12 million people worldwide. Leishmania replicates intracellularly in macrophages, a process that is essential for disease progression. Although the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accounts for restriction of parasite replication, Leishmania is known to induce ROS upon macrophage infection. We have recently demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in infected macrophages, a process that is important for the outcome of infection. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for inflammasome activation are unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that ROS induced via NADPH oxidase during the early stages of L. amazonensis infection is critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. We identified that ROS production during L. amazonensis infection occurs upon engagement of Dectin-1, a C-type lectin receptor that signals via spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) to induce ROS. Accordingly, inflammasome activation in response to L. amazonensis is impaired by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, Syk, focal adhesion kinase, and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, and in the absence of Dectin-1. Experiments performed with Clec7a\u2212/\u2212 mice support the critical role of Dectin-1 for inflammasome activation, restriction of parasite replication in macrophages, and mouse resistance to L. amazonensis infection in vivo. Thus, we reported that activation of the Dectin-1/Syk/ROS/NLRP3 pathway during L. amazonensis phagocytosis is important for macrophage restriction of the parasite replication and effectively accounts for host resistance to Leishmania infection.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage immunometabolism, the changes in intracellular metabolic pathways that alter the function of these highly plastic cells, has been the subject of intense interest in the past few years, in part because macrophage immunometabolism plays important roles in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. In this review article, part of the Compendium on Atherosclerosis, we introduce the concepts of (1) intracellular immunometabolism-the canonical pathways of intrinsic cell activation leading to changes in intracellular metabolism, which in turn alter cellular function; and (2) intercellular immunometabolism-conditions in which intermediates of cellular metabolism are transferred from one cell to another, thereby altering the function of the recipient cell. The recent discovery that the metabolite cargo of dead and dying cells ingested through efferocytosis by macrophages can alter metabolic pathways and downstream function of the efferocyte is markedly changing the way we think about macrophage immunometabolism. Metabolic transitions of macrophages contribute to their functions in all stages of atherosclerosis, from lesion initiation to formation of advanced lesions characterized by necrotic cores, to lesion regression following aggressive lipid lowering. This review article discusses recent advances in our understanding of these different aspects of macrophage immunometabolism in atherosclerosis. With the increasing understanding of the roles of macrophage immunometabolism in atherosclerosis, new exciting concepts and potential targets for intervention are emerging.",

An automatic biochemical analyser was used to measure blood glucose, blood lipids, kidney function, MDA, and other indicators; radioimmunoassay was used to assess serum insulin; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1; HE, PAS, and Masson staining were used to observe kidney pathological tissue morphology; western blot and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR were used to assess protein and mRNA expression of molecules, such as Nrf2, NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD; and TUNEL staining was used to detect DNA damage. SPSS statistical software was used for the data analysis. Results The kidney tissues of golden hamsters in the control group were normal; Nrf2 was highly expressed, serum MDA level was low, NLRP3 expression in kidney tissue was not obvious, Caspase-1 and GSDMD were weakly expressed, and only a few TUNEL-positive cells were observed. Compared with the control group, the golden hamsters in the model group had obvious renal pathological damage; blood glucose, blood lipids, renal function-related indexes, insulin, and inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1 were increased (P < 0.05); NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD expression was increased; Nrf2 expression was decreased; MDA level was increased (P < 0.05); and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was increased. Compared with the model group, the pathological morphology of the kidney tissue of golden hamsters in the three treatment groups was significantly improved; blood glucose, blood lipids, renal function, and the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were reduced (P < 0.05); NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, and other molecular proteins and mRNA expression were decreased; Nrf2 expression was increased; MDA level was decreased (P < 0.05); and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was decreased. Conclusion DN golden hamster kidney NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD signalling was enhanced. BBR can reduce oxidative stress damage by regulating antioxidative Nrf2 and then regulating NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD signalling to inhibit pyroptosis, antagonizing DN inflammation-induced damage.",

        "explanation": "This paper is related to the source paper as it also investigates diabetic nephropathy and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the source paper's findings, as it explores a different compound (berberine) that also targets the NLRP3 pathway."

        "abstract": "The previous meta\u2010analysis showed an advantageous effect of berberine supplementation on interleukin 6 (IL\u20106), tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), and serum C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) concentrations; however, it is unknown the dosage that this component influences inflammatory biomarkers. A comprehensive search was done in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science until September 2022 to find randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed the effects of berberine/barberry on IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and CRP in adults but not trials without a control group. Studies bias was assessed using RoB 2. A random\u2010effects model was performed to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD). A dose\u2010dependent effect was calculated. Eighteen clinical trials with 1600 participants were included in the current meta\u2010analysis. These interventions significantly mitigate IL\u20106 levels (\u22121.18\u2009pg/mL), TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (\u22123.72\u2009pg/mL), and CRP levels (\u22121.33\u2009mg/L). In addition, the non\u2010linear analysis showed a significant lowering effect of berberine/barberry on IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels in doses <1000\u2009mg/day and less than 5\u2009weeks of intervention. There are limitations to our findings, including low\u2010quality studies and significant heterogeneity. These interventions might be considered adjunct therapy to managing inflammation status. However, more investigation and high\u2010quality evidence must be conducted to obtain more comprehensive and generalizable results.",

        "title": "Roles of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Diabetic Kidney Disease: New Perspectives from Mechanism to Therapy",
        "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes and the main cause of end-stage renal disease around the world. Mitochondria are the main organelles responsible for producing energy in cells and are closely involved in maintaining normal organ function. Studies have found that a high-sugar environment can damage glomeruli and tubules and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. Meanwhile, animal experiments have shown that DKD symptoms are alleviated when mitochondrial damage is targeted, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is inextricably linked to the development of DKD. This article describes the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and the progression and onset of DKD. The relationship between DKD and mitochondrial dysfunction is discussed. At the same time, the progress of DKD treatment targeting mitochondrial dysfunction is summarized. We hope to provide new insights into the progress and treatment of DKD.",
