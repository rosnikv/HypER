The NHP was administered twice to 73 patients, waiting for total hip replacement. Pain, energy, sleep, and mobility were severely affected. The correlations between subjective and objective scores were, apart from pain, moderate. The two test administrations correlated highly. In conclusion, the NHP is a reliable instrument, which may provide valuable supplementary information in the assessment of disability.",

        "abstract": "AN articular index is a formalized method of expressing the severity and extent of joint involvement in inflammatory arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatologists agree that articular indices are important in clinical investigations [1], use them in some form in routine clinical practice [2], and when aware of each other's assessments on similar patients converge on an articular index as the main determinant of their clinical evaluations [3]. It is difficult to conceive of a clinical study of rheumatoid arthritis which would not now include an articular index. A variety of articular indices have been devised and adopted. If these were simply different but comparable scales by which to measure patients their multiplicity would not cause any difficulty, but this is not the case. Until recently there has been little agreement about which joints should be selected for inclusion in an articular index and how they should be examined [4]. For example, the Ritchie index [5] grades the tenderness of groups of joints, the index described by the Cooperating Clinics of the American Rheumatism Association (the ARA index) [6] counts joints that are tender and/or swollen and the Lansbury index [7] scores the severity of inflammation, weighted for joint surface area. All have been shown to be sensitive to changes in a patient's condition, but which is the best measure of joint inflammation?",

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of measures of psychosocial distress, health-seeking behaviour, sleep problems and traumatic life events to the development of new cases of CWP in the community.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a population-based prospective study, 3171 adults aged 25-65 yrs free of CWP were followed-up 15 months later to identify those with new CWP. Baseline data were available on their scores from a number of psychological scales including Illness Attitude Scales (IAS), Somatic Symptom Checklist (SSC), Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale, Sleep Problems Scale, and Life Events Inventory.\n\n\nRESULTS\n324 subjects [10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2, 11.3] developed new CWP at follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, three factors independently predicted the development of CWP: scoring three or more on the SSC [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1], scoring eight or more on the Illness Behaviour subscale of the IAS (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.3, 4.8), and nine or more on the Sleep Problem Scale (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6, 3.2). Subjects exposed to all three factors were at 12 times the odds of new CWP than those with low scores on all scales.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSubjects are at substantial increased odds of developing CWP if they display features of somatization, health-seeking behaviour and poor sleep. Psychosocial distress has a strong aetiological influence on CWP.",

Of those, 2,347 (60%) returned to work. Sleep disturbances 5-7 nights per week predicted work disability due to mental disorders (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-1.9) and diseases of the circulatory system (HR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), musculoskeletal system (HR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8) and nervous system (HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2), and injuries and poisonings (HR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) after controlling for baseline age, sex, socioeconomic status, night/shift work, health behaviors (e.g., smoking, exercise), diagnosed somatic diseases, use of pain killers, depression, and anxiety. In addition, sleep disturbances prior to disability were associated with higher likelihood of not returning to work after work disability from musculoskeletal diseases (HR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) and, in men, after work disability due to mental disorders (HR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.7-11.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSleep disturbances are associated with increased risk for subsequent disabling mental disorders and various physical illnesses.

        "abstract": "In Finland, between 2003 and 2010 and parallel to the increase in the prevalence of insomnia-related symptoms among the general population, there has been a cessation of growth and even a decrease in the consumption of traditional hypnotics. The reasons behind this seemingly paradoxical situation are not known. We analyzed trends over the period 2000-2010 in the estimated consumption of traditional hypnotics and some new drugs that are destined for use in insomnia treatment. We used the annual wholesale statistical database compiled by the Finnish Medicine Agency, FIMEA, and data from the Finnish Drug Prescription Register. We found evidence to support two parallel trends in Finnish outpatient care. First, there seems to be a trend in which physicians increasingly comply with official guidelines for insomnia treatment, which partly accounts for the decrease in the consumption of traditional hypnotics. Second, at the same time, the first trend seems to be resulting in an increasing trend to treat insomnia patients with some new drugs that were not originally developed for insomnia treatment by prescribing these non-hypnotic drugs in small, sub-clinical doses. The current trend in practice may have contradictory effects on the treatment of insomnia. The long-term consequences of using low doses of drugs other than hypnotics to treat insomnia are not known and the situation should, therefore, be followed-up in subsequent studies. However, pharmacological treatment should never be a substitute for non-pharmacological treatments of insomnia.

        "abstract": "The link between sleepiness and the risk of motor vehicle accidents is well known, but little is understood regarding the risk of home, work and car accidents of subjects with insomnia. An international cross\u2010sectional survey was conducted across 10 countries in a population of subjects with sleep disturbances. Primary care physicians administered a questionnaire that included assessment of sociodemographic characteristics, sleep disturbance and accidents (motor vehicle, work and home) related to sleep problems to each subject. Insomnia was defined using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD\u201010) criteria. A total of 5293 subjects were included in the study, of whom 20.9% reported having had at least one home accident within the past 12 months, 10.1% at least one work accident, 9% reported having fallen asleep while driving at least once and 4.1% reported having had at least one car accident related to their sleepiness. All types of accident were reported more commonly by subjects living in urban compared to other residential areas. Car accidents were reported more commonly by employed subjects, whereas home injuries were reported more frequently by the unemployed. Car accidents were reported more frequently by males than by females, whereas home accidents were reported more commonly by females. Patients with insomnia have high rates of home accidents, car accidents and work accidents related to sleep disturbances independently of any adverse effects of hypnotic treatments. Reduced total sleep time may be one factor explaining the high risk of accidents in individuals who complain of insomnia.",

The experimental procedure included four nights with polysomnography in the lab (zolpidem, doxepin, and their respective placebo conditions). Arousability was measured using an auditory awakening threshold delivered at the peak-plasma concentration for the active hypnotics and at matched times for the respective placebo conditions.

        "abstract": "Purpose Although patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) might suffer difficulty in falling asleep during overnight polysomnography (PSG), standard hypnotics to obtain sleep during PSG have not been established. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a new hypnotic agent, suvorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist, for insomnia in suspected OSA patients during in-laboratory PSG. Patients and methods An observational study was conducted during PSG for 149 patients with suspected OSA who had no insomnia at home. Patients with difficulty in falling asleep during PSG were optionally permitted to take single-use suvorexant. Patients with residual severe insomnia (>1 hour) after taking suvorexant were permitted to take an add-on use zolpidem. Clinical data and sleep questionnaire results were analyzed between a no insomnia group (without hypnotics) and an insomnia group (treated with suvorexant). Results Among 84 patients who experienced insomnia during PSG and required hypnotics (the insomnia group; treated with suvorexant), 44 (52.4%) achieved sufficient subjective sleep with single-use of suvorexant, while the other 40 (47.6%) required suvorexant plus zolpidem. An apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of \u22655 was observed in 144 out of 149 patients with predominantly obstructive respiratory events. Among those patients, 70.8% in the no insomnia group and 63.1% in the insomnia group had severe OSA. Regarding both subjective sleep time and morning mood, significant differences between the no insomnia group and the insomnia group were not observed. No patient taking suvorexant had an adverse event, such as delirium or falling.

In the last decade, many trials have been conducted with orexin receptor antagonists, which represent an innovative and valid therapeutic option based on the multiple mechanisms of action of orexins on different biological circuits, both centrally and peripherally, and their role in a wide range of medical conditions which are often associated with insomnia. A very interesting aspect of this new category of drugs is that they have limited abuse liability and their discontinuation does not seem associated with significant rebound effects. Further studies on the efficacy of DORAs are required, especially on children and adolescents and in particular conditions, such as menopause. Which DORA is most suitable for each patient, based on comorbidities and/or concomitant treatments, should be the focus of further careful research. On the contrary, studies on SORAs, some of which seem to be appropriate also in insomnia in patients with psychiatric diseases, are still at an early stage and, therefore, do not allow to draw definite conclusions.",

        "title": "Associations of sleep disorders with all-cause MCI/dementia and different types of dementia \u2013 clinical evidence, potential pathomechanisms and treatment options: A narrative review",
        "abstract": "Due to worldwide demographic change, the number of older persons in the population is increasing. Aging is accompanied by changes of sleep structure, deposition of beta-amyloid (A\u00df) and tau proteins and vascular changes and can turn into mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as dementia. Sleep disorders are discussed both as a risk factor for and as a consequence of MCI/dementia. Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based as well as case\u2013control studies revealed sleep disorders, especially sleep-disorderded breathing (SDB) and excessive or insufficient sleep durations, as risk factors for all-cause MCI/dementia. Regarding different dementia types, SDB was especially associated with vascular dementia while insomnia/insufficient sleep was related to an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Scarce and still inconsistent evidence suggests that therapy of sleep disorders, especially continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in SDB, can improve cognition in patients with sleep disorders with and without comorbid dementia and delay onset of MCI/dementia in patients with sleep disorders without previous cognitive impairment. Regarding potential pathomechanisms via which sleep disorders lead to MCI/dementia, disturbed sleep, chronic sleep deficit and SDB can impair glymphatic clearance of beta-amyloid (A\u00df) and tau which lead to amyloid deposition and tau aggregation resulting in changes of brain structures responsible for cognition. Orexins are discussed to modulate sleep and A\u00df pathology. Their diurnal fluctuation is suppressed by sleep fragmentation and the expression suppressed at the point of hippocampal atrophy, contributing to the progression of dementia. Additionally, sleep disorders can lead to an increased vascular risk profile and vascular changes such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis which can foster neurodegenerative pathology. There is ample evidence indicating that changes of sleep structure in aging persons can lead to dementia and also evidence that therapy of sleep disorder can improve cognition. Therefore, sleep disorders should be identified and treated early.",
