        "abstract": "No effective medical therapy is available for all patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been suggested to be of benefit based on open label clinical studies. We randomized 166 patients with liver biopsy\u2013proven NASH to receive between 13 and 15 mg/kg/d of UDCA or placebo for 2 years. End points included changes in liver test results and liver histology at 2 years of therapy. The treatment groups were comparable at entry with regard to age, gender, risk factors for NASH, serum liver biochemistries, and baseline liver histology. A total of 126 patients completed 2 years of therapy. Pre\u2010 and posttreatment liver biopsies were available in 107 patients for review at the end of the study. UDCA was well tolerated and body weight was stable during the study duration. Serum liver biochemistries were stable or improved in both the UDCA and placebo\u2010treated groups. Changes in the degree of steatosis, necroinflammation, or fibrosis that occurred with therapy were not significantly different between the UDCA and placebo groups. In conclusion, 2 years of therapy with UDCA at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/d, although safe and well tolerated, is not better than placebo for patients with NASH. (HEPATOLOGY 2004;39:770\u2013778.)",

        "abstract": "In the absence of surrogate markers, the evaluation of suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly dependent on histological examination. The extent of sampling variability affecting the reliability of a single liver biopsy in patients with suspected NAFLD is poorly characterized. This prospective study aimed to correlate precise histological findings in paired biopsies\u2014right and left lobe\u2014in the diagnosis of NAFLD in morbidly obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery employing both Brunt and Matteoni classifications and the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). We also aimed to determine whether the composite histopathological findings of the two biopsies would improve diagnostic accuracy. Consecutive subjects had an intraoperative biopsy from both right and left lobes, evaluated and scored in a blinded manner. Intraobserver agreement was also assessed. Kappa coefficients of agreement were calculated. Forty\u2010one subjects had acceptable biopsies. Agreement for steatosis was excellent and moderate for fibrosis. Concordance was only fair for most features of necroinflammation. Intraobserver agreement was only moderate for lobular inflammation. Excellent agreement was seen for the diagnosis of NASH using Brunt criteria and good agreement when using Matteoni and NAS scoring systems. Composite biopsy data particularly improved identification of hepatocyte ballooning. The diagnostic accuracy also improved substantially when composite features were compared with single\u2010sided biopsy features, especially for the Matteoni and NAS scoring systems. In conclusion, significant sampling variability occurs in NAFLD, particularly for features of necroinflammation. This should be factored into the design of clinical trials and studies of the natural history of the disease. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:874\u2013880.)",

        "abstract": "Recently, the Nordic consensus on the treatment of undescended testis prohibited the use of hormones because of possible long-term adverse effects on spermatogenesis (1). This conclusion was based on articles published by groups from Finland and Denmark analyzing testicular histology and apoptosis of the germ cells (1). Even if human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) treatment induces increased apoptosis of the germ cells, it is still irrelevant for subsequent fertility outcome. The follow-up spermiogram performed in these patients showed no significant difference in fertility outcome between the treated and untreated groups. The second reason was the observation of decreased numbers of germ cells in cryptorchid boys aged 1\u20133 years who were previously unsuccessfully treated with HCG in comparison to the untreated group (1). These results, although statistically significant, are again irrelevant for the fertility outcome because the germ cell count in both groups was below 0.2 germ cells per tubular cross-section. If the germ cell count is <0.2, the majority of patients will develop infertility irrespective of whether they had only surgery or hormonal pretreatment in addition to orchidopexy. Abnormal contralateral testis is ideal for evaluating the effect of hormonal treatment because there is no effect from abnormal position and increased temperature to interfere with the results. In contrast to the concerns raised by the Nordic consensus group, the results of our recent study showed that hormonal treatment for undescended testis improved the histopathology of the contralateral testis without harming the germ cells (2). Furthermore, neoadjuvant gonadotropin relasing hormone (GNRH) treatment was found to improve the fertility index in prepubertal cryptorchidism (3). Maximum salvage of active germinal tissue is achieved by treating cryptorchidism before the end of the first year of life (3). We entirely agree with the Nordic consensus group that infertility is the primary concern for the treatment of boys with unilateral or bilateral undescended testes. This especially because analysis of contralateral descended testis in unilateral cryptorchidism demonstrated that cryptorchidism is a bilateral disease, and infertility in cryptorchidism is endocrinopathy of mini-puberty (4,5). It is important to realize that male fertility potential depends on the presence of Ad spermatogonia (5\u20137). Development of Ad spermatogonia from gonocytes, which takes place during first months of life, was shown to be testosterone dependent (8). However, early and seemingly successful orchidopexy does not improve fertility in a substantial number of cryptorchid males because it does not address the underlying pathophysiology of cryptorchidism, namely, the impaired transformation of gonocytes into Ad spermatogonia (6,7). Furthermore, successfully surgically treated patients at risk for infertility after 6 months of luteinizing hormonerelasing hormone analogue (LH-RHa) treatment had a lasting increase in the number of germ cells in their cryptorchid testis (9). The efficacy of the LH-RHa treatment was the best in boys younger than 7 years (9,10). Treatment with LH-RHa normalized sperm concentration in 86% of unilateral cryptorchid males, who were in the high-risk group for developing infertility (Fig. 1). All males in the untreated group (surgery only) were severely oligospermic, with 20% being azoospermic (10). This profoundly changes our current concept of cryptorchidism treatment. For the first time, it is possible to demonstrate that infertility caused by cryptorchidism, which is believed to be a congenital malformation, can be successfully corrected if adequately treated. During the last 35 years, histological studies have contributed the most to our understanding of the aetiology of cryptorchidism. Only the comparison of histology and hormonal levels exemplify hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in the majority of cryptorchid boys. Why the Nordic consensus group did not take the histopathologic findings into consideration remains unclear. Nonetheless, their recommendation as to when a testicular biopsy should be obtained is passe. A testicular biopsy is the only sure way of identifying those cryptorchid boys who need to be treated hormonally with LH-RHa following successful surgery;",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in general population so it is impossible to perform liver biopsy in such a large number of patients to identify those with advanced fibrosis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Liver biopsy has a potential sampling error, it is invasive and prone to complications, so it is no longer considered as mandatory as first line screening tools for chronic liver disease. The development of non-invasive biomarkers, FibroTest-ActiTest in 2001 and more recently FibroMax, as well as transient elastography (TE) has changed the management of chronic liver disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the advantages and limits of the available non-invasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis, in comparison with liver biopsy in NAFLD patients.",
