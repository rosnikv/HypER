        "title": "Effects of skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract on frequency of gout flares: a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives Previous laboratory studies have identified two dairy fractions, glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract (G600), with anti-inflammatory effects in models of acute gout. The aim of this proof-of-concept clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that daily intake of skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with GMP and G600 can prevent gout flares. Methods This was a 3-month randomised double-blind controlled trial of milk products for prevention of gout flares. One hundred and twenty patients with recurrent gout flares were randomised to one of three arms: lactose powder control, SMP control and SMP enriched with GMP and G600 (SMP/GMP/G600). The primary end point was change in the frequency of gout flares using a daily flare diary measured monthly for 3 months. Results The frequency of gout flares reduced in all three groups over the 3-month study period compared with baseline. Over the 3-month study period there was a significantly greater reduction in gout flares in the SMP/GMP/G600 group (analysis of covariance pgroup=0.031, Tukey post hoc test compared with lactose control, p=0.044). Following treatment with SMP/GMP/G600 over the 3-month period, greater improvements were also observed in pain and fractional excretion of uric acid, with trends to greater improvement in tender joint count. Similar adverse event rates and discontinuation rates were observed between the three groups. Conclusions This is the first reported controlled trial of dietary intervention in patients with gout, and suggests that SMP enriched with GMP and G600 may reduce the frequency of gout flares.",

        "title": "2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout",
        "abstract": "Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

        "title": "New Perspectives in Rheumatology: Implications of the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities Trial and the Associated Food and Drug Administration Public Safety Alert",
        "abstract": "Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now\u2010published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all\u2010cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate\u2010lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long\u2010term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first\u2010line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first\u2010line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision\u2010making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Aims To compare the occurrence of cerebral, cardiovascular, and renal events in patients with hyperuricaemia treated with febuxostat and those treated with conventional therapy with lifestyle modification. Methods and results This multicentre, prospective, randomized open-label, blinded endpoint study was done in 141 hospitals in Japan. A total of 1070 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. Elderly patients with hyperuricaemia (serum uric acid >7.0 to \u22649.0\u2009mg/dL) at risk for cerebral, cardiovascular, or renal disease, defined by the presence of hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, renal disease, or history of cerebral or cardiovascular disease, were randomized to febuxostat and non-febuxostat groups and were observed for 36\u2009months. Cerebral, cardiovascular, and renal events and all deaths were defined as the primary composite event. The serum uric acid level at endpoint (withdrawal or completion of the study) in the febuxostat (n\u2009=\u2009537) and non-febuxostat groups (n\u2009=\u2009533) was 4.50\u2009\u00b1\u20091.52 and 6.76\u2009\u00b1\u20091.45\u2009mg/dL, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The primary composite event rate was significantly lower in the febuxostat group than in non-febuxostat treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 0.750, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.592\u20130.950; P\u2009=\u20090.017] and the most frequent event was renal impairment (febuxostat group: 16.2%, non-febuxostat group: 20.5%; HR 0.745, 95% CI 0.562\u20130.987; P\u2009=\u20090.041).

        "title": "Clinical Effects of Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors in Hyperuricemic Patients",
        "abstract": "This review aims to critically present the available clinical evidence supporting the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. For this reason, the studies published on uric acid (UA)-lowering drugs in the English language from 2000 to August 2019 have been carefully reviewed. The terms \u201cserum uric acid,\u201d \u201cxanthine oxidase,\u201d \u201callopurinol,\u201d \u201cfebuxostat,\u201d and \u201ctopiroxostat\u201d were incorporated into an electronic search strategy, alone and in combinations, in both MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Even if new urate-lowering drugs seem of particular efficacy for acute treatment of refractory hyperuricemia, their use is supported by relatively small clinical evidence. On the contrary, large long-term clinical trials have demonstrated that xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs, namely, allopurinol and febuxostat) are effective, safe, and relatively well-tolerated in most of the patients. They have mainly been tested in the elderly, in patients affected by chronic diseases such as heart failure and cancer, and in patients taking a large number of drugs, confirming their safety profile. Recent data also show that they could exert some positive effects on vascular health, renal function, and glucose metabolism. Their cost is also low. In conclusion, XOIs remain the first choice of UA-lowering drug for chronic treatment.",

        "title": "A Brief Review of Natural Products with Urate Transporter 1 Inhibition for the Treatment of Hyperuricemia",
        "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a common disease caused by a high level of uric acid. Urate transporter 1 (URAT1) is an important protein and mediates approximately 90% of uric acid reabsorption. Therefore, the URAT1 inhibitor is a class of uricosuric medicines widely used in the clinic for the treatment of hyperuricemia. To find the new medicine with stronger URAT1 inhibition and lower toxicity, researchers have been exploring natural products. This study systematically summarizes the natural products with URAT1 inhibition. The results show that many natural products are potential URAT1 inhibitors, such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, coumarins, stilbenes, and steroids, among which flavonoids are the most promising source of URAT1 inhibitors. It is worth noting that most studies have focused on finding natural products with inhibition of URAT1 and have not explored their activities and mechanisms toward URAT1. By reviewing the few existing studies of the structure-activity relationship and analyzing common features of natural products with URAT1 inhibition, we speculate that the rigid ring structure and negative charge may be the keys for natural products to produce URAT1 inhibition. In conclusion, natural products are potential URAT1 inhibitors, and exploring the mechanism of action and structure-activity relationship will be an important research direction in the future.",

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct, with specific search terms and Boolean operators. A total of 269 articles were initially retrieved, but after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria only 28 articles were selected for further review. Among the findings, four varieties of sweet potato were identified as having potential anti-diabetic properties. Phenolic acids, flavonols, flavanones, and anthocyanidins are responsible for the anti-diabetic activity of sweet potatoes. The anti-diabetic mechanism of sweet potatoes was determined using a combination of components with multi-target actions. The results of these studies provide evidence that Ipomoea batatas is effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Common Ivy (Hedera helix L.) is an ornamental plant that is known for its aesthetic qualities and ability to provide natural greenery. It is also associated with potential health benefits. When evaluating the phytochemical constituents of H. helix methanolic extracts, the fruit extract had the highest levels of total phenolic compounds (TPC) at 100 GAE mg/g extract, compared to 89.47 GAE mg/g in the leaves extract. In contrast, total flavonoid compounds and total tannin were higher in leaves extracts, 37.14 TE mg/g extract and 24.79 GAE mg/g extract respectively. fruit extracts showed the greatest level of antioxidant properties in the FRAP test 75.5 and 62.35 AscE mg/g extract also in DPPH tests, the IC50 were 3.49 and 8.79 mg/ml for fruit and leaves respectively, demonstrating their potent capacity to neutralize free radicals and high reducing power. However, when evaluated by the ABTS method, the leaves extracts indicated the strongest antioxidant activity, suggesting their potent capacity to neutralize free radicals, the IC50 were 4.54 and 8.69 mg/ml for fruit and leaves respectively, the extracts' inhibitory effects on albumin denaturation were also assessed. The findings demonstrated the potential of the extracts as anti-inflammatory, with the leaf extract having the lowest IC50 values in these tests 75.26\u00b1 3.87 \u00b5g/ml and 115.62\u00b1 56.47 \u00b5g/ml, for ripe fruit extract.
