        "title": "Crisis Intervention Program in Newly Diagnosed Diabetic Children",
        "abstract": "A group of 223 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, aged 7\u201324 yr, who had been under the regular care of our clinic up to 15 yr, were rated by two independent judges on a two-level scale of adjustment and maladjustment. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (N = 107) comprised those who had been under care from diagnosis of the disease and had been subjected to the special crisis intervention program offered to every family upon referral of a newly diagnosed patient. Group B (N = 116) comprised patients who were diagnosed and treated initially in a clinic that had no crisis intervention program. Significant differences between the two groups were found in respect to three of the four aspects studied, i.e., compliance, familial relationships, and sociability, with group A showing a better adjustment than group B. There was no significant difference in the fourth aspect studied, i.e., school achievement and work performance. It was found that it took three times the effort, i.e., the time invested in counseling and psychotherapeutic measures, to bring group B to a good level of adjustment than it did to achieve similar results with group A. It is suggested that the initial period after diagnosis of diabetes in a child should be considered a period of crisis, requiring special muitidisciplinary services to reduce future psychosocial maladjustments and improve compliance.",

        "abstract": "Although the role of emotional and psychosocial factors in diabetes is generally appreciated, most health care professionals, diabetic patients, and families of patients have no clear model that clarifies the nature of psychosocial variables and provides defined principles for effective treatment and preventative interventions. A multivariate clinical model for coping with predictable crises of diabetes is presented. The model is based on the constructs of crisis, coping, and social support as well as a developmental and life course perspective. The psychosocial tasks to be addressed in coping with crises, in general, as well as strategies of coping are defined and discussed. The specific predictable crises of diabetes are described with reference to the demands and sources of stress inherent in the critical situations and the associated strategies for coping with them. Special attention is given to coping with the initial diagnosis and onset of the disease, the role of health care professionals, and developmental issues in coping with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe purposes of this study were to describe how persons with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) accept their disease and what sense of coherence they have, in order to determine whether a person's acceptance of the disease is related to his or her sense of coherence. Whether acceptance of the disease and sense of coherence are related to the disease duration, complications of the disease, metabolic control and demographic data would also be determined.\n\n\nDESIGN\nOne hundred and seven, randomly selected, insulin-dependent, diabetic subjects (47 men and 60 women) participated in the study. The Acceptance of Disability Scale Modified (ADM scale), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC scale), a study-specific questionnaire and the patients records were used to collect the data.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nIDDM implies a major change in way of life. Ingrained procedures and patterns of behaviour must be adapted to the disease and its treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results of the present study show that educational level seems to be an important factor for how well a person accepts the disease and the sense of coherence. Persons with higher scores on the ADM and the SOC scales had higher levels of education. Moreover, they also had a better metabolic control. Individuals with a poor metabolic control had more disease-related complications. A significant correlation between the ADM and the SOC scores was found, indicating that persons with a high degree of acceptance of the IDDM also had a high coping capability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is important to individualize the care of subjects with IDDM and to identify the persons with low acceptance of their disease and a low sense of coherence.",

        "abstract": "The coexistence of diabetes and depression occurs frequently among young and middle-age women. Unless one is resourceful, simultaneous management of the symptoms of both conditions is especially challenging. Skills constituting resourcefulness are learned throughout life and are important for the optimal performance of daily activities. Little is known about specific factors that influence resourcefulness. In this study, contextual factors (diabetic and depressive symptoms) and cognitive factors (positive cognitions and acceptance of diabetes) were examined as antecedents of learned resourcefulness in 82 women with type 2 diabetes. Regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms and positive cognitions were significant antecedents of learned resourcefulness: Positive cognitions mediated the effects of depressive symptoms on learned resourcefulness. The findings suggest the need for interventions that focus on development of positive cognitions to better promote resourcefulness in women with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for depression.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nInvestigate psychosocial barriers to self-care and the prevalence of depression among Hispanic women with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS\nOne hundred twenty-six (126) Hispanic women living in Miami-Dade, South Florida were recruited through outpatient diabetes clinics, physicians' offices, or community referrals to participate in a cross-sectional survey to assess psychosocial factors that can interfere with type 2 diabetes self-care. The survey collected information on sociodemographics, performance of self-care regimens, a diabetes care profile (support, knowledge, empowerment, and attitudes), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), health locus of control, and perceived stress, as well as other data used to evaluate diabetes status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 4 of the 126 diabetic women interviewed reported having had depression previously assessed. Mean for depression scores was 12.76 +/- 8.71. Scores on the depression inventory indicated depression in 40.6% of subjects, with 23% categorized as mildly, 11.1% moderately, and 6.3% severely depressed. Greater self-assessed depression was associated with poorer self-rated health, understanding of diabetes, and diabetes knowledge scores. Subjects classified as severely depressed had lived with diabetes for a significantly longer mean number of years than those classified as moderately, mildly, or minimally depressed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDepression had not been previously assessed by any healthcare providers seen by participants or addressed in most participants in this study. While the literature abounds with findings on the depression in diabetes and potential for improved compliance when depression is treated, this concept seems to not yet be adopted into mainstream diabetes care for our Hispanic population.",

Participants included 45 self-identified Latino adults with diabetes. Discussion topics included diabetes management, perceived control, emotional barriers, conceptualization of depression, and help-seeking behavior. Themes pertinent to depression and emotional health were identified using a combined deductive/inductive approach and an iterative process of consensus coding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants' mean age was 40 years, 44% were male, and most were born in Mexico. The mean time with diabetes was 6.5 years. The primary theme identified was the bidirectional relationship between emotional health and diabetes. Diagnosis of diabetes led to feelings of hopelessness and upset, while difficulty with diabetes management led to feelings of anxiety and depression. Participants felt that being \"stressed out\" or sad directly affected their blood sugar. Participants described factors that influence the relationship between emotions and diabetes, including family and societal stressors, and they reported little discussion of depression with providers. Depression and emotional health are closely associated with diabetes in the minds of these Latino adults. It is important to ask patients with diabetes about their emotional health, to screen for depression, and to elicit preferences about treatment when indicated.",

        "abstract": "In their review, Perez-Escamilla and Putnik address the com- plexity between different levels of acculturation and the influ- ence on nutrition, obesity, and other lifestyle factors, which consequently modulate the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Latinos (1). One would expect that several of the changes in dietary patterns associated with acculturation may explain the prevalence of diabetes among subgroups of Latinos living in the US. However, the need for further research in this area is illustrated by the fact that there is no consistent evidence that acculturation is associated with a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes. Indeed, research shows that, although individuals who have been able to incorporate into the mainstream European- American culture appear to have less prevalence of type 2 diabetes, those who are less acculturated have more pronounced patterns of insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose metabolism (2). However, this finding is likely to be confounded by poverty. In a survey conducted in Mexican Americans living in Arizona, 68% of those individuals presenting type 2 diabetes belonged to a lower socioeconomic group (3), indicating that poverty level is a major contribution to degenerative diseases. Although lifestyle changes may be responsible for these patterns, an assessment of biomarkers is needed to understand the progress of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death in the United States and have been associated with depressive symptoms and poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study examined whether depressive symptoms and HRQOL indicators changed among participants in Pasos Adelante, a chronic disease prevention and control program implemented in a US\u2013Mexico border community. Methods Pasos Adelante was a 12-week promotora-led program that included educational sessions and walking groups. We used the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Center for Disease Control's \"Healthy Days\" measures to measure depressive symptoms and HRQOL. We used linear mixed-effects models and general estimating equations to analyze changes in CES-D scores and HRQOL indicators from baseline to postprogram and from postprogram to 3-month follow-up. Results At baseline, participants had a mean of 7.1 physically unhealthy days, 7.4 mentally unhealthy days, and 3.9 days of activity limitation. The mean number of physically and mentally unhealthy days declined significantly from baseline to postprogram, but the mean number of activity limitation days did not. At baseline, 42.6% of participants reported their health as fair/poor; 20.8% of participants reported frequent mental distress, and 31.8% had a CES-D score of 16 or more. All 3 proportions declined from baseline to postprogram. No significant changes occurred between postprogram and follow-up. Conclusion Participants in Pasos Adelante showed improvement in depressive symptoms and several HRQOL indicators. Future studies should use an experimental design with a comparison group to determine whether these findings can be replicated and to examine potential mediators and moderators of program effects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective We assessed the feasibility and impact on knowledge, attitudes, and reported practices of psychological first-aid (PFA) training in a sample of Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) members. Data have been limited on the uptake of PFA training in surge responders (eg, MRC) who are critical to community response. Methods Our mixed-methods approach involved self-administered pre- and post-training surveys and within-training focus group discussions of 76 MRC members attending a PFA training and train-the-trainer workshop. Listen, protect, connect (a PFA model for lay persons) focuses on listening and understanding both verbal and nonverbal cues; protecting the individual by determining realistic ways to help while providing reassurance; and connecting the individual with resources in the community. Results From pre- to post-training, perceived confidence and capability in using PFA after an emergency or disaster increased from 71% to 90% (P < .01), but no significant increase was found in PFA-related knowledge. Qualitative analyses suggest that knowledge and intentions to use PFA increased with training. Brief training was feasible, and while results were modest, the PFA training resulted in greater reported confidence and perceived capability in addressing psychological distress of persons affected by public health threats. Conclusion PFA training is a promising approach to improve surge responder confidence and competency in addressing postdisaster needs. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2014;0:1-6)",

        "abstract": "Background: Disparities in depression care exist among the poor. Community Partners in Care (CPIC) compared a community coalition model with technical assistance to improve depression services in under-resourced communities. We examine effects on health, social, and utilization outcomes among the poor and, non-poor depressed, and poor subgroups. Methods: This study analyzed clients living above (n = 268) and below (n = 750) the federal-poverty level and, among the poor, 3 nonoverlapping subgroups: justice-involved (n = 158), homeless and not justice-involved (n = 298), and other poor (n = 294). Matched programs (n = 93) from health and community sectors were randomly assigned to community engagement and planning (CEP) or resources for services (RS). Primary outcomes were poor mental health\u2013related quality of life and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores, whereas community-prioritized and utilization outcomes were secondary. Effects were scrutinized using false discovery rate\u2013adjusted P values to account for multiple comparisons. Results: In the impoverished group, CEP and RS clients of participating study programs did not differ in primary outcomes, but CEP more than RS improved mental wellness among the depressed poor (unadjusted P = .004) while providing suggestive evidence for other secondary outcomes. Within the poor subgroups, evidence favoring CEP was only suggestive but was strongest among justice-involved clients. Conclusions: A coalition approach to improving outcomes for low-income clients with depression, particularly those involved in the justice system, may offer additional benefits over standard technical assistance programs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Comorbid depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) are associated with poor health and social outcomes disproportionately affecting under-resourced communities. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that a coalition approach to collaborative care (CC) for depression would improve outcomes of hazardous drinking and behavioral health hospitalizations, relative to technical assistance, for individuals with comorbid substance use problems. Substance use problems were defined by meeting criteria for DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence, hazardous drinking by AUDIT-C, or treatment in a SUD program within the prior 6 months. Methods: Two depression CC implementation approaches were compared: Resources for Services (RS) provided expert technical support for CC toolkits to individual programs. Community engagement and planning (CEP) supported multi-sector coalitions in collaborating in planning, adapting, implementing and monitoring CC toolkits. One thousand eighteen individuals with depression (PHQ-8 \u226510) enrolled. Regression analyses estimated intervention effects in participants with comorbid substance use problems (n = 588, 281 females, 307 males). Substance use problems were defined by meeting criteria for DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence, hazardous drinking by AUDIT-C, or treatment in a SUD program within the prior 6 months. Results: There were no significant baseline differences by intervention status among participants with depression and substance use problems. Intervention effects on primary outcomes including depression were not significant at 6 months. Compared to RS, CEP significantly reduced alcohol consumption (CEP = 1.6, RS = 2.1, p = .038), probability of behavioral health hospitalizations (OR = 0.50, p = .036), and use of specialty mental health visits (IRR = 0.52, p = .027), while increasing use of faith-based depression services (IRR = 3.4, p = .001). Conclusions: Given feasibility and possible benefits, CEP should be considered a promising approach to implementing depression CC with potential benefits to adults with comorbid substance use problems.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The scope of primary care increasingly encompasses patient behavioral health problems, manifest typically through depression screening and treatment. Although substance use is highly comorbid with depression, it is not commonly identified and addressed in the primary care context. This study aimed to examine the association between the likelihood of substance use disorder and increased depression severity, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, among a sample of 2409 patients from 41 geographically dispersed and diverse primary care clinics across the US. Methods: This is secondary analysis of data obtained from a multi-site parent study of integrated behavioral health in primary care, among patients with both chronic medical and behavioral health conditions. Patient reported outcome surveys were gathered from patients at 3 time points. The primary care practices were blind to which of their patients completed surveys. Included were standardized measures of depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire\u20149) [PHQ-9] and substance use disorder likelihood (Global Appraisal of Individual Needs\u2014Short Screener [GSS]). Results: Four percent of the study population screened positive for substance use disorder. PHQ-9 scores indicated depression among 43% of all patients. There was a significant association between the likelihood of substance use disorder and depression initially, at a 9-month follow-up, and over time. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, and other patient and contextual characteristics. Conclusions: The findings suggest that substance use disorder is associated with depression severity cross-sectionally and over time. Primary care clinics and health systems might consider implementing substance use screening in addition to the more common screening strategies for depression. Especially for patients with severe depression or those who do not respond to frontline depression treatments, the undermining presence of a substance use disorder should be explored.",
