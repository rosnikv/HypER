        "title": "Efficacy of metformin in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The Multicenter Metformin Study Group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSulfonylurea drugs have been the only oral therapy available for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in the United States. Recently, however, metformin has been approved for the treatment of NIDDM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed two large, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled studies in which metformin or another treatment was given for 29 weeks to moderately obese patients with NIDDM whose diabetes was inadequately controlled by diet (protocol 1: metformin vs. placebo; 289 patients), or diet plus glyburide (protocol 2: metformin and glyburide vs. metformin vs. glyburide; 632 patients). To determine efficacy we measured plasma glucose (while the patients were fasting and after the oral administration of glucose), lactate, lipids, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin before, during, and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn protocol 1, at the end of the study the 143 patients in the metformin group, as compared with the 146 patients in the placebo group, had lower mean (+/- SE) fasting plasma glucose concentrations (189 +/- 5 vs. 244 +/- 6 mg per deciliter [10.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.6 +/- 0.2 percent, P < 0.001). In protocol 2, the 213 patients given metformin and glyburide, as compared with the 210 patients treated with glyburide alone, had lower mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations (187 +/- 4 vs. 261 +/- 4 mg per deciliter [10.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.7 +/- 0.1 percent, P < 0.001). The effect of metformin alone was similar to that of glyburide alone. Eighteen percent of the patients given metformin and glyburide had symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia, as compared with 3 percent in the glyburide group and 2 percent in the metformin group. In both protocols the patients given metformin had statistically significant decreases in plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, whereas the values in the respective control groups did not change. There were no significant changes in fasting plasma lactate concentrations in any of the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea are well tolerated and improve glycemic control and lipid concentrations in patients with NIDDM whose diabetes is poorly controlled with diet or sulfonylurea therapy alone.",

        "title": "Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and modes of action of therapeutic interventions.",
        "abstract": "At least 90% of the 12 to 15 million persons with diabetes mellitus in the United States, half of whose condition remains undiagnosed, have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance, a reversible metabolic state associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular complications. Thus, at the time of diagnosis, long-term complications have developed in almost one fourth of patients. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes requires genetic (most likely polygenic) and acquired factors, and its pathogenesis involves an interplay of progressive insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. The ideal treatment of type 2 diabetes should reverse insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in most treated patients and prevent, delay, or reverse long-term complications. Current strategies are aimed at amelioration of insulin resistance (diet, exercise, weight loss, and metformin and troglitazone therapy), augmentation of insulin supply (sulfonylurea and insulin therapy), or limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia (acarbose therapy). Future therapies probably will target (1) insulin resistance, using a multifaceted approach; (2) hepatic glucose production, using gluconeogenesis inhibitors; (3) excess nonesterified fatty acid production, using lipolysis inhibitors; and (4) fat oxidation, using carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II inhibitors. Attempts also could be made to stimulate energy expenditure and increase nonoxidative glucose disposal by means of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. One promising strategy is an attack on multiple pathophysiological processes by combining antidiabetic agents with disparate mechanisms of action. Thus, we now have unprecedented resources for drug therapy for diabetes, with great opportunity for innovative combinations. It is hoped that these expanded choices will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient management of type 2 diabetes and prevention of its long-term complications.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with Type 2 diabetes, and risk of atherosclerotic disease is markedly increased in people with diabetes compared to people with normal glucose tolerance. The excess risk can not be completely explained by increased prevalence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in people with diabetes. This review examines the role of hyperglycemia and glycemic control in cardiovascular disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. The results of prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials are summarized. We conclude that control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia are important to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes and may be more easily achieved than tight glycemic control.

        "title": "Combination therapies with insulin in type 2 diabetes.",
        "abstract": "The U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that intensive glucose control with insulin or sulfonylureas markedly reduces the risk of microvascular complications (1). For myocardial infarction, the reduction in risk (16% for a 0.9% decrease in HbA1c) was of borderline significance but corresponded closely to epidemiological predictions (14% decrease for a 1% drop in HbA1c) (2). These data demonstrated that neither insulin nor sulfonylureas, despite causing hyperinsulinemia and weight gain, have adverse effects on cardiovascular outcome. Glycemic control deteriorated continuously, however, even in intensively treated patients in the UKPDS (1).\n\nIn the UKPDS, the worsening of glycemic control has been attributed to the natural course of type 2 diabetes and lack of efficacy of current antihyperglycemic therapies (1). Insulin therapy consisted of a single injection of ultralente or isophane insulin. If the daily dose exceeded 14 U, regular insulin was added and home-glucose monitoring was encouraged (1). Combination therapy regimens with insulin and oral agents were not used. We now know that 14 U of long-acting insulin is insufficient to control fasting glycemia in most type 2 diabetic patients (3). Since 1977, when the UKPDS was started, several studies have tried to define the optimal insulin treatment regimen for type 2 diabetic patients. These studies are the focus of this review and include studies comparing insulin alone to combination therapy with insulin and sulfonylureas (subject to meta-analyses in 1991 and 1992) (4,5) and more recent trials using metformin, glitazones, or acarbose in insulin combination therapy regimens. They do not contain data on cardiovascular end points but only on surrogate markers of risk of micro- and macrovascular complications, mostly data on glycemia, body weight, insulin doses, lipids, and in a few studies, also accurate data on the frequency of hypoglycemias.\n\nAccording to a Medline search (1966\u20132000), \u2026",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTo study the effect on body weight and glycaemic control of two insulin treatment regimens in patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate failure to oral hypoglycaemic agents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixteen patients treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents (6 men and 10 women) were included in this open-label, randomized, parallel group study. Their age was 62 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) years (range 44-79 years), body weight 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.6 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2). The patients were switched to insulin treatment with bedtime NPH insulin combined with daytime sulphonylurea (combination group) or twice daily injections of a premixed combination of regular human and NPH insulin (insulin twice daily group) with measurements as given below before and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHbA(1c) was lowered from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 7.0 +/- 0.2% in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.05) and from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 6.8 +/- 0.5% in the combination group (p<0.03; ns between treatment groups). Body weight increased from 71.7 +/- 4.0 kg to 77.6 +/- 4.4 kg in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.001) and from 70.8 +/- 4.6 kg to 72.7 +/- 5.1 kg in the combination group (ns; p<0.02 between groups). The dose of insulin at 24 weeks in the insulin twice daily group was 45.8 +/- 4.2 U and 29.4 +/- 5.4 U in the combination group (p=0.03). Combination treatment reduced fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth treatments improved glycaemic control to the same extent but the combination of bedtime NPH insulin and daytime sulphonylurea gave a very small increase of body weight over a 6 months period. We conclude that combination therapy is an attractive alternative when starting insulin treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes as this is a critical period for weight gain in such patients.",

Insulin dosage was titrated to target FBG </=100 mg/dl (both insulins) and predinner blood glucose </=100 mg/dl (70/30 only) using a weekly forced-titration algorithm.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean HbA(1c) decrease from baseline was significantly more pronounced (-1.64 vs. -1.31%, P = 0.0003), and more patients reached HbA(1c) </=7.0% without confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia (45.5 vs. 28.6%, P = 0.0013) with glargine plus OAD than with 70/30. Similarly, FBG decrease was greater with glargine plus OAD (adjusted mean difference -17 mg/dl [-0.9 mmol/l], P < 0.0001), and more patients reached target FBG </=100 mg/dl with glargine plus OAD than with 70/30 (31.6 vs. 15.0%, P = 0.0001). Glargine plus OAD patients had fewer confirmed hypoglycemic episodes than 70/30 patients (mean 4.07 vs. 9.87/patient-year, P < 0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInitiating insulin treatment by adding basal insulin glargine once daily to glimepiride plus metformin treatment was safer and more effective than beginning twice-daily injections of 70/30 and discontinuing OADs in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with OADs.",

Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of (i) sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor combination therapy in treatment-na\u00efve type 2 diabetes adults; (ii) initial high and low dose SGLT2 inhibitor combination therapy. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of initial SGLT2 combination therapy. Mean difference (MD) for changes from baseline (HbA1c, weight, blood pressure) after 24\u201326 weeks of treatment and relative risks (RR, safety) were calculated using a random-effects model. Risk of bias and quality of evidence was assessed. Results: In 4 RCTs (n = 3749) there was moderate quality evidence that SGLT2 inhibitor/metformin combination therapy resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c (MD (95% CI); \u22120.55% (\u22120.67, \u22120.43)) and weight (\u22122.00 kg (\u22122.34, \u22121.66)) compared with metformin monotherapy, and a greater reduction in HbA1c (\u22120.59% (\u22120.72, \u22120.46)) and weight (\u22120.57 kg (\u22120.89, \u22120.25)) compared with SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy.

        "abstract": "Background: Diabetes mellitus is a serious threat to global health and among the top 10 causes of death, with nearly half a billion people living with it worldwide. Treating patients with diabetes tend to become more challenging due to the nature of the disease. The role and benefits of combination therapies for the management of type 2 diabetes are well-documented, while the comparative safety and efficacy among the different combination options have not been elucidated. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the comparative cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin and sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method: We searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 August 2019 and without restriction in the year of publication. We included randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes who were on metformin- sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or metformin-sulphonylureas combination therapy at least for a year. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hypoglycemia, and changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Random effect model was carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between the two combination therapies. Results: Of 3,190 citations, we included nine trials involving 10,974 participants. The pooled analysis showed no significance difference in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.52, 1.67]), serious adverse events (RR=0.96, 95% CI [0.79, 1.17]) and adverse events (RR=1.00, 95% CI [0.99, 1.02]) between the two, but in hypoglycemia (RR= 0.13, 95% CI [0.10, 0.17], P<0.00001). Participants taking metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (MD= -0.10, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.03] %, body weight (MD= -4.57, 95% CI [-4.74, -4.39] kg, systolic blood pressure (MD=-4.77, 95% CI [-5.39, -4.16] mmHg, p<0.00001), diastolic blood pressure (MD=-2.07, 95% CI [-2.74, -1.40] mmHg, and fasting plasma glucose (MD= -0.55, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.41] mmol/L, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: A combination therapy of metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors is a safe and efficacious alternative to combination therapy of metformin and sulphonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular comorbidity. However, there remains a need for additional long-term randomized controlled trials as available studies are very limited and heterogeneous.
