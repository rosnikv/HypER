        "title": "A randomized clinical trial of ursodeoxycholic acid as adjuvant treatment to prevent liver transplant rejection",
        "abstract": "Acute rejection following orthotopic liver transplantation is a common problem despite current immunosuppressive regimens. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown in small, open\u2010labeled studies to prevent rejection episodes, although its effects on complications such as infections, length of hospital stay, and survival have not been evaluated. We conducted a randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind trial to determine if UDCA (10\u201015 mg/kg/d) added to a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen was associated with a decrease in the incidence of at least one episode of acute cellular rejection. Secondary end\u2010points included determining differences in the total number of rejection episodes, the use of muromonab\u2010CD3, the incidence of infections, length of hospital stay, and survival at 90 days and 1 year. Fifty\u2010two patients were randomized, 28 to the treatment group and 24 to the placebo group. During the 3 months of the trial, there was no difference between the placebo and UDCA groups in the number of patients who were rejection\u2010free; however, there were significantly fewer patients in the treatment group who had multiple episodes of acute rejection (0 vs. 6; P = .007). Patients in the treatment group experienced a significantly lower incidence of bacterial infections (4% vs. 29%; P = .02), shorter hospital stay (25 days vs. 34 days; P = .03), and better 90\u2010day survival (100% vs. 83%; P= .04) and 1\u2010year survival (93% vs. 79%). The addition of UDCA to a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen results in significantly fewer patients experiencing multiple episodes of rejection and improved survival at 90 days and at 1 year. The use of UDCA as adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing liver transplantation who are treated with a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen should be considered.",

        "abstract": "As ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) delays the need for transplantation, this could result in patients with more comorbid disease, therefore more likely to have a worse outcome posttransplantation. The aim of this study is to compare posttransplantation outcome in patients who received UDCA versus placebo who subsequently required a liver transplant. Data on all trial patients referred for transplantation were retrospectively collected from three randomized controlled trials of UDCA in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted with patients assigned to their original treatment allocation. UDCA and placebo groups were compared at trial entry, transplant referral, just before transplantation, and 1 month and 1 year posttransplantation. From 1987 to 1996, 37 UDCA-treated and 53 placebo patients were referred for transplantation; their age, sex, and serum bilirubin levels were similar at study entry. Immediately before transplantation, these two groups were again similar with respect to age, bilirubin level, Mayo risk score, and serum creatinine level. Posttransplantation survival rates at 1 month were 93.9% in the UDCA group and 88.4% in the placebo group, and 1 year survival rates were 90.3% and 78.4%, respectively (not significant). Posttransplantation, the two groups had similar rates of infection (53.9% v 58%); however, rejection occurred significantly less often in the UDCA group; 42.9% versus 68. 8% in the placebo group (P =.04). The posttransplantation outcome of UDCA-treated patients with PBC is no different from those who were administered placebo. There is no evidence to suggest the beneficial effect of UDCA in delaying the need for transplantation is associated with a worse outcome once liver transplantation becomes necessary.",

We report a case\u2010control cohort study to determine the incidence and microbiologic profile of bilomas and risk factors for biloma formation in 492 patients undergoing liver transplantation from 1994 to 2001. Fifty\u2010seven patients (11.5%) developed one or more bilomas; 95% in the first year post\u2010transplantation. The most common initial infecting pathogens were enterococci (37%), one\u2010half resistant to vancomycin (VRE); coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci (26%); and Candida species (26%). Infection by coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci was strongly associated with the presence of a T\u2010tube (OR 9.60, p = 0.02).

Strategies to prevent biloma formation must focus on measures to prevent hepatic artery thrombosis and colonization of liver transplant patients by multiresistant nosocomial pathogens. T\u2010tube drainage post\u2010transplantation bears reassessment.

Here we report a case of hepatic artery thrombosis in a liver recipient whose native and donor livers were heterozygous for FVL. The patient subsequently underwent a successful retransplant.

        "abstract": "Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most common vascular complication after liver transplantation; it has been reported to occur in 2% to 5% of liver transplant recipients. Most reports of HAT in the literature describe single\u2010center series with small numbers of patients and lack the power to definitively identify nontechnical risk factors. We used the United Network for Organ Sharing database of adult deceased donor liver transplants from 1987 to 2006 to identify 1246 patients with graft loss from HAT. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify donor and graft risk factors for HAT\u2010induced graft loss. Although most donor predictors of HAT\u2010induced graft loss were surrogates for vessel size, donor age > 50 years was also a significant predictor of graft loss from HAT (relative risk = 1.45, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the risk of graft loss from HAT increased progressively with each decade of donor age > 50 years, such that a 61% increased risk of HAT\u2010related graft loss (relative risk = 1.61, P < 0.001) was associated with donor age > 70 years. A separate analysis of risk factors for early HAT graft loss (\u226490 days) and late HAT graft loss (> 90 days) found that older donor age was associated with increased late HAT graft loss. These findings are of interest in an era of ongoing organ shortages requiring maximum utilization of potential allografts and increasing allocation of older allografts.

        "abstract": "The use of high\u2010risk donor livers, which is reflective of the gross national shortage of organs available for transplantation, has gained momentum. Despite the demand, many marginal livers are discarded annually. We evaluated the impact of center volume on survival outcomes associated with liver transplantation using high\u2013donor risk index (DRI) allografts. We queried the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database for deceased donor liver transplants (n = 31,576) performed between 2002 and 2008 for patients who were 18 years old or older, and we excluded partial and multiple liver transplants. A high\u2010DRI cohort (n = 15,668), which was composed of patients receiving grafts with DRIs > 1.90, was analyzed separately. Transplant centers (n = 102) were categorized into tertiles by their annual procedure volumes: high\u2010volume centers (HVCs; 78\u2010215 cases per year), medium\u2010volume centers (MVCs; 49\u201077 cases per year), and low\u2010volume centers (LVCs; 5\u201048 cases per year). The endpoints were allograft survival and recipient survival. In comparison with their lower volume counterparts, HVCs used donors with higher mean DRIs (2.07 for HVCs, 2.01 for MVCs, and 1.91 for LVCs), more donors who were 60 years old or older (18.02% for HVCs, 16.85% for MVCs, and 12.39% for LVCs), more donors who died after a stroke (46.52% for HVCs, 43.71% for MVCs, and 43.36% for LVCs), and more donation after cardiac death organs (5.04% for HVCs, 4.45% for MVCs, and 3.51% for LVCs, all P values < 0.001). Multivariate risk\u2010adjusted frailty models showed that increased procedure volume at a transplant center led to decreased risks of allograft failure [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89\u20100.98, P = 0.002] and recipient death (HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83\u20100.97, P = 0.004) for high\u2010DRI liver transplants. In conclusion, HVCs more frequently used higher DRI livers and achieved better risk\u2010adjusted allograft and recipient survival.

        "abstract": "Because of the shortage of deceased donor organs, transplant centers accept organs from marginal deceased donors, including older donors. Organ\u2010specific donor risk indices have been developed to predict graft survival with various combinations of donor and recipient characteristics. Here we review the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) and the liver donor risk index (LDRI) and compare and contrast their strengths, limitations, and potential uses. The KDRI has a potential role in developing new kidney allocation algorithms. The LDRI allows a greater appreciation of the importance of donor factors, particularly for hepatitis C virus\u2013positive recipients; as the donor risk index increases, the rates of allograft and patient survival among these recipients decrease disproportionately. The use of livers with high donor risk indices is associated with increased hospital costs that are independent of recipient risk factors, and the transplantation of livers with high donor risk indices into patients with Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease scores < 15 is associated with lower allograft survival; the use of the LDRI has limited this practice. Significant regional variations in donor quality, as measured by the LDRI, remain in the United States. We also review other potential indices for liver transplantation, including donor\u2010recipient matching and the retransplant donor risk index. Although substantial progress has been made in developing donor risk indices to objectively assess donor variables that affect transplant outcomes, continued efforts are warranted to improve these indices to enhance organ allocation policies and optimize allograft survival.

        "abstract": "Variation in deceased-donor kidney quality can significantly affect outcomes after kidney transplantation. Suboptimal organ selection for a given recipient can result in primary nonfunction, premature graft failure, or inappropriate discard of a suitable organ. Appraisal and appropriate selection of deceased-donor kidneys for use in transplantation is therefore critical. A number of predictive tools have been developed to assist the transplant team in evaluating the suitability of a deceased-donor kidney for transplantation to a given recipient. These include stratification of donors into \u201cstandard-\u201d or \u201cexpanded-criteria\u201d categories based on clinical parameters, pre-implantation biopsy scores, donor risk scores, machine perfusion characteristics, functional kidney weight, donor biomarkers and molecular diagnostic tools, ex vivo viability assessment using postmortem normothermic perfusion, and overall macroscopic appraisal by the surgical team. Consensus as to the role and predictive value of each of these tools is lacking and clinical practice regarding evaluation and selection of kidneys varies considerably. In this review, we seek to critically appraise the literature and evaluate the levels of evidence for tools used to assess deceased-donor kidneys. Although a plethora of appraisal tools exist, very few demonstrate desirable predictive power to be useful in clinical decision-making. Further research using large, well-designed prospective studies is urgently needed to advance this important field of transplantation science.",

We prospectively determined associations between perfusate biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase\u2013associated lipocalin [NGAL], kidney injury molecule 1, IL\u201018 and liver\u2010type fatty acid\u2013binding protein [L\u2010FABP]) and pump parameters (resistance and flow) with outcomes of delayed graft function (DGF) and 6\u2010mo estimated GFR (eGFR). DGF occurred in 230 of 671 (34%) recipients. Only 1\u2010h flow was inversely associated with DGF. Higher NGAL or L\u2010FABP concentrations and increased resistance were inversely associated with 6\u2010mo eGFR, whereas higher flow was associated with higher adjusted 6\u2010mo eGFR. Discarded kidneys had consistently higher median resistance and lower median flow than transplanted kidneys, but median perfusate biomarker concentrations were either lower or not significantly different in discarded compared with transplanted kidneys. Notably, most recipients of transplanted kidneys with isolated \u201cundesirable\u201d biomarker levels or HMP parameters experienced acceptable 6\u2010mo allograft function, suggesting these characteristics should not be used in isolation for discard decisions.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to possess the capacity to stimulate kidney repair. Therefore, the combination of NMP and MSC therapy offers potential to repair transplant kidneys. It is however unknown how NMP conditions affect MSC. In this study the effect of NMP perfusion fluid on survival, metabolism and function of thawed cryopreserved human (h)MSC and porcine (p)MSC in suspension conditions was studied. Suspension conditions reduced the viability of pMSC by 40% in both perfusion fluid and culture medium. Viability of hMSC was reduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid, whilst no differences were found in survival in culture medium. Under adherent conditions, survival of the cells was not affected by perfusion fluid. The perfusion fluid did not affect survival of fresh MSC in suspension compared to the control culture medium. The freeze-thawing process impaired the survival of hMSC; 95% survival of fresh hMSC compared to 70% survival of thawed hMSC. Moreover, thawed MSC showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species, which indicates elevated levels of oxidative stress, and reduced mitochondrial activity, which implies reduced metabolism. The adherence of pMSC and hMSC to endothelial cells was reduced after the thawing process, effect which was particularly profound in in the perfusion fluid. To summarize, we observed that conditions required for machine perfusion are influencing the behavior of MSC. The freeze-thawing process reduces survival and metabolism and increases oxidative stress, and diminishes their ability to adhere to endothelial cells. In addition, we found that hMSC and pMSC behaved differently, which has to be taken into consideration when translating results from animal experiments to clinical studies.",

Cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to determine cell viability. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to detect gene expressions. Hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining were performed to observe the histopathological changes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect the kidney markers\u2019 expression. In vivo and in vitro results showed that miR-192-5p was up-regulated in the I/R-induced mice model and H/R-induced cell model, and miR-192-5p overexpression exacerbated I/R-induced renal damage. Then, the downstream target of miR-192-5p was analyzed by combining the differentially expressed mRNAs and the predicted genes and confirmed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. It was found that miR-192-5p was found to regulate fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein expression by directly targeting the 3\u2019 untranslated region of FTO mRNA. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies unveiled that FTO overexpression alleviated renal I/R injury and promoted HK-2 cell viability via stimulating autophagy flux. In conclusion, miR-192-5p aggravated I/R-induced renal injury by blocking autophagy flux via down-regulating FTO.",

        "title": "Mouse kidney transplantation model: Three novel methods",
        "abstract": "Objective The mouse kidney transplantation model presents challenges in terms of surgical difficulty and low success rate, making it difficult to master. This study aims to provide a crucial model for transplantation immunology research by modifying and developing novel techniques for mouse kidney transplantation. Methods A total of 57 pairs of mice were used to establish and compare the modified and innovative surgical techniques for mouse kidney transplantation. Three different surgical models were established, including the abdominal suture technique for orthotopic kidney transplantation, the abdominal cuff technique for orthotopic kidney transplantation, and the cervical cuff technique for ectopic kidney transplantation. BALB/c or C57BL/6 male mice, aged 8 to 12 weeks and weighed 20 to 25 g with specified pathogen free-grade were served as the donor mice or the recipient mice. The surgical technique characteristics, key surgical times, complications, and pathological examination in the early postoperative period were summarized and compared. Results Three different surgical models of mouse kidney transplantation were successfully established. The comparison of warm ischemic time for the 3 groups of mice showed no statistical significance (P=0.510 4). The abdominal suture group had the shortest total operation time of the donor compared with the abdominal cuff group and the cervical cuff group [(18.3\u00b13.6) min vs (26.2\u00b14.7) min and (22.8\u00b12.5) min; both P<0.000 1]. There was a significant difference in cold ischemia time among the 3 groups (all P<0.000 1), with (60.8\u00b14.1) min in the cervical cuff group, (43.3\u00b15.0) min in the abdominal suture group, and (88.8\u00b16.7) min in the abdominal cuff group. Due to different anastomosis methods, the cervical cuff group had the shortest time [(17.6\u00b12.7) min], whereas the abdominal cuff group had the longest time [(38.8\u00b15.4) min]. The total operation time for the recipients showed significant differences (P<0.000 1), with the abdominal suture group having the shortest time [(44.0\u00b16.9) min], followed by the cervical cuff group [(64.1\u00b15.2) min], and the abdominal cuff group [(80.0\u00b16.0) min] being the longest. In the 32 mice of the abdominal suture group, there were 6 with intraoperative bleeding, including 1 arterial intimal injury bleeding and 5 with bleeding after vessel opening. Six mice had ureteral complications, including ureteral bladder anastomotic stenosis, necrosis, and renal pelvis dilation. Two mice had postoperative abdominal infections. In the abdominal cuff group, there was no intraoperative bleeding, but 6 mice showed mild arterial stenosis and 5 showed venous stenosis, 4 arterial injury, 4 arterial thrombosis, and 2 ureteral complications. No postoperative infections occurred in the mice. In the cervical cuff group, no intraoperative bleeding, arterial intimal injury, arterial/venous stenosis, or thrombosis were found in 13 mice. Five mice had ureteral complications, including ureteral necrosis and infection, which were the main complications in the cervical cuff group. The renal function in mice of the 3 groups remained stable 7 days after surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining showed no significant differences in terms of acute rejection among the 3 surgical methods (all P>0.05). Conclusion All 3 surgical methods are able to successfully establish mouse kidney transplantation models, with no significant differences observed in the short-term graft survival and acute rejection. The modified abdominal suture technique and abdominal cuff technique have their respective advantages in research applications. The novel cervical cuff technique for ectopic kidney transplantation model is relatively simple to be prepared and causes less trauma to the mice, providing more options for studies involving xenotransplantation, secondary transplantation, and local lymphatic drainage. However, the difficulty in harvesting the donor kidney and the high incidence of ureteral infections need further validation in long-term survival. This study holds important reference value for choosing the type of mouse kidney transplantation model for different research needs.",
