        "title": "Recombinant factor VIIa for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a randomized, double-blind trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a severe and frequent complication of cirrhosis. Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been shown to correct the prolonged prothrombin time in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB. This trial aimed to determine efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in cirrhotic patients with variceal and nonvariceal UGIB.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 245 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh < 13; Child-Pugh A = 20%, B = 52%, C = 28%) with UGIB (variceal = 66%, nonvariceal = 29%, bleeding source unknown = 5%) were randomized equally to receive 8 doses of 100 microg/kg rFVIIa or placebo in addition to pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment. The primary end point was a composite including: (1) failure to control UGIB within 24 hours after first dose, or (2) failure to prevent rebleeding between 24 hours and day 5, or (3) death within 5 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics were similar between rFVIIa and placebo groups. rFVIIa showed no advantage over standard treatment in the whole trial population. Exploratory analyses, however, showed that rFVIIa significantly decreased the number of failures on the composite end point (P = 0.03) and the 24-hour bleeding control end point (P = 0.01) in the subgroup of Child-Pugh B and C variceal bleeders. There were no significant differences between rFVIIa and placebo groups in mortality (5- or 42-day) or incidence of adverse events including thromboembolic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough no overall effect of rFVIIa was observed, exploratory analyses in Child-Pugh B and C cirrhotic patients indicated that administration of rFVIIa significantly decreased the proportion of patients who failed to control variceal bleeding. Dosing with rFVIIa appeared safe. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY \n \n \nThe Consensus Document on Alternatives to Allogeneic Blood Transfusion (AABT) has been drawn up by a panel of experts from five scientific societies. The Spanish societies of anesthesiology (SEDAR), critical care medicine and coronary units (SEMICYUC), hematology and hemotherapy (AEHH), blood transfusion (SETS), and thrombosis and hemostasis (SETH) have sponsored and participated in this consensus document. Alternatives to blood transfusion have been divided into pharmacological and nonpharmacological, with four modules and 12 topics. The main objective variable was the reduction of allogeneic blood transfusions and/or the number of transfused patients. The extent to which this objective was achieved by each AABT was evaluated using the Delphi methodology, which classifies the grades of recommendation from \u2018A\u2019 (supported by controlled studies) to \u2018E\u2019 (noncontrolled studies and expert opinion). The experts concluded that most of the indications for AABT only attained middle or low grades of recommendation, \u2018C\u2019, \u2018D\u2019 or \u2018E\u2019, thus indicating the need for further controlled studies.",

MTPs using adequate volumes of plasma, and thus coagulation factors, improve patient outcome. The ideal amounts of plasma, platelet, cryoprecipitate and other coagulation factors given in MTPs in relationship to the red blood cell transfusion volume are not known precisely, but until prospective, randomized, clinical trials are performed and more clinical data are obtained, current data support a target ratio of plasma:red blood cell:platelet transfusions of 1:1:1. Future prospective clinical trials will allow continued improvement in MTPs and thus in the overall management of patients with trauma.",

However, plasma product transfusion according to CR became increasingly popular in US civilian trauma ceners and operating rooms.17,19 The prevention of trauma-induced coagulopathy and subsequent nonsurgical bleeding is a major advantage of DCR,20 but the DCR approach lacks a specific target for replacement and a consideration for interindividual variability in coagulation factor levels and vascular (endothelial) responses.

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives. Natural colloid albumin induces a lesser degree of dilutional coagulopathy than synthetic colloids. Fibrinogen concentrate has emerged as a promising strategy to treat coagulopathy, and factor XIII (FXIII) works synergistically with fibrinogen to correct coagulopathy following haemodilution with crystalloids. Our objectives were to examine the ability of fibrinogen and FXIII concentrates to reverse albumin-induced dilutional coagulopathy. Methods. High and low concentrations of both fibrinogen and FXIII were used to reverse coagulopathy induced by 1:1 dilution in vitro with 5% albumin of blood samples from healthy volunteers, monitored by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM\u00ae). Results. Haemodilution with albumin significantly attenuated EXTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), alpha angle (AA), clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), and FIBTEM MCF (p < 0.001). Following haemodilution, both doses of fibrinogen significantly corrected all ROTEM parameters (p \u2264 0.02), except the lower dose did not correct AA. Compared to the lower dose, the higher dose of fibrinogen significantly improved FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM MCF, AA and CFT (p < 0.001). The lower dose of FXIII did not significantly correct any of the ROTEM parameters, and the high dose only improved EXTEM CT (p = 0.004). All combinations of high/low concentrations of fibrinogen/FXIII significantly improved all ROTEM parameters examined (p \u2264 0.001). Fibrinogen concentration generally had a greater effect on each parameter than did FXIII concentration; the best correction of ROTEM parameters was achieved with high-dose fibrinogen concentrate and either low- or high-dose FXIII. Conclusions. Fibrinogen concentrate successfully corrected initiation, propagation and clot firmness deficits induced by haemodilution with albumin, and FXIII synergistically improved fibrin-based clot strength.",

        "abstract": "Background Albumin treatment of ischemic stroke was associated with cardiopulmonary adverse events in previous studies and a low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage. We sought to describe the neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events in the ALIAS Part 2 Multicenter Trial. Methods Ischemic stroke patients, aged 18\u201383 and a baseline NIHSS \u2265 6, were randomized to treatment with ALB or saline control within 5 hours of stroke onset. Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, hemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. Cardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolism. Results Among 830 patients, neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events were not differentially associated with poor outcome between ALB and saline control subjects. The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first 24h was low overall (2.9%, 24/830) but more common in the ALB treated subjects (RR = 2.4, CI95 1.01\u20135.8). The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was 7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 4.3\u201326.6); this complication was expected and was satisfactorily managed with mandated diuretic administration and intravenous fluid guidelines. Troponin elevations in the first 48h were common, occurring without ECG change or cardiac symptoms in 52 subjects (12.5%). Conclusions ALB therapy was associated with an increase in symptomatic ICH and pulmonary edema/congestive heart failure but this did not affect final outcomes.

Blood samples were collected immediately before PT and at 1\u2009h and 24\u2009h after PT.

Electron microscopy explained the gain of stiffness. Incorporated RBCs weakened the clots. Reduction of temperature during the clotting process supported the development of high moduli by providing more time for fiber assembly. But at low HCT, clot firmness could be increased by elevating the temperature from 32 to 37\u00b0C. In contrast, when the fibrinogen concentration was modified, acceleration of clotting via temperature always reduced clot stiffness, whatever the initial fibrinogen concentration. Electrical resistance increased continuously during clotting; loss tangent (D) (relaxation frequency 249\u200akHz) decreased when clots became denser: fewer dipoles contributed to the relaxation process. The relaxation peak (Dmax) shifted to lower frequencies at higher platelet count.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncreasing temperature accelerates clot formation but weakens clots.

        "abstract": "Objective: There is uncertainty about deep vein thrombosis standard treatment as thrombus stiffness alters each case. Here, we investigated thrombus\u2019 stiffness of different compositions and ages using shear wave elastography (SWE). We then studied the effectiveness of ultrasound-thrombolysis on different thrombus compositions. Methods: Shear waves generated through mechanical shaker and traveled along thrombus of different hematocrit (HCT) levels, whereas 18-MHz ultrasound array used to detect wave propagation. Thrombus\u2019 stiffness was identified by the shear wave speed (SWS). In thrombolysis, a 3.2 MHz focused transducer was applied to different thrombus compositions using different powers. The thrombolysis rate was defined as the percentage of weight loss. Results: The estimated average SWS of 20%, 40%, and 60% HCT thrombus were 0.75 m/s, 0.44 m/s, and 0.32 m/s, respectively. For Thrombolysis, the percentage weight loss at 8 MPa Negative pressure for the same HCT groups were 23.1%, 35.29%, and 39.66% respectively. Conclusion: SWS is inversely related to HCT level and positively related to thrombus age. High HCT thrombus had higher weight loss compared to low HCT. However, the difference between 20% and 40% HCT was more significant than between 40% and 60% HCT in both studies. Our results suggest that thrombus with higher SWS require more power to achieve the same thrombolysis rate as thrombus with lower SWS. Significance: Characterizing thrombus elastic property undergoing thrombolysis enables evaluation of ultrasound efficacy for fractionating thrombus and reveals the appropriate ultrasound parameters selection to achieve a certain thrombolysis rate in the case of a specific thrombus stiffness.",
