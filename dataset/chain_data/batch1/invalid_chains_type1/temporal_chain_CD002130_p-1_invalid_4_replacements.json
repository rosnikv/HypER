        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPlatelets are believed to play a part in the ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty, such as abrupt closure of the coronary vessel during or soon after the procedure. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhen administered in conjunction with primary coronary stenting for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may provide additional clinical benefit, but data on this combination therapy are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 300 patients with acute myocardial infarction in a double-blind fashion either to abciximab plus stenting (149 patients) or placebo plus stenting (151 patients) before they underwent coronary angiography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 30 days and 6 months after the procedure. The angiographic patency of the infarct-related vessel and the left ventricular ejection fraction were evaluated at 24 hours and 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 30 days, the primary end point--a composite of death, reinfarction, or urgent revascularization of the target vessel--had occurred in 6.0 percent of the patients in the abciximab group, as compared with 14.6 percent of those in the placebo group (P=0.01); at 6 months, the corresponding figures were 7.4 percent and 15.9 percent (P=0.02). The better clinical outcomes in the abciximab group were related to the greater frequency of grade 3 coronary flow (according to the classification of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) in this group than in the placebo group before the procedure (16.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent, P=0.01), immediately afterward (95.1 percent vs. 86.7 percent, P=0.04), and six months afterward (94.3 percent vs. 82.8 percent, P=0.04). One major bleeding event occurred in the abciximab group (0.7 percent); none occurred in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with placebo, early administration of abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction improves coronary patency before stenting, the success rate of the stenting procedure, the rate of coronary patency at six months, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Stenting has become standard treatment for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clinical impressions continue to support this as a user friendly, safe, and efficacious technology\n\nThe National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was established in the light of a perceived need for a regulatory body to review the efficacy of existing and new treatments and to appraise technological developments. It was seen as being important for the following reasons: (1) there was and is slow uptake, even of innovations of perceived benefit; (2) judgements on the interpretation or significance of the evidence can be different in different parts of the country, resulting in variations in the access for patients to the new treatments with the widespread perception of inequity; (3) wasteful use of resources can occur when treatments are used outside the range in which they are clinically cost effective, at the expense of alternative uses of those resources which could give greater benefits to patients.\n\nThe key functions of NICE are technology appraisal of both new and existing interventions, in order to assess clinical benefit and cost effectiveness. Guidelines are issued and information disseminated. It is expected that progress will be audited. Advocates suggest that the good things about NICE include the fact that it was badly needed, and that it is transparent, has authority, and it has been able to rationalise the often difficult debate between clinicians and purchasers. It produces evidence based reports. Its detractors would claim it takes evidence from experts who had \u201csomething to sell\u201d, and that it tends to depend too heavily on randomised clinical trials, which select populations, rather than to also use registry data.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of coronary artery stents in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nThe review was conducted following accepted guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials that include comparisons of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) versus PTCA with stent, stent versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and drug-eluting stents (DES) versus non-DES in patients with CAD in native or graft vessels and those with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and unstable angina were also included. Data on the following outcome measures were included in the review: combined event rate or event-free survival, death, acute myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation, repeat treatment (PTCA, stent or CABG) and binary restenosis. An economic model was developed based on extrapolation of trends in mortality and revascularisation from clinical trials data to a 5-year time horizon.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 50 studies comparing the use of stents with PTCA, six comparing stents with CABG and 12 comparing DES eluting stents with non-DES. No studies were identified that compared DES with PTCA or DES with CABG. Existing quality of life data suggest that revascularisation procedures reduce the patient's quality of life for a short period only. Stents were found to be more effective than PTCA in preventing adverse events and revascularisations. In multiple-vessel disease there was no evidence of a difference in mortality (at 1 year) between patients treated surgically and those receiving a stent. Patients treated surgically required fewer revascularisations. There is no evidence of a difference in mortality between patients receiving DES and those treated with bare metal stents at 1 year. A reduction in event rate at 9 and 12 months was found in patients treated with DES. This event rate is primarily made up of increased revascularisation rates in patients treated with bare metal stents. Two-year outcome data from one study indicate that this benefit of DES continues over the longer term. The economic model proved sufficient to indicate long-term trends in cost-effectiveness. CABG was found initially to be more expensive than bare metal stenting in multivessel disease and may have higher immediate risks, but over time the cost differential is reduced and long-term outcomes favour CABG over stenting. A similar situation was found for DES versus CABG in multiple-vessel disease. However, DES may not generally be considered a cost-effective alternative to bare metal stenting in single-vessel disease by policy makers as substantially higher costs are involved with a very small outcome benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDES might be considered cost-effective if the additional cost (compared with ordinary stents) was substantially reduced, the outcome benefits from the use of DES were much improved, and/or its use were targeted on the subgroups of patients with the highest risks of requiring reintervention. Long-term clinical studies are needed that focus on significant outcomes such as mortality. Further research should consider: the differences among plain stents; head-to-head comparisons within DES, CABG compared with DES; and the evaluation of newer non-DES against DES. Evaluation of the effects of revascularisation procedures and especially repeat revascularisation procedures on the patient's quality of life would also be useful, as would the development and testing of risk assessment tools to identify patients likely to need further revascularisations.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of drug eluting stents (DES) compared with conventional stents for treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease in the UK. Design: Cost\u2013utility analysis of audit based patient subgroups by means of a simple economic model. Setting: Tertiary care. Participants: 12 month audit data for 2884 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting at the Cardiothoracic Centre Liverpool between January 2000 and December 2002. Main outcome measures: Risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months of index procedure and reduction in risk from use of DES. Economic modelling was used to estimate the cost\u2013utility ratio and threshold price premium. Results: Four factors were identified for patients undergoing elective surgery (n \u200a=\u200a 1951) and two for non-elective surgery (n \u200a=\u200a 933) to predict risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months. Most patients fell within the subgroup with lowest risk (57% of the elective surgery group with 5.6% risk and 91% of the non-elective surgery group with 9.9% risk). Modelled cost\u2013utility ratios were acceptable for only one group of high risk patients undergoing non-elective surgery (only one patient in audit data). Restricting the number of DES for each patient improved results marginally: 4% of stents could then be drug eluting on economic grounds. The threshold price premium justifying 90% substitution of conventional stents was estimated to be \u00a3112 (US$212, \u20ac162) (sirolimus stents) or \u00a389 (US$167, \u20ac130) (paclitaxel stents). Conclusions: At current UK prices, DES are not cost effective compared with conventional stents except for a small minority of patients. Although the technology is clearly effective, general substitution is not justified unless the price premium falls substantially.",

In fact there has been an explosion of published reports on the topic within cardiology, medical, surgical and subspecialty journals. The device industry has repeatedly sent their own summaries of information directly to physicians, while mainstream media has kept the consumer and Wall Street appraised of safety concerns, often with sensational headlines. The Food and Drug Administration has also taken notice by convening a meeting on DES in late 2006. What have we learned through all this dissemination of data?\n\nArticle p 745 \n\nThe introduction of DES was greeted with intense enthusiasm in a \u201cperfect storm\u201d sort of way. Device representatives were eager to promote this new product that could dramatically reduce restenosis.1 Patients expected to be treated with this new and \u201cbetter\u201d technology. Lastly, cardiologists had a potent new tool at their disposal that they increasingly incorporated into practice until it became the default revascularization device instead of bare-metal stents in many parts of the world. This quick and widespread adoption in DES resulted in its frequent use in relatively untested and off-label indications. At the Cleveland Clinic, the use of DES mirrored the community and many interventional practices throughout the world, where the penetration of this device peaked at >90%.\n\nWhile DES use was increasing, McFadden and colleagues sounded an alarm with the publication of a report on 4 patients who experienced late stent thrombosis.2 Although this could have been a chance finding, DES were systematically shown to confer an increased risk of late thrombosis relative to bare-metal stents.3 This safety issue has been confirmed by several independent analyses with patient-level data from the pivotal randomized trials.1,4,5\n\nStent thrombosis is uncommon, although when it occurs it \u2026",

        "abstract": "Background: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stent implantation are associated with intimal hyperplasia and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, resulting in restenosis. We showed that local delivery of 17-beta-estradiol (17\u03b2E) reduced restenosis following PTCA and stent implantation by 47 and 23%, respectively. Because estrogens decreased type I and type III collagen synthesis in vitro, we hypothesized that local delivery of 17\u03b2E may influence intimal hyperplasia formation by modulating ECM expression. Methods: Porcine coronary arteries underwent PTCA or stenting and were randomly assigned to 17\u03b2E or placebo. After 28 days, animals were sacrificed for histology and collagen type I and III content analysis. Results: Both collagen subtypes increased in the media by 1.7 to 2.6-fold after PTCA and by 15.7 to 16.1-fold after stenting, as compared to PTCA segments. In the neointima, the ratio of collagen type III to type I was 2.7 in stented arteries and only 0.3 in PTCA arteries. In the neointima of 17\u03b2E-treated animals, collagen type I (but not type III) content upregulation was limited by 53% after PTCA and by 74% after stenting.

Methods and Results\u2014 Consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for ULMD had prospective platelet reactivity assessment by light transmittance aggregometry after a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel. The primary end point of the study was cardiac mortality, and the secondary end point was stent thrombosis. From January 2005 to September 2008, 215 consecutive patients were treated with DES for ULMD. The incidence of HRPR after clopidogrel loading was 18.6%. The median follow-up was 19.3 months. The overall estimated 1-, 2- and 3-year cardiac mortality rate was 3.9\u00b11.3%, 7.5\u00b12.2%, and 12.2\u00b13.4%, respectively. The 3-year cardiac mortality rate was 8.0\u00b13.1% in the low residual platelet reactivity (LRPR) group and 28.3\u00b110.4% in the HRPR group (P=0.005). The 3-year stent thrombosis rate was 4.2\u00b11.8% in the low residual platelet reactivity group and 16.0\u00b17.3% in the HRPR group (P=0.021). By forward stepwise regression analysis, HRPR after clopidogrel loading was the only independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio, 3.82; 95% confidence interval,1.38 to 10.54; P=0.010) and stent thrombosis (hazard ratio, 3.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 12.09; P=0.031). Conclusions\u2014 HRPR after 600-mg clopidogrel loading is a strong marker of increased risk of cardiac death and DES thrombosis in patients receiving DES stenting for ULMD. Routine assessment of in vitro residual platelet reactivity after clopidogrel loading in patients with ULMD potentially suitable for DES-supported percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered to guide patient care decisions.",

        "abstract": "Summary In patients suffering from acute coronary syndromes or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, oral antiplatelet treatment is routinely administered with the primary aim of inhibiting platelet-mediated thrombus formation and subsequent abrupt vessel occlusion. Simultaneous inhibition of blood platelet cyclooxygenase-1 by aspirin and of the P2Y12 receptor by clopidogrel or prasugrel is currently recommended in this setting. Inter-individual response variability to aspirin and especially to clopidogrel is the subject of much debate as evidence has grown over the years linking an attenuated response to treatment with the occurrence of ischaemic events. Consequently, the clinical entity of high (on-treatment) platelet reactivity (HPR) was born and subsequently characterised in numerous studies over the last decade. Until recently, alternative treatment options were limited in patients exhibiting HPR. At present the antiplatelet therapy landscape is changing with the advent of prasugrel and ticagrelor as alternative and more potent treatment options. Different tests for monitoring platelet function are available and are being increasingly employed in research projects and clinical routine. These tests may prove useful for achieving optimal platelet inhibition for the individual patient, and several centres now incorporate such testing in day-to-day practice. Widespread adoption of this practice and incorporation into clinical guidelines awaits the results of ongoing trials in which treatment is changed based on platelet function monitoring. This review aims to summarise available facts and fiction in relation to platelet function testing and reactivity with a particular focus on P2Y12 receptor inhibition in patients undergoing coronary stent placement.",

Patients undergoing these treatments may be receiving exogenous anticoagulants and antithrombotics. Even though the risk of major bleeding is very small, the consequences can be catastrophic. However, the role of antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease to decrease the incidence of acute cerebral and cardiovascular events is also crucial. Overall, there is a paucity of literature on the subject of bleeding risk in interventional pain management along with practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and anti-thrombotic therapy.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nBest evidence synthesis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo critically appraise and synthesize the literature with assessment of the bleeding risk of interventional techniques including practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe available literature on the bleeding risk of interventional techniques and practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was reviewed. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 through December 2012 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients who discontinue antithrombotic therapy, spontaneous epidural hematomas occur with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy associated with stressors such as chiropractic manipulation, diving, and anatomic abnormalities such as ankylosing spondylitis, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques. There is fair evidence that excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation may occur with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon is higher than the risk of epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques, to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal], and Aggrenox [aspirin and dipyridamole]), and that anatomic conditions such as spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis, and procedures involving the cervical spine; multiple attempts; and large bore needles increase the risk of epidural hematoma; and rapid assessment and surgical or nonsurgical intervention to manage patients with epidural hematoma can avoid permanent neurological complications. There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), or prasugrel (Effient) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities. There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas during interventional techniques and to continue to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe recommendations derived from the comprehensive assessment of the literature and guidelines are to continue NSAIDs and low dose aspirin, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole, cilostazol, Aggrenox) during interventional techniques. However, the recommendations for discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) is variable with clinical judgment to continue or discontinue based on the patient's condition, the planned procedure, risk factors, and desires, and the cardiologist's opinion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin may be discontinued 12 hours prior to performing interventional techniques. Warfarin should be discontinued or international normalized ratio (INR) be normalized to 1.4 or less for high risk procedures and 2 or less for low risk procedures based on risk factors. It is also recommended to discontinue Pradaxa for 24 hours for paravertebral interventional techniques in 2 to 4 days for epidural interventions in patients with normal renal function and for longer periods of time in patients with renal impairment, and to discontinue rivaroxaban for 24 hours prior to performing interventional techniques.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\u00a0 The paucity of the literature.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the available literature including guidelines, the recommendations in patients with antithrombotic therapy for therapy prior to interventional techniques are provided.",

Diffusion-positive lesions were classified into 3 groups according to the number of lesions (n = 0 [grade 0], n < 6 [grade I], and n \u2265 6 [grade II]). The relationship between antiplatelet resistance and diffusion-positive lesions was analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two endovascular coiling procedures were performed on 58 patients. Clopidogrel resistance was revealed in 23 patients (39.7%) and diffusion-positive lesions were demonstrated in 28 patients (48.3%); these consisted of 19 (32.8%) grade I and 9 (15.5%) grade II lesions. Clopidogrel resistance was not relevant to the development of any diffusion-positive lesion (grade I and II, P = .789) but was associated with the development of multiple diffusion-positive lesions (grade II, P = .002). In the logistic regression prediction model, clopidogrel resistance showed significant correlation with the development of grade II lesions (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple diffusion-positive lesions (\u22656 in number) occurred more frequently in patients with clopidogrel resistance after endovascular coiling for unruptured aneurysms.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Procedure-related thromboembolism is a major limitation of coil embolization, but the relationship between thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet resistance is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to verify the association between immediate postprocedural thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet drug resistance after endovascular coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 338 aneurysms between October 2012 and March 2015. All patients underwent postprocedural MR imaging within 48 hours after endovascular coil embolization. Antiplatelet drug resistance was checked a day before the procedure by using the VerifyNow system. Abnormal antiplatelet response was defined as >550 aspirin response units and >240 P2Y12 receptor reaction units. In addition, we explored the optimal cutoff values of aspirin response units and P2Y12 receptor reaction units. The primary outcome was radiologic infarction based on postprocedural MR imaging. RESULTS: Among 338 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 134 (39.6%) showed diffusion-positive lesions on postprocedural MR imaging, and 32 (9.5%) and 105 (31.1%) had abnormal aspirin response unit and P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values, respectively. Radiologic infarction was associated with advanced age (65 years and older, P = .024) only with defined abnormal antiplatelet response (aspirin response units \u2265 550, P2Y12 receptor reaction units \u2265 240). P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values in the top 10th percentile (>294) were associated with radiologic infarction (P = .003). With this cutoff value, age (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.28\u20134.08), P2Y12 receptor reaction units (>294; OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.53\u20137.71), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04\u20134.02) were associated with radiologic infarction in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic infarction after coiling for unruptured aneurysm was closely associated with age. Only very high P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values (>294) predicted postprocedural infarction. Further controlled studies are needed to determine the precise cutoff values, which could provide information regarding the optimal antiplatelet regimen for aneurysm coiling.",

Thromboembolic and hemorrhagic adverse events were compared between 207 patients who received low-dose prasugrel (PSG group) and 90 patients who received clopidogrel (CPG group).\n\n\nRESULTS\nP2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values were significantly lower in the PSG group (PSG group vs CPG group, 132.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076.9 vs 238.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069.1; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001); the percentage of inhibition was also statistically higher in the PSG group (54.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.0% vs 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Thromboembolic events occurred less frequently in the PSG group than in the CPG group (0.9% vs 6.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01), whereas there was no significant difference in the percentage of hemorrhagic complications (0.5% vs 2.2%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.22). In the multivariate analysis, clopidogrel as the antiplatelet medication was the sole significant risk factor for thromboembolism in this series of patients undergoing stent-assisted coil embolization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUse of low-dose PSG as an antiplatelet premedication is quick, effective, and safe for stent-assisted coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Prasugrel premedication significantly lowered the frequency of thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is routinely used to decrease ischemic complications during neurointerventional procedures. However, the efficacy may be limited by antiplatelet resistance. PURPOSE: Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the cerebrovascular field. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of 2 large databases was performed for studies published from 2000 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting treatment-related outcomes of patients undergoing neurointerventional procedures under prasugrel, and studies comparing prasugrel and clopidogrel. DATA ANALYSIS: Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the overall rate of complications, ischemic and hemorrhagic events, and influence of the dose of prasugrel. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the 7 included studies, 682 and 672 unruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated under prasugrel (cases) and clopidogrel (controls), respectively. Low-dose (20 mg/5 mg; loading and maintenance doses) prasugrel compared with the standard dose of clopidogrel (300 mg/75 mg) showed a significant reduction in the complication rate (OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17\u201374, P = .006; I2 = 0%). Overall, the ischemic complication rate was significantly higher in the clopidogrel group (40/672 = 6%; 95% CI, 3%\u201313%; I2 = 83% versus 16/682 = 2%; 95% CI, 1%\u20135%; I2 = 73%; P = .03). Low and high loading doses of prasugrel were associated with 0.6% (5/535; 95% CI, 0.1%\u20131.6%; I2 = 0%) and 9.3% (13/147; 95% CI, 0.2%\u201318%; I2 = 60%) intraperiprocedural hemorrhages, respectively (P = .001), whereas low and high maintenance doses of prasugrel were associated with 0% (0/433) and 0.9% (2/249; 95% CI, 0.3%\u20132%; I2 = 0%) delayed hemorrhagic events, respectively (P = .001). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective series and heterogeneous endovascular treatments were limitations. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, low-dose prasugrel compared with clopidogrel premedication was associated with an effective reduction of the ischemic events with an acceptable rate of hemorrhagic complications.",

        "abstract": "Background Thromboembolic complications (TECs) are frequent during the endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms. To prevent TECs, dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for the perioperative period. In patients with a poor response, clopidogrel is a risk factor for TECs. To prevent TECs, our study assessed the stratified use of prasugrel. Methods Patients who underwent endovascular therapy for unruptured cerebral aneurysms from April 2017 to August 2019 were enrolled in this clinical study and given premedication with aspirin and clopidogrel for 2 weeks prior to the procedure. P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) were measured using the VerifyNow assay on the day before the procedure (tailored group). In subgroups with PRU <240, the clopidogrel dose was maintained (CPG subgroup). In subgroups with PRU \u2265240, clopidogrel was changed to prasugrel (PSG subgroup). We compared the occurrence of TECs with retrospective consecutive cases from January 2015 to March 2017 without PRU assessments (non-tailored group). The frequency of TECs within 30 days was assessed as the primary endpoint. Results The tailored and non-tailored groups comprised 167 and 50 patients, respectively. TECs occurred in 11 (6.6%) and 8 (16%) patients in the tailored and non-tailored groups (P=0.048), respectively. The HR for TECs was significantly reduced in the tailored group (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.81); P=0.017) compared with the non-tailored group. Conclusion The results suggest that tailored dual antiplatelet therapy medication with PRU significantly reduces the frequency of TECs without increasing hemorrhagic complications.",

        "abstract": "Background Antiplatelet therapy, where regimens are tailored based on platelet function testing, has been introduced into neurointerventional surgery. This nationwide registry study evaluated the effect and safety of tailored antiplatelet therapy in stent assisted coiling for unruptured aneurysms compared with conventional therapy using a standard regimen. Methods This study enrolled 1686 patients in 44 participating centers who received stent assisted coiling for unruptured aneurysms between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. The standard regimen (aspirin and clopidogrel) was used for all patients in the conventional group (924, 19 centers). The regimen was selected based on platelet function testing (standard regimen for clopidogrel responders; adding cilostazol or replacing clopidogrel with other thienopyridines (ticlopidine, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for clopidogrel non-responders) in the tailored group (762, 25 centers). The primary outcome was thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes were bleeding and poor outcomes (increase in modified Rankin Scale score). Outcomes within 30 days after coiling were compared using logistic regression analysis. Results The thromboembolic event rate was lower in the tailored group than in the conventional group (30/762 (3.9%) vs 63/924 (6.8%), adjusted OR 0.560, 95% CI 0.359 to 0.875, P=0.001). The bleeding event rate was not different between the study groups (62/762 (8.1%) vs 73/924 (7.9%), adjusted OR 0.790, 95%\u2009CI 0.469 to 1.331, P=0.376). Poor outcomes were less frequent in the tailored group (12/762 (1.6%) vs 34 (3.7%), adjusted OR 0.252, 95%\u2009CI 0.112 to 0.568, P=0.001).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe optimal duration for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stent-assisted coiling (SAC) of intracranial aneurysms is unclear. Longer-term therapy may reduce thrombotic complications but increase the risk of bleeding complications.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review of prospectively maintained data at 12 institutions was conducted on patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who underwent SAC between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020, and were followed \u22656 months postprocedure. The type and duration of DAPT, stent(s) used, outcome, length of follow-up, complication rates, and incidence of significant in-stent stenosis (ISS) were collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 556 patients reviewed, 450 met all inclusion criteria. Nine patients treated with DAPT <29 days after SAC and 11 treated for 43-89 days were excluded from the final analysis as none completed their prescribed duration of treatment. Eighty patients received short-term DAPT. There were no significant differences in the rate of thrombotic complications during predefined periods of risk in the short, medium, or long-term treatment groups (1/80, 1.3%; 2/188, 1.1%; and 0/162, 0%, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found in the rate of hemorrhagic complications during period of risk in any group (0/80, 0%; 3/188, 1.6%; and 1/162, 0.6%, respectively). Longer duration DAPT did not reduce ISS risk in any group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuing DAPT >42 days after SAC did not reduce the risk of thrombotic complications or in-stent stenosis, although the risk of additional hemorrhagic complications remained low. It may be reasonable to discontinue DAPT after 42 days following non-flow diverting SAC of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.",
