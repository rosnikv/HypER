        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe effects of parenteral growth hormone, glutamine supplementation, and a high carbohydrate-low fat (HCLF) diet on gut adaptation in short-bowel syndrome are unclear. The aim of this study was to compare effects of this treatment regimen and placebo in patients with short-bowel syndrome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 8 patients with short-bowel syndrome (average small bowel length, 71 cm; mean duration, 12.9 years) was performed. Active treatment was growth hormone (0.14 mg.kg-1.day-1), oral glutamine (0.63 g.kg-1.day-1), and the HCLF diet for 21 days. The weight, basal metabolic rate, nutrient and electrolyte balance, serum insulin-like growth factor I levels, D-xylose absorption, morphology and DNA proliferation of small intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal transit were evaluated. Treatments were compared by paired t test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActive treatment transiently increased body weight, significantly but modestly increased the absorption of sodium and potassium, and decreased gastric emptying. The assimilation of macronutrients, stool volumes, and morphometry of small bowel mucosa were not statistically different in the two treatment arms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough treatment with growth hormone, glutamine, and HCLF diet for 3 weeks resulted in modest improvements in electrolyte absorption and delayed gastric emptying, there were no improvements in small bowel morphology, stool losses, or macronutrient absorption.",

        "abstract": "To determine whether treatment with a potent protease-resistant analog of human glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) might augment the adaptive response to massive intestinal resection, rats were divided into resected, which had 75% of the midjejunoileum removed, sham-resected, and nonsurgical groups. Within each group, animals were assigned to 21 days of treatment with the drug (0.1 \u03bcg/g of the GLP-2 analog in phosphate-buffered saline) or vehicle alone subcutaneously twice daily. Food intake; weight gain; jejunal and ileal diameters, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt depths, and villus heights; mucosal sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter, and micrograms of DNA per centimeter; andd-xylose absorption were measured. There was a significant increase in diameter, total and mucosal wet weights per centimeter, crypt-villus height, sucrase activity, milligrams of protein per centimeter and micrograms of DNA per centimeter in both the jejunum and ileum in response to resection and a significant additive response to the GLP-2 analog in the jejunum but not in the ileum. The ratio of milligrams of protein per centimeter to micrograms of DNA per centimeter of mucosa was not different among groups, consistent with hyperplasia.d-Xylose absorption was significantly reduced in response to resection; however, the GLP-2 analog enhanced the absorptive capacity in control animals and restored the absorptive capacity in resected animals. Thus the GLP-2 analog induces mucosal hyperplasia and enhances the rate and magnitude of the proximal intestinal adaptive response to massive resection.",

        "title": "Luminal and systemic signals trigger intestinal adaptation in the juvenile python.",
        "abstract": "Juvenile pythons undergo large rapid upregulation of intestinal mass and intestinal transporter activities upon feeding. Because it is also easy to do surgery on pythons and to maintain them in the laboratory, we used a python model to examine signals and agents for intestinal adaptation. We surgically isolated the middle third of the small intestine from enteric continuity, leaving its mesenteric nerve and vascular supply intact. Intestinal continuity was restored by an end-to-end anastomosis between the proximal and distal thirds. Within 24 h of the snake's feeding, the reanastomosed proximal and distal segments (receiving luminal nutrients) had upregulated amino acid and glucose uptakes by up to 15-fold, had doubled intestinal mass, and thereby soon achieved total nutrient uptake capacities equal to those of the normal fed full-length intestine. At this time, however, the isolated middle segment, receiving no luminal nutrients, experienced no changes from the fasted state in either nutrient uptakes or in morphology. By 3 days postfeeding, the isolated middle segment had upregulated nutrient uptakes to the same levels as the reanastomosed proximal and distal segments, but it still lacked any appreciable morphological response. These contrasting results for the reanastomosed intestine and for the isolated middle segment suggest that luminal nutrients and/or pancreatic biliary secretions are the agents triggering rapid upregulation of transporters and of intestinal mass and that systemic nerve or hormonal signals later trigger transporter regulation but no trophic response.",

        "abstract": "Maturation of the fetal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is influenced by both luminal stimuli (e.g. swallowed fluid) and hormonal factors (e.g. endogenous cortisol release). The aims of the present study were 1) to investigate GIT growth and maturation during the last 20% of gestation in pigs (term = 114 \u00b1 2 d), and 2) to investigate the effect of esophageal ligation, to prevent fetal swallowing, at 80% to 91% gestation. In normal fetuses, marked increases occurred during late gestation in body weight (+95%), relative intestinal weight (+79%, g kg\u22121 body weight), activity of some digestive enzymes (1.5- to 10-fold), and absorption of glucose and intact proteins (3- to 6-fold). Fetuses with ligated esophagi had lowered body weight (\u221220%), reduced intestinal weight (\u221243%), aminopeptidase A activity (\u221224%), and glucose absorption (\u221227%), while lactase, sucrase, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV activities were increased (+40\u201350%), compared with sham-operated fetuses (all p < 0.05). Other parameters of GIT function remained unchanged by esophageal obstruction (absorption of amino acids and immunoglobulin, activity of chymosin, amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, maltase, aminopeptidase N \u2013 all expressed per gram GIT tissue). Ligated fetuses had elevated cortisol levels, which is known to stimulate fetal GIT maturation. We conclude that the rapid development of GIT function in late gestation is diminished by esophageal obstruction, mainly due to slower GIT growth and not inhibition of normal functional development of enterocytes.",

        "abstract": "Intestinal function depends on the presence of luminal nutrients and is altered during starvation and refeeding. Amino acids are essential for enterocytes, but the luminal supply is compromised with changes in dietary intake. To test the hypothesis that during periods of restricted luminal nutrient availability mucosal cells undergo adaptations aimed toward preserving amino acid supply, the expression of amino acid and peptide transporter mRNAs was quantified in rats with no oral intake, whose nutritional status was maintained with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The role of the intestinotrophic hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) was investigated in the adaptive responses. Rats were administered TPN with or without exogenous GLP-2. Amino acid and peptide transporter mRNAs in small intestine mucosa were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Compared with orally fed rats, removal of luminal nutrition increased the expression of ASCT1, SAT2, and GLYT1 mRNAs in the duodenum and of ASCT2, EAAC1, NBAT, and PepT1 mRNAs in the ileum. CAT1, PAT1, and SN2 mRNA abundances were unaffected. GLP-2 reversed these effects. Three subgroups of transporters were identified by regional differences in response to TPN. This may reflect differing roles for substrates of transporters located apically and basally and along the proximal-distal axis of the intestine. The importance of maintaining amino acid supply for intestinal mucosal cells is illustrated.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Parenteral nutrition is a critically important intervention for children with intestinal dysfunctions. However, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with no enteral feeding is associated with small intestine atrophy and malabsorption, which complicate the transition to enteral nutrition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the intestinotrophic peptide glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which reduces TPN-associated atrophy and maintains nutrient absorption in adult rats, for preventing nutrient malabsorption in neonates receiving TPN. Methods: Term pigs obtained by cesarean delivery received from birth TPN alone (TPN; n = 7) or TPN with GLP-2 (25 nmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121; GLP-2; n = 8) or were fed sow milk enterally (n = 7). The small intestine was removed on postnatal day 6 to measure morphological responses and absorption of glucose, leucine, lysine and proline by intact tissues and brush border membrane vesicles and to quantify the abundances of mRNA and protein for enterocyte glucose transporters (SGLT-1 and GLUT2). Results: Relative to TPN alone, administration of GLP-2 resulted in small intestines that were larger (P < 0.01), had greater abundances of mRNA and protein for SGLT-1, but not for GLUT2, and had higher capacities to absorb nutrients (P < 0.01). Moreover, the intestines of GLP-2 pigs were comparable in size and absorptive capacities with those of pigs fed sow milk enterally. Conclusions: Providing GLP-2 to neonates receiving TPN prevents small intestine atrophy, results in small intestine absorptive capacities that are comparable to when nutrients are provided enterally and may accelerate the transition from TPN to enteral nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) causes morbidity and mortality among preterm infants and is associated with nutrient malabsorption. Therefore, a preterm pig model that spontaneously develops NEC was used to investigate the relationship between severity of NEC lesions and galactose absorption in vivo and carrier-mediated glucose absorption by intact mid small intestine. Preterm pigs collected by caesarian section at 92% of gestation received parenteral nutrition with and without minimal enteral nutrition for 48 h before conversion to enteral nutrition with colostrum or an enteral formula. Pigs were killed when symptoms of NEC were observed or after 36\u201340 h of enteral nutrition. NEC lesions decreased in vivo absorption of galactose and mannitol by more than 50% and abolished carrier-mediated glucose uptake by tissues with lesions. Moreover, when NEC lesions were restricted to the colon, small intestinal tissues that seemed clinically healthy had decreased in vitro glucose absorption due to reduced uptake via the sodium-dependent glucose transporter with little or no involvement of the apical facilitative glucose carrier. The present findings reveal a direct relationship between the severity of NEC lesions and the magnitude of sugar malabsorption that is detectable before clinical symptoms are evident.",

        "title": "Changes in gut microbiota control inflammation in obese mice through a mechanism involving GLP-2-driven improvement of gut permeability",
        "abstract": "Background and aims: Obese and diabetic mice display enhanced intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxaemia that participate in the occurrence of metabolic disorders. Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Despite decades of research, the etiological origins of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remain elusive. Recently, the mechanisms of ASD have encompassed emerging theories involving the gastrointestinal, immune, and nervous systems. While each of these perspectives presents its own set of supporting evidence, the field requires an integration of these modular concepts and an overarching view of how these subsystems intersect. In this systematic review, we have synthesized relevant evidences from the existing literature, evaluating them in an interdependent manner and in doing so, outlining their possible connections. Specifically, we first discussed gastrointestinal and immuno-inflammation pathways in-depth, exploring the relationships between microbial composition, bacterial metabolites, gut mucosa, and immune system constituents. Accounting for temporal differences in the mechanisms involved in neurodevelopment, prenatal and postnatal phases were further elucidated, where the former focused on maternal immune activation (MIA) and fetal development, while the latter addressed the role of immune dysregulation in contributing to atypical neurodevelopment. As autism remains, foremost, a neurodevelopmental disorder, this review presents an integration of disparate modules into a \"Gut-Immune-Brain\" paradigm. Existing gaps in the literature have been highlighted, and possible avenues for future research with an integrated physiological perspective underlying ASD have also been suggested.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Selenium is an essential trace element that can modulate the gut microbiome with an impact on host health. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of organic (selenium-enriched yeast) vs inorganic (sodium selenite) selenium source on fecal end-fermentation products and gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. Alpha and beta diversity of the gut bacterial community were affected by age but not by gender or selenium source. The relative abundance of taxa was differently affected by age, and the DNA concentration of all selected bacterial groups increased with age, although total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate, propionate, caproate and lactate concentrations decreased. Organic selenium was associated with a higher concentration of total VFA, propionate and butyrate, a higher number of DNA copies of Lactobacillus, and a trend to lower DNA copies of Escherichia coli. Effects on fecal microbiome during growth differed with selenium source. Females had higher fecal end-fermentation products related to protein degradation, whereas males had higher DNA concentration of Bifidobacterium. Organic selenium might be beneficial over inorganic for dog food supplementation due to the positive modulation of the gut microbiome observed in puppies.",

        "abstract": "The high operating cost is currently a limitation to industrialize microbial lipids production by the yeast Lipomyces starkeyi. To explore economic fermentation technology, the two-stage fermentation of Lipomyces starkeyi using yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium, orange peel (OP) hydrolysate medium, and their mixed medium were investigated for seven days by monitoring OD600 values, pH values, cell growth status, C/N ratios, total carbon concentration, total nitrogen concentration, residual sugar concentration, lipid content, lipid titer, and fatty acids profiles of lipids. The results showed that two-stage fermentation with YPD and 50% YPD + 50% OP medium contributed to lipid accumulation, leading to larger internal lipid droplets in the yeast cells. However, the cells in pure OP hydrolysate grew abnormally, showing skinny and angular shapes. Compared to the one-stage fermentation, the two-stage fermentation enhanced lipid contents by 18.5%, 27.1%, and 21.4% in the flasks with YPD medium, OP medium, and 50%YPD + 50%OP medium, and enhanced the lipid titer by 77.8%, 13.6%, and 63.0%, respectively. The microbial lipids obtained from both one-stage and two-stage fermentation showed no significant difference in fatty acid compositions, which were mainly dominated by palmitic acid (33.36\u201338.43%) and oleic acid (46.6\u201348.12%). Hence, a mixture of commercial medium and lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysate could be a promising option to balance the operating cost and lipid production.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Due to climate change, heat waves occur more often, and the annual average temperature increases, which may contribute to the negative effects of heat stress in pigs. This study explored ways to help growing\u2013finishing pigs cope with heat stress during hot weather. Two groups of pigs were given different diets\u2014one standard and one enriched with specific feed additives. The pigs\u2019 respiration rates, rectal and skin temperatures, performances, and meat qualities were monitored. During a heat wave, the group with the enriched diet did not need as much drinking water compared to the standard diet group. Both groups, without distinguishing between dietary treatments, showed increased respiration rates and skin temperatures during higher heat loads. The findings suggest that the enriched diet may help reduce the need to increase daily water intake during hot periods. Furthermore, this study highlighted the sensitivity of the parameter of respiration rate in pigs suffering from (mild) heat stress. Abstract Heat stress in pigs negatively affects welfare, health, and performance. Osmoprotectants and antioxidants may alleviate oxidative damage during hot periods. We investigated whether an additive-enriched feed can reduce negative effects in pigs during summer conditions. Sixty growing\u2013finishing pigs were allocated into two groups: the control (CF) and summer feed (SF) group. The CF group contained 0.4 mg/kg inorganic selenium and 100 ppm vitamin E, while the SF group contained 0.3 mg/kg inorganic selenium, 0.1 mg/kg selenomethionine, 200 ppm vitamins E and C, and 0.2% betaine. Feed was offered ad libitum. Respiration rate, rectal and skin temperature, behaviour, and weight gain were assessed weekly. Daily measurements of these parameters were performed during a 3-day heat wave (temperature humidity index (THI) \u2265 75) and during an artificial heating period. Individual average daily water intake (ADWI) and feed intake were measured using RFID systems. The ADWI of the SF group did not change during heat load while it increased for the CF group. Independent of dietary treatment, increases in \u2206THI or the THI were accompanied by significant increases in both respiration rate and skin temperature. In conclusion, the SF may induce a reduced need to increase ADWI during hot periods. In addition, mainly skin temperatures and especially respiration rates revealed the sensitivity of pigs to heat stress.",
