Thirty symptomatic patients were invited to undergo objective and subjective assessment of the ability to instill artificial tears with and without the Opticare.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred twenty-seven (37%) patients had had symptoms lasting at least 3 months at some time, and 85 (25%) were currently symptomatic. Many patients found difficulty using artificial tears due to problems aiming and squeezing the bottles as a result of impaired upper limb function. The Opticare statistically significantly improved the ability to squeeze out drops and get them in the eye.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Opticare device allows patients with functional impairment of the upper limb to instill artificial tears, resulting in less wastage of tears and increased independence and compliance.",

        "abstract": "It is thought that in genetically predisposed individuals, autoimmune diseases can be promoted and/or exacerbated by viruses, bacteria, or parasitic infectious agents. Pathogens can activate innate immune response interacting with Toll-like receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecules. As a consequence of infections, a prolonged inflammatory response may occur leading to chronic inflammation with activation of adaptive immune response. In addition, the defective clearance of apoptotic infected cells, which progress- es to secondary necrosis, can foster the autoimmune reactions. Although numerous data from humans and/or animal models support the hypothesis of a direct contribution of pathogens to the induction of the disease, some infectious agents are able to prevent autoimmune disorders. In this review, data on the innate and adaptive immune response induced by pathogens are summarized, focusing on the possible protective or non-protective role of infections in the development of autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing documentation of a link between inflammatory periodontal disease affecting the supporting structure of teeth, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Periodontitis is initiated predominantly by Gram-negative bacteria and progresses as a consequence of the host inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens. Lipopolysaccharide, a cell wall constituent stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines via the activation of signaling pathways perpetuating inflammatory pathogenesis in a cyclical manner in susceptible individuals; with an element of autoimmune stimulation, not dissimilar to the sequential events seen in RA. Periodontitis, also implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, promotes mechanisms for atherosclerosis by enhancing an imbalance in systemic inflammatory mediators; more direct mechanisms attributed to microbial products are also implicated in both RA and atherogenesis. Severe periodontal disease characterized by clinical and radiographic parameters has been associated with ischemic stroke risk, significant levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, amongst others common to both periodontitis and atherosclerosis. Existing data supports the hypothesis that persistent localized infection in periodontitis may influence systemic levels of inflammatory markers and pose a risk for RA and atherosclerosis. A common nucleus of activity in their pathogeneses provides novel paradigms of therapeutic targeting for reciprocal benefit.",

        "abstract": "The host response to bacterial plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces initiates periodontal disease and its progression affecting the supporting structures of teeth. Stressor responses of the host to plaque biofilm result in markers of inflammation that are common to diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease (Pussinen et al 2007). These inflammatory markers are relevant to periodontitis, anxiety states, associated systemic diseases and their sequelae in a bi-directional manner. The extent and clinical significance of these associations have received increasing coverage in the literature. This is largely dependent on the scale of the inflammatory loading based on the severity of periodontal inflammation at the time of examination and the number of sites involved (Norse et al 2008). Response to periodontal treatment with decreased levels of serum markers is indicative of the importance of this source of systemic inflammatory loading. The impact of inflammatory loading from the periodontium as a significant source of systemic inflammation has been an area of debate. The extent and severity of periodontal inflammation in the presenting population determine its significance in this context. It has wider implications in the context of co-morbidities in periodontal patients. In addition to the commoner co-morbidities, coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus and arthritis, other autoimmune conditions and anxiety states also show similar links. This chapter aims to provide such evidence, conflicting at times due to multifactorial presentations of clinical conditions and individual susceptibility. In relevant cases, given a sufficient impetus from inflammatory loading it highlights the importance of controlling periodontal disease in a systemically-ill population. Searches were done over the past 10-15 years, using keywords relevant to the title; subsequently limited to those representing key information focusing on inflammatory markers, their significance and relevance to periodontal, psychosomatic and cardiometabolic diseases with implications on treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background Hormonal contraceptive (HC) use may increase cardiometabolic risk; however, the effect of HC on emerging cardiometabolic and other disease risk factors is not clear. Objectives To determine the association between HC use and plasma proteins involved in established and emerging disease risk pathways. Method Concentrations of 54 high-abundance plasma proteins were measured simultaneously by LC-MRM/MS in 783 women from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured separately. ANCOVA was used to test differences in protein concentrations between users and non-users, and among HC users depending on total hormone dose. Linear regression was used to test the association between duration (years) of HC use and plasma protein concentrations. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify plasma proteomic profiles in users and non-users. Results After Bonferroni correction, 19 proteins involved in inflammation, innate immunity, coagulation and blood pressure regulation were significantly different between users and non-users (P<0.0009). These differences were replicated across three distinct ethnocultural groups. Traditional markers of glucose and lipid metabolism were also significantly higher among HC users. Neither hormone dose nor duration of use affected protein concentrations. PCA identified 4 distinct proteomic profiles in users and 3 in non-users. Conclusion HC use was associated with different concentrations of plasma proteins along various disease-related pathways, and these differences were present across different ethnicities. Aside from the known effect of HC on traditional biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, HC use also affects numerous proteins that may be biomarkers of dysregulation in inflammation, coagulation and blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: The relationship between vitamin D and cardiometabolic disease risk across ethnic groups is unclear, and it is not known whether the use of hormonal contraceptives (HCs), which affect vitamin D metabolism and are also associated with cardiometabolic disease risk, modifies this relationship. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30 nmol/L) to assess seasonal variation in concentrations of 25(OH)D, and to examine whether 25(OH)D is associated with cardiometabolic biomarkers across ethnic groups and across men, female HC nonusers, and female HC users in an ethnically diverse population of young adults living in Canada. Methods: The study population consisted of Caucasian, East Asian, and South Asian individuals (n = 1384, 69% female) aged 20\u201329 years. Participants provided overnight fasting blood samples, from which plasma 25(OH)D and cardiometabolic biomarkers were measured. Vitamin D status distributions were compared using \u03c72 tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine seasonal variations in 25(OH)D, as well as the association between 25(OH)D and cardiometabolic biomarkers, across groups. Results: Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations fluctuated seasonally among Caucasians and East Asians and across men, female HC nonusers, and female HC users, but they remained low year-round in South Asians, half of whom were vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher insulin, homeostasis model assessment\u2013estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-beta among Caucasians and East Asians and among men and female HC nonusers and with higher triglycerides among men only. No biomarkers were associated with 25(OH)D among South Asians and female HC users, although nonsignificant trends were observed for higher markers of glycemic dysregulation in those who were vitamin D deficient in both groups. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency varies between ethnic groups and is particularly high among South Asians, and it is associated with biomarkers of glycemic dysregulation; however, HC use among women may attenuate this association. Given the widespread use of HCs by women throughout the world, a better understanding of the extent to which these medications may modify the relationship between vitamin D and processes related to disease is warranted.",

There is limited evidence to guide ultrasound surveillance protocols. Using a retrospective cohort, we aimed to provide insight into the optimal interval of ultrasound surveillance. Methods: Retrospective cohort of women with MCDA pregnancies who received antenatal care at Monash Medical Centre (January 2011-October 2014). We reviewed all ultrasounds from \u226515 weeks' gestation and collected perinatal outcomes. Results: A total of 162 women with MCDA pregnancies attended our care. Six women were excluded due to late referral. Of the remaining 156, 55% were uncomplicated. TTTS, TAPS, IUGR and fetal demise in utero occurred in 9%, 1%, 31% and 2%, respectively. Median interval between the last ultrasound and TTTS diagnosis was 3.1 weeks (IQR 0.8-5.8). There was a trend towards a longer interval for cases with advanced TTTS compared to early TTTS. Interval between ultrasound scans was longer in cases with unexplained fetal demise in utero and advanced TTTS than early TTTS [3.4 weeks (IQR 2.0-6.9) vs. 0.9 weeks (IQR 0.4-3.7); p < 0.05]. Discussion: Our observations support current recommendations for fortnightly ultrasound surveillance in MCDA pregnancies from 16 weeks' gestation and suggest that longer intervals may be associated with poorer outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with negative health consequences for mothers and their infants. Data on the vitamin D status of pregnant women in Switzerland are scarce. A three-centre study was conducted in the obstetric departments of Zurich, Bellinzona and Samedan (Switzerland) to investigate the prevalence and determinants of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)<50 nmol/l) in 3rd-trimester pregnant women living in Switzerland (n 305), and the correlation between 25(OH)D in pregnant women and their offspring at birth (n 278). Demographic and questionnaire data were used to explore the determinants of vitamin D deficiency. Median concentration of serum 25(OH)D in the third trimester of pregnancy was 46\u00b70 nmol/l (1st-3rd quartiles: 30\u00b75-68\u00b75), representing a 53\u00b74 % prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. 25(OH)D levels in the umbilcal cord blood (median: 50\u00b70 nmol/l; 1st-3rd quartiles: 31\u00b70-76\u00b76) strongly correlated with mothers' serum 25(OH)D (Spearman's correlation \u03c1=0\u00b779, P<0\u00b7001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that significant determinants of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women were centre of study, country of origin, season of delivery and vitamin D supplement intake. Near-term BMI, skin colour, use of sunscreen and mothers' education, although each not individually significant, collectively improved the ability of the model to explain vitamin D status. Low vitamin D levels were common in this sample of pregnant women and their newborns' cord blood. Vitamin D supplement intake was the most actionable determinant of vitamin D status, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy should receive more attention in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D can modulate immune responses, and its deficiency is linked to increased autoimmunity and susceptibility to infection. In the general population, it has been observed that serum vitamin D levels are connected with the risk of COVID-19 and its severity. Our study aims to examine reported findings on the effect of vitamin D serum levels on infection of COVID-19 during pregnancy. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. Serum vitamin D serum levels in COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative pregnant women were 24.61 \u00b1 20.86 ng/mL and 24.12 \u00b1 17.33 ng/mL, respectively. In mild vs. moderate to critical COVID-19 pregnant women, vitamin D serum levels were 16.71 \u00b1 9.04 ng/mL vs. 10.7 \u00b1 9.37 ng/mL and severe vs. non-severe were 13.21 \u00b1 11.47 ng/mL vs. 15.76 \u00b1 10.0 ng/mL.
