        "abstract": "In this study, we hypothesized that bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) protect ischemic myocardium through paracrine effects that can be further augmented with preconditioning. In in vitro experiments, cell survival factors such as Akt and eNOS were significantly increased in BMSCs following anoxia. In the second series of experiments following coronary ligation in mice, left ventricles were randomly injected with the following: DMEM (G-1), BMSCs (G-2), and preconditioned BMSCs (G-3). Four days after myocardial infarction, BMSCs were observed within injured myocardium in G-2 and G-3. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes within periinfarct area were significantly reduced in G-3. Four weeks after myocardial infarction, smaller left ventricular (LV) dimension and increased LV ejection fraction were observed in G-3. Infarct area was significantly reduced in G-3. However, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were observed in low numbers within periinfarct area in G-2 and G-3. In conclusion, BMSCs secreted cell survival factors under ischemia, and they prevented apoptosis in cardiomyocytes adjacent to the infarcted area. Preconditioning of BMSCs enhanced their survival and ability to attenuate LV remodeling, which was attributable, in part, to paracrine effects.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a major public health problem that causes significant mortality despite recent advances in its prevention and treatment. Therefore, approaches based on adult stem cells represent a promising alternative to conventional therapies for this life-threatening condition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that have been isolated from multiple tissues and differentiate to various cell types. Here we have analyzed the capacity of MSCs from human bone marrow (BMSC), adipose tissue (ATSC), and dental pulp (DPSC) to differentiate to cells with a cardiac phenotype. Differentiation of MSCs was induced by long-term co-culture with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs). Shortly after the establishment of MSC-CM co-cultures, expression of connexin 43 and the cardiac-specific markers troponin I, beta-myosin heavy chain, atrial natriuretic peptide, and alpha-sarcomeric actinin was detected in BMSCs, ATSCs, and DPSCs. Expression of differentiation markers increased over time in the co-cultures, reaching the highest levels at 4 weeks. Translocation of the transcription factors NKX2.5 and GATA4 to the nucleus was observed in all three cultures of MSCs during the differentiation process; moreover, nuclear localization of NKX2.5 and GATA4 correlated with expression of alpha-sarcomeric actinin. These changes were accompanied by an increase in myofibril organization in the resulting CM-like cells as analyzed by electron microscopy. Thus, our results provide novel information regarding the differentiation of tissue-specific MSCs to cardiomyocytes and support the potential use of MSCs in cell-based cardiac therapies.",

        "abstract": "Despite refinements of medical and surgical therapies, heart failure remains a fatal disease. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure, and only palliative measures are available to relieve symptoms and prolong the patient's life span. Because mammalian cardiomyocytes irreversibly exit the cell cycle at about the time of birth, the heart has traditionally been considered to lack any regenerative capacity. This paradigm, however, is currently shifting, and the cellular composition of the myocardium is being targeted by various regeneration strategies. Adult progenitor and stem cell treatment of diseased human myocardium has been carried out for more than 10 years (Menasche et al., 2001; Stamm et al., 2003), and it has become clear that, in humans, the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, despite potent proangiogenic effects, is limited (Stamm et al., 2009). More recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and related cell types are being evaluated in preclinical models of heart disease as well as in clinical trials (see Published Clinical Trials, below). MSCs have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into lineages that normally originate from the embryonic mesenchyme (connective tissues, blood vessels, blood-related organs) (Caplan, 1991; Prockop, 1997; Pittenger et al., 1999). The current definition of MSCs includes plastic adherence in cell culture, specific surface antigen expression (CD105(+)/CD90(+)/CD73(+), CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD11b(-) or CD14(-)/CD19(-) or CD79\u03b1(-)/HLA-DR1(-)), and multilineage in vitro differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic) (Dominici et al., 2006 ). If those criteria are not met completely, the term \"mesenchymal stromal cells\" should be used for marrow-derived adherent cells, or other terms for MSC-like cells of different origin. For the purpose of this review, MSCs and related cells are discussed in general, and cell type-specific properties are indicated when appropriate. We first summarize the preclinical data on MSCs in models of heart disease, and then appraise the clinical experience with MSCs for cardiac cell therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted exosomes exert a cardioprotective role in jeopardized myocardium. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of exosomes derived from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain largely unclear. In this study, ADMSC-derived exosomes (ADMSCs-ex) were administrated into the rats subjected to I/R injury and H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Consequently, administration of ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarction, accompanied with a decrease in serum levels of creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Simultaneously, ADMSCs-ex dramatically antagonized I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis, along with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax, and inhibition of Caspase 3 activity in rat myocardium. Similarly, ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced cell apoptosis and the expression of Bax, but markedly increased cell viability and the expression of Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 under H/R. Furthermore, ADMSCs-ex observably induced the activation of Wnt/&bgr;-catenin signaling by attenuating I/R- and H/R-induced inhibition of Wnt3a, p-GSK-3&bgr; (Ser9), and &bgr;-catenin expression. Importantly, treatment with Wnt/&bgr;-catenin inhibitor XAV939 partly neutralized ADMSC-ex\u2013induced antiapoptotic and prosurvival effects in H9c2 cells. In conclusion, we confirmed that ADMSCs-ex protect ischemic myocardium from I/R injury through the activation of Wnt/&bgr;-catenin signaling pathway.",

MSC-derived secretome may bypass many side effects of MSC-based therapy, including unwanted differentiation of engrafted MSCs. In contrast to MSCs which had to be expanded in culture to reach optimal cell number for transplantation, MSC-sourced secretome is immediately available for treatment of acute conditions, including fulminant hepatitis, cerebral ischemia and myocardial infarction. Additionally, MSC-derived secretome could be massively produced from commercially available cell lines avoiding invasive cell collection procedure. In this review article we emphasized molecular and cellular mechanisms that were responsible for beneficial effects of MSC-derived secretomes in the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory diseases of hepatobiliary, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and nervous system. Results obtained in a large number of studies suggested that administration of MSC-derived secretomes represents a new, cell-free therapeutic approach for attenuation of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Therapeutic effects of MSC-sourced secretomes relied on their capacity to deliver genetic material, growth and immunomodulatory factors to the target cells enabling activation of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways that resulted in tissue repair and regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are important players in tissue homeostasis and regeneration owing to their immunomodulatory potential and release of trophic factors that promote healing. They have been increasingly used in clinical trials to treat multiple conditions associated with inflammation and tissue damage such as graft versus host disease, orthopedic injuries and cardiac and liver diseases. Recent evidence demonstrates that their beneficial effects are derived, at least in part, from their secretome. In particular, data from animal models and first-in-man studies indicate that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) can exert similar therapeutic potential as their cells of origin. MSC-EVs are membranous structures loaded with proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, which play an important role in cell-cell communication and may represent an attractive alternative for cell-based therapy. In this article we summarize recent advances in the use of MSC-EVs for tissue repair. We highlight several isolation and characterization approaches used to enrich MSC-derived EVs. We discuss our current understanding of the relative contribution of the MSC-EVs to the immunomodulatory and regenerative effects mediated by MSCs and MSC secretome. Finally we highlight the challenges and opportunities, which come with the potential use of MSC-EVs as cell free therapy for conditions that require tissue repair.",

        "abstract": "Both myocardial infarction (MI) and the follow-up reperfusion will lead to an inevitable injury to myocardial tissues, such as cardiac dysfunctions, fibrosis, and reduction of intercellular cell-to-cell interactions. Recently, exosomes (Exo) derived from stem cells have demonstrated a robust capability to promote angiogenesis and tissue repair. However, the short half-life of Exo and rapid clearance lead to insufficient therapeutic doses in the lesion area. Herein, an injectable conductive hydrogel is constructed to bind Exo derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells to treat myocardial injuries after myocardial infarction-ischemia/reperfusion (MI-I/R). To this end, a hyperbranched epoxy macromer (EHBPE) grafted by an aniline tetramer (AT) was synthesized to cross-link thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) and thiolated Exo anchoring a CP05 peptide via an epoxy/thiol \"click\" reaction. The resulting Gel@Exo composite system possesses multiple features, such as controllable gelation kinetics, shear-thinning injectability, conductivity matching the native myocardium, soft and dynamic stability adapting to heartbeats, and excellent cytocompatibility. After being injected into injured hearts of rats, the hydrogel effectively prolongs the retention of Exo in the ischemic myocardium. The cardiac functions have been considerably improved by Gel@Exo administration, as indicated by the enhancing ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and reducing fibrosis area. Immunofluorescence staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results demonstrate that the expression of cardiac-related proteins (Cx43, Ki67, CD31, and \u03b1-SMA) and genes (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, vWF, TGF-\u03b21, MMP-9, and Serca2a) are remarkably upregulated. The conductive Gel@Exo system can significantly improve cell-to-cell interactions, promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and result in a prominent therapeutic effect on MI-I/R, providing a promising therapeutic method for injured myocardial tissues.",

        "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a severe ischemic disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Maladaptive cardiac remodeling is a series of abnormalities in cardiac structure and function that occurs following myocardial infarction (MI). The pathophysiology of this process can be separated into two distinct phases: the initial inflammatory response, and the subsequent longer-term scar revision that includes the regression of inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrotic scar formation. Extracellular vesicles are nano-sized lipid bilayer vesicles released into the extracellular environment by eukaryotic cells, containing bioinformatic transmitters which are essential mediators of intercellular communication. EVs of different cellular origins play an essential role in cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. In this review, we first introduce the pathophysiology of post-infarction cardiac remodeling, as well as the biogenesis, classification, delivery, and functions of EVs. Then, we explore the dual role of these small molecule transmitters delivered by EVs in post-infarction cardiac remodeling, including the double-edged sword of pro-and anti-inflammation, and pro-and anti-fibrosis, which is significant for post-infarction cardiac repair. Finally, we discuss the pharmacological and engineered targeting of EVs for promoting heart repair after MI, thus revealing the potential value of targeted modulation of EVs and its use as a drug delivery vehicle in the therapeutic process of post-infarction cardiac remodeling.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Cardiac fibrosis is one of the important causes of heart failure and death in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules in eukaryotes and have high stability. Their role in myocardial fibrosis with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to understand the expression profiles of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis with DCM, exploring the possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DCM. Methods At 21 weeks of age, db/db mice established the type 2 DCM model measured by echocardiography, and the cardiac tissue was extracted for Hematoxylin\u2013eosin, Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, the expression profile of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis of db/db mice was constructed using microarray hybridization and verified by real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A circRNA\u2013microRNA\u2013messenger RNA coexpression network was constructed, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were done. Results Compared with normal control mice, db/db mice had 77 upregulated circRNAs and 135 downregulated circRNAs in their chromosomes (fold change \u22651.5, P \u2264 0.05). Moreover, the enrichment analysis of circRNA host genes showed that these differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. CircPHF20L1, circCLASP1, and circSLC8A1 were the key circRNAs. Moreover, circCLASP1/miR-182-5p/Wnt7a, circSLC8A1/miR-29b-1-5p/Col12a1, and most especially circPHF20L1/miR-29a-3p/Col6a2 might be three novel axes in the development of myocardial fibrosis in DCM. Conclusion The findings will provide some novel circRNAs and molecular pathways for the prevention or clinical treatment of DCM through intervention with specific circRNAs.",
