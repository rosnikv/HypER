        "title": "Effect of silymarin and silybinin on oxygen radicals",
        "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the scavenging action of the flavonoids, silymarin and silybinin (two well known hepatoprotective agents) against different types of oxygen radicals which were generated by specific chemical reactions and detected by luminol\u2010sensitized chemiluminescence. A well known scavenger for each radical was used as control for the paradigm and for comparing its effect with those of the flavonoids. It was found that 0.8 \u03bcg/ml of silymarin and 5.5 mg/ml of silybinin produced the same effect as 3.2 ng/ml superoxide dismutase (SOD). An alkoxy radical scavenging effect similar to the one produced by 0.35 ng/ml of vitamin E was caused by 2 \u03bc/ml silymarin and 1.6 ng/ml silybinin. Silybinin was evaluated as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals by determining the inhibition of the chemiluminescence produced by the Fenton reaction with luminol; this was compared with the results obtained from a more conventional method which determines the inhibition of the damage to 2\u2010deoxyribose by the Fenton reaction. In both methods, inhibition was observed at a relatively high concentration of the flavonoid as compared with ethanol. The action of silymarin and silybinin as scavengers of oxygen radicals may explain the protective effect of these flavonoids in certain forms of liver disease where free radicals are involved. However, other properties of these compounds cannot be discarded for their hepatoprotective actions. \u00a9 1993 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of three pharmaceutical forms of silymarin (silymarin MZ-80, silybinin-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, and silybinin) on the liver oxidative status in vitro and after oral administration to rats with extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO) and sham-operated animals. We evaluated thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and their related enzyme activities (GSH peroxidase, GSSG reductase and GSH transferase). All three compounds inhibited the in vitro production of TBARS (IC50 56\u2013533 \u00b5mol/l). These compounds, mainly silymarin MZ-80, also increased GSH peroxidase and GSH transferase activities. In EBO rats we found increases in TBARS production which was inhibited by 50\u201370% after treatment. Glutathione was reduced by 55% and elevated by silymarin MZ-80. GSH transferase increased in the group given silymarin MZ-80. We conclude that all three derivatives of silymarin show a clear ability to reduce lipid peroxidation in the liver. Silymarin MZ-80 was the only compound that enhanced the glutathione antioxidant system.",

        "abstract": "In the animal body, various electron transport chains and various enzymatic reactions either produce free radical intermediates or use free radical substrates. These free radical production have developed several mechanisms to control them. Earlier studies suggests that the Swertia chirata extract was a potent hepatoprotective drug in vivo. Since the ethanolic extract was rich in xanthones, it reduces the free radical induced lipo-peroxidation. In vivo studies on animal models have confirmed the antiradical properties of the extract. The drugs which prevent the toxic effects of free radicals are called free radical scavengers or anti oxidants. Co-enzyme Q10, Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) are examples of such drugs. The lethal cell injury by CCl4 results in the elevation of lipid peroxidation products, impairment in antioxidant enzyme activities. An extraction procedure is described for the isolation of xanthones from the plant S. chirata.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 The present study was performed to determine whether melatonin protects mouse liver against severe damage induced by acetaminophen (APAP) administration and where melatonin primarily functions in the metabolic pathway of APAP to protect mouse liver against APAP\u2010induced injury. Treatment of mice with melatonin (50 or 100\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) 8 or 4\u2003hr before APAP administration (750\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) suppressed the increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in a dose\u2010 and a time\u2010dependent manner. Melatonin treatment (100\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) 4\u2003hr before APAP administration remarkably inhibited centrilobular hepatic necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration and increases in hepatic lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase activity, an index of tissue neutrophil infiltration, as well as release of nitric oxide and interleukin\u20106 into blood circulation at 9\u2003hr after APAP administration. However, melatonin neither affected hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content nor spared hepatic GSH consumption by APAP treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with melatonin 4\u2003hr before APAP administration did not influence the induction of hepatic heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) by APAP and melatonin alone did not induce HSP70 in mouse liver. These results indicate that exogenously administered melatonin exhibits a potent hepatoprotective effect against APAP\u2010induced hepatic damage probably downstream of the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1, which works upstream of GSH conjugation in the pathway of APAP metabolism, via its anti\u2010nitrosative and anti\u2010inflammatory activities in addition to its antioxidant activity.",

There is no pharmacological treatment for this pathological condition. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of melatonin treatment on Ca2+ signaling pathways and contractility altered by cholecystitis. [Ca2+]i was determined by epifluorescence microscopy in fura\u20102 loaded isolated gallbladder smooth muscle cells, and isometric tension was recorded from gallbladder muscle strips. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents were determined by spectrophotometry and cycloxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) expression was quantified by western blot. Melatonin was tested in two experimental groups, one of which underwent common bile duct ligation for 2\u2003days and another that was later de\u2010ligated for 2\u2003days. Inflammation\u2010induced impairment of Ca2+ responses to cholecystokinin and caffeine were recovered by melatonin treatment (30\u2003mg/kg). This treatment also ameliorated the detrimental effects of AC on Ca2+ influx through both L\u2010type and capacitative Ca2+ channels, and it was effective in preserving the pharmacological phenotype of these channels. Despite its effects on Ca2+ homeostasis, melatonin did not improve contractility. After de\u2010ligation, Ca2+ influx and contractility were still impaired, but both were recovered by melatonin. These effects of melatonin were associated to a reduction of MDA levels, an increase in GSH content and a decrease in COX\u20102 expression. These findings indicate that melatonin restores Ca2+ homeostasis during AC and resolves inflammation. In addition, this indoleamine helps in the subsequent recovery of functionality.",

Melatonin has previously been demonstrated to be a powerful organ protective substance in numerous models of injury; these beneficial effects have been attributed to the hormone's intense radical scavenging capacity. The present report reviews the hepatoprotective potential of the pineal hormone in various models of oxidative stress in vivo, and summarizes the extensive literature showing that melatonin may be a suitable experimental substance to reduce liver damage after sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, ischemia/reperfusion, and in numerous models of toxic liver injury. Melatonin's influence on hepatic antioxidant enzymes and other potentially relevant pathways, such as nitric oxide signaling, hepatic cytokine and heat shock protein expression, are evaluated. Based on recent literature demonstrating the functional relevance of melatonin receptor activation for hepatic organ protection, this article finally suggests that melatonin receptors could mediate the hepatoprotective actions of melatonin therapy.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY Light at night and light interference (LI) disrupt the natural light:dark cycle, causing alterations at physiological and molecular levels, partly by suppressing melatonin (MLT) secretion at night. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) can be activated in response to environmental changes. We assessed changes in gene expression and protein level of HSP70 in brain and hepatic tissues of golden spiny mice (Acomys russatus) acclimated to LI for two (SLI), seven (MLI) and 21 nights (LLI). The effect of MLT treatment on LI-mice was also assessed. HSP70 levels increased in brain and hepatic tissues after SLI, whereas after MLI and LLI, HSP70 decreased to control levels. Changes in HSP70 levels as a response to MLT occurred after SLI only in hepatic tissue. However, hsp70 expression following SLI increased in brain tissue, but not in hepatic tissue. MLT treatment and SLI caused a decrease in hsp70 levels in brain tissue and an increase in hsp70 in hepatic tissue. SLI acclimation elicited a stress response in A. russatus, as expressed by increased HSP70 levels and gene expression. Longer acclimation decreases protein and gene expression to their control levels. We conclude that for brain and hepatic tissues of A. russatus, LI is a short-term stressor. Our results also revealed that A. russatus can acclimate to LI, possibly because of its circadian system plasticity, which allows it to behave both as a nocturnal and as a diurnal rodent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the effect of LI as a stressor at the cellular level, by activating HSP70.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. Exercise has been reported to be effective to protect the heart from cardiac injury during the development of DCM. However, the potential cardioprotective effect of exercise in advanced DCM remains unclear. Methods: Seven-week old male C57BL/6 wild-type or db/db mice were either subjected to a running exercise program for 15 weeks or kept sedentary. Cardiac function, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, and mitochondrial biogenesis were examined for evaluation of cardiac injury. Results: A reduction in ejection fraction and fractional shortening in db/db mice was significantly reversed by exercise training. DCM induced remarkable cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 at the protein level. Meanwhile, DCM caused slightly myocardial fibrosis with elevated mRNA levels of collagen I and collagen III. Also, DCM resulted in a reduction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and transcription, together with reduced mtDNA content and impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure. All of these changes could be abolished by exercise training. Furthermore, DCM-associated inhibition of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling was significantly activated by exercise, indicating that exercise-induced activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling might be responsible for mediating cardioprotective effect of exercise in DCM. Conclusion: Exercise preserves cardiac function, prevents myocardial apoptosis and fbrosis, and improves mitochondrial biogenesis in the late stage of DCM. Exercise-induced activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling might be promising therapeutic targets for advanced DCM.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an independent clinical entity defined as structural and functional changes in the myocardium because of metabolic and cellular abnormali ties induced by diabetes, resulting in cardiac failure. Hyperglycemia has been seen as a major cause of DCM due to activation of different mechanisms leading to oxidative stress. Several body of evidence show that distinct pathways of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species formation contribute to myocardial impairment. Abnormal mitochon drial morphology and energetics, evoked by abnormal Ca 2+ handling, metabolic changes and oxidative stress, are observed in DCM, suggesting a pivotal role of mitochondrial dynamics in disease pathogenesis. In addition, insulin resistance compromises myocar dial glucose uptake due to cellular depletion of glucose transporter proteins, together with increased myocardial uptake of free fatty acids and augmented triglyceride levels, which cause cardiomyocyte lipotoxicity. Finally, the state of chronic low-grade inflam - mation, a feature of obese type 2 diabetes, seems to also play a major role in DCM pro -gression, whose mechanisms have been progressively disclosed.

        "abstract": "Objective- This study investigates the functional significance of mitochondria present in endothelial microparticles (EMP) and how MK2 (MAPKAPK2 [MAPK-activated protein kinase 2]) governs EMP production and its physiological effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Approach and Results- Flow cytometric analysis, confocal imaging, oxygen consumption rate measurement through Seahorse were used to confirm the presence of functionally active mitochondria in nontreated EMP (EMP derived from untreated control cells), lipopolysaccharide, and oligomycin treatment increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species activity in EMP (EMP derived from cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin, respectively). The dysfunctional mitochondria contained in EMP derived from cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin induced the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the target endothelial cells leading to the augmented adhesion of human monocytic cell line on EA.hy926 cells. Multiphoton real-time imaging detected the increased adherence of EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin at the site of carotid artery injury as compared to EMP derived from untreated control cells. MK2 regulates EMP generation during inflammation by reducing E-selectin expression and regulating the cytoskeleton rearrangement through ROCK-2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2) pathway. MK2-deficient EMP reduced the E-selectin and ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1) expression on target endothelial cells leading to reduced monocyte attachment and reduced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Conclusions- MK2 promotes the proinflammatory effect of EMP mediated through dysfunctional mitochondria. MK2 modulates the inflammatory effect induced during cardiac hypertrophy through EMP.",

        "abstract": "An adequate protection from oxidative and inflammatory reactions, together with the promotion of oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) differentiation, is needed to recover from myelin damage in demyelinating diseases. Mitochondria are targets of inflammatory and oxidative insults and are essential in oligodendrocyte differentiation. It is known that nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor/antioxidant responsive element (NRF2/ARE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma/PPAR-\u03b3 response element (PPAR-\u03b3/PPRE) pathways control inflammation and overcome mitochondrial impairment. In this study, we analyzed the effects of activators of these pathways on mitochondrial features, protection from inflammatory/mitochondrial insults and cell differentiation in OP cultures, to depict the specificities and similarities of their actions. We used dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) and pioglitazone (pio) as agents activating NRF2 and PPAR-\u03b3, respectively, and two synthetic hybrids acting differently on the NRF2/ARE pathway. Only DMF and compound 1 caused early effects on the mitochondria. Both DMF and pio induced mitochondrial biogenesis but different antioxidant repertoires. Moreover, pio induced OP differentiation more efficiently than DMF. Finally, DMF, pio and compound 1 protected from tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) insult, with pio showing faster kinetics of action and compound 1 a higher activity than DMF. In conclusion, NRF2 and PPAR-\u03b3 by inducing partially overlapping pathways accomplish complementary functions aimed at the preservation of mitochondrial function, the defense against oxidative stress and the promotion of OP differentiation.",

Unlike the previously discovered regulated cell death, it has certain morphology, biochemistry, and genetic characteristics [1]. Epilepsy is caused by the imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory conduction and mitochondrial dysfunction [2,3]. Notably, growing evidence has shown that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Seizures induce elevated extracellular glutamate [4,5], which inhibits cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xcand serves as a natural trigger for ferroptosis [6]. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction, as the phenomenal characteristic of ferroptosis, has been identified as one potential cause of epileptic seizures [7].
