        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of early postoperative tube feeding on outcomes of liver transplant recipients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty transplant patients were randomized prospectively to receive enteral formula via nasointestinal feeding tubes (tube-feeding [TF] group) or maintenance i.v. fluid until oral diets were initiated (control group). Thirty-one patients completed the study. Resting energy expenditure, nitrogen balance, and grip strength were measured on days 2, 4, 7, and 12 after liver transplantation. Calorie and protein intakes were calculated for 12 days posttransplant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTube feeding was tolerated in the TF group (n = 14). The TF patients had greater cumulative 12-day nutrient intakes (22,464 +/- 3554 kcal, 927 +/- 122 g protein) than did the control patients (15,474 +/- 5265 kcal, 637 +/- 248 g protein) (p < .002). Nitrogen balance was better in the TF group on posttransplant day 4 than in the control group (p < .03). There was a rise in the overall mean resting energy expenditure in the first two posttransplant weeks from 1487 +/- 338 to 1990 +/- 367 kcal (p = .0002). Viral infections occurred in 17.7% of control patients compared with 0% of TF patients (p = .05). Although other infections tended to occur more frequently in the control group vs the TF group (bacterial, 29.4% vs 14.3%; overall infections, 47.1% vs 21.4%), these differences were not statistically significant. Early posttransplant tube feeding did not influence hospitalization costs, hours on the ventilator, lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, rehospitalizations, or rejection during the first 21 posttransplant days.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly posttransplant tube feeding was tolerated and promoted improvements in some outcomes and should be considered for all liver transplant patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo study the effect of the route of delivery and formulation of postoperative nutritional support on host defense, protein metabolism, infectious complications, and outcome.\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective, randomized, clinical trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nDepartment of Surgery at a university hospital.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nTwo hundred sixty candidates for pancreaticoduodenectomy or gastrectomy for cancer.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly allocated into 3 groups during surgery. Starting 6 hours after operation, the first group received a standard enteral formula (standard group; n = 87); the second, the same enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA (immunonutrition group; n = 87); and the third, total parenteral nutrition (parenteral group; n = 86). The 3 regimens were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. The nutritional goal was 105 kJ/kg per day.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nImmune response by phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor levels, and delayed hypersensitivity response; protein synthesis by IL-6 and prealbumin; tolerance of enteral feeding; incidence of postoperative complications; and length of hospital stay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe immunonutrition group had a significantly better recovery of the immune parameters on postoperative day 8 compared with the other groups. Linear regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between IL-6 and preambulin levels (r = 0.766) only in the immunonutrition group. Only 11 patients (6.3%) in both enteral groups did not reach the nutritional goal. Postoperative infection rate was 14.9% (13/87) in the immunonutrition group, 22.9% (20/87) in the standard group, and 27.9% (24/86) in the parenteral group (P = .06). Mean +/- SD length of hospital stay was 16.1 +/- 6.2, 19.2 +/- 7.9, and 21.6 +/- 8.9 days in the immunonutrition, standard, and parenteral groups, respectively (P = .01 vs standard group; P = .004 vs parenteral group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly postoperative enteral feeding is a valid alternative to parenteral feeding in patients undergoing major surgery. Immunonutrition enhances the host response, induces a switch from acute-phase to constitutive proteins, and improves outcome.",

        "abstract": "Cachexia, weight loss, and malnutrition are found commonly in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. This wasting has been linked not only to survival, but also to alterations in host defenses, functional ability, and quality of life in these patients. Enteral nutritional support has been provided to these patients with the goal of preventing or correcting malnutrition in an attempt to improve measures of mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. Studies presented in this review have examined the impact of the timing, the composition, and the route of nutritional support on these outcome variables to evaluate the use of enteral nutritional support in these wasting disorders. There remains a paucity of strong clinical evidence that supports any improvements in outcome variables associated with the provision of enteral nutritional support in these patients.",

        "abstract": "hypermetabolism, hypercatabolism, immunosuppression, and erosion of body cell mass. Some patients suffering from these metabolic alterations can develop sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, resulting in increased utilization of health care resources from prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Administration of specialized nutrition support as parenteral or enteral nutrition can maintain or improve some nutritional indices such as serum proteins and nitrogen balance in critically ill patients. However, traditional specialized nutritional support does not preserve body cell mass or help to attain an immunocompetent state. Some investigators have suggested that the route of specialized nutrition support is important in determining which patients will be subjected to septic morbidity.1,2 Most of these data favor the enteral route for the delivery of nutritional support during critical illness, and this route should be used whenever possible. There is still a subset of patients, however, who do not tolerate enteral nutrition even when access is obtained. These patients must receive parenteral nutrition or a combination of both enteral and parenteral nutrition to meet nutritional needs until an oral diet can be safely achieved.",
