        "title": "Comparison of early invasive and conservative strategies in patients with unstable coronary syndromes treated with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is continued debate as to whether a routine, early invasive strategy is superior to a conservative strategy for the management of unstable angina and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 2220 patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation who had electrocardiographic evidence of changes in the ST segment or T wave, elevated levels of cardiac markers, a history of coronary artery disease, or all three findings. All patients were treated with aspirin, heparin, and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban. They were randomly assigned to an early invasive strategy, which included routine catheterization within 4 to 48 hours and revascularization as appropriate, or to a more conservative (selectively invasive) strategy, in which catheterization was performed only if the patient had objective evidence of recurrent ischemia or an abnormal stress test. The primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome at six months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt six months, the rate of the primary end point was 15.9 percent with use of the early invasive strategy and 19.4 percent with use of the conservative strategy (odds ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.97; P=0.025). The rate of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at six months was similarly reduced (7.3 percent vs. 9.5 percent; odds ratio, 0.74; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 1.00; P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation who were treated with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban, the use of an early invasive strategy significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiac events. These data support a policy involving broader use of the early inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in combination with an early invasive strategy in such patients.",

        "abstract": "The present study prospectively evaluated adjunctive antiplatelet therapy in patients without insulin\u2010requiring diabetes during elective coronary stenting. Three hundred patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: clopidogrel pretreatment, adjunctive abciximab, or control. Stenting was successful in 98% and no deaths occurred. Thirty\u2010day and 1\u2010year major adverse coronary events (MACEs) was similar in all groups. A subgroup of 109 patients undergoing single\u2010vessel stenting of type A/B1 lesions with short guidewire times had no postprocedure myocardial infarction or 30\u2010day MACE.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nEnoxaparin has demonstrated advantages over unfractionated heparin in low- to moderate-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) treated with a conservative strategy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo compare the outcomes of patients treated with enoxaparin vs unfractionated heparin and to define the role of enoxaparin in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS at high risk for ischemic cardiac complications managed with an early invasive approach.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors (SYNERGY) trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international trial conducted between August 2001 and December 2003. A total of 10 027 high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS to be treated with an intended early invasive strategy were recruited.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nSubcutaneous enoxaparin (n = 4993) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (n = 4985) was to be administered immediately after enrollment and continued until the patient required no further anticoagulation, as judged by the treating physician.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy outcome was the composite clinical end point of all-cause death or nonfatal myocardial infarction during the first 30 days after randomization. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding or stroke.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point occurred in 14.0% (696/4993) of patients assigned to enoxaparin and 14.5% (722/4985) of patients assigned to unfractionated heparin (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.06). No differences in ischemic events during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were observed between enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin groups, respectively, including similar rates of abrupt closure (31/2321 [1.3%] vs 40/2364 [1.7%]), threatened abrupt closure (25/2321 [1.1%] vs 24/2363 [1.0%]), unsuccessful PCI (81/2281 [3.6%] vs 79/2328 [3.4%]), or emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery (6/2323 [0.3%] vs 8/2363 [0.3%]). More bleeding was observed with enoxaparin, with a statistically significant increase in TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding (9.1% vs 7.6%, P =.008) but nonsignificant excess in GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Arteries) severe bleeding (2.7% vs 2.2%, P =.08) and transfusions (17.0% vs 16.0%, P =.16).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnoxaparin was not superior to unfractionated heparin but was noninferior for the treatment of high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Enoxaparin is a safe and effective alternative to unfractionated heparin and the advantages of convenience should be balanced with the modest excess of major bleeding.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite its limitations, unfractionated heparin has been the standard anticoagulant used during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Several small studies have suggested that intravenous enoxaparin may be a safe and effective alternative. Our primary aim was to assess the safety of enoxaparin as compared with that of unfractionated heparin in elective PCI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial, we randomly assigned 3528 patients with PCI to receive enoxaparin (0.5 or 0.75 mg per kilogram of body weight) or unfractionated heparin adjusted for activated clotting time, stratified according to the use or nonuse of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The primary end point was the incidence of major or minor bleeding that was not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting. The main secondary end point was the percentage of patients in whom the target anticoagulation levels were reached.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEnoxaparin at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of non-CABG-related bleeding in the first 48 hours, as compared with unfractionated heparin (5.9% vs. 8.5%; absolute difference, -2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to -0.6; P=0.01), but the higher enoxaparin dose was not (6.5% vs. 8.5%; absolute difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -4.0 to 0.0; P=0.051). The incidence of major bleeding was significantly reduced in both enoxaparin groups, as compared with the unfractionated heparin group. Target anticoagulation levels were reached in significantly more patients who received enoxaparin (0.5-mg-per-kilogram dose, 79%; 0.75-mg-per-kilogram dose, 92%) than who received unfractionated heparin (20%, P<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn elective PCI, a single intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg of enoxaparin per kilogram is associated with reduced rates of bleeding, and a dose of 0.75 mg per kilogram yields rates similar to those for unfractionated heparin, with more predictable anticoagulation levels. The trial was not large enough to provide a definitive comparison of efficacy in the prevention of ischemic events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00077844 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).",

Although LMWH has superior efficacy to UFH in NSTE-ACS, it must also provide cost-effectiveness or net-cost savings before its wide use can be approved by healthcare payers. The drug-acquisition costs of LMWH are higher than those of UFH, but economic analyses should also consider the initial medical resource consumption and the downstream costs associated with failed treatment and subsequent care. Based on published economic analyses, the incremental drug costs of LMWH compared with UFH are compensated for by savings in medical-resource costs secondary to reducing ischemic events in NSTE-ACS patients.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nFondaparinux is an indirect, Factor Xa inhibitor that requires co-administration of another anticoagulant with anti-Factor IIa activity for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) per guideline recommendations. In this setting, the use of bivalirudin, a direct Factor IIa inhibitor, is not well established.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nUsing the Premier hospital database, we identified 971 patients who underwent elective or urgent PCI after receiving fondaparinux as the initial anticoagulant. They were treated with either bivalirudin \u00b1 glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) (Group A=618) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) \u00b1 GPI (Group B=353) during PCI. A 2:1 propensity score matching (PSM) process was performed to control for patient and hospital level characteristics. The primary endpoints were to determine in-hospital death, bleeding and post-PCI length of stay (LOS) between treatment groups. After PSM, 512 matched patients were analysed (Group A=348 and Group B=174). In-hospital death was 1.4% in Group A vs. 2.9% in Group B (p=0.26). Clinically apparent bleeding occurred in 4.0% of Group A vs. 9.2% of Group B patients (p<0.02). Clinically apparent bleeding requiring transfusion was lower in Group A patients (0.6% vs. 2.9%; p=0.04). Post-PCI LOS was 1.9 \u00b1 3.8 days for Group A and 2.4 \u00b1 5.8 days for Group B (p=0.36). GPI use during PCI occurred in 9.2% of Group A vs. 44.8% of Group B patients (p<0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter initial administration of fondaparinux, a bivalirudin-based strategy for PCI is associated with significantly reduced bleeding, with similar mortality and post-PCI LOS when compared with an UFH-based strategy.",
