        "abstract": "Recurrence rate is high after operation for Crohn's disease. A multicenter trial was performed to study the effect of radical or nonradical operation and of sulfasalazine prophylaxis versus placebo on postoperative recurrence rate in 232 patients with Crohn's disease. Sixteen medical and surgical centers participated in the study, 7 operating radically and 9 nonradically. The follow-up period lasted 3 years, the allocation to drug treatment was randomized and double blind. Recurrence was significantly less frequent and occurred later in patients who were operated nonradically. Patients on sulfasalazine prophylaxis had a better prognosis than on placebo. This effect was statistically significant in the first 2 years of treatment. Both strategies were additive: nonradical operation and sulfasalazine had the best prognosis, radical operation and placebo was worst. It is concluded that postoperative recurrence is best prevented by resecting nonradically and prescribing 3 g of sulfasalazine daily at least over 2 years.",

        "abstract": "&NA; Mesalamine is an enteric\u2010coated 5\u2010aminosalicylic acid formulation effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and in decreasing the relapse rate in Crohn's disease. However, little data are available regarding its use in children and adolescents. To determine the modalities of use, safety, and the optimal dose in this age group, charts of 153 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with mesalamine were reviewed, representing >150 patient years of use. Among these, more than half of the children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (120 patients) had ileocolonic involvement, and pancolitis predominated in those with ulcerative colitis (33 patients). Patients with ulcerative colitis were diagnosed at a younger age than those with Crohn's disease, and thus mesalamine therapy was initiated earlier. When used as monotherapy, no difference was noted in the average dose used for the treatment of active disease versus maintenance therapy (36 mg/kg/day). However, the average dose used did increase since 1992, for both the treatment of active disease and relapse prevention (43 mg/kg/ day). Overall, 18 patients (11.8%) were withdrawn from mesalamine therapy; however only 8 (5.2%) had objective side effects. Exacerbation of diarrhea was the most common reason for withdrawal. Although reported rarely, no serious adverse reactions such as pancreatitis or hepatic or renal dysfunction were observed. This study suggests that mesalamine is a safe and well\u2010tolerated medication in the long\u2010term treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Mesalazine is a first-line drug in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and is customarily used to induce and maintain remission in mild to moderate disease. In children, pharmacokinetic data are scarce, and dosage recommendations are largely extrapolated from studies in adults. Aim of the study was to obtain the pharmacokinetic profile of a new mesalazine pellet formulation in children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis. A single oral dose of 20 mg/kg mesalazine was administered to 13 patients (age 6\u201316 years). Serial blood and urine sampling for determination of mesalazine and acetylmesalazine was performed before and during 24 hours following ingestion. Maximum plasma concentration of mesalazine (Cmax) was 1332 ng/mL (geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation [CV]: 0.57), obtained 3.7 hours (tmax; CV: 0.31) after drug administration. Systemic exposure as determined by area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0\u2013\u221e ) was 8712 ng/ml*h (CV: 0.44). Terminal half-life of elimination of mesalazine was 3.5 hours (t1/2; CV: 1.43). This study presents extensive pharmacokinetic data on mesalazine in children with mild-moderately active ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis. In comparison with previous experience in adults, pharmacokinetics of mesalazine administered as pellets appear to be similar in both populations.",

        "abstract": "A randomized, 2\u2010way, crossover study was conducted in 30 volunteers to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of a new once\u2010daily dosing regimen of mesalazine (1 \u00d7 4 g/d) with the current twice\u2010daily dosage (2 \u00d7 2 g/d) used in many European countries. The 2 dosages were administrated orally for 8 days, separated by a 2\u2010week washout. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine were determined on days 1 and 8 by a validated high\u2010performance liquid chromatography method and Cmax, tmax, and AUCs calculated. The bioequivalence was obtained for a 90% confidence interval of the AUC0\u201324h ratio (test/reference) for mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine on days 1 and 8, within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. The bioequivalence was demonstrated on day 1 for mesalazine and N\u2010acetyl\u2010mesalazine and on day 8 for mesalazine. As it is desirable to offer patients a preparation with a less frequent administration to enhance compliance, this once\u2010daily regimen may be an attractive dosing option.",

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasingly recognized as a disease affecting the elderly. Approximately 10%\u201330% of the UC population is over the age of 60 years. Additionally, younger patients with UC are aging and thus comprise a second group of elderly IBD patients. To date, there have been no clinical trials that have evaluated treatment efficacy of UC in the elderly population. The aim of our study was to conduct a systematic review of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing treatment outcome in UC; we also sought to identify the elderly population, defined as age 60 years or older, represented in these studies, to see if pooled data would lead to meaningful conclusions regarding treatment efficacy and safety profile in the elderly. A search of the MEDLINE database via PubMed and the EMBASE database via Scopus was performed to identify all RCTs evaluating medical therapy for UC in humans, published within the English language through September 2012. Studies were grouped into three categories: biological agent (BA) therapy; immunosuppressant (IS) therapy; and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy. To estimate the number of elderly patients in each study, mean age plus 1 and 2 standard deviations (SD) was calculated to find the closest approximation to age 60. Of 876 studies, 112 RCTs were included in the final analysis\u201420 studies for BA, 20 for IS, and 72 for 5-ASA agents. While nearly all studies reported either a mean or median age, only 38% additionally reported the SD and age range. The mean composite age was 39.2 years for the BA studies, 38.5 years for the IS studies, and 42.8 years for the 5-ASA studies, consistent with a young middle-aged patient. We estimated that no more than 16% of patients per study would have qualified as elderly, and in most cases a much smaller percentage (<8%). Additionally, there were no BA or IS RCTs that reported results by age subgroup analysis. Four studies in the 5-ASA group report age-specific analyses and showed no difference in treatment efficacy by age. None of the 112 RCTs reported age sub-analyses of safety, tolerability, adverse events, or withdrawal rates. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate efficacy of treatment and adverse events from treatment for UC in the elderly. With the rising number of elderly patients with UC, there is a need for more clinical trials that specifically address UC treatment in this unique population.",

We assessed the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD) of the pouch and chronic antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at 5 academic referral centers in the United States. Adult patients with endoscopic inflammation of the pouch who received vedolizumab were included. The primary outcome was clinical response at any time point. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response, and remission. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed for the effect of the following variables on clinical response: fistula, onset of pouchitis less than 1 year after IPAA, younger than 35 years old, gender, previous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-alpha use, and BMI >30.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-three patients were treated with vedolizumab for inflammation of the pouch between January 2014 and October 2017. Median follow-up was 1.3 years (interquartile range 0.7-2.1). The proportion of patients that achieved at least a clinical response was 71.1%, with 19.3% achieving clinical remission. Of the 74 patients with a follow-up pouchoscopy, the proportion of patients with endoscopic response and mucosal healing was 54.1% and 17.6%, respectively. Patients who developed pouchitis symptoms less than 1 year after undergoing IPAA were less likely to respond to vedolizumab, even after controlling for other risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVedolizumab is safe and effective in the management of CD of the pouch and chronic pouchitis. Further studies are needed to compare vedolizumab with other biologic therapies for pouchitis and CD of the pouch.",

Background: Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Those with \u22653 episodes of pouchitis/year and symptoms despite antibiotics are considered to have chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis (CARP). While several agents including probiotics, steroids and immunomodulators have been used, treatment of CARP remains challenging. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the safety and efficacy of various biological agents in treatment of CARP. Methods: Multiple databases were searched through June 2020 for studies that reported the efficacy and safety of biological therapy including antitumor necrosis factor-alpha agents [infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA)], vedolizumab (VDZ), and ustekinumab in CARP. We excluded studies on Crohn\u2019s like and/or other inflammatory complications of the pouch. Meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled rates of clinical as well as endoscopic improvement and remission. Results: We included 15 studies with 311 patients in our final analysis. Ninety-two patients were treated with IFX, 42 with ADA, 144 with VDZ and 33 with ustekinumab. Pooled rate of clinical improvement was 71.4%, 58.2%, 47.9% and clinical remission was 65.7%, 31%, 47.4% with IFX, ADA, and VDZ, respectively. Pooled rate of endoscopic improvement was achieved in 61.2% patients treated with VDZ while endoscopic remission was achieved in 70.3% patients treated with IFX.
