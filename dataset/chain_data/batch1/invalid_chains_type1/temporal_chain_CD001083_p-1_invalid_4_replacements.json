The subsequent follow-up of patients up to 24 months suggested that the initial improvement in visual acuity with cyclosporin A was not sustained.

        "abstract": "Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder. The patients have repeated exacerbations and remissions of the symptoms. This disease may produce a wide variety of symptoms. In mild cases, mucocutaneous lesions are only the symptoms during the whole clinical course, whereas ocular lesions, which occur in about 70% of the patients, can cause blindness. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, CNS and large vessels is less frequent, but sometimes life-threatening. Colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are employed for the treatment of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease with therapies tailored to individual patients depending on clinical manifestations. Cyclosporin A is the most effective drug for ocular lesions at the present, but its neurotoxicity, which occurs in 20 - 30% of patients receiving cyclosporin A, restricts usage of the agent. Many patients are still suffering from a severe form of uveitis and serious neurological symptoms, which are resistant to any conventional therapies. New drugs have been investigated for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. IFN-\u03b1 therapy has shown significant efficacy for common symptoms including ocular lesions without any serious adverse effects. Thalidomide and its analogues also appear to be applicable to this disease. Monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 is now in clinical trials. These novel therapeutic approaches may provide much needed treatment options for patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Posterior segment involvement, which can lead to blindness with recurrent inflammatory attacks, has a very important prognostic value in ocular Beh\u00e7et's disease (BD). This study evaluated the frequency and characteristics of posterior segment involvement and the causes of visual impairment in patients with ocular BD. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 257 eyes of the 131 patients who were followed from 1993 to 2001 in the Uveitis and BD division of SSK Ankara Eye Hospital, Turkey. Results The mean follow-up was 49.2 \u00b1 27.4 months. Thirty-one of the paients were female (23.6%) and 100 male (76.4%). The mean age was 25.1\u00b17.9. Fundus changes were observed in 213 (82.9%) eyes and were bilateral in 87%, and vitritis was present in 239 (93%) eyes. The most frequent fundus changes were vascular sheathing in 61 eyes (23.7%), optic atrophy in 46 (17.9%), macular edema in 29 (11.3%), retinal hemorrhage in 23 (9%), macular scar in 21 (8.2%), optic disc paleness in 19 (7.4%), retinal edema in 17 (6.6%), branch retinal vein occlusion in 15 (5.8%). The most common fluorescein angiography findings were diffuse vascular leakage in 98 (38%), hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in 38 (14.8%) and hyperfluorescence of the macula in 29 eyes (11.3%). Visual acuity was <1/10 in 85 (33%) of the eyes. Optic atrophy was the main cause (54.1%) of permanent visual impairment. Conclusions Posterior segment involvement is the most serious ocular complication of BD, leading to blindness with recurrent attacks. Following patients closely, performing fluorescein angiography in all patients diagnosed as BD even they have no clinical ocular involvement, and early treatment are very important in the prognosis of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Thalidomide (Thd), a potent teratogen, was shown to have therapeutic potential in cancer, primarily in multiple myeloma (MM), yet its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. It was recently suggested that its teratogenicity is derived from interference in expression of genes regulated by GC-rich promoters by blocking the binding of SP1 transcription factor to its motif. We explored the validation of the proposed model by focusing on potential molecular targets associated with MM pathogenesis. Cell lines RPMI 8226, U266, and ARH-77 were exposed for 24 h to racemic Thd and analyzed for apoptosis, membranal expression of CD29 and CD63, transcript level of hTERT, CD63, and IGFI-R (characterized by GC-rich motifs) and telomerase activity. Analysis of an hTERT core promoter reporter gene expression [enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)] in transiently transfected RPMI 8226 incubated with racemic and steric (+/-)-enantiomers of Thd was performed. A consistent reduction ( approximately 10-40%) in transcript levels of all three assayed genes in all three cell lines was demonstrated in the presence of racemic Thd. Significant reduction of EGFP was demonstrated in cells transfected with hTERT reporter gene and treated with racemic and (S)-Thd. Our results show that Thd's antimyeloma activity can be ascribed to the same mechanism responsible for its teratogenic effect and that the inhibition of GC-rich promoter genes is mostly attributed to the S-racemate. Indeed, this selectivity delineates GC-rich promoter genes as a unique group eligible for specific drug targeting.",

        "abstract": "Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to investigate the binding of 13 alkaloids to two GC-rich DNA duplexes which are critical sequences in human survivin promoter. Negative ion ESI-MS was first applied to screen the binding of the alkaloids to the duplexes. Six alkaloids (including berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine) show complexation with the target DNA sequences. Relative binding affinities were estimated from the negative ion ESI data, and the alkaloids show a binding preference to the duplex with higher GC content. Positive ion ESI mass spectra of the complexes were also recorded and compared with those obtained in negative ion mode. Only the 1 : 1 complex with berbamine was observed with lower abundance in the positive ion mass spectrum while complexes with the other alkaloids were absolutely absent. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments indicate that the complexes with the protoberberine alkaloids (berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine) dissociate via base loss and covalent cleavage. In contrast, product ion spectra of the complexes with the alkaloids reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine show the predominant loss of a neutral alkaloid molecule, accompanied by base loss and covalent cleavage to a lesser extent. A comparison of the gas-phase behaviors of complexes with the alkaloids to those with the traditional DNA binders has suggested an intercalative binding mode of these alkaloids to the target DNA duplexes.",

        "abstract": "Chromatin has been successfully used as a tool for the study of genome function in cancers. Vincristine as a vinca alkaloid anticancer drug exerts its action by binding to tubulins. In this study the effect of vincristine on DNA and chromatin was investigated employing various spectroscopy techniques as well as thermal denaturation, equilibrium dialysis and DNA-cellulose affinity. The results showed that the binding of vincristine to DNA and chromatin reduced absorbance at both 260 and 210 nm with different extent. Chromopheres of chromatin quenched with the drug and fluorescence emission intensity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin exhibited higher emission intensity changes compared to DNA. Upon addition of vincristine, Tm of DNA and chromatin exhibited hypochromicity without any shift in Tm. The binding of the drug induced structural changes in both positive and negative extremes of circular dichroism spectra and exhibited a cooperative binding pattern as illustrated by a positive slope observed in low r values of the binding isotherm. Vincristine showed higher binding affinity to double stranded DNA compared to single stranded one. The results suggest that vincristine binds with higher affinity to chromatin compared to DNA. The interaction is through intercalation along with binding to phosphate sugar backbone and histone proteins play fundamental role in this process. The binding of the drug to chromatin opens a new insight into vincristine action in the cell nucleus.",

We have presented data on molecular markers responsible for the efficacy, side effects, and toxicity of the drugs commonly used for childhood ALL treatment, i.e., glucocorticoids, vincristine, asparaginase, anthracyclines, thiopurines, and methotrexate. Big data was generated using high-throughput technologies, but their implementation in clinical practice is poor.

        "abstract": "Abstract The thiopurine drugs azathioprine and mercaptopurine are effective in the treatment of disorders of immune regulation and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Although developed in the 1950s, thiopurines remained relevant in the anti-tumour necrosis factor biologic era, finding widespread use as a co-immunomodulator. Step changes in the management of patients treated with thiopurines have reduced the incidence of severe, sometimes life-threatening toxicity. Testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency directs a safe initial dose for therapy. The introduction of red cell thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) monitoring provides a basis for dose adjustment and the identification of patients with high levels of red cell methylmercaptopurine (MMP) and an increase in the MMP:TGN ratio. These patients are at risk for hepatotoxicity and where TGN levels are sub-therapeutic, non-response to therapy. Switching thiopurine hypermethylators to low-dose thiopurine and allopurinol combination therapy resolves hepatoxicity and increases sub-therapeutic TGN levels to regain clinical response. NUDT15 variants are a common cause of severe myelotoxicity in Asian populations where the frequency of TPMT deficiency is low. There is increasing evidence that testing for NUDT15 and TPMT deficiency in all populations prior to the start of thiopurine therapy is clinically useful and should be the first step in personalising thiopurine therapy.",

We successfully developed synthetic routes toward diverse 6sGMP prodrugs, tested their proliferation inhibitory potential in different cell lines, and examined their mode of action. Our results show that 4-acetyloxybenzyl- and cycloSaligenyl-derivatized 6sGMP prodrugs are effective antiproliferative compounds in cells that are resistant to thiopurines.
