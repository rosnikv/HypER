        "abstract": "Background: Only 23% of patients are meeting all goals for cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Objective: The purpose of our study is to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist-physician collaboration on attainment of cardiovascular-related goals in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: This prospective, multicenter cohort enrolled patients from 7 practice sites that were members of the University of Tennessee Pharmacist Practice Based Research Network (UT Pharm Net). Patients were included if they were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, at least 18 years of age and English speaking. Pregnant patients were excluded. Patients were followed for 12 months after enrollment. Primary cardiovascular outcomes included reduction in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as well as the proportion of patients achieving a blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg and proportion of patients achieving an LDL goal of <100 mg/dL. Results: For the 206 patients enrolled, the average age was 59.7 years; the majority were male (59.7%) and white (66%). When compared with baseline, the postintervention mean systolic (P < .0001), diastolic blood pressure (P = .0003), and LDL (P < .0001) decreased significantly. The proportion of patients achieving a blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg increased 21.8% (P < .0001), and the proportion of patients achieving an LDL of <100 mg/dL increased 12% (P = .0023). Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that collaborative management has a positive impact on decreasing cardiovascular risk and assists patients in attaining national goals for blood pressure and cholesterol.",

        "title": "Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial",
        "abstract": "Background Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin\u2013angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. Methods The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke. Results The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.",

Design Population based cohort study using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting UK primary care, 1997-2014. Participants Patients starting treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (n=122\u2009363). Main outcome measures Poisson regression was used to compare rates of end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death among patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more after starting treatment against those without such increases, and for each 10% increase in creatinine. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of other antihypertensive drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Results Among the 2078 (1.7%) patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more, a higher proportion were female, were elderly, had cardiorenal comorbidity, and used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop diuretics, or potassium sparing diuretics. Creatinine increases of 30% or more were associated with an increased adjusted incidence rate ratio for all outcomes, compared with increases of less than 30%: 3.43 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 4.91) for end stage renal disease, 1.46 (1.16 to 1.84) for myocardial infarction, 1.37 (1.14 to 1.65) for heart failure, and 1.84 (1.65 to 2.05) for death. The detailed categorisation of increases in creatinine concentrations (<10%, 10-19%, 20-29%, 30-39%, and \u226540%) showed a graduated relation for all outcomes (all P values for trends <0.001). Notably, creatinine increases of less than 30% were also associated with increased incidence rate ratios for all outcomes, including death (1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) for increases of 10-19% and 1.35 (1.23 to 1.49) for increases of 20-29%, using <10% as reference). Results were consistent across calendar periods, across subgroups of patients, and among continuing users. Conclusions Increases in creatinine after the start of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment were associated with adverse cardiorenal outcomes in a graduated relation, even below the guideline recommended threshold of a 30% increase for stopping treatment.",

        "title": "Severe acute interstitial nephritis induced by valsartan",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can increase serum creatinine or potassium levels in patients with renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis, heart failure or hypovolemia, but hardly cause severe kidney injury in patients without any risk factors. A case of severe acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) induced by valsartan was reported here. Patient concerns: A 62-year-old female with nausea for 1 month and acute deterioration of kidney function for 2 weeks was admitted. She had a history of hypertension for 5 months and had taken valsartan 40\u200amg daily for 4 months. Although the valsartan had been stopped for 2 weeks, the serum creatinine continuously increased after admission. Kidney biopsy demonstrated the eosinophils infiltration in interstitium. Diagnoses: AIN induced by valsartan. Interventions: The patient was treated with glucocorticoid. Outcomes: The serum creatinine decreased gradually and got back to normal level 5 months later. Then therapy of glucocorticoid was stopped. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by computed tomography angiography (CTA). Lessons: Although valsartan-induced allergy has been reported previously, AIN was firstly recognized as a severe complication of this drug. We suggest when there is a ARB-associated continuous deterioration of kidney function for patients without renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis, heart failure or hypovolemia, AIN should be thought of and therapy with glucocorticoid should be considered if necessary.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common outcome evaluated in clinical studies, often as a safety end point in a variety of cardiovascular, kidney disease, and other clinical trials. AKI end points that include modest increases in serum creatinine levels from baseline may not associate with patient-centered outcomes such as initiation of dialysis, sustained decline in kidney function, or death. Surprisingly, data from several randomized controlled trials have suggested that in certain settings, the development of AKI may be associated with favorable outcomes. AKI safety end points that are nonspecific and may not associate with patient-centered outcomes could result in beneficial therapies being inappropriately withheld or never developed for commercial use. We review several issues related to commonly used AKI definitions and suggest that future work in AKI use more patient-centered AKI end points such as major adverse kidney events at 30 days or other later time points.",

        "title": "Potential Role and Limitations of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Slope Assessment in Cardiovascular Trials: A Review.",
        "abstract": "Importance\nCardiovascular trials have traditionally been underpowered to assess advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) outcomes, and when included as a secondary end point, trials have used progression of CKD as incidence of some variation of a composite of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) outcomes. Such outcomes are infrequent or occur late in cardiovascular outcome trials, which highlights the need for alternate markers for assessing the impact of interventions on kidney function at an earlier stage of the disease and, from the prevention perspective, more relevant stage of the disease.\n\n\nObservations\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope has demonstrated strong association with subsequent progression to ESKD. With adequate sample size, treatment effects in the range of 0.5 to 1.00 mL/min/1.73 m2/y had 96% probability of predicting CKD progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine, eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or ESKD. eGFR slope can be used in patients with higher baseline values and may provide CKD progression insights when few hard kidney events are observed, especially in trials with limited follow-up. However, among trials that have determined eGFR slope, significant variations exist regarding inclusion of baseline values, calculation of eGFR values, and the follow-up period, which make it difficult to compare and gauge the incremental benefit of the interventions. There are multiple challenges in computing eGFR slope in cardiovascular trials, such as accounting for initial eGFR dip, nonlinearity, and heteroscedasticity.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\neGFR slope may serve as a valuable marker to determine progression of CKD in cardiovascular trials. Further work is required to standardize data collection, follow-up duration, time points for kidney function assessment, and analytic methods to compute eGFR slope in cardiovascular trials.",

We also examined poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, and worsening HF (WHF), defined as HF hospitalization, emergency department visit, or outpatient intensification of therapy between baseline and 8-month follow-up.\n\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH\nFine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models and Cox proportional hazard models regressed clinical outcomes on baseline eGFRdiffcysC-sCr. Logistic regression investigated the association of baseline eGFRdiffcysC-sCr with poor HRQoL and frailty. Linear regression models assessed the association of WHF with eGFRcysC, eGFRsCr, and eGFRdiffcysC-sCr at an 8-month follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline eGFRdiffcysC-sCr was >+10 and <-10 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 13.0% and 35.7% of the patients, respectively. More negative values of eGFRdiffcysC-sCr were associated with worse outcomes ([sub]-hazard ratio per standard deviation [SD]: PARADIGM-HF primary endpoint: 1.18, p=0.008; CV mortality: 1.34, p=0.001; all-cause mortality 1.39, p<0.001; worsening kidney function: 1.31, p=0.05). For 1-SD decrease in eGFRdiffcysC-sCr, the prevalence of poor HRQoL and frailty increased by 29% and 17%, respectively (p \u22640.008).

Data regarding whether eGFR using serum cystatin C (cystatin C \u2013 based eGFR [eGFRcys]) may yield more accurate GFR estimates in patients with advanced HFrEF because of sarcopenia are inconclusive. 2 Emerging data demonstrate that large intraindividual discrepancies between eGFRcr and eGFRcys are associated with adverse outcomes. 3,4 A ratio of eGFRcys/eGFRcr , 0.7, indicating an intraindividual eGFRcys . 30% lower than eGFRcr, has been associated with greater mortality risk in the general population. 3 In a post hoc analysis of the Prospective Comparison of ARNI [Angiotensin Receptor - Neprilysin Inhibitor] with ACEI [Angiotensin-Converting - Enzyme Inhibitor] to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure Trial consisting of patients with predominantly moderate HFrEF, large discrepancies between eGFRcr and eGFRcys were associated with higher mortality. 4 However, patients with an eGFR , 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 were excluded.
