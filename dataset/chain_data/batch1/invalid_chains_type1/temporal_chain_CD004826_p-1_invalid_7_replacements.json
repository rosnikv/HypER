        "title": "Crohn's disease and Escherichia coli. A new approach in therapy to maintain remission of colonic Crohn's disease?",
        "abstract": "Involvement of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has long been suggested because, among other reasons, the inflammatory response resembles that in infectious bowel diseases. Elevated antibody levels to pathogen antigens and a changed metabolic activity of the intestinal microflora have been detected in patients with Crohn's disease. Several studies have revealed a possible etiologic link between intestinal microorganisms and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, several therapeutic strategies, including reduction or dilution of bacterial components in the intestine by antibiotics or intestinal lavage, respectively, inactivation of inflammatory bacterial products, and reconstitution of intestinal microflora have been employed, substantiating the idea that dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier and an alteration of bacterial composition contribute to the inflammatory disease. However, the beneficial effect of restoration of the physiologic intestinal microflora in colonic inflammation by exogenous administration of a viable nonpathogenic bacterium has not been investigated before in a placebo-controlled study. Promising results came from the present pilot study in which the nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 was tested for efficacy and tolerance in maintaining remission in patients with colonic Crohn's disease. Application of the physiologic bacteria reduced the risk for relapse and minimized the need for glucocorticoids. Therefore we are convinced that in Crohn's disease parts of the intestinal microflora, including the host's immune response toward indigenous flora or an impairment of the gut flora's metabolic activity are involved in the development or at least in the onset of relapse from remissive of colonic Crohn's disease. However, more data are necessary to prove the benefit of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 as a new therapy to maintain remission of colonic Crohn's disease.",

However, only a few of the potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of exciting promises and many unanswered questions.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common aetiologies in high and low-income countries respectively. The diagnosis is based on clinical, radiographic and pleural fluid examination. Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of a pleural effusion in high TB prevalence areas. There is controversy about the optimal treatment for empyema in children. Sepsis should be controlled with antibiotics and drainage of the pleural cavity. Intrapleural fibrinolysis and Video Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS) are modern interventions widely used in high-income countries but mostly unavailable in the developed world. There are however few properly conducted studies that would support one therapeutic approach over the other. Despite this, the clinical outcome of paediatric empyema is usually good regardless of therapeutic approach. This review summarises aetiology, pathogenesis and clinical presentation of childhood empyema and discusses the various treatment modalities with an emphasis on clinical practice in developing countries.",

        "title": "Probiotics for Children With Diarrhea: An Update",
        "abstract": "This review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus), and Lactobacillus reuteri. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. Few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or Clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. Overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. On the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. Most commonly employed probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. They consistently show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains\u2014mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii, but also L. reuteri\u2014in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. Such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. The effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10\u2009billion/d being necessary.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of calcium and probiotics on the incidence and duration of acute diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in low-socioeconomic communities of Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 494 healthy children aged 1 to 6 years who received low-lactose milk with low calcium content (LC; \u223c50 mg/day; n = 124), regular calcium content (RC; \u223c440 mg/day; n = 126), RC with 5.108 colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus casei CRL431 (casei; n = 120), or RC with 5.108 colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 (reuteri; n = 124). Number and duration of diarrhea and ARTIs episodes were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Incidence of World Health Organization\u2013defined diarrhea (\u22653 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was not significantly different between RC and LC (relative risk [RR]: 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62\u20131.58]), between casei and RC (RR: 1.21 [95% CI: 0.76\u20131.92]), or between reuteri and RC (RR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.46\u20131.25]) groups. Incidence of all reported diarrhea (\u22652 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was significantly lower in the reuteri versus RC group (RR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.46\u20130.99]). Irrespective of the definition used, reuteri significantly reduced diarrhea incidence in children with lower nutritional status (below-median height-and-weight-for-age z score). None of the interventions affected ARTIs. CONCLUSIONS: RC milk, alone or with L casei, did not reduce diarrhea or ARTIs in Indonesian children. L reuteri may prevent diarrhea, especially in children with lower nutritional status.",

        "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 has been shown to provide a moderate clinical effect in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. However, as the L. reuteri ATCC 55730 strain was found to carry potentially transferable resistance traits for tetracycline and lincomycin, it was replaced by a new strain, L. reuteri DSM 17938, without unwanted plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance. Bioequivalence of the two strains has been suggested. We aimed to systematically evaluate data on the effectiveness of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and the original strain, L. reuteri ATCC 55730, in the treatment of AGE in children. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, reference lists, and abstract books of major scientific meetings were searched in August 2013, with no language restrictions, for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two RCTs (n=196) that evaluated L. reuteri DSM 17938 and three RCTs (n=156) that evaluated L. reuteri ATCC 55730, which involved hospitalised children aged 3 to 60 months, met the inclusion criteria. Compared with placebo or no treatment, DSM 17938 significantly reduced the duration of diarrhoea (mean difference -32 h, 95% confidence interval (CI): -41 to -24) and increased the chance of cure on day 3 (relative risk: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 10.8, random effects model). Similar results were obtained with the original strain, L. reuteri ATCC 55730. In conclusion, in hospitalised children, use of both strains of L. reuteri reduced the duration of diarrhoea, and more children were cured within 3 days. Data from outpatients and countryspecific cost-effectiveness analyses are needed. Given the limited data and the methodological limitations of the included trials, the evidence should be viewed with caution.",

        "abstract": "Antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, are widely used for treatment of influenza virus infection. We reported previously that oseltamivir inhibits the viral growth cycle, ameliorates symptoms, and reduces viral antigen quantities. Suppressed viral antigen production, however, induces a reduction of acquired antiviral humoral immunity, and increases the incidence of re-infection rate in the following year. To achieve effective treatment of influenza virus infection, it is necessary to overcome these adverse effects of antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors. Feeding of yogurt fermented with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) OLL1073R-1 is reported to have immune-stimulatory effects on influenza virus infection in mice and humans. In the present study, we assessed the effect of feeding L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 yogurt cultures (YC) on local and systemic humoral immune responses, which were suppressed by oseltamivir treatment, in mice infected with influenza A virus. Yogurt culture (1.14 \u00d7 108 cfu/0.4 mL per mouse per day) or sterile water (vehicle) was administered by intragastric gavage for 35 d. At d 22, influenza A virus/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8; 0.5 pfu/15 \u03bcL per mouse) was instilled intranasally, followed immediately by oral administration of oseltamivir (50 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcL per mouse, twice daily) or 5% methylcellulose (100 \u03bcL/mouse) as a vehicle for 13 d. Titers of anti-PR8-specific IgG and IgA in serum and mucosal secretory IgA (S-IgA) and IgG in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed by ELISA at 14 d after infection. Oseltamivir significantly suppressed the induction of anti-PR8-specific IgG and IgA in serum and S-IgA and IgG in BALF after infection. Feeding YC mildly but significantly stimulated production of PR8-specific IgA in serum, S-IgA in BALF, and IgG in serum without changing the IgG2a:IgG1 ratio. We analyzed the neutralizing activities against PR8 in serum and BALF and found that oseltamivir also reduced protective immunity, and YC feeding abrogated this effect. The immune-stimulatory tendency of YC on anti-PR8-specific IgA and IgG titers in serum and BALF was also detected in mice re-infected with PR8, but the effect was insignificant, unlike the effect of YC in the initial infection.",

Besides the limited effect of vaccines, the problem is exacerbated by the lack of drugs with strong antiviral activity against all flu strains. Currently, there are two classes of antiviral drugs available that are chemosynthetic and approved against influenza A virus for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, but the appearance of drug-resistant virus strains is a serious issue that strikes at the core of influenza control. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new antiviral drugs. Many reports have shown that the development of novel bioactive plant extracts and microbial extracts has significant advantages in influenza treatment. This paper comprehensively reviews the development and effects of chemosynthetic drugs, plant extracts, and microbial extracts with influenza antiviral activity, hoping to provide some references for novel antiviral drug design and promising alternative candidates for further anti-influenza drug development.",

Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that A. muciniphila plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that A. muciniphila and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, A. muciniphila was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of A. muciniphila remains much controversial.

Numerous connections and mutual correlations have become the basis for seeking answers to many questions related to pathology as well as human physiology. Disorders of this homeostasis as well as dysbiosis itself accompany neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. Heavily dependent on external factors, modulation of the gut microbiome represents an opportunity to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Probiotic interventions, synbiotic interventions, or fecal transplantation can undoubtedly support the biotherapeutic process. A special role is played by diet, which provides metabolites that directly affect the body and the microbiota. A holistic view of the human organism is therefore essential.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it discusses the role of intestinal microbiota in modulating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, which were mentioned in the source paper as being influenced by Akkermansia muciniphila through the microbiota-gut-brain axis."
