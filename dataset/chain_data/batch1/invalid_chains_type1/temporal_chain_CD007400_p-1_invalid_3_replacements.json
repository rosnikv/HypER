        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\n. To compare the safety and efficacy of a topical diclofenac solution versus oral diclofenac in relieving the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy equivalence trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 622 men and women with radiological evidence of primary knee OA and mild to severe symptoms were randomly assigned to treatment with a topical diclofenac solution plus placebo oral capsules, or placebo topical solution plus oral diclofenac (50 mg) capsules. Patients applied 50 drops of study solution and took 1 study capsule 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy variables were pain and physical function, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) VA 3.1 OA Index, and patient global assessment (PGA). Equivalence in the per-protocol group was based on previously defined ranges of clinically significant difference. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe difference in mean (95% CI) change scores (final minus baseline) between treatments was 13.3 mm (-8.6 to 35.2) for pain (total scale 500 mm), 71.0 mm (-2.4 to 144.5) for physical function (total scale 1700 mm), and 4.3 mm (-1.2 to 9.8) for PGA (total scale 100 mm). The CI for each efficacy variable fell within the predefined equivalence ranges (pain, +/- 75 mm; physical function, +/- 255 mm; PGA, +/- 20 mm), indicating that no clinically relevant difference was found between the 2 treatment arms. Safety analyses of patients applying topical diclofenac solution revealed some minor skin irritation at the application site--mostly skin dryness in 83/311 (27%) patients--but a significantly reduced incidence, relative to oral diclofenac, of total and severe gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. The number of patients developing abnormal liver function tests (including clinically significant elevation), hemoglobin, and creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the oral diclofenac group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nApplication of this topical diclofenac solution to the knee of patients with OA produced relief of symptoms equivalent to oral diclofenac, with minor local skin irritation, but significantly reduced incidence of diclofenac-related GI complaints and abnormal laboratory values.",

        "title": "Current therapeutic options in the management of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis",
        "abstract": "Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a condition characterised by calcification and ossification of soft tissues, mainly ligaments and enthesis. Although DISH often coexists with osteoarthritis, this disorder differs from primary osteoarthritis by a dissimilar prevalence within the general population, gender distribution, anatomical site of primary involvement and magnitude and distribution in the spine and the peripheral joints. Little is known about the pathogenesis of the disease and possible therapeutic interventions. Treatment should be aimed at the symptomatic relief of pain and stiffness; the prevention, retardation or arrest of progression; the treatment of associated metabolic disorders and the prevention of spontaneous or induced complications. Change of lifestyle, nutrition and therapeutic options to alleviate pain and stiffness are measures that might improve quality of life in patients affected by DISH. Control of associated metabolic disorders such as hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia with or without hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia may reduce the morbidities associated with these disorders and prevent further progression of the condition. Recent developments in our understanding of the molecular basis of the ligamentous and entheseal changes that lead to the development of DISH might pave the way to future, more targeted and effective therapies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose) The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of pulsed and continuous diclofenac gel phonophoresis with topical diclofenac gel treatment. (Methods) Eighty patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to 4 groups. The first group received continuous diclofenac gel phonophoresis, the second group received pulsed diclofenac gel phonophoresis, the third group received diclofenac gel with sham ultrasound, and the fourth group received acoustic gel applied with sham ultrasound. Range of knee motion, VAS pain at rest and in activity, the WOMAC Index and 20 m walking time were evaluated before the treatment, at the end of treatment and 1 month after the treatment. (Results) Improvements were found in VAS pain at rest, VAS pain in activity, WOMAC pain and physical function scores in all of the groups up to 1 month after the therapy. Both modalities of phonophoresis were shown to improve VAS pain at rest, VAS pain in activity, WOMAC pain and physical function scores compared to the other treatments. There was no significant difference in the improvements between the pulsed phonophoresis group and the continuous phonophoresis group. (Conclusion) We showed that both continuous and pulsed ultrasound diclofenac gel phonophoresis is more effective for pain and functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis than topical application of diclofenac gel, and that the effectiveness of pulsed phonophoresis and continuous phonophoresis is similar.",

        "title": "Improved Pain and Function in Knee Osteoarthritis with Dexamethasone Phonophoresis: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Background Intraarticular corticosteroid injection is an adjunct to core treatments for relief of moderate-to-severe pain in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. This randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of dexamethasone phonophoresis (DxPh) on knee OA. Patients and Methods Forty six female patients with knee OA were randomized into two equal groups. The study group received DxPh over the medial side of the knee, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and quadriceps strengthening exercises. Control group received ultrasound therapy and the same TENS and exercise program. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the pain subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pre- and posttreatment. Functional mobility was assessed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, total WOMAC, and the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC. The minimal clinically identifiable difference was used to calculate treatment effect sizes of both modalities, which was compared to intraarticular steroid injections. Results The VAS, TUG, and WOMAC scores improved with both modalities. Pain intensity improved by 50.6%\u201358.0% in the study group (VAS and pain subscale of WOMAC, respectively) compared to 17.8%\u201328.6% for the control group. Functional mobility showed a higher rate of improvement in the DxPh group compared to control (37.7 vs. 17.5% for TUG and 53.2 vs. 23.0 and 56.1 vs. 26.4% for the joint stiffness and physical function subscales of WOMAC, respectively). Posttreatment results revealed statistically and clinically significant improvement in pain intensity and functional mobility in the DxPh group. Conclusion DxPh resulted in a greater improvement in pain and function in patients with knee OA than therapeutic ultrasound combined with exercise and TENS. The effect size of phonophoresis was clinically significant and higher than that reported for intraarticular steroid injection from pooled data in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common subtype of arthritis. To date, treatment of OA focuses primarily on alleviating pain and improving joint function. The lack of a vascular system within synovial joints and the rapid removal of agents due to synovial exchange hinder continuous delivery of OA drugs. However, these obstacles are being addressed by promising nanoscale drugs. Methods: We synthesize and assemble a hydrogen peroxide [H2O2, belongs to the category of active oxygen species (ROS)]-sensitive nanomicelle, which is loaded with the anti-inflammation drug dexamethasone and chondrogenic differentiation factor cartilage-derivedmor-phogeneticprotein-1. The micelle can induce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair cartilage while inhibiting joint inflammation. Results: The prepared nanoparticles were of uniform size and displayed an obvious core-shell structure. Under H2O2 stimulation, the shell layer could be removed gradually. The drug-loaded micelle effectively inhibited proliferation of activated macrophages, induced macrophage apoptosis with an anti-inflammatory effect, and caused the BMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes. Conclusion: This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for further development of a drug-loaded micelle in the healing of osteoarthritis.",

        "title": "Current Insights Into the Maintenance of Structure and Function of Intervertebral Disc: A Review of the Regulatory Role of Growth and Differentiation Factor-5",
        "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), characterized by conversion of genotypic and phenotypic, is a major etiology of low back pain and disability. In general, this process starts with alteration of metabolic homeostasis leading to ongoing inflammatory process, extracellular matrix degradation and fibrosis, diminished tissue hydration, and impaired structural and mechanical functionality. During the past decades, extensive studies have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of degeneration and shed light on the protective roles of various factors that may have the ability to halt and even reverse the IDD. Mutations of GDF-5 are associated with several human and animal diseases that are characterized by skeletal deformity such as short digits and short limbs. Growth and differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) has been shown to be a promise biological therapy for IDD. Substantial literature has revealed that GDF-5 can decelerate the progression of IDD on the molecular, cellular, and organ level by altering prolonged imbalance between anabolism and catabolism. GDF family members are the central signaling moleculars in homeostasis of IVD and upregulation of their gene promotes the expression of healthy nucleus pulposus (NP) cell marker genes. In addition, GDF signaling is able to induce mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into NPCs and mobilize resident cell populations as chemotactic signals. This review will discuss the promising critical role of GDF-5 in maintenance of structure and function of IVDs, and its therapeutic role in IDD endogenous repair.",

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), a common and disabling degenerative joint disease, affects millions of people worldwide and imposes a considerable burden on patients and society due to its high prevalence and economic costs. The pathogenesis of OA is closely related to the progressive degradation of articular cartilage and the accompany inflammation; however, articular cartilage itself cannot heal and modulate the inflammation due to the lack of nerves, blood vessels, and lymph-vessels. Therefore, reliable and effective methods to treat OA remain highly desired. Local administration of drugs or bioactive materials by intra-articular injection of the delivery system represents a promising approach to treat OA, especially considering the prolonged joint retention, cartilage or chondrocytes targeting, and stimuli-responsive release to achieve precision OA therapy. This article summarizes and discusses the advances in the currently used delivery systems (nanoparticle, hydrogel, liposome, and microsphere) and then focuses on their applications in OA treatment from the perspective of endogenous stimulus (redox reactions, pH, enzymes, and temperature) and exogenous stimulus (near-infrared, magnetic, and ultrasound)-responsive release. Finally, the challenges and potential future directions for the development of nano-delivery systems are summarized.",
