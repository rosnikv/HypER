        "abstract": "reported menstrual irregularities. Nearly half of the sample (42) reported more aggressive behaviour when using AASs. Thirteen met DSM-IV3 criteria for dependence on AASs, including symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal, and a further 24 met criteria for AAS abuse. Subjects reported that health concerns were the most likely deterrent to AAS use. Several potentially harmful activities engaged in included self-taught injection procedures, injecting specific muscle groups for localised growth (calves, biceps), concurrent use of several AASs (\"stacking\"), use of high doses and/or long cycles, and use of other drugs such as clenbuterol, diuretics, thyroxine, insulin, and human growth hormone. AAS users actively seek out information relevant to their AAS use. Friends (63), nonmedical handbooks (60) and fitness magazines (53) are the most common sources, making the quality of the information highly questionable. Almost three-quarters (73) of the sample claimed that their preferred AAS information source would be their family medical practitioner (provided she or he were well informed and approachable), giving scope for improving the harm reduction information available to this eager group by educating medical practitioners. Medical education could highlight the legal and ethical obligations of medical practitioners as well as provide harm reduction information to pass on to their patients.",

        "title": "Oral versus topical NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases: a comparison.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and are responsible for approximately one-quarter of all adverse drug reaction reports. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for patients with rheumatic disease--a population at increased risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Topical administration of NSAIDs offers the advantage of local, enhanced drug delivery to affected tissues with a reduced incidence of systemic adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease and GI haemorrhage. NSAIDs administered topically penetrate slowly and in small quantities into the systemic circulation; bioavailability and maximal plasma NSAID concentration after topical application are generally less than 5 and 15%, respectively, compared with equivalent oral administration. Product formulation may have a dramatic impact, not only on absorption rates but also on penetration depth. Compared with oral administration, topical application leads to relatively high NSAID concentrations in the dermis. Concentrations achieved in the muscle tissue below the site of application are variable, but are at least equivalent to that obtained with oral administration. NSAIDs applied topically do reach the synovial fluid, but the extent and mechanism (topical penetration versus distribution via the systemic circulation) remain to be determined. In addition, marked interindividual variability was noted in all studies; percutaneous absorption may be strongly influenced by individual skin properties. In general, interpretation of clinical studies measuring efficacy of topical NSAIDs in rheumatic disease states is difficult because of a remarkably high placebo response rate, use of rescue paracetamol (acetaminophen), and significant variability in percutaneous absorption and response rates between patients. Overall efficacy rates attributable to topical NSAIDs in patients with rheumatic disorders ranged from 18 to 92% of treated patients. Topically applied NSAIDs have a superior safety profile to oral formulations. Adverse effects secondary to topical NSAID application occur in approximately 10 to 15% of patients and are primarily cutaneous in nature (rash and pruritus at site of application). GI adverse drug reactions are rare with topically applied NSAIDs, compared with a 15% incidence reported for oral NSAIDs. Available clinical studies suggest, but do not document, equivalent efficacy of topical over oral NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases.",

        "title": "Synthesis and properties of a naproxen polymeric prodrug",
        "abstract": "A water\u2010soluble polymeric prodrug containing a naproxen moiety was synthesized. The carboxylic groups of naproxen were condensed with the hydroxyl groups of 2\u2010hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to produce a drug\u2010linked monomer, denoted HN. The polymeric prodrug was prepared by copolymerization of HN with methacrylic acid. The molar percentage of HN in the polymeric prodrug was 26 mol%, as determined by 1H NMR. To investigate the pertinence of this polymeric prodrug, the hydrolysis was studied in\u2010vitro with or without esterase or lipase. The kinetics of enzymatic catalysis was calculated from a Lineweaver\u2010Burk plot. The anti\u2010inflammatory activity was evaluated using the carrageenan\u2010induced oedema test. The polymeric prodrug released a major fraction of the free naproxen and a significant fraction of the hydroxyethyl ester derived\u2010naproxen. The maximum hydrolysis rate Vmax, and the Michaelis constant Km were calculated to be 2.16 times 10\u22125 equiv. mol L\u22121 min\u22121 and 5.11 times 10\u22122 equiv. mol L\u22121. The maximum anti\u2010inflammatory inhibition of free naproxen appeared at 2 h and quickly decreased thereafter. In contrast, the polymeric prodrug showed a maximum at around 2\u223c3 h and then slowly decreased. This indicates that the polymeric prodrug displays greater potency than free naproxen in the inhibition of acute inflammatory processes over long periods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Three concentrations (mg ml\u22121) of extracts of the medicinal plants Xysmalobium undulatum (XU) roots (0.125, 0.25, 0.50), leaves of Helichrysum caespititum (HC) (0.00625, 0.0125, 0.025) and ascorbic acid (AA) (0.125, 0.25, 0.50) were assessed for cytotoxicity (CT), genotoxicity (GT) and modulation of cyclophosphamide- and EMS-induced GT using the Allium cepa assay following 24 h treatment. CP (1.00 mg ml\u22121) and EMS (0.0375 mg ml\u22121) were not cytotoxic but genotoxic. CT was measured by the mitotic index (MI). GT was the number of aberrant cells per 100 mitotic cells. The MI and GT of test groups were compared with the negative control group using t-test. The modulatory effect (ME), calculated as (B \u2013 C) \u2013 (A \u2013 C)/(A \u2013 C) gave the number of times of the mutagen-induced GT by which the GT of the mutagen was reduced (anti-GT) or increased (synergism). One or more concentrations of AA, XU and HC and their mixtures with CP or EMS were cytotoxic and genotoxic. Mixtures of AA, XU and HC with CP were significantly more genotoxic than CP alone which indicated a synergistic interaction. Mixtures of AA with EMS were significantly more genotoxic than EMS alone. Mixtures of XU with EMS were less genotoxic than EMS, but not significantly, which made XU mildly anti-genotoxic to EMS GT. Mixtures of lower concentrations of HC with EMS were more genotoxic than EMS alone but not significantly. The most common aberrations among dividing cells were sticky chromosomes, c-metaphase, anaphase and telophase bridges, chromosome fragment and multipolar anaphase and telophase.",

        "title": "An evaluation for the standardization of the Allium cepa test as cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assay",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT A general report on the use of the Allium test as cytotoxicological and genotoxicological assay is proposed, with particular emphasis about the standardization of the test in several common applications. The intraspecific variation in Allium cepa has been overlooked, as in most investigations no mention is made about origin and denomination of the onion cultivar used. A standardization of the used material would allow a better generalization of the results, since we cannot be sure that all cultivars would give the same response. A more frequent use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation is proposed. Even if relatively time consuming and not available in all laboratories, it may help to better understand the mechanism of cytotoxicity, since many morphological characters may appear similar but be arisen from different processes observable only with TEM. About statistical testing, tests other than chi-squared may be used in case of a lower amount of data. The most commonly used statistical tests are the parametric tests ANOVA and Student\u2019s t, and the non-parametric tests Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Mann\u2013Whitney U, for analysis of variance. Tests should be used also to assess the minimal sample dimension for obtaining significance, since data collection (microscope observation) appears to be one of the main bottle necks of the test. Also the use of the Allium test for testing liposomes and other nanovectors for drug delivery is proposed, in order to assess the cytotoxicity of these types of medium and the possible increase in cytotoxicity of the associated drug.",

        "abstract": "Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam. is claimed to effectively manage a number of ailments including diabetes and associated complications. Nonetheless, no attempt has been made to delineate its pharmacological propensities and phytochemical profile. This study was designed to appraise the antioxidant and enzymatic inhibitory properties relevant to the management of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and neurodegenerative and skin disorders. A combination of colorimetric assays and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) were applied for the phytochemical screening of leaf, root, twig, and fruit extracts (methanol and ethyl acetate). In vitro antioxidant evaluations were via radical scavenging abilities (DPPH, ABTS), reducing potential (FRAP, CUPRAC), chelating power, and total antioxidant capacity (phosphomolybdenum). Seven key metabolic enzymes (\u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, tyrosinase, elastase, lipase, AChE, and BChE) were targeted to determine the inhibitory effects. Multivariate and in silico docking analysis were performed on collected data. Methanolic fruit extract yielded the highest total phenolic, tannin, and triterpenoid contents (174.18 \u00b1 4.27 mg GAE/g, 176.24 \u00b1 3.10 mg CE/g, 63.11 \u00b1 3.27 mg OAE/g, respectively); significantly depressed tyrosinase, elastase, and \u03b1-amylase activities (155.35 \u00b1 0.29 mg KAE/g, 4.56 \u00b1 0.10 mg CAE/g, 1.00 \u00b1 0.05 mmol ACAE/g, accordingly); and harboured the most potent antioxidant capacities with DPPH, CUPRAC, FRAP (492.62 \u00b1 5.31, 961.46 \u00b1 11.18, 552.49 \u00b1 8.71 mg TE/g, respectively), and phosphomolybdenum (4.17 \u00b1 0.31 mmol TE/g) assays. Multivariate analysis suggested that the type of solvents used influenced the biological activities more compared to plant parts. Docking analysis showed that azelaic acid binds with tyrosinase by Van der Waals and conventional hydrogen bonds. We anticipate that the present study may establish baseline data on this halophyte that could open new avenues for the development of biomedicine.",

        "abstract": "Snakebite being a quick progressing serious situation needs immediate and aggressive therapy. Snake venom antiserum is the only approved and effective treatment available, but for selected snake species only. The requirement of trained staff for administration and serum reactions make the therapy complicated. In tropical countries where snakebite incidence is high and healthcare facilities are limited, mortality and morbidities associated with snake envenomation are proportionately high. Traditional compilations of medical practitioners\u2019 personal journals have wealth of plant-based snake venom antidotes. Relatively, very few plants or their extractives have been scientifically investigated for neutralization of snake venom or its components. None of these investigations presents enough evidence to initiate clinical testing of the agents. This review focuses on curating Indian traditional snake envenomation therapies, identifying plants involved and finding relevant evidence across modern literature to neutralize snake venom components. Traditional formulations, their method of preparation and dosing have been discussed along with the investigational approach in modern research and their possible outcomes. A safe and easily administrable small molecule of plant origin that would protect or limit the spread of venom and provide valuable time for the victim to reach the healthcare centre would be a great lifesaver.",
