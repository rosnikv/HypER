        "title": "Natural interferon-alpha versus its combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone in the therapy of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia: a long-term, randomized, controlled study.",
        "abstract": "Type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is an often progressive vasculitis characterized by circulating cold-precipitable proteins that usually consists of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM kappa with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity. Its etiology is unknown, although recent evidence strongly suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a major role. Plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, and cytotoxic drugs have been used in the therapy of MC patients. Recently, favorable results with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN alpha) have been reported. To further assess its effectiveness, we studied the effects of natural human interferon-alpha (nIFN alpha), alone and in combination with 6-methyl-prednisolone (PDN), in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with symptomatic MC. Sixty-five patients were enrolled onto the trial, 52 (80%) of whom presented serum anti-HCV antibodies and specific genomic RNA sequences. Fifteen patients received nIFN alpha (3 MU) intramuscularly (IM) three times weekly, whereas 17 patients also received 16 mg/d of PDN orally on non-IFN days. Moreover, 18 patients received 16 mg/d of PDN only, and 15 were untreated. Treatment was discontinued after 1 year and patients were monitored for 8 to 17 months (mean, 13). A complete response was achieved in eight of 15 patients (53.3%) treated with nIFN alpha and nine of 17 (52.9%) treated with nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with three of 18 patients (16.7%) who received PDN only (P < .05) and one of 15 (6.7%) untreated controls (P < .01). Partial response occurred in two of 15 (13.3%) patients treated with nIFN alpha, three of 17 (17.6%) who received nIFN alpha plus PDN, one of 18 (5.5%) who received PDN only, and one of 15 (6.7%) controls. A complete response in six patients (66.7%) was achieved within 3 months in the group that received nIFN alpha plus PDN, as compared with two patients (25%) of those who received nIFN alpha alone (P < .02). In anti-HCV-positive patients, the clinical response occurred in step with reduced or undetectable levels of HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. Quantification of circulating HCV RNA represented a good predictive response marker. The probability of relapse within 3 months after treatment was 100% (three of three patients) and 75% (six of eight patients), respectively, in patients who received PDN alone or nIFN alpha alone as compared with none of those who received nIFN alpha plus PDN (P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Extrahepatic Manifestations of Hepatitis C Virus Infection",
        "abstract": "TO THE EDITOR: Gumber and Chopra [1] recently reviewed the extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. They focused on the striking association between HCV and mixed cryoglobulinemia. This immune-complex-mediated systemic vasculitis is secondary to benign B-lymphocyte expansion. The HCV infection of lymphocytes [2] represents the remote event that triggers chronic B-cell proliferation. The immune system alteration may promote various disorders (mixed cryoglobulinemia, autoimmune hepatitis, porphyria cutanea tarda, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and lung fibrosis. These manifestations could be the result of a variable combination of genetic and environmental factors, HCV mutants [3], and other infectious agents. Here, we point out the crucial role of lymphoproliferation in patients with HCV infection (Table 1). In a limited number of patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, the benign B-cell proliferation can evolve to frank non-Hodgkin lymphoma [2]. The same phenomenon has been anecdotally reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We recently described a cohort of 14 patients with chronic hepatitis C complicated by B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma observed over a long follow-up period [4]. In a few of these patients, HCV RNA has been detected in bone marrow or lymph node biopsy specimens using one-tube, nested polymerase chain reaction [2, 4]. Table 1. Systemic Disorders Related to HCV Infection* Moreover, in a series of 50 patients with idiopathic B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we found a surprisingly high frequency of HCV infection [5]. In 32% of these patients, HCV RNA has been shown in both sera and peripheral lymphocytes. Hepatitis C virus is probably the trigger factor of a multistep pathologic process, as has been hypothesized for other virus-induced neoplasias in humans. Throughout the world, chronic hepatitis C has become an increasingly diffuse disorder. The possible appearance of malignant lymphoproliferation during the natural course of HCV infection is an uncommon but severe complication that can affect overall prognosis.",

        "title": "Hepatitis C virus infection, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: an emerging picture.",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA agent which expresses its genetic informations in the form of a single, large polyprotein encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) that extends through most of its genomic RNA. Proteolytic cleavage of the ORF product is essential for the virogenesis and the production of viral progeny. HCV is responsible for chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral persistence is considered the greatest problem in the management of HCV infection. It may result from several mechanisms, two of which are established. In the first, the high rate of genetic variations during viral replication results in the production of mutants capable of escaping the immune attack. In the second, the virus infects cells of the immune system itself, which represent a privileged site that cannot be reached by virus-specific T cell response. Involvement of lymphoid cells in the early stages of HCV infection may provide insight into the pathobiologic patterns of extrahepatic dissemination (lymph nodes, major salivary glands, kidneys, blood vessels). Dissemination of HCV-infected lymphoid cells throughout the organism is likely to maintain a mobile and extensive reservoir of the virus. In this respect, extrahepatic sites may act as a source of continuous reinfection of hepatocytes. Studies of intrahepatic B lymphocytes indicate that they are infected with HCV, clonally expanded and activated to secrete IgM molecules with rheumatoid factor activity. This strongly suggests that HCV directly stimulates B cell expansion, which may result in an indolent stage of lymphoproliferation (i.e., mixed cryoglobulinemia) or in frank B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The frequency of NHL, however, is much lower than that of HCV infection, suggesting that HCV alone is not able to induce tumors and that cellular events, in addition to the presence of virus and virus-encoded products, are necessary in order to obtain a malignant B cell phenotype. The demonstration of HCV productive infection in bone marrow-recruited and circulating pluripotent hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells indicates that HCV replication occurs in the early differentiation stages of hematopoietic progenitors. These are stable cell populations and are likely to represent the initial site of infection and a continuous source of virus production.",

        "title": "Sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin antigen receptor of hepatitis C virus-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas suggests that the malignant cells are derived from the rheumatoid factor-producing cells that occur mainly in type II cryoglobulinemia.",
        "abstract": "Analysis of the immunoglobulin receptor (IGR) variable heavy- and light-chain sequences on 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) (9 patients also had type II mixed cryoglobulinemia [MC] syndrome and 8 had NHL unrelated to MC) and analysis of intraclonal diversity on 8 of them suggest that such malignant lymphoproliferations derive from an antigen-driven pathologic process, with a selective pressure for the maintenance of a functional IgR and a negative pressure for additional amino acid mutations in the framework regions (FRs). For almost all NHLs, both heavy- and light-chain complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) showed the highest similarity to antibodies with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity that have been found in the MC syndrome, thus suggesting that a common antigenic stimulus is involved in MC syndrome and in HCV-associated lymphomagenesis. Moreover, because HCV is the recognized pathologic agent of MC and the CDR3 amino acid sequences of some HCV-associated NHLs also present a high homology for antibody specific for the E2 protein of HCV, it may be reasonable to speculate that HCV E2 protein is one of the chronic antigenic stimuli involved in the lymphomagenetic process. Finally, the use of specific segments, in particular the D segment, in assembling the IgH chain of IgR seems to confer B-cell disorders with the property to produce antibody with RF activity, which may contribute to the manifestation of an overt MC syndrome.",

        "title": "Rheumatoid factors: host resistance or autoimmunity?",
        "abstract": "Rheumatoid factors (RFs), autoantibodies that bind to the Fc portion of IgG, are important in the immune response. RF-committed B-cells exist in the circulating lymphocyte pool in a high frequency (approximately 1-2 %) in normal individuals and in patients with pathological conditions associated with the sustained levels of circulating RF, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), and mixed cryoglobulinemia, associated with hepatitis C virus infection. RFs are induced by many infectious entities (viruses, bacteria, parasites) as a consequence of a secondary immune response to the pathogen, but usually the response is transient. It is likely that RFs play an important role in the host's defense against infection, both at the cellular level, where the RF B-cell can be an antigen presenting cell which can promote the antipathogen response, and at the humoral level, where RFs can contribute to the mopping up of the IgG antipathogen antibodies by contributing to immune complex formation and clearance. There has been much research on RFs in chronic pathological conditions, and the literature pertaining to their origin, structure, binding specificities, and possible roles in disease are discussed. The importance of the host defense, sometimes at the expense of an autoimmune response, is a balance that needs to be considered in light of a possible outcome of health or disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma who have disease progression during or after the receipt of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy have a poor prognosis. KTE-X19, an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, may have benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a multicenter, phase 2 trial, we evaluated KTE-X19 in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. Patients had disease that had relapsed or was refractory after the receipt of up to five previous therapies; all patients had to have received BTK inhibitor therapy previously. Patients underwent leukapheresis and optional bridging therapy, followed by conditioning chemotherapy and a single infusion of KTE-X19 at a dose of 2\u00d7106 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) as assessed by an independent radiologic review committee according to the Lugano classification. Per the protocol, the primary efficacy analysis was to be conducted after 60 patients had been treated and followed for 7 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 74 patients were enrolled. KTE-X19 was manufactured for 71 patients and administered to 68. The primary efficacy analysis showed that 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84 to 98) of the 60 patients in the primary efficacy analysis had an objective response; 67% (95% CI, 53 to 78) had a complete response. In an intention-to-treat analysis involving all 74 patients, 85% had an objective response; 59% had a complete response. At a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range, 7.0 to 32.3), 57% of the 60 patients in the primary efficacy analysis were in remission. At 12 months, the estimated progression-free survival and overall survival were 61% and 83%, respectively. Common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were cytopenias (in 94% of the patients) and infections (in 32%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 15% and 31% of patients, respectively; none were fatal. Two grade 5 infectious adverse events occurred.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nKTE-X19 induced durable remissions in a majority of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. The therapy led to serious and life-threatening toxic effects that were consistent with those reported with other CAR T-cell therapies.

        "abstract": "The present study investigated the significance of the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelets in relation to the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Localization of the BDNF expression in human HCC tissues was performed by immunohistochemistry. The measurement of soluble BDNF in the serum was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BDNF was expressed in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. A positive correlation between the tissue and serum levels of BDNF was identified in the HCC patients. The serum levels of BDNF were positively correlated with the platelet counts in the HCC patients. A higher level of serum BDNF was significantly correlated with a tumor size >5 cm, poorly differentiated HCC, the presence of microsatellite tumor nodules, and the absence of cirrhosis in the non-tumorous tissues. A higher level of the serum BDNF/platelet ratio was associated with a poorer disease-free survival after hepatic resection. This study suggested that the tumor cell was a source of serum BDNF in HCC. A higher serum BDNF level was associated with a more advanced tumor status in the HCC patients. The interaction between serum BDNF and platelets might play an important role in HCC tumor progression.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nDespite abundant clinical evidence, the mechanisms by which hepatic iron overload develops in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated chronic liver disease remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how hepatic iron overload develops in the presence of HCV proteins.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMale transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein and nontransgenic control mice (C57BL/6) were assessed for iron concentrations in the liver, spleen, and serum and iron regulatory molecules in vivo and ex vivo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTransgenic mice had increased hepatic and serum iron concentrations, decreased splenic iron concentration, and lower hepcidin expression in the liver accompanied by higher expression of ferroportin in the duodenum, spleen, and liver. In response to hepatocellular iron excess, transferrin receptor 1 expression decreased and ferritin expression increased in the transgenic liver. Transgenic mice showed no inflammation in the liver but preserved the ability to induce hepcidin in response to proinflammatory cytokines induced by lipopolysaccharide. Hepcidin promoter activity and the DNA binding activity of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP) were down-regulated concomitant with increased expression of C/EBP homology protein, an inhibitor of C/EBP DNA binding activity, and with increased levels of reactive oxygen species in transgenic mice at the ages of 8 and 14 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHCV-induced reactive oxygen species may down-regulate hepcidin transcription through inhibition of C/EBPalpha DNA binding activity by C/EBP homology protein, which in turn leads to increased duodenal iron transport and macrophage iron release, causing hepatic iron accumulation.",

        "abstract": "In most adult epithelia the process of replacing damaged or dead cells is maintained through the presence of stem/progenitor cells, which allow epithelial tissues to be repaired following injury. Existing evidence strongly supports the presence of stem cells in the adult kidney. Indeed, recent findings provide evidence in favour of a role for intrinsic renal cells and against a physiological role for bone marrow-derived stem cells in the regeneration of renal epithelial cells. In addition, recent studies have identified a subset of CD24+CD133+ renal progenitors within the Bowman's capsule of adult human kidney, which provides regenerative potential for injured renal epithelial cells. Intriguingly, CD24 + CD133 + renal progenitors also represent common progenitors of tubular cells and podocytes during renal development. Chronic injury causes dysfunction of the tubular epithelial cells, which triggers the release of fibrogenic cytokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells to injured kidneys. The rapid interposition of scar tissue probably confers a survival advantage by preventing infectious microorganisms from invading the wound, but prevents subsequent tissue regeneration. However, the existence of renal epithelial progenitors in the kidney suggests a possible explanation for the regression of renal lesions which has been observed in experimental animals and even in humans. Thus, manipulation of the wound repair process in order to shift it towards regeneration will probably require the ability to slow the rapid fibrotic response so that renal progenitor cells can allow tissue regeneration rather than scar formation.",

        "abstract": "The effects of retinoids, the structural derivatives of vitamin A (retinol), on post-natal peak bone density acquisition and skeletal remodeling are complex and compartment specific. Emerging data indicates that retinoids, such as all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its precursor all trans retinaldehyde (Rald), exhibit distinct and divergent transcriptional effects in metabolism. Despite these observations, the role of enzymes that control retinoid metabolism in bone remains undefined. In this study, we examined the skeletal phenotype of mice deficient in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a1), the enzyme responsible for converting Rald to ATRA in adult animals. Bone densitometry and micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) demonstrated that Aldh1a1-deficient (Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212) female mice had higher trabecular and cortical bone mass compared to age and sex-matched control C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice at multiple time points. Histomorphometry confirmed increased cortical bone thickness and demonstrated significantly higher bone marrow adiposity in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In serum assays, Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice also had higher serum IGF-1 levels. In vitro, primary Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressed significantly higher levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and demonstrated enhanced osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis versus WT MSCs. BMP2 was also expressed at higher levels in the femurs and tibias of Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice with accompanying induction of BMP2-regulated responses, including expression of Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase, and Smad phosphorylation. In vitro, Rald, which accumulates in Aldh1a1\u2212/\u2212 mice, potently induced BMP2 in WT MSCs in a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent manner, suggesting that Rald is involved in the BMP2 increases seen in Aldh1a1 deficiency in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate Aldh1a1 as a novel determinant of cortical bone density and marrow adiposity in the skeleton in vivo through modulation of BMP signaling.",

At 2 weeks of age, the mandibular mineral density, alveolar bone volume, osteoblast numbers, and dental volume, dentin sialoprotein-immunopositive areas in the first molar were increased significantly in p27(-/-) mice and decreased dramatically in both Pthrp(KI/KI) and p27(-/-) Pthrp(KI/KI) mice compared with wild-type mice; however, these parameters were partly rescued in p27(-/-) Pthrp(KI/KI) mice compared with Pthrp(KI/KI) mice. These data demonstrate that the deletion of p27 in Pthrp(KI/KI) mice can partially rescue defects in dental and mandibular development. Furthermore, we found that deletion of p27 in Pthrp(KI/KI) mice partially corrected the dental and mandibular phenotype by modulating cell cyclin-regulating molecules and antioxidant enzymes. This study therefore indicates that the p27 pathway may function downstream in the action of PTHrP nuclear localization sequence to regulate dental and mandibular development.",

        "title": "Overexpressed Sirt1 in MSCs Promotes Dentin Formation in Bmi1-Deficient Mice",
        "abstract": "Sirt1 promotes odontoblastic gene expression in human dental pulp cells, whereas the inhibition of Sirt1 downregulates the expression of those genes. To investigate whether the overexpression of Sirt1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) driven by Prx1 promoter could rescue the dentin formation defects in Bmi1-deficient (Bmi1\u2212/\u2212) mice, we established the MSCs overexpressing Sirt1 in Bmi1 knockout mice (Sirt1TGBmi1\u2212/\u2212). First, we used Prx1-Cre/ROSAnTnG mice to demonstrate that Prx1 linage cells exist mainly in the pulp horns at 4 wk of age. Second, we found that 4-wk-old Sirt1TG mice had increased tooth volume as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. The expression level of Sirt1 was significantly higher in dental papilla mesenchymal cells of Sirt1TG mice than WT mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the tooth mineralization, dental volume, dentin sialoprotein\u2013immunopositive areas, odontoblastic gene expression, and percentage of proliferating BrdU-positive cells were significantly elevated in the Sirt1TG mice and dramatically reduced in the Bmi1\u2013/\u2013 mice versus the WT littermates at 4 wk of age. However, the areas of predentin and the percentage of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were significantly reduced in the Sirt1TG mice but dramatically increased in the Bmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared with the WT littermates. All these parameters were rescued in the Sirt1TGBmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice versus the Bmi1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Finally, by using dental papilla mesenchymal cells, we found that the overexpression of Sirt1 rescued the reduced cell proliferation and differentiation and increased the cell apoptosis caused by Bmi1 deficiency, which was associated with increased p53 deacetylation. Therefore, this study indicates that Sirt1 is a potential therapeutic target for promoting dentin formation in an anabolic approach to the treatment of dental developmental defects.",

        "abstract": "The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis and the immunological response to inflammation. The effects of lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well studied. Here we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)+/podoplanin (PDPN)+ lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\u2010associated periodontitis and ligature\u2010induced periodontitis. Further, PDPN+/alpha\u2010smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA)\u2212 lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN+/\u03b1SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased TRAP\u2010positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the local administration of adeno\u2010associated virus for vascular endothelial growth factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the area and number of PDPN+/\u03b1SMA+ collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. Lastly, LYVE1+/\u03b1SMA\u2212 lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1+/\u03b1SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls. Thus, our findings reveal an important role of local lymphatic drainage in periodontal inflammation\u2010mediated alveolar bone loss. \u00a9 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "Determining the mechanism of senescence\u2010associated pulmonary fibrosis is crucial for designing more effective treatments for chronic lung diseases. This study aimed to determine the following: whether Sirt1 and serum vitamin D decreased with physiological aging, promoting senescence\u2010associated pulmonary fibrosis by activating TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling, whether Sirt1 overexpression prevented TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling\u2010mediated senescence\u2010associated pulmonary fibrosis in vitamin D\u2010deficient (Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212) mice, and whether Sirt1 downregulated IL\u201011 expression transcribed by TGF\u2010\u03b21/Smad2 signaling through deacetylating histone at the IL\u201011 promoter in pulmonary fibroblasts. Bioinformatics analysis with RNA sequencing data from pulmonary fibroblasts of physiologically aged mice was conducted for correlation analysis. Lungs from young and physiologically aged wild\u2010type (WT) mice were examined for cell senescence, fibrosis markers, and TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling proteins, and 1,25(OH)2D3 and IL\u201011 levels were detected in serum. Nine\u2010week\u2010old WT, Sirt1 mesenchymal transgene (Sirt1Tg), Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212, and Sirt1TgCyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were observed the pulmonary function, aging, and senescence\u2010associated secretory phenotype and TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling. We found that pulmonary Sirt1 and serum vitamin D decreased with physiological aging, activating TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling, and promoting senescence\u2010associated pulmonary fibrosis. Sirt1 overexpression improved pulmonary dysfunction, aging, DNA damage, senescence\u2010associated secretory phenotype, and fibrosis through downregulating TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling in Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Sirt1 negatively regulated IL\u201011 expression through deacetylating H3K9/14ac mainly at the region from \u2212871 to \u2212724 of IL\u201011 promoter, also the major binding region of Smad2 which regulated IL\u201011 expression at the transcriptional level, and subsequently inhibiting TGF\u2010\u03b21/IL\u201011/MEK/ERK signaling in pulmonary fibroblasts. This signaling in aging fibroblasts could be a therapeutic target for preventing senescence\u2010associated pulmonary fibrosis induced by vitamin D deficiency.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin 11 (IL11) is an elusive member of the IL6 family of cytokines. While initially thought to be a haematopoietic and cytoprotective factor, more recent data show instead that IL11 is redundant for haematopoiesis and toxic. In this review, the reasons that led to the original misunderstandings of IL11 biology, which are now understandable, are explained with particular attention on the use of recombinant human IL11 in mice and humans. Following tissue injury, as part of an evolutionary ancient homeostatic response, IL11 is secreted from damaged mammalian cells to signal via JAK/STAT3, ERK/P90RSK, LKB1/mTOR and GSK3\u03b2/SNAI1 in autocrine and paracrine. This activates a program of mesenchymal transition of epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells to cause inflammation, fibrosis, and stalled endogenous tissue repair, leading to organ failure. The role of IL11 signalling in cell- and organ-specific pathobiology is described, the large unknowns about IL11 biology are discussed and the promise of targeting IL11 signalling as a therapeutic approach is reviewed.",

        "title": "IL-11 Expression in Systemic Sclerosis Is Dependent on Caspase-1 Activity but Does Not Increase Collagen Deposition",
        "abstract": "Background: Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is increased in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is thought to play a role in fibrosis. Many studies have reported decreased fibrosis when IL-11 is blocked, but few have examined factors that induce IL-11 expression. Because fibrosis has been linked to activated inflammasomes driving caspase-1 maturation and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, we set out to determine if IL-11 expression was dependent on caspase-1 activity. Methods: Primary lung fibroblast cell lines derived from patients with SSc, IPF (fibrotic control), and healthy individuals were cultured at low passage. Gene expression for IL-11 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R\u03b11) was analyzed using qPCR and normalized to the control, and collagen production was measured using Sirius Red. Results: SSc and IPF fibroblasts expressed significantly more IL-11 transcripts than normal cells (3.35-fold and 9.97-fold more, p = 0.0396 and p = 0.0023, respectively). IL-11R\u03b11 was expressed 2.32-fold and 2.27-fold more in SSc and IPF (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0032, respectively) than in normal cells. In SSc fibroblasts, inhibition of caspase-1 with YVAD decreased IL-11 expression by 49.59% (p = 0.0016) but did not affect IL-11R\u03b11 expression (p > 0.05). IL-11 expression was increased 2.97-fold with TGF-\u03b21 (p = 0.0030) and 22.24-fold with IL-1\u03b2 (p < 0.0001), while the expression of IL-11R\u03b11 was not induced with these two cytokines. LPS increased IL-11 expression in normal fibroblasts 1.52-fold (p = 0.0042), which was abolished with YVAD (p < 0.0001). IL-11R\u03b11 gene transcripts were also increased with LPS 1.50-fold (p = 0.0132), but YVAD did not inhibit this expression. In these studies, we were unable to detect IL-11 protein nor were we able to induce COL1A1 expression or increase the total amount of collagen secreted by fibroblasts with human recombinant IL-11. Conclusions: IL-11 and its receptor, IL-11R\u03b11, are both elevated in fibrosis. IL-11 expression is dependent on inflammasome activation of caspase-1 and the downstream cytokines TGF-\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b2, while IL-11R\u03b11 was only dependent on NF-kB.",
