        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCollaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine associations between cerebral microbleed (CMB) burden with recurrent ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk after IS or TIA. Methods: We identified prospective studies of patients with IS or TIA that investigated CMBs and stroke (ICH and IS) risk during \u22653 months follow-up. Authors provided aggregate summary-level data on stroke outcomes, with CMBs categorized according to burden (single, 2\u20134, and \u22655 CMBs) and distribution. We calculated absolute event rates and pooled risk ratios (RR) using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 5,068 patients from 15 studies. There were 115/1,284 (9.6%) recurrent IS events in patients with CMBs vs 212/3,781 (5.6%) in patients without CMBs (pooled RR 1.8 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4\u20132.5). There were 49/1,142 (4.3%) ICH events in those with CMBs vs 17/2,912 (0.58%) in those without CMBs (pooled RR 6.3 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% CI 3.5\u201311.4). Increasing CMB burden increased the risk of IS (pooled RR [95% CI] 1.8 [1.0\u20133.1], 2.4 [1.3\u20134.4], and 2.7 [1.5\u20134.9] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively) and ICH (pooled RR [95% CI] 4.6 [1.9\u201310.7], 5.6 [2.4\u201313.3], and 14.1 [6.9\u201329.0] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively). Conclusions: CMBs are associated with increased stroke risk after IS or TIA. With increasing CMB burden (compared to no CMBs), the risk of ICH increases more steeply than that of IS. However, IS absolute event rates remain higher than ICH absolute event rates in all CMB burden categories.",

        "abstract": "See related articles, p 12, p 21, p 29, p 38, p 47 This edition of focused updates in cerebrovascular disease of the journal is devoted to cerebral microangiopathies. Research into cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD) has blossomed over the past 2 decades. While there are many reasons for such heightened interest in these conditions, one major factor is the visibility of many brain lesions attributable to cSVDs on clinical neuroimaging. Cerebral microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis, white matter disease, lacunar infarcts, cerebral microinfarcts, and enlarged perivascular spaces are all visible on commonly obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Studies aimed at validating these radiological lesions showed good correlation with the actual pathologies. National Institutes of Health identified cSVD as a major contributor to dementia, therefore, a top research priority. The result of the improved funding and development of multidisciplinary collaborations is an exponentially increasing number of high-quality research publications. The current focused updates aim to cover some of the key developments in the field. The progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of disease through neuroimaging and genetics, the latest on therapeutic trials, and finally the clinical relevance of cSVDs are discussed in 5 review articles. This introductory article will not restate what is already been discussed in detail in these articles, but we will cover 3 specific areas that present challenges in clinical care and research related to cSVDs, therefore offering opportunities for improvement. We will specifically emphasize the importance of cSVD in multidisciplinary efforts aimed at detection and interpretation of neuroimaging findings in the clinic, prediction of risk for hemorrhagic strokes, and relationship with cognitive impairment in middle aged to older adults.",

        "title": "A predictive study of multivariate factors affecting goal attainment of INR after anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNon-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common type of AF, and patients with NVAF have a higher risk of ischemic stroke than non-AF patients. This study aims to investigate the goal attainment of international normalized ratio (INR) in patients with NVAF after anticoagulation therapy, and to analyze the risk factors that affect the goal attainment of INR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNVAF patients who were admitted to our hospital from December 2019 to December 2020 and received anticoagulation therapy were selected as the research subjects. The INR goal attainment of patients was assessed, the risk factors affecting INR goal attainment were analyzed, and a ROC curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of risk factors for INR goal attainment in NVAF patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter anticoagulation treatment, the INR of 42 cases reached the target (INR value \u22650.2, the goal attainment group), and the INR of 74 cases did not reach the target (INR value <2.0, the non-goal attainment group). The age, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and large platelet ratio (P-LCR) levels of patients in the goal attainment group were significantly lower than those in the non-goal attainment group, and the platelet count (PLT) level was higher than that of the non-goal attainment group (P<0.05). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that MPV, PDW, and P-LCR were independent risk factors that affected the failure in INR goal attainment in patients with NVAF after anticoagulation therapy. The ROC curve showed that the AUC values of MPV, PDW, and P-LCR were 0.711, 0.748, 0.867, respectively, and the combined AUC was 0.876, which was higher than that of the single detection.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMPV, PDW, and P-LCR are important factors that affect the goal attainment of INR after anticoagulant therapy in NVAF patients. For patients with risk factors, clinicians can formulate a reasonable individualized anticoagulant drug regimen based on the above-mentioned index levels.",
