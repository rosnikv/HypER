        "title": "Peginterferon alfa\u20102a for hepatitis C after liver transplantation: Two randomized, controlled trials",
        "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for recurrent hepatitis C after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We therefore performed two randomized, controlled trials\u2014a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial\u2014to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a in patients who had undergone OLT. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 54 patients within 3 weeks after OLT, and the treatment trial enrolled 67 patients 6 to 60 months after OLT. In each trial, patients were randomized to treatment with once weekly injections of 180 \u03bcg peginterferon alfa\u20102a or no antiviral treatment for 48 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks thereafter. Peginterferon alfa\u20102a treated patients had significantly lower hepatitis C virus RNA levels and more favorable changes in hepatic histological features compared with untreated controls. However, only 2 treated patients in the prophylaxis trial (8%) and 3 in the treatment trial (12%) achieved a sustained virological response. In the prophylaxis trial, 8 patients (31%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 9 (32%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely; whereas in the treatment trial, 10 patients (30%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 6 (19%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely. The incidence of acute rejection was similar in the treated and untreated groups in both the prophylaxis (12% vs. 21%; P = .5) and treatment (12% vs. 0%; P = .1) trials. In conclusion, peginterferon alfa\u20102a treatment for 48 weeks is safe and tolerable and offers some efficacy in the post\u2010OLT setting. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients who have undergone OLT. (HEPATOLOGY 2005;41:289\u2013298.)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nRecurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a relevant problem of liver transplantation programs. We evaluated the effect of antiviral therapy on disease progression in 81 HCV-infected liver transplantation recipients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with mild hepatitis C recurrence (fibrosis stage F0 to F2, n = 54) were randomized to no treatment (group A, n = 27) or peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin for 48 weeks (group B, n = 27). Patients with severe recurrence (F3 to F4, cholestatic hepatitis) were treated (group C, n = 27). All patients (n = 81) underwent a liver biopsy at baseline and after follow-up; paired hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements were available in 51 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen (48%) patients of group B and 5 (18.5%) of group C achieved sustained virological response. Liver fibrosis progressed > or =1 stage in 40 (49%) of 81 patients: 19 (70%) of group A versus 7 (26%) of group B (P = .001) and in 14 (54%) of group C. HVPG increased (6.5 to 13 mm Hg, P < .01) in patients in whom fibrosis worsened, whereas it decreased (5 to 3.5 mm Hg, P = .017) or remained unchanged in those with fibrosis improvement or stabilization, respectively. The only variable independently associated with fibrosis improvement/stabilization was treatment (odds ratio [OR] =3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 10, P = .009). Among treated patients, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization and viral clearance were independently associated with histological or hemodynamic improvement/stabilization (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 18, P < .01; OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 38, P = .01; respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data demonstrate that in liver transplantation recipients, antiviral therapy slows disease progression (particularly in sustained virological responders), as shown by its effects on liver histology and on HVPG.",

        "abstract": "Summary.\u2002 Pegylated interferon with ribavirin (Peg/R) is the most effective therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) but its utility and effectiveness after liver transplantation has been difficult to assess. We evaluated efficacy, tolerability, and safety of Peg/R in liver transplant candidates and recipients with HCV cirrhosis. We searched medical databases and conference proceedings between January 1999 and January 2008 selecting randomized and nonrandomized studies. Primary end points meta\u2010analytically were: (1) sustained viral response (SVR) and (2) histological response. Secondary end points were: (1) treatment discontinuation, (2) mortality, and (3) rejection episodes. Pegylated interferons using either 1\u20131.5\u2003mcg/kg of pegylated interferon alpha\u20102b or 180\u2003\u03bcg (pegylated interferon alpha\u20102a combined with ribavirin 800\u20131200\u2003mg/day were the most effective compared to any other regimen or no therapy. In three pretransplant studies the median SVR was 19.6% (19.6\u201350%). In six postransplant studies where a meta\u2010analysis was done the cumulative risk difference in SVR was 0.31% (95% CI, 0.18\u20130.44, p\u2003<\u20030.001). However histological response was not significantly better compared to no therapy or other antiviral regimens. There were no significant differences in discontinuation of therapy, acute or chronic rejection or mortality between optimal Peg/R vs no treatment or other regimens. Hence pegylated interferon plus ribavirin in full doses is effective pre and post transplant but has a low SVR rate. To date no significant histological improvement has been reported.",

Furthermore, despite its significance as a cause of chronic liver disease and indication for LT, it has received little attention in recent years for several reasons, including the good posttransplant short-term results, and the lack of specific \"drugs\" used for this disease. A writing group, endorsed by the International Liver Transplant Society, was convened to write guidelines on Liver Transplantation for Alcoholic Liver Disease to summarize current knowledge and provide answers to controversial and delicate ethical as well as clinical problems. We report here a short version of the guidelines (long version available at www.ilts.org) with the final recommendations graded for level of evidence.

        "abstract": "Within 5\u201310 years, 20\u201340% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010infected liver transplant recipients can be expected to develop cirrhosis. Here, cost\u2010effectiveness of antiviral therapy was assessed. A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression and calculate outcome and costs of treatment. In the baseline analysis, Peg\u2010IFN/RBV treatment prevented organ loss/death, gained quality\u2010adjusted life\u2010years (QALYs) and undercut the limit of cost\u2010effectiveness of \u20ac50 000/QALY with an incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio of approximately \u20ac40 400/QALY and \u20ac21 000/QALY for HCV genotype 1 and 2/3 patients, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis testing modified model parameters according to extreme data described in the literature confirmed cost\u2010effectiveness for a lower or higher rate of fibrosis progression, increased non\u2010HCV\u2010related mortality, lower limits of utilities, a time horizon of 30 years, and additional costs in the year of death. On the other hand, cost\u2010effectiveness was lost for patients with genotype 1 in case of doubled antiviral or life\u2010time costs or an increased discount rate of 7%. New treatment strategies for HCV genotype 1 infected patients remained on the same level cost\u2010effective, if additional costs did not exceed \u20ac10 774 per 10% sustained virologic response gain. We conclude that Peg\u2010IFN/RBV treatment is cost\u2010effective post transplant. This may support treatment decision in individual cases.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the most common indication for liver transplantation (LT). Aggressive treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection before cirrhosis development or decompensation may reduce LT need and risk of HCV recurrence post-LT. Factors associated with increased HCV risk or severity of recurrence include older age, immunosuppression, HCV genotype 1 and high viral load at LT. HCV recurrence post-LT leads to accelerated liver disease and cirrhosis development with reduced graft and patient survival. Currently, interferon (IFN)-based regimens can be used in dual-agent regimens with ribavirin, in triple-agent antiviral strategies with direct-acting antivirals (e.g., protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir), or before transplant in compensated patients to reduce HCV viral load to prevent or reduce the risk of post-LT recurrence and complications; they cannot be used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. IFN-based regimens are used in less than half of HCV-infected patients waiting for LT due to extremely low efficacy and poor tolerability. However, antiviral therapy is indicated after LT in patients with histologically confirmed CHC despite tolerability issues. Improvements in side effect management have increased survival in patients achieving therapeutic targets. HCV treatment pre- and post-LT results in significant health care costs especially when lack of efficacy leads to disease worsening, although studies have shown sofosbuvir treatment before LT vs conventional post-LT dual antiviral is cost effective. The suboptimal efficacy and tolerability of IFN-based therapies, plus the significant economic burden, means the need for effective and well tolerated IFN-free anti-HCV therapy for pre- and post-LT remains high.",

Methods The current study describes three cases of treatment failure in patients referred to Zagazig Viral Hepatitis Treatment Center (ZVHTC), Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. RAS were identified and characterized using deep sequencing. The first patient had breakthrough while receiving a daclatasvir (DCV)+sofosbuvir (SOF) regimen, patient 2 relapsed after treatment with DCV+SOF+ribavirin (RBV), and patient 3 relapsed after DCV+SOF therapy. A serum sample was collected from each patient at failure and sent to Vall d\u2019Hebron Research Institute at Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron in Barcelona (Spain) for deep-sequencing study to identify and characterize the RAS present in the samples. Results The following were identified: L28M, L30S and L28M+L30S in patient 1, L30R in patient 2, and R155C, D168E, L28M, L30H, L30S, L28M+L30H, and L28M+L30S in patient 3. Conclusion:\u00a0 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from Egypt of patients failing DAA-based therapy, describing the associated RAS.

We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks\u2019 retreatment with either combination of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/simeprevir plus ribavirin (SOF/DCV/SMV/RBV, n = 45) or sofosbuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin (SOF/OBV/PTV/r/RBV, n = 163) in patients who had previously failed NS5A inhibitors\u2010based regimens. The primary end point was SVR 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Safety follow\u2010up data were recorded for 60 weeks after the end of treatment. Two hundred\u2010eight patients were included in the study. Of them, 53.4% of patients were females and 40.4% had liver cirrhosis. The most common prior drug combinations were sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (n = 94) and sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus ribavirin (n = 109). The overall SVR12 rates were 98.1%. In SOF/DCV/SMV/RBV group, 95.6% achieved SVR12, while in SOF/OBV/PTV/r/RBV group, the SVR12 rates were 98.8%. SVR12 was higher in cirrhotic patients (84/84) than noncirrhotic (120/124), P value = .0149. Regarding the safety outcomes, anaemia and fatigue were significantly higher in SOF/OBV/PTV/r/RBV group. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was reported in eight (3.8%) patients (four in each group). Of them, death was confirmed in four patients. Retreatment of Egyptian CHC relapsed patients with either sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/simeprevir plus ribavirin or sofosbuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin is highly effective and well\u2010tolerated for both noncirrhotic and compensated cirrhotic patients.
