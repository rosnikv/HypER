        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare medication adherence calculated from four different data sources including a pill count and self-report obtained during a home medication history, as well as calculations based on refill frequency derived from a provincial prescription claims database (manual and electronic). DESIGN: Baseline medication adherence was collected as part of a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Mean medication adherence results obtained from the four data sources were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple range test. SETTING: A pharmacy consultation service located at an interdisciplinary wellness center for noninstitutionalized elderly. PATIENTS: 65 years or older, noninstitutionalized, taking one or more prescribed or nonprescribed medications. Clients would either present to the wellness center or be referred by the Provincial Home Care program. RESULTS: When calculated from self-report or manual or electronic prescription claims data, mean percent adherence by drug was high and not statistically different (95.8% \u00b1 17.1%, 107.6% \u00b1 40.3%, and 94.6% \u00b1 24.0%, respectively), whereas the pill count adherence was significantly lower at 74.0% \u00b1 41.5% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An unexpected finding was that the pill count technique used in this study of elderly clients using chronic, repeat medications appeared to underestimate medication adherence. Numerous other limitations of pill count, self-report, and a province-wide prescription claims database in estimating medication adherence are presented. When using medication adherence as a process measure, the researcher and practitioner should be aware of the limitations unique to the data source they choose, and interpret data cautiously.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To compare self-reported nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART) with predose plasma levels of protease inhibitor (PI). DESIGN A cross-sectional study of consecutive patients from a university-based HIV clinic in Rome, Italy, was conducted. One hundred and forty HIV-infected patients were prescribed regimens containing ritonavir or indinavir. A patient questionnaire assessing knowledge of treatment regimen, adherence behavior, reasons for taking and missing therapy, factors influencing adherence, and health behaviors was administered. A predose PI plasma level was measured concurrently. RESULTS By patient report, 12% missed at least one dose \"yesterday,\" and 24% missed doses in the last 3 days; 14% had a predose plasma concentration below the assay limit of quantitation (2 ritonavir and 18 indinavir samples). Confusion, poor psychological well-being, long office wait, running out of drugs between visits, having relatives to remind the patient to take medication, children, and alteration of sense of taste were related to unquantifiable predose levels of PI. In multivariable analysis, reported nonadherence (odds ratio [OR], 15.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-63.3) and confusion (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.4-69.6) were related to unquantifiable predose levels of PI. CONCLUSION Self-report of missing a dose of antiretroviral medication \"yesterday\" was related to an unmeasurable plasma PI level.",

        "abstract": "Success with current protease inhibitors (PIs) is limited by substantial variability in pharmacokinetics, onset of adverse metabolic effects that include sustained lipid elevations and insulin resistance, and increased risk of lipodystrophy. Additionally, poor adherence to the often complex regimens can lead to emergence of PI-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) variants and treatment failure. Boosting blood levels of current PIs through coadministration of ritonavir can improve the pharmacokinetic characteristics of these agents, increasing the chances of success, but often at the price of additional adverse effects. New PIs in development have the potential to overcome at least some of these obstacles. Tipranavir, mozenavir, and atazanavir have favorable and unique resistance profiles, making them potentially effective in new treatment strategies in both PI-na\u00efve and PI-experienced patients. Atazanavir does not cause the lipid elevations seen with current PIs, and it may improve adherence through once-daily dosing.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nApproximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy, which puts them at greater risk for poorer access to care and poorer health outcomes.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo update a 2004 systematic review and determine whether low health literacy is related to poorer use of health care, outcomes, costs, and disparities in health outcomes among persons of all ages.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nEnglish-language articles identified through MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane Library databases and hand-searching (search dates for articles on health literacy, 2003 to 22 February 2011; for articles on numeracy, 1966 to 22 February 2011).\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nTwo reviewers independently selected studies that compared outcomes by differences in directly measured health literacy or numeracy levels.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nOne reviewer abstracted article information into evidence tables; a second reviewer checked information for accuracy. Two reviewers independently rated study quality by using predefined criteria, and the investigative team jointly graded the overall strength of evidence.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\n96 relevant good- or fair-quality studies in 111 articles were identified: 98 articles on health literacy, 22 on numeracy, and 9 on both. Low health literacy was consistently associated with more hospitalizations; greater use of emergency care; lower receipt of mammography screening and influenza vaccine; poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications appropriately; poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages; and, among elderly persons, poorer overall health status and higher mortality rates. Poor health literacy partially explains racial disparities in some outcomes. Reviewers could not reach firm conclusions about the relationship between numeracy and health outcomes because of few studies or inconsistent results among studies.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nSearches were limited to articles published in English. No Medical Subject Heading terms exist for identifying relevant studies. No evidence concerning oral health literacy (speaking and listening skills) and outcomes was found.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLow health literacy is associated with poorer health outcomes and poorer use of health care services.\n\n\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",

        "abstract": "The rollout of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in eastern and southern Africa will be one of the most important public health interventions in the years to come. Among the lingering dangers in that effort is that inequalities in infection rates will be compounded by inequities in the access to treatment. Because of a lack of vital registration systems however the settings where these concerns are probably most legitimate go without monitoring. We use 5-year data from an ongoing surveillance of burials at all cemeteries of Addis Ababa to investigate the population level impact of antiretroviral treatment on sex-specific adult mortality trends. To that end we use life table techniques as well as methods that are based on the lay reports of the causes of death. Preliminary results suggest that AIDS mortality indeed declined since the introduction of ART but more so for men than for women. (authors)",

Methods:We prospectively assessed CD4 cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and alcohol consumption for up to 7 years in 595 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems recruited between 1997 and 2003. We investigated the relation of these markers of HIV disease progression to alcohol consumption using longitudinal regression models controlling for known prognostic factors, including adherence and depressive symptoms, and stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results:Among subjects who were not on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a lower CD4 cell count (adjusted mean decrease of 48.6 cells/\u03bcL compared with abstinence; P = 0.03) but not with higher log10 HIV RNA. Among subjects who were on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was not associated with a lower CD4 cell count or higher log10 HIV RNA. Conclusions:Heavy alcohol consumption has a negative impact on the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected persons not receiving ART. In addition to the known deleterious effects of alcohol on ART adherence, these findings suggest that avoiding heavy alcohol consumption in patients not on ART may have a beneficial effect on HIV disease progression.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to identify and assess studies that have quantified the association between alcohol consumption and HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. PubMed, CAB Abstracts and article references were searched to identify studies published in English between 2000 and 2008 that reported relative measures of the association between alcohol use and HIV prevalence and/or seroconversion rates. Twenty-one eligible studies were described in detail and information on study characteristics extracted. All of the identified studies were conducted either in east or southern Africa, and varied substantially regarding study population and alcohol use definitions. Overall, users of alcohol and especially problem drinkers were more likely to be HIV seropositive (HIV+) than non-users, frequency or quantity of alcohol use was positively associated with HIV prevalence, and the association varied by gender. The use of alcohol in sexual contexts was significantly associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition and prevalence. The findings of this review of sub-Saharan African research strongly support an association between alcohol consumption and HIV infection. Although a causal relationship could not be established with certainty from the mainly cross-sectional studies, the negative consequences of such an association have profound implications for the burden of disease in this region. To confirm causality, future research should use prospective study designs, use clearly defined standardised measures of alcohol use (and problematic drinking) and an \u2018event-specific\u2019 approach to examine the situational links between alcohol use and HIV acquisition.",

This study assessed HRQL and its predictors among men and women with HIV/AIDS. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 155 patients (36.8% women, mean age=31.4) registering for antiretroviral treatment (ART) at Vietnam-Sweden Uong Bi General Hospital, Quang Ninh Province. The Vietnamese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV brief version (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) was developed. Factor analysis was applied to assess the construct validity of the measurement. Six major domains of the Vietnamese WHOQOL-HIV BREF were determined, namely physical; performance; morbidity; environment; psychological; and social support. Internal consistency reliability of the six domains ranged from 0.52 to 0.71. Multivariate linear regression models, constructed using step-wise forward selection, determined different predictors of HRQL domain scores in men and women with HIV/AIDS. The results showed that men reported higher scores or better in Morbidity (p=0.02), Environment (p=0.07) and Psychological dimensions (p=0.02); meanwhile, women had higher scores in Performance (p=0.09). Alcohol and injection drug use negatively predicted HRQL outcomes in both men and women. Employment was associated with better performance in men, and better physical but poorer environment status in women. Female patients who have a child experienced decrements in social support, psychological, environment, and performance. Findings of this study highlight the need to develop comprehensive interventions for HIV/AIDS patients, including HIV/AIDS treatment support and gender-specific impact mitigation interventions strategies.",

Aim. To assess gender differences in HRQOL and its associated factors among people living with HIV and on highly active antiretroviral therapy in public health institutions of Mekelle town, Northern Ethiopia. Methods. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 494 adult people living with HIV taking ART services. Quality of life was measured using WHOQOL-HIV BREF. Result. There was a statistically significant gender difference (P < 0.05) in HRQOL among PLHIV on HAART. Females had low score in all HRQOL domains. High perceived stigma was strongly associated with poor psychological quality of domain among both female and male groups with [AOR = 2.89(1.69,4.96)] and [AOR = 2.5(1.4,4.4)], respectively.

        "abstract": "Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant concern in the field of global health. However, studies on the relationship between viral load, opportunistic infections, and quality-of-life among them are limited. \nObjectives: This study aims to determine the relationship between viral load count, the presence of opportunistic infection, and the quality-of-life among people living with HIV. \nMethods: A cross-sectional study was used involving 35 respondents recruited through convenience sampling. The quality-of-life of individuals living with HIV was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life instrument for HIV. Statistical analysis using descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and proportion, and bivariate analysis with p-value<0.05. \nResults: Of the 35 participants, the majority were male (57.1%), with a mean age of 41.63 (9.09), and had a low education level (51.4%). The mean quality-of-life score was 86.88 (12.27), with a mean duration of ARV treatment of 7.23 years (5.36), undetectable viral load (68.6%), living with opportunistic infections (80%), and with tuberculosis being the most common (52.63%). There was a significant correlation between viral load and overall quality-of-life (p-value 0.04). \nConclusion: The results of viral load testing and the identification of opportunistic infections can serve as indicators to assess the quality-of-life among people living with HIV. The outcomes of this study have practical implications for enhancing healthcare services in clinical settings. This information can guide the implementation of targeted interventions to strengthen social relationships and these individuals' environmental quality-of-life.",
