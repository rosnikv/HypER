        "abstract": "Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of autologous bone marrow cells (BMC) in conjunction with standard treatment may improve left ventricular function after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the results of these studies remain controversial, as the studies were relatively small in size and partially differed in design. We reviewed primary controlled randomized clinical studies comparing intracoronary transfer of autologous non\u2010mobilized BMC combined with standard therapy versus standard therapy alone in patients with AMI. We identified five randomized controlled clinical trials, three of which were also placebo\u2010 and bone marrow aspiration\u2010controlled. Non\u2010mobilized BMC were infused into the revascularized coronary target artery 6.6 \u00b1 6.1 days after AMI. The mean follow\u2010up period of 5.2 \u00b1 1.1 months was completed by 482 patients, 241 of which received infusion of BMC. The effect of BMC on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as a major functional parameter was evaluated. Analyzing the overall effect on the change in LVEF between baseline and follow\u2010up value revealed a significant improvement in the BMCtreated group as compared to the control group (P = 0.04). Thus, considering the increase in LVEF during follow\u2010up, transplantation of BMC may be a safe and beneficial procedure to support treatment of AMI. However, the functional improvement observed with this form of therapy was altogether relatively moderate and the studies were heterogeneous in design. Hence, further efforts aiming at large\u2010scale, double\u2010blind, randomized and placebo\u2010controlled multi\u2010center trials in conjunction with better definition of patients, which benefit from BMC infusion, appear to be warranted.",

To examine whether these cells could have therapeutic potential in the repair of myocardial infarction (MI), DPSC were infected with a retrovirus encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expanded ex vivo. Seven days after induction of myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation, 1.5 \u00d7 106 GFP\u2010DPSC were injected intramyocardially in nude rats. At 4 weeks, cell\u2010treated animals showed an improvement in cardiac function, observed by percentage changes in anterior wall thickening left ventricular fractional area change, in parallel with a reduction in infarct size. No histologic evidence was seen of GFP+ endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or cardiac muscle cells within the infarct. However, angiogenesis was increased relative to control\u2010treated animals. Taken together, these data suggest that DPSC could provide a novel alternative cell population for cardiac repair, at least in the setting of acute MI.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a major public health problem that causes significant mortality despite recent advances in its prevention and treatment. Therefore, approaches based on adult stem cells represent a promising alternative to conventional therapies for this life-threatening condition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that have been isolated from multiple tissues and differentiate to various cell types. Here we have analyzed the capacity of MSCs from human bone marrow (BMSC), adipose tissue (ATSC), and dental pulp (DPSC) to differentiate to cells with a cardiac phenotype. Differentiation of MSCs was induced by long-term co-culture with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs). Shortly after the establishment of MSC-CM co-cultures, expression of connexin 43 and the cardiac-specific markers troponin I, beta-myosin heavy chain, atrial natriuretic peptide, and alpha-sarcomeric actinin was detected in BMSCs, ATSCs, and DPSCs. Expression of differentiation markers increased over time in the co-cultures, reaching the highest levels at 4 weeks. Translocation of the transcription factors NKX2.5 and GATA4 to the nucleus was observed in all three cultures of MSCs during the differentiation process; moreover, nuclear localization of NKX2.5 and GATA4 correlated with expression of alpha-sarcomeric actinin. These changes were accompanied by an increase in myofibril organization in the resulting CM-like cells as analyzed by electron microscopy. Thus, our results provide novel information regarding the differentiation of tissue-specific MSCs to cardiomyocytes and support the potential use of MSCs in cell-based cardiac therapies.",

        "abstract": "Despite refinements of medical and surgical therapies, heart failure remains a fatal disease. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure, and only palliative measures are available to relieve symptoms and prolong the patient's life span. Because mammalian cardiomyocytes irreversibly exit the cell cycle at about the time of birth, the heart has traditionally been considered to lack any regenerative capacity. This paradigm, however, is currently shifting, and the cellular composition of the myocardium is being targeted by various regeneration strategies. Adult progenitor and stem cell treatment of diseased human myocardium has been carried out for more than 10 years (Menasche et al., 2001; Stamm et al., 2003), and it has become clear that, in humans, the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, despite potent proangiogenic effects, is limited (Stamm et al., 2009). More recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and related cell types are being evaluated in preclinical models of heart disease as well as in clinical trials (see Published Clinical Trials, below). MSCs have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into lineages that normally originate from the embryonic mesenchyme (connective tissues, blood vessels, blood-related organs) (Caplan, 1991; Prockop, 1997; Pittenger et al., 1999). The current definition of MSCs includes plastic adherence in cell culture, specific surface antigen expression (CD105(+)/CD90(+)/CD73(+), CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD11b(-) or CD14(-)/CD19(-) or CD79\u03b1(-)/HLA-DR1(-)), and multilineage in vitro differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic) (Dominici et al., 2006 ). If those criteria are not met completely, the term \"mesenchymal stromal cells\" should be used for marrow-derived adherent cells, or other terms for MSC-like cells of different origin. For the purpose of this review, MSCs and related cells are discussed in general, and cell type-specific properties are indicated when appropriate. We first summarize the preclinical data on MSCs in models of heart disease, and then appraise the clinical experience with MSCs for cardiac cell therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Several cell-based therapies for adjunctive treatment of acute myocardial infarction have been investigated in multiple clinical trials, but the benefits still remain controversial. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow\u2013derived mononuclear cell (BMMNC) therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but also explores the effect of newer generations of stem cells. Methods and Results\u2014A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of stem cell therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction that were published between January 2002 and September 2013. The defined end points were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, infarct size, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates. Also, several subgroup analyses were performed on BMMNC trials. Overall, combining the results of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), LV ejection fraction increased by +2.10% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68\u20133.52; P=0.004) in the BMMNC group as compared with controls, evoked by a preservation of LV end-systolic volume (\u22124.05 mL; 95% CI, \u22126.91 to \u22121.18; P=0.006) and a reduction in infarct size (\u22122.69%; 95% CI, \u22124.83 to \u22120.56; P=0.01). However, there is no effect on cardiac function, volumes, or infarct size, when only RCTs (n=9) that used MRI-derived end points were analyzed. Moreover, no beneficial effect could be detected on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates after BMMNC infusion after a median follow-up duration of 6 months. Conclusions\u2014Intracoronary infusion of BMMNC is safe, but does not enhance cardiac function on MRI-derived parameters, nor does it improve clinical outcome. New and possibly more potent stem cells are emerging in the field, but their clinical efficacy still needs to be defined in future trials.",

        "title": "Rebuilding the Damaged Heart: Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Cell-Based Therapy, and Engineered Heart Tissue.",
        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are broadly distributed cells that retain postnatal capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. MSCs evade immune detection, secrete an array of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mediators, and very importantly activate resident precursors. These properties form the basis for the strategy of clinical application of cell-based therapeutics for inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. In cardiovascular medicine, administration of autologous or allogeneic MSCs in patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy holds significant promise. Numerous preclinical studies of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy employing MSC-based therapy have demonstrated that the properties of reducing fibrosis, stimulating angiogenesis, and cardiomyogenesis have led to improvements in the structure and function of remodeled ventricles. Further attempts have been made to augment MSCs' effects through genetic modification and cell preconditioning. Progression of MSC therapy to early clinical trials has supported their role in improving cardiac structure and function, functional capacity, and patient quality of life. Emerging data have supported larger clinical trials that have been either completed or are currently underway. Mechanistically, MSC therapy is thought to benefit the heart by stimulating innate anti-fibrotic and regenerative responses. The mechanisms of action involve paracrine signaling, cell-cell interactions, and fusion with resident cells. Trans-differentiation of MSCs to bona fide cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels is also thought to occur, although at a nonphysiological level. Recently, MSC-based tissue engineering for cardiovascular disease has been examined with quite encouraging results. This review discusses MSCs from their basic biological characteristics to their role as a promising therapeutic strategy for clinical cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted exosomes exert a cardioprotective role in jeopardized myocardium. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of exosomes derived from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain largely unclear. In this study, ADMSC-derived exosomes (ADMSCs-ex) were administrated into the rats subjected to I/R injury and H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Consequently, administration of ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarction, accompanied with a decrease in serum levels of creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Simultaneously, ADMSCs-ex dramatically antagonized I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis, along with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax, and inhibition of Caspase 3 activity in rat myocardium. Similarly, ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced cell apoptosis and the expression of Bax, but markedly increased cell viability and the expression of Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 under H/R. Furthermore, ADMSCs-ex observably induced the activation of Wnt/&bgr;-catenin signaling by attenuating I/R- and H/R-induced inhibition of Wnt3a, p-GSK-3&bgr; (Ser9), and &bgr;-catenin expression. Importantly, treatment with Wnt/&bgr;-catenin inhibitor XAV939 partly neutralized ADMSC-ex\u2013induced antiapoptotic and prosurvival effects in H9c2 cells. In conclusion, we confirmed that ADMSCs-ex protect ischemic myocardium from I/R injury through the activation of Wnt/&bgr;-catenin signaling pathway.",

In contrast to MSCs which had to be expanded in culture to reach optimal cell number for transplantation, MSC-sourced secretome is immediately available for treatment of acute conditions, including fulminant hepatitis, cerebral ischemia and myocardial infarction. Additionally, MSC-derived secretome could be massively produced from commercially available cell lines avoiding invasive cell collection procedure. In this review article we emphasized molecular and cellular mechanisms that were responsible for beneficial effects of MSC-derived secretomes in the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory diseases of hepatobiliary, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and nervous system. Results obtained in a large number of studies suggested that administration of MSC-derived secretomes represents a new, cell-free therapeutic approach for attenuation of inflammatory and degenerative diseases.

They have been increasingly used in clinical trials to treat multiple conditions associated with inflammation and tissue damage such as graft versus host disease, orthopedic injuries and cardiac and liver diseases. Recent evidence demonstrates that their beneficial effects are derived, at least in part, from their secretome. In particular, data from animal models and first-in-man studies indicate that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) can exert similar therapeutic potential as their cells of origin. MSC-EVs are membranous structures loaded with proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, which play an important role in cell-cell communication and may represent an attractive alternative for cell-based therapy. In this article we summarize recent advances in the use of MSC-EVs for tissue repair. We highlight several isolation and characterization approaches used to enrich MSC-derived EVs. We discuss our current understanding of the relative contribution of the MSC-EVs to the immunomodulatory and regenerative effects mediated by MSCs and MSC secretome. Finally we highlight the challenges and opportunities, which come with the potential use of MSC-EVs as cell free therapy for conditions that require tissue repair.",

        "abstract": "Both myocardial infarction (MI) and the follow-up reperfusion will lead to an inevitable injury to myocardial tissues, such as cardiac dysfunctions, fibrosis, and reduction of intercellular cell-to-cell interactions. Recently, exosomes (Exo) derived from stem cells have demonstrated a robust capability to promote angiogenesis and tissue repair. However, the short half-life of Exo and rapid clearance lead to insufficient therapeutic doses in the lesion area. Herein, an injectable conductive hydrogel is constructed to bind Exo derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells to treat myocardial injuries after myocardial infarction-ischemia/reperfusion (MI-I/R). To this end, a hyperbranched epoxy macromer (EHBPE) grafted by an aniline tetramer (AT) was synthesized to cross-link thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) and thiolated Exo anchoring a CP05 peptide via an epoxy/thiol \"click\" reaction. The resulting Gel@Exo composite system possesses multiple features, such as controllable gelation kinetics, shear-thinning injectability, conductivity matching the native myocardium, soft and dynamic stability adapting to heartbeats, and excellent cytocompatibility. After being injected into injured hearts of rats, the hydrogel effectively prolongs the retention of Exo in the ischemic myocardium. The cardiac functions have been considerably improved by Gel@Exo administration, as indicated by the enhancing ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and reducing fibrosis area. Immunofluorescence staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results demonstrate that the expression of cardiac-related proteins (Cx43, Ki67, CD31, and \u03b1-SMA) and genes (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, vWF, TGF-\u03b21, MMP-9, and Serca2a) are remarkably upregulated.

        "abstract": "Introduction Cardiac fibrosis is one of the important causes of heart failure and death in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules in eukaryotes and have high stability. Their role in myocardial fibrosis with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to understand the expression profiles of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis with DCM, exploring the possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DCM. Methods At 21 weeks of age, db/db mice established the type 2 DCM model measured by echocardiography, and the cardiac tissue was extracted for Hematoxylin\u2013eosin, Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, the expression profile of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis of db/db mice was constructed using microarray hybridization and verified by real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A circRNA\u2013microRNA\u2013messenger RNA coexpression network was constructed, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were done. Results Compared with normal control mice, db/db mice had 77 upregulated circRNAs and 135 downregulated circRNAs in their chromosomes (fold change \u22651.5, P \u2264 0.05). Moreover, the enrichment analysis of circRNA host genes showed that these differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. CircPHF20L1, circCLASP1, and circSLC8A1 were the key circRNAs. Moreover, circCLASP1/miR-182-5p/Wnt7a, circSLC8A1/miR-29b-1-5p/Col12a1, and most especially circPHF20L1/miR-29a-3p/Col6a2 might be three novel axes in the development of myocardial fibrosis in DCM. Conclusion The findings will provide some novel circRNAs and molecular pathways for the prevention or clinical treatment of DCM through intervention with specific circRNAs.",
