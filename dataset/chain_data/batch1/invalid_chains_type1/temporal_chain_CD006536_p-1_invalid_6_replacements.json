        "abstract": "In this study, we hypothesized that bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) protect ischemic myocardium through paracrine effects that can be further augmented with preconditioning. In in vitro experiments, cell survival factors such as Akt and eNOS were significantly increased in BMSCs following anoxia. In the second series of experiments following coronary ligation in mice, left ventricles were randomly injected with the following: DMEM (G-1), BMSCs (G-2), and preconditioned BMSCs (G-3). Four days after myocardial infarction, BMSCs were observed within injured myocardium in G-2 and G-3. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes within periinfarct area were significantly reduced in G-3. Four weeks after myocardial infarction, smaller left ventricular (LV) dimension and increased LV ejection fraction were observed in G-3. Infarct area was significantly reduced in G-3. However, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were observed in low numbers within periinfarct area in G-2 and G-3. In conclusion, BMSCs secreted cell survival factors under ischemia, and they prevented apoptosis in cardiomyocytes adjacent to the infarcted area. Preconditioning of BMSCs enhanced their survival and ability to attenuate LV remodeling, which was attributable, in part, to paracrine effects.",

To examine whether these cells could have therapeutic potential in the repair of myocardial infarction (MI), DPSC were infected with a retrovirus encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expanded ex vivo. Seven days after induction of myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation, 1.5 \u00d7 106 GFP\u2010DPSC were injected intramyocardially in nude rats. At 4 weeks, cell\u2010treated animals showed an improvement in cardiac function, observed by percentage changes in anterior wall thickening left ventricular fractional area change, in parallel with a reduction in infarct size. No histologic evidence was seen of GFP+ endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or cardiac muscle cells within the infarct. However, angiogenesis was increased relative to control\u2010treated animals. Taken together, these data suggest that DPSC could provide a novel alternative cell population for cardiac repair, at least in the setting of acute MI.",

Banking ones own tooth-derived stem cells is a reasonable and simple alternative to harvesting stem cells from other tissues. Obtaining stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) is simple and convenient, with little or no trauma. Every child loses primary teeth, which creates the perfect opportunity to recover and store this convenient source of stem cells--should they be needed to treat future injuries or ailments and presents a far better alternative to simply discarding the teeth or storing them as mementos from the past. Furthermore, using ones own stem cells poses few, if any, risks for developing immune reactions or rejection following transplantation and also eliminates the potential of contracting disease from donor cells. Stem cells can also be recovered from developing wisdom teeth and permanent teeth. Individuals have different opportunities at different stages of their life to bank these valuable cells. It is best to recover stem cells when a child is young and healthy and the cells are strong and proliferative. The purpose of this review is to discuss the present scenario as well as the technical details of tooth banking as related to SHED cells.",

        "title": "Mesenchymal stem cells for cardiac cell therapy.",
        "abstract": "Despite refinements of medical and surgical therapies, heart failure remains a fatal disease. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure, and only palliative measures are available to relieve symptoms and prolong the patient's life span. Because mammalian cardiomyocytes irreversibly exit the cell cycle at about the time of birth, the heart has traditionally been considered to lack any regenerative capacity. This paradigm, however, is currently shifting, and the cellular composition of the myocardium is being targeted by various regeneration strategies. Adult progenitor and stem cell treatment of diseased human myocardium has been carried out for more than 10 years (Menasche et al., 2001; Stamm et al., 2003), and it has become clear that, in humans, the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, despite potent proangiogenic effects, is limited (Stamm et al., 2009). More recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and related cell types are being evaluated in preclinical models of heart disease as well as in clinical trials (see Published Clinical Trials, below). MSCs have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into lineages that normally originate from the embryonic mesenchyme (connective tissues, blood vessels, blood-related organs) (Caplan, 1991; Prockop, 1997; Pittenger et al., 1999). The current definition of MSCs includes plastic adherence in cell culture, specific surface antigen expression (CD105(+)/CD90(+)/CD73(+), CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD11b(-) or CD14(-)/CD19(-) or CD79\u03b1(-)/HLA-DR1(-)), and multilineage in vitro differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic) (Dominici et al., 2006 ). If those criteria are not met completely, the term \"mesenchymal stromal cells\" should be used for marrow-derived adherent cells, or other terms for MSC-like cells of different origin. For the purpose of this review, MSCs and related cells are discussed in general, and cell type-specific properties are indicated when appropriate. We first summarize the preclinical data on MSCs in models of heart disease, and then appraise the clinical experience with MSCs for cardiac cell therapy.",

        "title": "Intracoronary Infusion of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Precursor Cells Directly After Experimental Acute Myocardial Infarction Reduces Infarct Size, Abrogates Adverse Remodeling, and Improves Cardiac Function",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) are a specific Stro-3+ subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow. MPCs exert extensive cardioprotective effects, and are considered to be immune privileged. Objective: This study assessed the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of intracoronary delivery of allogeneic MPCs directly after acute myocardial infarction in sheep. Methods and Results: Initially, intracoronary delivery conditions were optimized in 20 sheep. These conditions were applied in a randomized study of 68 sheep with an anterior acute myocardial infarction. Coronary flow was monitored during MPC infusion, and cardiac function was assessed using invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography at baseline and during 8 weeks follow-up. Coronary flow remained within thrombolysis in myocardial infarction III definitions in all sheep during MPC infusion. Global left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by pressure\u2013volume loop analysis deteriorated in controls to 40.7\u00b12.6% after 8 weeks. In contrast, MPC treatment improved cardiac function to 52.8\u00b10.7%. Echocardiography revealed significant improvement of both global and regional cardiac functions. Infarct size decreased by 40% in treated sheep, whereas infarct and border zone thickness were enhanced. Left ventricular adverse remodeling was abrogated by MPC therapy, resulting in a marked reduction of left ventricular volumes. Blood vessel density increased by >50% in the infarct and border areas. Compensatory cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was reduced in border and remote segments, accompanied by reduced collagen deposition and apoptosis. No microinfarctions in remote myocardial segments or histological abnormalities in unrelated organs were found. Conclusions: Intracoronary infusion of allogeneic MPCs is safe, feasible, and markedly effective in a large animal model of acute myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Several cell-based therapies for adjunctive treatment of acute myocardial infarction have been investigated in multiple clinical trials, but the benefits still remain controversial. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow\u2013derived mononuclear cell (BMMNC) therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but also explores the effect of newer generations of stem cells. Methods and Results\u2014A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of stem cell therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction that were published between January 2002 and September 2013. The defined end points were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, infarct size, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates. Also, several subgroup analyses were performed on BMMNC trials. Overall, combining the results of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), LV ejection fraction increased by +2.10% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68\u20133.52; P=0.004) in the BMMNC group as compared with controls, evoked by a preservation of LV end-systolic volume (\u22124.05 mL; 95% CI, \u22126.91 to \u22121.18; P=0.006) and a reduction in infarct size (\u22122.69%; 95% CI, \u22124.83 to \u22120.56; P=0.01). However, there is no effect on cardiac function, volumes, or infarct size, when only RCTs (n=9) that used MRI-derived end points were analyzed. Moreover, no beneficial effect could be detected on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates after BMMNC infusion after a median follow-up duration of 6 months. Conclusions\u2014Intracoronary infusion of BMMNC is safe, but does not enhance cardiac function on MRI-derived parameters, nor does it improve clinical outcome. New and possibly more potent stem cells are emerging in the field, but their clinical efficacy still needs to be defined in future trials.",

        "title": "The Future of Heart Failure Diagnosis, Therapy, and Management.",
        "abstract": "Over the past 4 decades, patients with heart failure (HF) have derived substantial benefit from the major advances in our understanding of pathophysiology of the HF syndrome, which have led to evolving treatment paradigms. Morbidity and mortality for patients as documented in clinical trials for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have steadily decreased, and many patients with this syndrome have also enjoyed improved functional capacity and quality of life. However, there are major unmet needs. Hospital discharges with a primary HF diagnosis, an index of population disease burden and economic impact, remain >1 million annually with little change between 2000 and 2010.1 According to the American Heart Association\u2019s Heart and Stroke Facts,2 the prevalence of HF will increase \u224850% between 2012 and 2030, resulting in >8 million people \u226518 years of age with HF.3 This daunting future reflects the increased prevalence of HF as the population ages, acute myocardial infarction survival improves, and HF survival itself increases at rates that exceed our impact to prevent the development of HF.\n\nThe national and, indeed, international burden of HF reflects a growing component of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), for which trials have been neutral, in contrast to the progress for HFrEF. These frustrating trial results reflect our incomplete understanding of the more heterogeneous complex of the HFpEF syndrome, which was only defined as an entity more recently. Knowledge in this area has evolved over the past few years, however, suggesting that positive results may be enabled by more targeted treatments rather than broad-brush interventions and a shift in focus to symptoms and daily quality of life as primary outcomes.\n\nIn this review, we will use the lessons of the recent past to illuminate pathways forward in how the HF syndrome is conceptualized, how we might better \u2026",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted exosomes exert a cardioprotective role in jeopardized myocardium. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of exosomes derived from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain largely unclear. In this study, ADMSC-derived exosomes (ADMSCs-ex) were administrated into the rats subjected to I/R injury and H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Consequently, administration of ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarction, accompanied with a decrease in serum levels of creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Simultaneously, ADMSCs-ex dramatically antagonized I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis, along with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax, and inhibition of Caspase 3 activity in rat myocardium. Similarly, ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced cell apoptosis and the expression of Bax, but markedly increased cell viability and the expression of Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 under H/R. Furthermore, ADMSCs-ex observably induced the activation of Wnt/&bgr;-catenin signaling by attenuating I/R- and H/R-induced inhibition of Wnt3a, p-GSK-3&bgr; (Ser9), and &bgr;-catenin expression. Importantly, treatment with Wnt/&bgr;-catenin inhibitor XAV939 partly neutralized ADMSC-ex\u2013induced antiapoptotic and prosurvival effects in H9c2 cells. In conclusion, we confirmed that ADMSCs-ex protect ischemic myocardium from I/R injury through the activation of Wnt/&bgr;-catenin signaling pathway.",

In vitro studies examine the accumulation and physiological effect of exosomes on human and mouse osteosarcoma cell lines by MTT assay, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. Results: Systemic HUC-MSC exosomes accumulated continuously in tumor over a 24-48 h post-injection period. In contrast, synthetic lipid nanoparticles accumulate in tumor only for the first 3 h post-injection. Conclusion: These results suggest that HUC-MSCs exosomes accumulate within human or mouse osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo over a 24 to 48 h after infusion.",

In the present study, we examined the therapeutic effect of anti\u2013claudin (CLDN)\u20104 extracellular domain antibody, 4D3, on TNBC. When the expression of CLDN4 and CLDN1 in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was examined in 114 IDC (78 cases from 2004 to 2009 in a single center and 36 cases of tissues array), CLDN1 had lower expression than CLDN4 and was correlated with histological grade. In contrast, expression of CLDN4 was correlated with histological grade, receptor subtype, and stage. CLDN4 expression in human IDC cell lines MCF\u20107 (luminal subtype) and MDA\u2010468 (TNBC) was at the same level. In both cells, paclitaxel (PTX)\u2010induced growth suppression was enhanced by 4D3. Furthermore, 4D3 increased both intracellular PTX concentration (in both cells) and apoptosis. In the mouse model, 4D3 promoted the antitumor effect of PTX on subcutaneous tumors and reduced lung metastasis. The combination of PTX and 4D3 reduced M2 macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells in the tumor. 4D3 also reduced stemness of the tumors and increased the intratumoral pH. Moreover, concurrent treatment with 4D3, PTX and tamoxifen, or with PTX and tamoxifen in MDA\u2010468 also showed the same level of antitumor activity and survival as MCF\u20107. Furthermore, in a bone metastasis model, combination of PTX and bisphosphonate with 4D3 promoted tumor growth in both cells. Thus, CLDN4 targeting of the antibody facilitated existing therapeutic effects.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a cardiovascular disease that poses a serious threat to human health. Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after MI has been recognized as a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Thus, prevention of fibrosis or alleviation of fibrosis progression is important for cardiac repair. To this end, a biocompatible microneedle (MN) patch based on gelatin is fabricated to load exosomes containing microRNA\u201029b (miR\u201029b) mimics with antifibrotic activity to prevent excessive cardiac fibrosis after MI. Exosomes are isolated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and loaded with miR\u201029b mimics via electroporation, which can be internalized effectively in cardiac fibroblasts to upregulate the expression of miR\u201029b and downregulate the expression of fibrosis\u2010related proteins. After being implanted in the infarcted heart of a mouse MI model, the MN patch can increase the retention of loaded exosomes in the infarcted myocardium, leading to alleviation of inflammation, reduction of the infarct size, inhibition of fibrosis, and improvement of cardiac function. This design explored the MN patch as a suitable platform to deliver exosomes containing antifibrotic biomolecules locally for the prevention of cardiac fibrosis, showing the potential for MI treatment in clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Cardiac fibrosis is one of the important causes of heart failure and death in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules in eukaryotes and have high stability. Their role in myocardial fibrosis with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to understand the expression profiles of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis with DCM, exploring the possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DCM. Methods At 21 weeks of age, db/db mice established the type 2 DCM model measured by echocardiography, and the cardiac tissue was extracted for Hematoxylin\u2013eosin, Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, the expression profile of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis of db/db mice was constructed using microarray hybridization and verified by real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A circRNA\u2013microRNA\u2013messenger RNA coexpression network was constructed, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were done. Results Compared with normal control mice, db/db mice had 77 upregulated circRNAs and 135 downregulated circRNAs in their chromosomes (fold change \u22651.5, P \u2264 0.05). Moreover, the enrichment analysis of circRNA host genes showed that these differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. CircPHF20L1, circCLASP1, and circSLC8A1 were the key circRNAs. Moreover, circCLASP1/miR-182-5p/Wnt7a, circSLC8A1/miR-29b-1-5p/Col12a1, and most especially circPHF20L1/miR-29a-3p/Col6a2 might be three novel axes in the development of myocardial fibrosis in DCM. Conclusion The findings will provide some novel circRNAs and molecular pathways for the prevention or clinical treatment of DCM through intervention with specific circRNAs.",
