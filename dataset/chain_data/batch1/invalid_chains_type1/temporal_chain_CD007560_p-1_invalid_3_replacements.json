        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUncontrolled studies have suggested that methotrexate may be effective in patients with active ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral methotrexate in chronic steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with active ulcerative colitis who have received steroids and/or immunosuppressives for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months with a current Mayo Clinic score of > or = 7 were included in the study. Methotrexate (12.5 mg) or placebo was added to their treatment once weekly for 9 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-seven patients were included (methotrexate, 30 patients, placebo, 37 patients). The proportion of patients entering first remission (methotrexate, 46.7%; placebo, 48.6%), the time to reach first remission (methotrexate, 4.1 +/- 1.9 months; placebo, 3.4 +/- 1.7 months), as well as the proportions of patients having a relapse after first remission (methotrexate, 64.3%; placebo, 44.4%) were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean Mayo Clinic score, the mean monthly steroid dose, and the proportion of abnormal laboratory results during the study were also similar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg was not found to be better than placebo in the induction or maintenance of remission in patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis.",

        "title": "The SIBDQ: further validation in ulcerative colitis patients",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is an instrument that assesses quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It has 32 items in four domains. The short form of the IBDQ (SIBDQ) was developed in Canadian Crohn's disease patients for use in clinical practice. Patients with ulcerative colitis might require a different form of the SIBDQ. Our aim was to design and validate a SIBDQ for patients with ulcerative colitis and to compare this to the Crohn's SIBDQ.METHODS:We recruited 122 patients with colitis as an initial sample. Using linear regression modeling, the 10 items that best predicted the total IBDQ score were identified. The colitis and Crohn's versions of the SIBDQ were compared by univariate linear regression with the total IBDQ score in two other cohorts of colitis patients.RESULTS:Ten items explained 97% of the variance of the total IBDQ score in our first cohort. These were items 1 and 9 (bowel); 7, 11, 21, 30 (emotional); 2 and 10 (systemic); and 12 and 28 (social). Only three items were shared with the Crohn's SIBDQ. The R2 for both SIBDQs with the total IBDQ score in the other cohorts were very high (\u22650.95), although the Colitis SIBDQ showed better internal consistency.CONCLUSIONS:The development of a SIBDQ for patients with ulcerative colitis did not reveal any clear advantage over the original version of the SIBDQ. Further studies are required to determine the role of the SIBDQ in routine clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Refractoriness to conventional therapy is a common and intriguing problem in Crohn's disease patients. At the present time there is no agreement on its definition and several mechanisms are involved in its determination. Immunosuppressors, such as azathioprine (AZA), 6\u2010mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX) are effective drugs for controlling the inflammatory process and avoid chronic glucocorticosteroid treatment and its related related side\u2010effects. Recently, the introduction of tumour necrosis factor antibodies (infliximab) has dramatically changed the natural history of Crohn's disease and its therapeutic approach. Several studies have determined the efficacy, mechanisms and safety of infliximab. However, this molecular approach has also left several questions unanswered about the mechanisms of refractoriness, possible concomitant treatments and long\u2010term safety and efficacy.",

        "title": "Experience with the use of low-dose methotrexate for inflammatory bowel disease",
        "abstract": "Background Thiopurine drugs (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) are well established in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, some patients are intolerant or resistant to thiopurine drugs and their management remains a challenge. Several studies have suggested methotrexate is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Objective This study was conducted because the overall data on clinical efficacy of methotrexate in inflammatory bowel disease remain limited and there are no data regarding fistulating Crohn's disease or concomitant use of methotrexate with thiopurine drugs in inflammatory bowel disease. Methods This study was a retrospective review of medical notes. Clinical response was defined as sustained withdrawal of oral steroids or fistula improvement. New episodes of steroid therapy, infliximab or surgery during the first 6 months were considered as failure to achieve clinical response. Results Seventy-two patients were studied (66 Crohn's disease and six ulcerative colitis). The mean dose of methotrexate used was 18.2 mg/week. Clinical response was achieved in 22 of 54 patients (40.7%) who completed 6 months of methotrexate treatment. For patients with Crohn's disease, fistula improvement was achieved in eight of 18 (44.4%) patients compared with 11 of 30 (36.7%) receiving methotrexate for steroid withdrawal. Clinical response was achieved in six of 15 patients (40%) treated with methotrexate and azathioprine at the same time compared with 16 of 39 patients (41%) treated with methotrexate alone. Conclusions Methotrexate is reasonably effective in clinical practice as a steroid sparing agent in inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy in fistulating Crohn's disease justifies its use as an immunomodulator in these patients. Combined azathioprine and methotrexate treatment appears to offer no advantage over methotrexate alone.",

        "abstract": "Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are a major family of phase II drug\u2010metabolizing enzymes. SULT\u2010catalyzed sulfonation regulates hormone activities metabolizes drugs detoxifies xenobiotic toxicants bioactivates carcinogens. Human dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (hSULT2A1 DHEA\u2010ST) plays a very important role in sulfating endogenous hydroxysteroids and exogenousxenobiotics. Our recent studies have shown that methotrexate can induce hSULT2A1 expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism involved in hSULT2A1 induction we generated the promoter sequence of hSULT2A1 by PCR and constructed a reporter gene vector. Both reporter gene assay and endogenous induction results suggested that human constitutive active receptor (hCAR) mediates the methotrexate induction of hSULT2A1 in both Caco\u20102 and Hep G2 cells. Human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) also upregulated hSULT2A1 gene expression while human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) downregulated it. Human pregnane X receptor suppressed hCAR\u2010mediated methotrexate induction of hSULT2A1 in both Caco\u20102 and Hep G2 cells. hVDR competed with hCAR for the hSULT2A1 promoter in Caco\u20102 cells. hCAR inhibited hVDR\u2010mediated vitamin D3 induction of hSULT2A1 but not methotrexate induction of hSULT2A1. These results strongly support the hypothesis that cross\u2010talk occurs among nuclear receptors in the signal transduction pathway of hSULT2A1 and that interactions among nuclear receptors also depend on ligands (inducers) in the system. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Abstract Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotics, increasing their water solubility. SULTs are not only important for xenobiotic detoxification but they also play important biological roles in the regulation of the activities of various biosignaling molecules and other cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of influenza A virus lung infection on the expression of SULTs in the lung, brain, and liver of female C57BL/6 mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time that SULT2B1b enzyme activity and protein expression are significantly up-regulated in the lung and brain of female mice in response to lung influenza A virus infection. Real-time quantitative PCR results are consistent with Western blot and enzymatic activity data. In mouse liver, mSULT2B1b is not significantly changed. Enzyme activities, protein expression, and mRNA expression of SULT1A1 and SULT2A1 in the lung, brain, and liver of mice were not significantly affected by the infection. The induction of SULT2B1b may be used to inactivate natural liver X receptor ligands and activate the proliferation of T cells in response to influenza A virus infection in the lung and brain of mice. Our results raise the possibility that regulation of SULT2B1b may influence acquired immune responses to infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "Cytosolic sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) catalyzes the sulfation of 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroids and functions as a selective cholesterol and oxysterol sulfotransferase. Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by oxysterols has been known to be an antiproliferative factor. Overexpression of SULT2B1b impairs LXR's response to oxysterols, by which it regulates lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate in vivo and in vitro effects of SULT2B1b on liver proliferation and the underlying mechanisms. Primary rat hepatocytes and C57BL/6 mice were infected with adenovirus encoding SULT2B1b. Liver proliferation was determined by measuring the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining labeling index. The correlation between SULT2B1b and PCNA expression in mouse liver tissues was determined by double immunofluorescence. Gene expressions were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. SULT2B1b overexpression in mouse liver tissues increased PCNA-positive cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increased expression of PCNA in mouse liver tissues was only observed in the SULT2B1b transgenic cells. Small interference RNA SULT2B1b significantly inhibited cell cycle regulatory gene expressions in primary rat hepatocytes. LXR activation by T0901317 effectively suppressed SULT2B1b-induced gene expression in vivo and in vitro. SULT2B1b may promote hepatocyte proliferation by inactivating oxysterol/LXR signaling.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and subsequent apoptosis are the major pathogenic events of metabolic disorders, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Recently, a novel regulatory oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3b, 25-diol 3-sulfate (25HC3S), has been identified, and hydroxysterol sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) has been elucidated as the key enzyme for its biosynthesis from 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) via oxysterol sulfation. The product 25HC3S and the substrate 25HC have been shown to coordinately regulate lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 25HC3S decreases levels of the nuclear liver oxysterol receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), inhibits SREBP processing, subsequently downregulates key enzymes in lipid biosynthesis, decreases intracellular lipid levels in hepatocytes and THP-1-derived macrophages, prevents apoptosis, and promotes cell proliferation in liver tissues. Furthermore, 25HC3S increases nuclear PPAR\u03b3 and cytosolic I\u03baB\u03b1 and decreases nuclear NF-\u03baB levels and proinflammatory cytokine expression and secretion when cells are challenged with LPS and TNF\u03b1. In contrast to 25HC3S, 25HC, a known LXR ligand, increases nuclear LXR and decreases nuclear PPARs and cytosol I\u03baB\u03b1 levels. In this review, we summarize our recent findings, including the discovery of the regulatory oxysterol sulfate, its biosynthetic pathway, and its functional mechanism. We also propose that oxysterol sulfation functions as a regulatory signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) has recently been identified as an attractive target for atherosclerosis intervention. Given potential relevance of 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol, 3-sulphate (CHOS) and PPAR\u03b3, an integrated docking method was used to study their interaction mechanisms, with the full considerations to distinct CHOS conformations and dynamic ensembles of PPAR\u03b3 ligand-binding domain (PPAR\u03b3-LBD). The results revealed that this novel platform is satisfactory to the accurate determination of binding profiles, and the binding pattern of CHOS is rather similar as those of current PPAR\u03b3 full/partial agonists. CHOS contributes to the stabilization of the AF2 and \u03b2-sheet surfaces of PPAR\u03b3-LBD and promotes the configuration adjustment of \u03a9 loop, in order to inhibit the Cdk5-mediated PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation. Nonetheless, there are clear differences in term of occupation of full or partial agonist-like binding models. The energetic and geometric analyses further revealed that CHOS may be fond of partial agonist-like binding, and its sulfonic group and carbon skeleton are helpful for the binding process. We hope that the results will aid our understanding of recognitions involving CHOS with PPAR\u03b3-LBD and warrant the further aspects to pharmacological experiments. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
