        "title": "A randomized clinical trial of ursodeoxycholic acid as adjuvant treatment to prevent liver transplant rejection",
        "abstract": "Acute rejection following orthotopic liver transplantation is a common problem despite current immunosuppressive regimens. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown in small, open\u2010labeled studies to prevent rejection episodes, although its effects on complications such as infections, length of hospital stay, and survival have not been evaluated. We conducted a randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind trial to determine if UDCA (10\u201015 mg/kg/d) added to a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen was associated with a decrease in the incidence of at least one episode of acute cellular rejection. Secondary end\u2010points included determining differences in the total number of rejection episodes, the use of muromonab\u2010CD3, the incidence of infections, length of hospital stay, and survival at 90 days and 1 year. Fifty\u2010two patients were randomized, 28 to the treatment group and 24 to the placebo group. During the 3 months of the trial, there was no difference between the placebo and UDCA groups in the number of patients who were rejection\u2010free; however, there were significantly fewer patients in the treatment group who had multiple episodes of acute rejection (0 vs. 6; P = .007). Patients in the treatment group experienced a significantly lower incidence of bacterial infections (4% vs. 29%; P = .02), shorter hospital stay (25 days vs. 34 days; P = .03), and better 90\u2010day survival (100% vs. 83%; P= .04) and 1\u2010year survival (93% vs. 79%). The addition of UDCA to a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen results in significantly fewer patients experiencing multiple episodes of rejection and improved survival at 90 days and at 1 year. The use of UDCA as adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing liver transplantation who are treated with a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen should be considered.",

        "abstract": "As ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) delays the need for transplantation, this could result in patients with more comorbid disease, therefore more likely to have a worse outcome posttransplantation. The aim of this study is to compare posttransplantation outcome in patients who received UDCA versus placebo who subsequently required a liver transplant. Data on all trial patients referred for transplantation were retrospectively collected from three randomized controlled trials of UDCA in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted with patients assigned to their original treatment allocation. UDCA and placebo groups were compared at trial entry, transplant referral, just before transplantation, and 1 month and 1 year posttransplantation. From 1987 to 1996, 37 UDCA-treated and 53 placebo patients were referred for transplantation; their age, sex, and serum bilirubin levels were similar at study entry. Immediately before transplantation, these two groups were again similar with respect to age, bilirubin level, Mayo risk score, and serum creatinine level. Posttransplantation survival rates at 1 month were 93.9% in the UDCA group and 88.4% in the placebo group, and 1 year survival rates were 90.3% and 78.4%, respectively (not significant). Posttransplantation, the two groups had similar rates of infection (53.9% v 58%); however, rejection occurred significantly less often in the UDCA group; 42.9% versus 68. 8% in the placebo group (P =.04). The posttransplantation outcome of UDCA-treated patients with PBC is no different from those who were administered placebo. There is no evidence to suggest the beneficial effect of UDCA in delaying the need for transplantation is associated with a worse outcome once liver transplantation becomes necessary.",

We report a case\u2010control cohort study to determine the incidence and microbiologic profile of bilomas and risk factors for biloma formation in 492 patients undergoing liver transplantation from 1994 to 2001. Fifty\u2010seven patients (11.5%) developed one or more bilomas; 95% in the first year post\u2010transplantation. The most common initial infecting pathogens were enterococci (37%), one\u2010half resistant to vancomycin (VRE); coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci (26%); and Candida species (26%). Infection by coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci was strongly associated with the presence of a T\u2010tube (OR 9.60, p = 0.02). In stepwise logistic regression multivariable analyses, hepatic artery thrombosis (OR 90.9, p < 0.0001), hepatic artery stenosis (OR 13.2, p < 0.0001) and Roux\u2010en\u2010Y choledochojejunostomy (OR 5.8, p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for biloma formation; ursodeoxycholic acid use was highly protective (OR 0.1, p = 0.002). Strategies to prevent biloma formation must focus on measures to prevent hepatic artery thrombosis and colonization of liver transplant patients by multiresistant nosocomial pathogens. T\u2010tube drainage post\u2010transplantation bears reassessment.

Here we report a case of hepatic artery thrombosis in a liver recipient whose native and donor livers were heterozygous for FVL. The patient subsequently underwent a successful retransplant.

        "abstract": "Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most common vascular complication after liver transplantation; it has been reported to occur in 2% to 5% of liver transplant recipients. Most reports of HAT in the literature describe single\u2010center series with small numbers of patients and lack the power to definitively identify nontechnical risk factors. We used the United Network for Organ Sharing database of adult deceased donor liver transplants from 1987 to 2006 to identify 1246 patients with graft loss from HAT. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify donor and graft risk factors for HAT\u2010induced graft loss. Although most donor predictors of HAT\u2010induced graft loss were surrogates for vessel size, donor age > 50 years was also a significant predictor of graft loss from HAT (relative risk = 1.45, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the risk of graft loss from HAT increased progressively with each decade of donor age > 50 years, such that a 61% increased risk of HAT\u2010related graft loss (relative risk = 1.61, P < 0.001) was associated with donor age > 70 years. A separate analysis of risk factors for early HAT graft loss (\u226490 days) and late HAT graft loss (> 90 days) found that older donor age was associated with increased late HAT graft loss. These findings are of interest in an era of ongoing organ shortages requiring maximum utilization of potential allografts and increasing allocation of older allografts.

For some, this is an expected part of the immediate posttransplant recovery period, whereas for others, the stay is more prolonged because of preexisting conditions, intraoperative events, or postoperative complications. In this review, 4 topics that are particularly relevant to the postoperative intensive care of LT recipients are discussed, with an emphasis on current knowledge specific to this patient group. Infectious complications are the most common causes of early posttransplant morbidity and mortality. The common patterns of infection seen in patients after LT and their management are discussed. Acute kidney injury and renal failure are common in post\u2010LT patients. Kidney injury identification, etiologies, and risk factors and approaches to management are reviewed. The majority of patients will require weaning from mechanical ventilation in the immediate postoperative period; the approach to this is discussed along with the approach for those patients who require a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation. A poorly functioning graft requires prompt identification and appropriate management if the outcomes are to be optimized. The causes of poor graft function are systematically reviewed, and the management of these grafts is discussed. Liver Transpl 17:511\u2013527, 2011. \u00a9 2011 AASLD.",

        "title": "Development of organ\u2010specific donor risk indices",
        "abstract": "Because of the shortage of deceased donor organs, transplant centers accept organs from marginal deceased donors, including older donors. Organ\u2010specific donor risk indices have been developed to predict graft survival with various combinations of donor and recipient characteristics. Here we review the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) and the liver donor risk index (LDRI) and compare and contrast their strengths, limitations, and potential uses. The KDRI has a potential role in developing new kidney allocation algorithms. The LDRI allows a greater appreciation of the importance of donor factors, particularly for hepatitis C virus\u2013positive recipients; as the donor risk index increases, the rates of allograft and patient survival among these recipients decrease disproportionately. The use of livers with high donor risk indices is associated with increased hospital costs that are independent of recipient risk factors, and the transplantation of livers with high donor risk indices into patients with Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease scores < 15 is associated with lower allograft survival; the use of the LDRI has limited this practice. Significant regional variations in donor quality, as measured by the LDRI, remain in the United States. We also review other potential indices for liver transplantation, including donor\u2010recipient matching and the retransplant donor risk index. Although substantial progress has been made in developing donor risk indices to objectively assess donor variables that affect transplant outcomes, continued efforts are warranted to improve these indices to enhance organ allocation policies and optimize allograft survival.

        "abstract": "Variation in deceased-donor kidney quality can significantly affect outcomes after kidney transplantation. Suboptimal organ selection for a given recipient can result in primary nonfunction, premature graft failure, or inappropriate discard of a suitable organ. Appraisal and appropriate selection of deceased-donor kidneys for use in transplantation is therefore critical. A number of predictive tools have been developed to assist the transplant team in evaluating the suitability of a deceased-donor kidney for transplantation to a given recipient. These include stratification of donors into \u201cstandard-\u201d or \u201cexpanded-criteria\u201d categories based on clinical parameters, pre-implantation biopsy scores, donor risk scores, machine perfusion characteristics, functional kidney weight, donor biomarkers and molecular diagnostic tools, ex vivo viability assessment using postmortem normothermic perfusion, and overall macroscopic appraisal by the surgical team. Consensus as to the role and predictive value of each of these tools is lacking and clinical practice regarding evaluation and selection of kidneys varies considerably. In this review, we seek to critically appraise the literature and evaluate the levels of evidence for tools used to assess deceased-donor kidneys. Although a plethora of appraisal tools exist, very few demonstrate desirable predictive power to be useful in clinical decision-making. Further research using large, well-designed prospective studies is urgently needed to advance this important field of transplantation science.",

DGF occurred in 230 of 671 (34%) recipients. Only 1\u2010h flow was inversely associated with DGF. Higher NGAL or L\u2010FABP concentrations and increased resistance were inversely associated with 6\u2010mo eGFR, whereas higher flow was associated with higher adjusted 6\u2010mo eGFR. Discarded kidneys had consistently higher median resistance and lower median flow than transplanted kidneys, but median perfusate biomarker concentrations were either lower or not significantly different in discarded compared with transplanted kidneys. Notably, most recipients of transplanted kidneys with isolated \u201cundesirable\u201d biomarker levels or HMP parameters experienced acceptable 6\u2010mo allograft function, suggesting these characteristics should not be used in isolation for discard decisions.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to possess the capacity to stimulate kidney repair. Therefore, the combination of NMP and MSC therapy offers potential to repair transplant kidneys. It is however unknown how NMP conditions affect MSC. In this study the effect of NMP perfusion fluid on survival, metabolism and function of thawed cryopreserved human (h)MSC and porcine (p)MSC in suspension conditions was studied. Suspension conditions reduced the viability of pMSC by 40% in both perfusion fluid and culture medium. Viability of hMSC was reduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid, whilst no differences were found in survival in culture medium. Under adherent conditions, survival of the cells was not affected by perfusion fluid. The perfusion fluid did not affect survival of fresh MSC in suspension compared to the control culture medium. The freeze-thawing process impaired the survival of hMSC; 95% survival of fresh hMSC compared to 70% survival of thawed hMSC. Moreover, thawed MSC showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species, which indicates elevated levels of oxidative stress, and reduced mitochondrial activity, which implies reduced metabolism. The adherence of pMSC and hMSC to endothelial cells was reduced after the thawing process, effect which was particularly profound in in the perfusion fluid. To summarize, we observed that conditions required for machine perfusion are influencing the behavior of MSC. The freeze-thawing process reduces survival and metabolism and increases oxidative stress, and diminishes their ability to adhere to endothelial cells. In addition, we found that hMSC and pMSC behaved differently, which has to be taken into consideration when translating results from animal experiments to clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Significance Statement Cold storage-associated transplantation (CST) injury occurs in renal transplant from deceased donors, the main organ source. The pathogenesis of CST injury remains poorly understood, and effective therapies are not available. This study has demonstrated an important role of microRNAs in CST injury and revealed the changes in microRNA expression profiles. Specifically, microRNA-147 (miR-147) is consistently elevated during CST injury in mice and in dysfunctional renal grafts in humans. Mechanistically, NDUFA4 (a key component of mitochondrial respiration complex) is identified as a direct target of miR-147. By repressing NDUFA4, miR-147 induces mitochondrial damage and renal tubular cell death. Blockade of miR-147 and overexpression of NDUFA4 reduce CST injury and improve graft function, unveiling miR-147 and NDUFA4 as new therapeutic targets in kidney transplantation. Background Kidney injury due to cold storage\u2013associated transplantation (CST) is a major factor determining the outcome of renal transplant, for which the role and regulation of microRNAs remain largely unclear. Methods The kidneys of proximal tubule Dicer (an enzyme for microRNA biogenesis) knockout mice and their wild-type littermates were subjected to CST to determine the function of microRNAs. Small RNA sequencing then profiled microRNA expression in mouse kidneys after CST. Anti\u2013microRNA-147 (miR-147) and miR-147 mimic were used to examine the role of miR-147 in CST injury in mouse and renal tubular cell models. Results Knockout of Dicer from proximal tubules attenuated CST kidney injury in mice. RNA sequencing identified multiple microRNAs with differential expression in CST kidneys, among which miR-147 was induced consistently in mouse kidney transplants and in dysfunctional human kidney grafts. Anti\u2013miR-147 protected against CST injury in mice and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction after ATP depletion injury in renal tubular cells in intro. Mechanistically, miR-147 was shown to target NDUFA4, a key component of the mitochondrial respiration complex. Silencing NDUFA4 aggravated renal tubular cell death, whereas overexpression of NDUFA4 prevented miR-147\u2013induced cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, overexpression of NDUFA4 alleviated CST injury in mice. Conclusions microRNAs, as a class of molecules, are pathogenic in CST injury and graft dysfunction. Specifically, miR-147 induced during CST represses NDUFA4, leading to mitochondrial damage and renal tubular cell death. These results unveil miR-147 and NDUFA4 as new therapeutic targets in kidney transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Objective The mouse kidney transplantation model presents challenges in terms of surgical difficulty and low success rate, making it difficult to master. This study aims to provide a crucial model for transplantation immunology research by modifying and developing novel techniques for mouse kidney transplantation. Methods A total of 57 pairs of mice were used to establish and compare the modified and innovative surgical techniques for mouse kidney transplantation. Three different surgical models were established, including the abdominal suture technique for orthotopic kidney transplantation, the abdominal cuff technique for orthotopic kidney transplantation, and the cervical cuff technique for ectopic kidney transplantation. BALB/c or C57BL/6 male mice, aged 8 to 12 weeks and weighed 20 to 25 g with specified pathogen free-grade were served as the donor mice or the recipient mice. The surgical technique characteristics, key surgical times, complications, and pathological examination in the early postoperative period were summarized and compared. Results Three different surgical models of mouse kidney transplantation were successfully established. The comparison of warm ischemic time for the 3 groups of mice showed no statistical significance (P=0.510 4). The abdominal suture group had the shortest total operation time of the donor compared with the abdominal cuff group and the cervical cuff group [(18.3\u00b13.6) min vs (26.2\u00b14.7) min and (22.8\u00b12.5) min; both P<0.000 1]. There was a significant difference in cold ischemia time among the 3 groups (all P<0.000 1), with (60.8\u00b14.1) min in the cervical cuff group, (43.3\u00b15.0) min in the abdominal suture group, and (88.8\u00b16.7) min in the abdominal cuff group. Due to different anastomosis methods, the cervical cuff group had the shortest time [(17.6\u00b12.7) min], whereas the abdominal cuff group had the longest time [(38.8\u00b15.4) min]. The total operation time for the recipients showed significant differences (P<0.000 1), with the abdominal suture group having the shortest time [(44.0\u00b16.9) min], followed by the cervical cuff group [(64.1\u00b15.2) min], and the abdominal cuff group [(80.0\u00b16.0) min] being the longest. In the 32 mice of the abdominal suture group, there were 6 with intraoperative bleeding, including 1 arterial intimal injury bleeding and 5 with bleeding after vessel opening. Six mice had ureteral complications, including ureteral bladder anastomotic stenosis, necrosis, and renal pelvis dilation. Two mice had postoperative abdominal infections. In the abdominal cuff group, there was no intraoperative bleeding, but 6 mice showed mild arterial stenosis and 5 showed venous stenosis, 4 arterial injury, 4 arterial thrombosis, and 2 ureteral complications. No postoperative infections occurred in the mice. In the cervical cuff group, no intraoperative bleeding, arterial intimal injury, arterial/venous stenosis, or thrombosis were found in 13 mice. Five mice had ureteral complications, including ureteral necrosis and infection, which were the main complications in the cervical cuff group. The renal function in mice of the 3 groups remained stable 7 days after surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining showed no significant differences in terms of acute rejection among the 3 surgical methods (all P>0.05). Conclusion All 3 surgical methods are able to successfully establish mouse kidney transplantation models, with no significant differences observed in the short-term graft survival and acute rejection. The modified abdominal suture technique and abdominal cuff technique have their respective advantages in research applications. The novel cervical cuff technique for ectopic kidney transplantation model is relatively simple to be prepared and causes less trauma to the mice, providing more options for studies involving xenotransplantation, secondary transplantation, and local lymphatic drainage. However, the difficulty in harvesting the donor kidney and the high incidence of ureteral infections need further validation in long-term survival. This study holds important reference value for choosing the type of mouse kidney transplantation model for different research needs.",
