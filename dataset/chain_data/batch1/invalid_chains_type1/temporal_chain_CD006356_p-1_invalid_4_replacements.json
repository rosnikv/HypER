        "title": "Low-Dose Prednisone Therapy for Patients with Early Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: Clinical Efficacy, Disease-Modifying Properties, and Side Effects: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial",
        "abstract": "Drug treatment for rheumatoid arthritis usually consists of a combination of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (for example, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, gold salt, or a combination). New biological agents, such as tumor necrosis factor- blocking agents and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists, appear promising (1, 2). Glucocorticoids have had a special place in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis since the publication of the report by Hench and coworkers showing that cortisone dramatically alleviated the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting inflammation (3). This period of enthusiasm in the 1950s was followed by a long period in which glucocorticoids were applied cautiously for rheumatoid arthritis because of their many side effects and the recognition that inhibition of inflammation is not necessarily associated with retardation of joint damage (4). Ongoing research on glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis focused on both inflammation and joint damage. Some recent studies showed that glucocorticoids reduced the progression of joint damage when added to therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These findings suggested that glucocorticoids might also have disease-modifying properties. If this could be confirmed, glucocorticoids might be used more often, especially since potential serious adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy are more easily managed today (5). Secondary osteoporosis is inhibited by potent bisphosphonates, and gastrointestinal complications of glucocorticoid therapy, especially in combination with NSAIDs, can be reduced by misoprostol, proton-pump inhibitors, or cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs. As yet, disease-modifying properties of low-dose glucocorticoids as monotherapy for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis have not been investigated. The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical efficacy, disease-modifying properties, and side effects of low-dose glucocorticoids as monotherapy for previously untreated patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Patients From October 1992 through October 1995, all consecutive outpatients at the rheumatology departments of the Deventer and Zutphen Hospitals, the Netherlands, who were at least 18 years of age and had early previously untreated rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration < 1 year) that satisfied classification criteria were invited to participate in the study [6]. To be included, patients had to have active disease, which was defined as the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: 1) early-morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes or longer, 2) 28-joint score for tenderness and 28-joint score for swelling of 3 or more, and 3) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 28 mm or higher after 1 hour (7, 8). Exclusion criteria were contraindications to prednisone or NSAIDs, active gastrointestinal problems, serious complicating diseases, severe hypertension, hemorrhagic diathesis, treatment with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs, alcohol or drug abuse, and psychiatric or mental problems. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before participation. Of the 118 eligible patients, 37 declined to participate (Figure 1). Figure 1. Trial profile. Intervention Pharmacy personnel at Deventer Hospital used a computer-generated randomization procedure to randomly assign the 81 participating patients, in blocks of 10, to one of two treatment groups. One group received two tablets of prednisone, 5 mg, once daily at breakfast, and one group received placebo. The pharmacology department at Deventer Hospital prepared and labeled the prednisone and placebo tablets, which were identical in shape and color, and distributed them to patients in unlabeled boxes. Only the pharmacist could access the allocation table. Both groups of patients received 500 mg of elementary calcium in the evening. The code of randomization was broken after 2 years of treatment, and the prednisone dosage was tapered. Surplus tablets of the study medication were counted at every visit, and adherence was satisfactory (96%). Use of NSAIDs was not regulated. Local glucocorticoid injections were permitted only when absolutely necessary. Physical therapy and additional use of paracetamol were allowed. After 6 months, sulfasalazine (2 g/d) could be prescribed as rescue medication. The decision to add sulfasalazine was made on clinical grounds (activity of rheumatoid arthritis). Design and Setting The ethics committees of the University Medical Center Utrecht and the Deventer and Zutphen Hospitals approved the trial. The study was considered ethically acceptable when it was designed (19891991); later, however, it became clear that irreversible joint damage is an early feature of rheumatoid arthritis. With our present knowledge, it would probably be considered unethical to compare the effects of prednisone and placebo in patients who did not receive a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for at least 6 months. In our study, sulfasalazine could be prescribed as rescue medication only after 6 months to avoid obscuring the effects of prednisone monotherapy. Measurements All clinical outcome measurements, except those for disability and radiologic outcomes, were performed at baseline and every 3 months. Disability, which was assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and radiologic outcomes were measured every 6 months. Early-morning stiffness was recorded in minutes (maximum, 720 minutes). Morning pain and general well-being were assessed on a horizontal visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm, with 0 representing the best score (no problems) and 100 representing the worst score. Swelling and tenderness were assessed with the 28-joint score (7, 8). Grip strength was measured in kPa with a vigorimeter (range, 0 to 200 kPa); the mean of three measurements was calculated for each hand. Disability was assessed with a validated Dutch version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Vragenlijst Dagelijks Functioneren) (9), which had a range of 0 to 3 (0 represented the best score [no problems], and 3 represented the worst score). Serum C-reactive protein level was measured in mg/L. To investigate the possible sparing effect of the trial medication, we recorded the use of NSAIDs and analgesics, the frequency of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, and the use of physiotherapy. The patients recorded the use of NSAIDs, analgesics, and physical therapy in standardized patient diaries. To calculate the use of NSAIDs and to compare different NSAIDs, we arbitrarily chose naproxen as a reference. One thousand mg of naproxen was defined as 1 unit and was considered to be approximately equivalent to 600 mg of azapropazone, 100 mg of diclofenac, 200 mg of flurbiprofen, 1600 mg of ibuprofen, 100 mg of indomethacin, 200 mg of ketoprofen, 15 mg of meloxicam, 1000 mg of nabumetone, 20 mg of piroxicam, and 600 mg of tiaprofenic acid. Every 3 months, the first author recorded use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Radiologic outcome measures were erosions, joint space narrowing, and the total score for both (range, 0 to 448). The total score is the sum of the erosions and narrowing scores in 44 joints in the hands and feet, assessed on plain radiography and scored with the van der Heijde modification of the Sharp method (10, 11). Radiologic outcome measures also included the number of patients with erosive disease in each group and the number of radiologically affected joints per patient. Radiographs were taken at entry and every 6 months. An assistant prepared the radiographs to be read, and all identifying patient data on the radiographs were concealed from the readers. The readers had no knowledge of patient identity when they scored the radiographs. Radiographs were read in random patient order and were scored for each patient in temporal order. Scoring in temporal order clearly has advantages, as a comparative study has shown (11). However, with this method, scores can either be stable or increase; a decrease (indicating improvement) is not possible. The first author and an independent radiologist viewed all available radiographs at one center. When the readers' total scores for individual cases differed by 25% or more, agreement was reached through discussion. Joint damage was defined as a score that exceeded 0. To correct for possible differences between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who developed little or no joint damage, we also analyzed data only from patients who developed joint damage. Furthermore, radiologic damage was also analyzed with a cutoff point of 4 modified Sharp units. A score of 0 to 3 was interpreted as no damage, and scores of 4 or greater were interpreted as joint damage. This cutoff point seems to reflect clinically relevant change (12) and was also used in our study to define erosive rheumatoid arthritis. At the start of the study and every 3 months for 2 years, standardized lists were used to document adverse effects. We noted the occurrence of infections and the use of antibiotics; the latter was checked at the patient's pharmacy. For hypertension, the first author used a single device to measure blood pressure in mm Hg. For steroid diabetes, serum glucose level was measured in mmol/L. Hyperglycemia was defined according to the World Health Organization standard: postprandial, a glucose level of at least 11.0 mmol/L (198 mg/dL), and fasting, at least 6.6 mmol/L (119 mg/dL). Urinary glucose level was measured by using a semiquantitative method (dipstick). A value less than 2.7 mmol/L (49 mg/dL) was considered negative, a value of 2.7 to 5.5 mmol/L (50 to 99 mg/dL) was considered a trace, a value of 5.6 to 16.6 mmol/L (100 to 299 mg/dL) was considered 1+, a value of 16.7 to 54.9 mmol/L (300 to 989 mg/dL) was considered 2+, and a value of 55 mmol/L or greater ( 990 mg/dL) was considered 3+.

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the impact of the combination of infliximab plus methotrexate (MTX) on the progression of structural damage in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Subanalyses were carried out on data for patients with early RA in the Anti-TNF Therapy in RA with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) study, in which 428 patients with active RA despite MTX therapy received placebo with MTX (MTX-only) or infliximab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every (q) 4 or 8 weeks with MTX (infliximab plus MTX) for 102 weeks. Early RA was defined as disease duration of 3 years or less; 82 of the 428 patients (19%) met this definition. Structural damage was assessed with the modified van der Heijde-Sharp score. The changes from baseline to week 102 in total modified van der Heijde-Sharp score were compared between the infliximab plus MTX groups and the MTX-only group. Results: The erosion and joint space narrowing scores from baseline to week 102 in the cohort of patients with early RA decreased significantly in each infliximab dose regimen compared with the MTX-only regimen. Consistent benefit was seen in the joints of both hands and feet. Conclusions: Infliximab combined with MTX inhibited the progression of structural damage in patients with early RA during the 2 year period of treatment. Early intervention with infliximab in patients with active RA despite MTX therapy may provide long term benefits by preventing radiographic progression and preserving joint integrity.",

We undertook this study to compare clinical and radiographic outcomes of 4 different treatment strategies, with intense monitoring in all patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, 508 patients were allocated to 1 of 4 treatment strategies: sequential disease-modifying antirheumatic drug monotherapy (group 1), step-up combination therapy (group 2), initial combination therapy with tapered high-dose prednisone (group 3), and initial combination therapy with the tumor necrosis factor antagonist infliximab (group 4). Treatment adjustments were made every 3 months in an effort to obtain low disease activity (a Disease Activity Score in 44 joints of < or =2.4).\n\n\nRESULTS\nInitial combination therapy including either prednisone (group 3) or infliximab (group 4) resulted in earlier functional improvement than did sequential monotherapy (group 1) and step-up combination therapy (group 2), with mean scores at 3 months on the Dutch version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (D-HAQ) of 1.0 in groups 1 and 2 and 0.6 in groups 3 and 4 (P < 0.001). After 1 year, mean D-HAQ scores were 0.7 in groups 1 and 2 and 0.5 in groups 3 and 4 (P = 0.009). The median increases in total Sharp/Van der Heijde radiographic joint score were 2.0, 2.5, 1.0, and 0.5 in groups 1-4, respectively (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the number of adverse events and withdrawals between the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with early RA, initial combination therapy including either prednisone or infliximab resulted in earlier functional improvement and less radiographic damage after 1 year than did sequential monotherapy or step-up combination therapy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo survey rheumatologists' preferences for the choice of a second-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) after inadequate response with methotrexate (MTX) therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-six rheumatologists stated their preferences for RA treatment after inadequate response with MTX therapy (optimal dose at least 6 months). From the initial scenario, we derived 54 vignettes varying by rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody presence, swollen joint count, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, and structural damage. Respondents stated their preference among 5 therapeutic options: MTX continuation, switch to another conventional DMARD, addition of another conventional DMARD, addition of anakinra, or addition of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker. Presentation by pairs yielded 10 combinations of strategies for each variant, totaling 540 vignettes; participants evaluated a random sample of 180 vignettes. Determinants of each top-ranked option were analyzed by logistic regression. The compilation of these data served to define a therapeutic algorithm.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe responses of 33 rheumatologists were analyzable. Therapeutic preferences corresponded to the top-ranked options. For patients with mild or moderately active RA, either a switch or step-up strategy to another conventional DMARD was top ranked. TNF blockers were preferred for RA patients with high disease activity or progressive structural damage. On the basis of these preferences, we developed a simple decision tree for use in daily clinical practice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur simple, easy-to-use decision tree developed from rheumatologists' preferences for therapy after failure of MTX therapy in RA treatment may guide rheumatologists in daily practice to choose a second-line DMARD.",

        "title": "Functional Characterization of Pneumocystis carinii Inositol Transporter 1",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Fungi in the genus Pneumocystis live in the lungs of mammals, where they can cause a fatal pneumonia (PCP [Pneumocystis pneumonia]) in hosts with compromised immune systems. The absence of a continuous in vitro culture system for any species of Pneumocystis has led to limited understanding of these fungi, especially for the discovery of new therapies. We recently reported that Pneumocystis carinii, Pneumocystis murina, and most significantly, Pneumocystis jirovecii lack both enzymes necessary for myo-inositol biosynthesis but contain genes with homologies to fungal myo-inositol transporters. Since myo-inositol is essential for eukaryotic viability, the primary transporter, ITR1, was functionally and structurally characterized in P. carinii. The predicted structure of P. carinii ITR1 (PcITR1) contained 12 transmembrane alpha-helices with intracellular C and N termini, consistent with other inositol transporters. The apparent Km was 0.94 \u00b1 0.08 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), suggesting that myo-inositol transport in P. carinii is likely through a low-affinity, highly selective transport system, as no other sugars or inositol stereoisomers were significant competitive inhibitors. Glucose transport was shown to use a different transport system. The myo-inositol transport was distinct from mammalian transporters, as it was not sodium dependent and was cytochalasin B resistant. Inositol transport in these fungi offers an attractive new drug target because of the reliance of the fungi on its transport, clear differences between the mammalian and fungal transporters, and the ability of the host to both synthesize and transport this critical nutrient, predicting low toxicity of potential inhibitors to the fungal transporter. IMPORTANCE myo-Inositol is a sugarlike nutrient that is essential for life in most organisms. Humans and microbes alike can obtain it by making it, which involves only 2 enzymes, by taking it from the environment by a transport process, or by recycling it from other cellular constituents. Inspection of the genomes of the pathogenic fungi of the genus Pneumocystis showed that these pneumonia-causing parasites could not make myo-inositol, as they lacked the 2 enzymes. Instead, we found evidence of inositol transporters, which would import the sugar from the lungs where the fungi reside. In the present report, we characterized the transport of myo-inositol in the fungus and found that the transporter was highly selective for myo-inositol and did not transport any other molecules. The transport was distinct from that in mammalian cells, and since mammals can both make and transport myo-inositol, while Pneumocystis fungi must transport it, this process offers a potential new drug target. myo-Inositol is a sugarlike nutrient that is essential for life in most organisms.

        "abstract": "SUMMARY Pneumocystis, a unique atypical fungus with an elusive lifestyle, has had an important medical history. It came to prominence as an opportunistic pathogen that not only can cause life-threatening pneumonia in patients with HIV infection and other immunodeficiencies but also can colonize the lungs of healthy individuals from a very early age. The genus Pneumocystis includes a group of closely related but heterogeneous organisms that have a worldwide distribution, have been detected in multiple mammalian species, are highly host species specific, inhabit the lungs almost exclusively, and have never convincingly been cultured in vitro, making Pneumocystis a fascinating but difficult-to-study organism. Improved molecular biologic methodologies have opened a new window into the biology and epidemiology of Pneumocystis. Advances include an improved taxonomic classification, identification of an extremely reduced genome and concomitant inability to metabolize and grow independent of the host lungs, insights into its transmission mode, recognition of its widespread colonization in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts, and utilization of strain variation to study drug resistance, epidemiology, and outbreaks of infection among transplant patients. This review summarizes these advances and also identifies some major questions and challenges that need to be addressed to better understand Pneumocystis biology and its relevance to clinical care.",
