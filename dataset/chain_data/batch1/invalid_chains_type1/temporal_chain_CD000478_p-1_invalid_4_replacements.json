        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether azathioprine can prevent relapse in ulcerative colitis. DESIGN--One year placebo controlled double blind trial of withdrawal or continuation of azathioprine. SETTING--Outpatient clinics of five hospitals. SUBJECTS--79 patients with ulcerative colitis who had been taking azathioprine for six months or more. Patients in full remission for two months or more (67), and patients with chronic low grade or corticosteroid dependent disease (12) were randomised separately. 33 patients in remission received azathioprine and 34 placebo; five patients with chronic stable disease received azathioprine and seven placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of relapse. Relapse was defined as worsening of symptoms or sigmoidoscopic appearance. RESULTS--For the remission group the one year rate of relapse was 36% (12/33) for patients continuing azathioprine and 59% (20/34) for those taking placebo (hazard rate ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.0). For the subgroup of 54 patients in long term remission (greater than six months before entry to trial) benefit was still evident, with a 31% (8/26) rate of relapse with azathioprine and 61% (17/28) with placebo (p less than 0.01). For the small group of patients with chronic stable colitis (six were corticosteroid dependent and six had low grade symptoms) no benefit was found from continued azathioprine therapy. Adverse events were minimal. CONCLUSIONS--Azathioprine maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis is beneficial for at least two years if patients have achieved remission while taking the drug. Demonstration of the relapse preventing properties of azathioprine has implications for a large number of patients with troublesome ulcerative colitis, who may benefit from treatment with azathioprine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine and its prodrug azathioprine are effective medications for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. However, use of these drugs has been limited by concerns about their toxicity. Colonic delivery of azathioprine may reduce its systemic bioavailability and limit toxicity. AIM: To determine the bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine after administration of azathioprine via three colonic delivery formulations. METHODS: Twenty four healthy human subjects each received 50 mg of azathioprine by one of four delivery formulations (each n = 6): oral; delayed release oral; hydrophobic rectal foam; and hydrophilic rectal foam. All subjects also received a 50 mg dose of intravenous azathioprine during a separate study period. Plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The bioavailabilities of 6-mercaptopurine after colonic azathioprine administration via delayed release oral, hydrophobic rectal foam, and hydrophilic rectal foam (7%, 5%, 1%; respectively) were significantly lower than the bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine after oral azathioprine administration (47%) by Wilcoxon rank sum pairwise comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine delivered to the colon by delayed release oral and rectal foam formulations considerably reduced systemic 6-mercaptopurine bioavailability. The therapeutic potential of these colonic delivery methods, which can potentially limit toxicity by local delivery of high doses of azathioprine, should be investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The use of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased in recent years. The pharmacology, patient response in controlled trials, new formulations and routes of administration and safety for these agents are reviewed. Pharmacology : AZA is rapidly converted to 6MP, which is then further metabolized to the active metabolites, the 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN). The half-life of 6TGN in erythrocytes is prolonged and weeks to months may be required to reach steady state. This prolonged time to 6TGN steady state may help explain the clinical observation that prolonged treatment (3-4 months) with 6MP/AZA for IBD is required before a therapeutic response occurs. Clinical response: Controlled trials of 6MP (1.5 mg/kg/d) or AZA (1.0-3.0 mg/kg/d) support the following treatment indications for 6MP/AZA: inflammatory Crohn's disease; fistulizing Crohn's disease; steroid-sparing; and remission maintenance.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe approval of azathioprine (AZA) for the long-term therapy of patients with Crohn's disease in The Netherlands.\n\n\nMETHODS\nReview and update of the literature on clinical efficacy and safety of AZA in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAZA and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the onset of the clinical response is delayed, requiring combination with other active medication in the early phase of treatment. Maintenance therapy with AZA/6-MP is also effective in the prevention of relapses in patients with Crohn's disease in remission. Indications for AZA/6-MP therapy further include refractory, fistulizing and steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. It is not known whether or when AZA/6-MP can be withdrawn in patients in long-term remission, but most clinicians discontinue therapy after 3-5 years. Although fewer data are available, AZA/6-PM appears to be effective also in the therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis. Side effects of AZA/6-MP occur in about 15% of patients and include skin rash, pancreatitis and hepatitis, dose-related neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and risk of increased occurrence and severity of infections. Recent data suggest that the risk of malignancy, other than colorectal cancer, is not increased. Safety in pregnancy has not been studied extensively, but no increased prevalence of birth defects has been reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAZA/6-MP therapy is efficacious in patients with active Crohn's disease, but the drug is especially valuable in the long-term treatment of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Drug-related side effects are frequent and require discontinuation or dose-reduction of the AZA/6-MP therapy. Due to an increased risk of infections secondary to myelosuppression, careful follow-up is mandatory. Insufficient data are available on safety in pregnancy and on the risk of malignancies, but the limited data available in patients with inflammatory bowel disease appear to be reassuring.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease presents in various forms. Its increasing incidence indicates that modern lifestyle triggers disease in genetically susceptible individuals. We present a model for inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology and review the new biological therapies available. These biological agents have been developed to antagonise the processes of pathogenic inflammation, such as the reduction in T\u2010lymphocyte apoptosis, increase in T\u2010lymphocyte proliferation and increase in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking into the intestinal mucosa. Inhibitors of various inflammatory cytokines, including some antagonists to tumour necrosis factor, are effective therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. However, this class is associated with the risk of rare, but serious, side\u2010effects, such as opportunistic infections and demyelinating diseases. The administration of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin\u201010 and interleukin\u201011, may theoretically be effective in reducing inflammation, although the clinical development of some of these therapies has been terminated. The selective inhibition of the adhesion molecules involved in T\u2010lymphocyte trafficking can be effective in reducing gut inflammation. Of the selective adhesion molecule inhibitors under investigation, natalizumab has demonstrated efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease.

Two doses of NAC (20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) given for 2 days and 7 days after acetic acid administration (to induce colitis) were tested. NAC was dissolved in saline and administered locally (intracolonic), systemically (intraperitoneal) or in a combination (intracolonic and intraperitoneal). Several parameters, including macroscopic and histopathological scores and myeloperoxidase, glutathione and nitric oxide concentrations were measured using standard assay procedures. Treatment with 100 mg/kg NAC for 7 days significantly decreased tissue myeloperoxidase, glutathione and nitric oxide concentrations. The 20 mg/kg dose had no protective effects. The data indicate that NAC substantially reduced the degree of colonic injury, probably by regulating free radical production and inhibiting inflammation.

        "abstract": "Transendothelial migration of circulating leukocytes into the colonic wall is a key step in the development of the inflammatory infiltrate in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 PECAM-1 (CD31) is expressed in the tight junction area of endothelial cells, where it is supposed to support the transmigration process. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PECAM-1 in experimental IBD and to show whether blockade of PECAM-1 has therapeutic effects. Chronic colitis was induced in female BALB/c mice by cyclic oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) 3% (wt/vol). Expression of PECAM-1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. In the treatment group animals received 1 mg/kg anti-PECAM-1 (2H8) ip daily starting on day 26. On day 30 leukocyte adhesion and migration was measured during N(2)O-isoflurane anesthesia in the distal colon by intravital microscopy. Disease activity index (DAI), histology, and MPO levels were compared with healthy and diseased controls. PECAM-1 was expressed in colitic mice. Chronic DSS colitis was characterized by a marked increase in rolling, adherent, and transmigrated leukocytes compared with healthy controls. Immunoblockade of PECAM-1 reduced leukocyte transmigration significantly and also diminished leukocyte rolling and sticking in an indirect manner. It also resulted in a significantly diminished DAI and MPO levels, as well as an amelioration of the histological inflammation score. PECAM-1 plays an important role in transendothelial leukocyte migration in DSS colitis. PECAM-1 could be a novel target for antibody-based treatment in IBD.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Evidence suggests haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can migrate to injured liver and influence tissue repair. However, mechanisms governing HSC recruitment to injured hepatic microcirculation are poorly understood. These were investigated in vivo following hepatic ischaemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) injury and in vitro using flow-based adhesion assays. Design: Partial IR was induced in anaesthetised WT or PECAM-1\u2212/\u2212 mice for 90 min. Recruitment of systemically administered HSCs was monitored and effects of function blocking antibodies against \u03b14\u03b21 integrin, CD18, CD44, PECAM-1 or VCAM-1 investigated. The kinetics and molecular events governing adhesion to murine cardiac endothelial cells in vitro were also determined. Effects of conditioned media from IR injured liver on HSC adhesion molecule expression was determined by FACS. Results: Administered HSCs homed predominantly to lungs rather than liver, highlighting a potential therapeutic hurdle. Hepatic HSC recruitment following IR injury was inhibited by anti-\u03b14\u03b21 and anti-VCAM-1 antibodies. A role for \u03b14\u03b21 was also confirmed using flow-based adhesion assays. Incubating HSCs with conditioned media from IR injured liver increased \u03b14\u03b21 expression. CD18, CD44 and PECAM-1 were not involved in recruitment.

        "abstract": "Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have shown benefit in clinical trials of patients with liver disease. Efficient delivery of cells to target organs is critical to improving their effectiveness. This requires an understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular engraftment into the liver. Binding of hMSCs to normal/injured liver tissue, purified extracellular matrices, and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) were quantified in static and flow conditions. To define the mechanisms underpinning hMSC interactions, neutralizing adhesion molecule antibodies were used. Fluorescently labelled hMSCs were infused intraportally into CCl4\u2013injured mice with and without neutralizing antibodies. hMSCs expressed high levels of CD29/\u03b21\u2010integrin and CD44. Using liver tissue binding assays, hMSC adhesion was greatest in diseased human liver versus normal liver (32.2 cells/field versus 20.5 cells/field [P = 0.048]). Neutralizing antibodies against CD29 and CD44 reduced hMSC binding to diseased liver by 34% and 35%, respectively (P = 0.05). hMSCs rolled at 528 \u03bcm/second on HSECs in flow assays. This rolling was abolished by CD29 blockade on hMSCs and vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (VCAM\u20101) blockade on HSECs. Firm adhesion to HSECs was reduced by CD29 (55% [P = 0.002]) and CD44 (51% [P = 0.04]) blockade. Neutralizing antibodies to CD29 and CD44 reduced hepatic engraftment of hMSCs in murine liver from 4.45 cells/field to 2.88 cells/field (P = 0.025) and 2.35 cells/field (P = 0.03), respectively. hMSCs expressed modest levels of chemokine receptors including CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3, but these made little contribution to hMSC adhesion in this setting. Conclusion: hMSCs bind preferentially to injured liver. Rolling of hMSCs is regulated by CD29/VCAM\u20101, whereas CD29/CD44 interactions with VCAM\u20101, fibronectin, and hyaluronan on HSECs determine firm adhesion both in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated using a murine model of liver injury.

The intrinsic properties of these cells make them an attractive candidate for clinical applications. MSCs are of keen interest because they can be isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow or adipose tissues and can be easily expanded in vitro. Moreover, their ability to modulate immune responses makes them an even more attractive candidate for regenerative medicine as allogeneic transplant of these cells is feasible without a substantial risk of immune rejection. MSCs secrete various immunomodulatory molecules which provide a regenerative microenvironment for a variety of injured tissues or organ to limit the damage and to increase self-regulated tissue regeneration. Autologous/allogeneic MSCs delivered via the bloodstream augment the titers of MSCs that are drawn to sites of tissue injury and can accelerate the tissue repair process. MSCs are currently being tested for their potential use in cell and gene therapy for a number of human debilitating diseases and genetic disorders.

Among the different human MSC origins exploited, umbilical cord represents an attractive and readily available source of MSC that involves a non-invasive collection procedure. In order to achieve relevant cell numbers of human MSC for clinical applications, it is crucial to develop scalable culture systems that allow bioprocess control and monitoring, combined with the use of serum/xenogeneic (xeno)-free culture media. In the present study, we firstly established a spinner flask culture system combining gelatin-based Cultispher(\u00ae) S microcarriers and xeno-free culture medium for the expansion of umbilical cord matrix (UCM)-derived MSC. This system enabled the production of 2.4 (\u00b11.1) x10(5) cells/mL (n = 4) after 5 days of culture, corresponding to a 5.3 (\u00b11.6)-fold increase in cell number. The established protocol was then implemented in a stirred-tank bioreactor (800 mL working volume) (n = 3) yielding 115 million cells after 4 days. Upon expansion under stirred conditions, cells retained their differentiation ability and immunomodulatory potential. The development of a scalable microcarrier-based stirred culture system, using xeno-free culture medium that suits the intrinsic features of UCM-derived MSC represents an important step towards a GMP compliant large-scale production platform for these promising cell therapy candidates.",

        "title": "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: From Discovery to Manufacturing and Commercialization",
        "abstract": "Over the last decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been the focus of intense research by academia and industry due to their unique features. MSC can be easily isolated and expanded through in vitro culture by taking full advantage of their self-renewing capacity. In addition, MSC exert immunomodulatory effects and can be differentiated into various lineages, which makes them highly attractive for clinical applications in cell-based therapies. In this review, we attempt to provide a brief historical overview of MSC discovery, characterization, and the first clinical studies conducted. The current MSC manufacturing platforms are reviewed with special attention regarding the use of bioreactors for the production of GMP-compliant clinically relevant cell numbers. The first commercial MSC-based products are also addressed, as well as the remaining challenges to the widespread use of MSC-derived products.",

        "title": "CFD modelling of a wave-mixed bioreactor with complex geometry and two degrees of freedom motion",
        "abstract": "Optimizing bioprocesses requires an in-depth understanding, from a bioengineering perspective, of the cultivation systems used. A bioengineering characterization is typically performed via experimental or numerical methods, which are particularly well-established for stirred bioreactors. For unstirred, non-rigid systems such as wave-mixed bioreactors, numerical methods prove to be problematic, as often only simplified geometries and motions can be assumed. In this work, a general approach for the numerical characterization of non-stirred cultivation systems is demonstrated using the CELL-tainer bioreactor with two degree of freedom motion as an example. In a first step, the motion is recorded via motion capturing, and a 3D model of the culture bag geometry is generated via 3D-scanning. Subsequently, the bioreactor is characterized with respect to mixing time, and oxygen transfer rate, as well as specific power input and temporal Kolmogorov length scale distribution. The results demonstrate that the CELL-tainer with two degrees of freedom outperforms classic wave-mixed bioreactors in terms of oxygen transport. In addition, it was shown that in the cell culture version of the CELL-tainer, the critical Kolmogorov length is not surpassed in any simulation.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the use of CFD modelling for characterizing non-stirred cultivation systems, which is a different approach from the source paper that focuses on stirred tank bioreactors. However, both papers share a common goal of optimizing bioprocesses and understanding the impact of hydrodynamics on cell culture. The paper does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, but it contributes to the broader field of bioprocess engineering, making it partially relevant."

        "title": "Automated Shape and Process Parameter Optimization for Scaling Up Geometrically Non-Similar Bioreactors",
        "abstract": "Scaling bioprocesses remains a major challenge. Since it is physically impossible to increase all process parameters equally, a suitable scale-up strategy must be selected for a successful bioprocess. One of the most widely used criteria when scaling up bioprocesses is the specific power input. However, this represents only an average value. This study aims to determine the Kolmogorov length scale distribution by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and to use it as an alternative scale-up criterion for geometrically non-similar bioreactors for the first time. In order to obtain a comparable Kolmogorov length scale distribution, an automated geometry and process parameter optimization was carried out using the open-source tools OpenFOAM and DAKOTA. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test statistic was used for optimization. A HEK293-F cell expansion (batch mode) from benchtop (Infors Minifors 2 with 4 L working volume) to pilot scale (D-DCU from Sartorius with 30 L working volume) was carried out. As a reference cultivation, the classical scale-up approach with constant specific power input (233 W m\u22123) was used, where a maximum viable cell density (VCDmax) of 5.02\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121 was achieved (VCDmax at laboratory scale 5.77\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121). Through the automated optimization of the stirrer geometry (three parameters), position and speed, comparable cultivation results were achieved as in the small scale with a maximum VCD of 5.60\u00b7106 cells mL\u22121. In addition, even on the pilot scale, cell aggregate size distribution was seen to strictly follow a geometric distribution and can be predicted with the help of CFD with the previously published correlation.",

        "explanation": "This paper uses the concept of Kolmogorov length scale distribution, which was also used in the source paper to characterize the CELL-tainer bioreactor. The authors apply this concept to optimize the scale-up of geometrically non-similar bioreactors, building on the idea of using the Kolmogorov length scale distribution as a scale-up criterion. Therefore, the hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper."
