        "title": "Does breathing other people's tobacco smoke cause lung cancer?",
        "abstract": "The available epidemiological studies of lung cancer and exposure to other people's tobacco smoke, in which exposure was assessed by whether or not a person classified as a non-smoker lived with a smoker, were identified and the results combined. There were 10 case-control studies and three prospective studies. Overall, there was a highly significant 35% increase in the risk of lung cancer among non-smokers living with smokers compared with non-smokers living with non-smokers (relative risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.54). Part of this increase was almost certainly caused by the misclassification of some smokers as non-smokers. As smokers, who are more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers, tend to live with smokers this misclassification probably exaggerated the estimated increase in risk. Adjustment for this error reduced the estimate to 30% (relative risk 1.30), but as people who live with non-smokers may still be exposed to other people's smoke this estimate was revised again to allow for the fact that a truly unexposed reference group was not used. The increase in risk among non-smokers living with smokers compared with a completely unexposed group was thus estimated as 53% (relative risk of 1.53). This analysis, and the fact that non-smokers breathe environmental tobacco smoke, which contains carcinogens, into their lungs and that the generally accepted view is that there is no safe threshold for the effect of carcinogens, leads to the conclusion that breathing other people's tobacco smoke is a cause of lung cancer. About a third of the cases of lung cancer in non-smokers who live with smokers, and about a quarter of the cases in non-smokers in general, may be attributed to such exposure.",

        "abstract": "We carried out a study to determine the proportion of patients attending a university-based gastroenterology outpatient clinic who sought alternative medical care for the same health problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. After the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire, the gastroenterologist gave a diagnosis and assigned a functional rating. Of the 395 patients 287 (73%) had not used alternative medicine, and 36 (9%) had sought alternative medical care for the problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. There were no significant differences between alternative medicine users and nonusers in sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services or general health status. Patients with a functional disease were more likely to seek alternative medical care than those with organic disease (33% v. 7%) (p less than 0.0001). Fewer alternative medicine users (54%) than nonusers (85%) were satisfied with conventional medicine (p less than 0.001), and more alternative medicine users (49%) than nonusers (13%) were very sceptical of conventional medicine (p less than 0.0001).",

Identification of the constituents was carried out by interpretation of their retention times, UV absorption spectra, MS and MS/MS spectra, as well as the data provided by authentic standards and literatures. A total of 20 components were separated in only 8.0 min on a small particle size C18 column (1.7 microm). These components included nine diterpene acids, seven glycosides and four triterpenoids, among which pseudolaric acid C-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and pseudolaric acid C2-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were separated and identified for the first time in this study. Furthermore, the fragmentation patterns of the three types of compounds were elucidated for the first time. This established UPLC-PDA/Q-TOF-MS/MS method is reliable and effective for the separation and identification of the 20 compounds and will be useful for quality control of the crude materials of Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon and their related preparations.",

The majority of visits are to physicians, followed by chiropractors. We attempted to understand more about this disparity by examining social and demographic factors that differentiate between persons who see these providers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEpisodes of care were constructed from participants in 2 panels from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey who had spinal pain. The provider of care was identified for each episode, and logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with MD/PT use compared to MD use, and MD/PT use compared to DC use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe majority of patients (61%) received MD care for spinal pain, followed by those who received DC (28%) and MD/PT (11%) care. Female sex, higher levels of education, and higher income were significantly associated with MD/PT care over MD care. Increased age, female sex, lower self-health rating, and presence of at least 1 disability day were all significantly associated with MD/PT care over DC care.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSociodemographic and clinical factors are associated with those who get MD/PT care as compared to MD or DC care. We found evidence of an access disparity for physical therapy and identified population characteristics that both increase and reduce the likelihood of physical therapy service use.",

        "abstract": "Study Design. A retrospective cohort. Objective. To describe physical therapy utilization following primary care consultation for low back pain (LBP) and evaluate associations between the timing and content of physical therapy and subsequent health care utilization and costs. Summary of Background Data. Primary care management of LBP is highly variable and the implications for subsequent costs are not well understood. The importance of referring patients from primary care to physical therapy has been debated, and information on how the timing and content of physical therapy impact subsequent costs and utilization is needed. Methods. Data were extracted from a national database of employer-sponsored health plans. A total of 32,070 patients with a new primary care LBP consultation were identified and categorized on the basis of the use of physical therapy within 90 days. Patients utilizing physical therapy were further categorized based on timing (early [within 14 d] or delayed)] and content (guideline adherent or nonadherent). LBP-related health care costs and utilization in the 18-months following primary care consultation were examined. Results. Physical therapy utilization was 7.0% with significant geographic variability. Early physical therapy timing was associated with decreased risk of advanced imaging (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 0.41), additional physician visits (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.32), surgery (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), injections (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), and opioid medications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) compared with delayed physical therapy. Total medical costs for LBP were $2736.23 lower (95% CI: 1810.67, 3661.78) for patients receiving early physical therapy. Physical therapy content showed weaker associations with subsequent care. Conclusion. Early physical therapy following a new primary care consultation was associated with reduced risk of subsequent health care compared with delayed physical therapy. Further research is needed to clarify exactly which patients with LBP should be referred to physical therapy; however, if referral is to be made, delaying the initiation of physical therapy may increase risk for additional health care consumption and costs.",

        "title": "Practice patterns when treating patients with low back pain: a survey of physical therapists",
        "abstract": "Abstract Low back pain (LBP), is a common musculoskeletal problem, affecting 75\u201385% of adults in their lifetime. Direct costs of LBP in the USA were estimated over 85 billion dollars in 2005 resulting in a significant economic burden for the healthcare system. LBP classification systems and outcome measures are available to guide physical therapy assessments and intervention. However, little is known about which, if any, physical therapists use in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to identify the use of and barriers to LBP classification systems and outcome measures among physical therapists in one state. A mixed methods study using a cross-sectional cohort design with descriptive qualitative methods was performed. A survey collected both quantitative and qualitative data relevant to classification systems and outcome measures used by physical therapists working with patients with LBP. Physical therapists responded using classification systems designed to direct treatment predominantly. The McKenzie method was the most frequent approach to classify LBP. Barriers to use of classification systems and outcome measures were lack of knowledge, too limiting and time. Classification systems are being used for decision-making in physical therapy practice for patients with LBP. Lack of knowledge and training seems to be the main barrier to the use of classification systems in practice. The Oswestry Disability Index and Numerical Pain Scale were the most commonly used outcome measures. The main barrier to their use was lack of time. Continuing education and reading the literature were identified as important tools to teach evidence-based practice to physical therapists in practice.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: It has been difficult to monitor the pelvic position during actual daily life. However, recent developments in wearable device technologies, such as the LUMOback device, provide the possibility to evaluate habitual pelvic posture and time spent sitting during daily life. The current study aimed (1) to investigate test\u2013retest reliability for habitual pelvic posture and time spent sitting with the LUMOback in individuals with prolonged low back pain (low back pain group) and without low back pain (control group), and (2) to preliminarily investigate differences in those measures between groups. Methods: Fifteen individuals in each group wore the LUMOback daily for 2\u2009weeks. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated in each group by comparing the mean from the first week with the mean from the second week: (1) for the posture score, which is a proportion of time with neutral posture, and (2) for time spent sitting. The two measures for the first week were compared between the low back pain and control groups. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for the posture score were .82 in the low back pain group and .91 in the control group. The intraclass correlation coefficients for time spent sitting were .75 in the low back pain group and .85 in the control group. The posture score in the low back pain group (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 37.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3%) was less than that in the control group (49.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0%; p\u2009<\u2009.001), but there was no difference in time spent sitting between the groups (p\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions: The current study found (1) acceptable test\u2013retest reliability for the posture score and time spent sitting evaluated by the LUMOback device, and (2) preliminary evidence of a difference in the posture score, indicating a more slouched lumbopelvic posture in individuals with prolonged low back pain than those without low back pain.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Working alliance between the physiotherapist and patient is important for successful treatment in physiotherapy. Working alliance can be measured by a 12-item self-reporting measure with 7-point Likert scale, the Working Alliance Inventory Short-Form Client (WAI-SC). Objectives: To develop a shorter version of the Japanese WAI-SC through examination of factor structure and test\u2013retest reliability. Design: Survey. Method: A convenience sample of 118 outpatients with musculoskeletal disorders completed the WAI-SC immediately after the third consultation and 101 of them completed the WAI-SC immediately before the fourth consultation. Results/findings: Through investigations of internal consistency, test\u2013retest reliability, and factor structure, a single structure was detected by excluding Item 4 and Item 10. Score calculation was also modified to dichotomous variables (Score 7 or other scores) due to serious ceiling effects, where >50% of responses were Score 7. A five-item questionnaire with dichotomous score rating (Modified WAI-SC Japanese musculoskeletal version) was developed through consideration of internal consistency and item-total correlation analysis. This questionnaire demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.88) and excellent test\u2013retest reliability for each item (Cohen\u2019s \u03ba for all > 0.4) and total scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84).

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The current standard to evaluate the presence of somatosensory dysfunctions is quantitative sensory testing, but its clinical utility remains limited. Low\u2010cost and time\u2010efficient clinical sensory testing (CST) batteries have thus been developed. Recent studies show moderate to substantial reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability of people with spine\u2010related leg and arm pain, representing mixed pain mechanisms. Methods Fifty\u2010three patients with spine\u2010related leg (n\u2009=\u200941) and arm pain (n\u2009=\u200912) attended three CST sessions. The CST battery consisted of eleven tests, determining loss and gain of sensory nerve function. CST was performed by the same investigator twice and by an additional investigator to determine inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability. Fleiss' (inter\u2010tester) and Cohen's (intra\u2010tester) kappa were calculated for dichotomized and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous outcomes. Results Fleiss' kappa varied among modalities from fair to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.23\u20130.66). Cold, warm, and vibration detection thresholds and cold and pressure pain thresholds reached kappa >0.4 (moderate to substantial reliability). Cohen's kappa ranged from moderate to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.45\u20130.66). The reliability of the windup ratio was poor (ICC <0.18). Conclusion CST modalities with moderate to substantial inter\u2010tester reliability could be of benefit as a screening tool. The moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability for all sensory modalities (except windup ratio) supports their potential use in clinical practice and research to monitor somatosensory changes over time in patients with spine\u2010related limb pain of mixed pain mechanisms. Significance We already know that most modalities of clinical sensory test (CST) batteries achieve moderate to substantial inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the reliability of a CST battery in populations with mixed pain mechanisms. We found inter\u2010tester reliability varied from poor to substantial for sensory modalities, questioning the value of some CST modalities. The CST battery showed moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability, suggesting its usefulness to monitor sensory changes over time in this cohort.",
