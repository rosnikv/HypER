        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe investigated the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GcRs) in the intrahepatic biliary epithelium and the role of corticosteroids in the regulation of cholangiocyte secretion.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGcR was studied by immunohistochemistry, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blots. The effects of dexamethasone and budesonide on biliary bicarbonate excretion and H+/HCO3- transport processes were investigated in bile fistula rats, isolated intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDUs), and purified cholangiocytes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGcRs were expressed by rat cholangiocytes. Although acute administration of corticosteroids showed no effect, treatment for 2 days with dexamethasone or budesonide increased (P < 0.05) biliary bicarbonate concentration and secretion, which were blocked by the specific GcR antagonist, RU-486. IBDUs isolated from rats treated with dexamethasone or budesonide showed an increased (P < 0.05) activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE2 member), which was blocked by RU-486. Protein expression of NHE1 and AE2 and messenger RNA for NH1 but not AE2 were increased (P < 0.05) in isolated cholangiocytes by dexamethasone treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe intrahepatic biliary epithelium expresses GcR and responds to corticosteroids by increasing bicarbonate excretion in bile. This is caused by corticosteroid-induced enhanced activities and protein expression of transport processes driving bicarbonate excretion in the biliary epithelium.",

        "title": "Variants Associated with Infantile Cholestatic Syndromes Detected in Extrahepatic Biliary Atresia by Whole Exome Studies: A 20-Case Series from Thailand",
        "abstract": "Abstract Biliary atresia (BA) is the most severe form of obstructive cholangiopathy occurring in infants. Definitive diagnosis of BA usually relies on operative findings together with supporting pathological patterns found in the extrahepatic bile duct. In infancy, overlapping clinical patterns of cholestasis can be found in other diseases including biliary hypoplasia and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. In addition, BA has been reported as a phenotype in some rare genetic syndromes. Unlike BA, other cholangiopathic phenotypes have their own established genetic markers. In this study, we used these markers to look for other cholestasis entities in cases diagnosed with BA. DNA from 20 cases of BA, diagnosed by operative findings and histopathology, were subjected to a study of 19 genes associated with infantile cholestasis syndromes, using whole exome sequencing. Variant selection focused on those with allele frequencies in dbSNP150 of less than 0.01. All selected variants were verified by polymerase chain reaction\u2013direct sequencing. Of the 20 cases studied, 13 rare variants were detected in 9 genes: 4 in JAG1 (Alagille syndrome), 2 in MYO5B (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis [PFIC] type 6), and one each in ABCC2 (Dubin\u2013Johnson syndrome), ABCB11 (PFIC type 2), UG1A1 (Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome), MLL2 (Kabuki syndrome), RFX6 (Mitchell\u2013Riley syndrome), ERCC4 (Fanconi anemia), and KCNH1 (Zimmermann\u2013Laband syndrome). Genetic lesions associated with various cholestatic syndromes detected in cases diagnosed with BA raised the hypothesis that severe inflammatory cholangiopathy in BA may not be a distinct disease entity, but a shared pathology among several infantile cholestatic syndromes.",

The first Focus Study Group was organized by Nora V. Bergasa and Howard H. Worman. It was dedicated to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and met on October 25th, 2003, during the AASLD annual meeting. The purpose of this symposium was to identify areas of research and to establish national and international collaborations to study PBC and its complications. The program was prepared from topics provided by investigators in the field, in response to questions posed by the organizers, and it was divided in three sections: pathogenesis, the study of fatigue, and treatment of PBC. An overview on the pathogenesis of PBC was presented by Dr. Eric M. Gershwin (University of California at Davis, CA)1 and was followed by the presentations of invited speakers, all of whom are investigators in the field. In this report, abstracted presentations provided by the speakers and the salient points that evolved from the discussion sections are provided.",

        "title": "Estrogens and the pathophysiology of the biliary tree.",
        "abstract": "The scientific framework concerning estrogen effects on different tissues has expanded enormously during the last decades, when estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes were identified. Estrogens are not only essential for the female reproductive system, but they also control fundamental functions in other tissues including the cardiovascular system, bone, brain and liver. Recently, estrogens have been shown to target the biliary tree, where they modulate the proliferative and secretory activities of cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells lining bile ducts. By acting on both estrogen receptors (ER-alpha) and (ER-beta) subtypes, and by activating either genomic or non-genomic pathways, estrogens play a key role in the complex loop of growth factors and cytokines, which modulates the proliferative response of cholangiocytes to damage. Specifically, estrogens activate intracellular signalling cascades [ERK(1/2) (extracellular regulated kinases (1/2), PI3- kinase/AKT (phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase/AKT)] typical of growth factors such as insulin like growth factor (IGF1), nerve growth factor (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus potentiating their action. In addition, estrogens stimulate the secretion of different growth factors in proliferating cholangiocytes. This review specifically deals with the recent advances related to the role and mechanisms by which estrogens modulate cholangiocyte functions in normal and pathological conditions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the different effects of oral estrogen therapy (ET) and transdermal ET on changes in circulating levels of cytokines and chemokines in relationship to changes in markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty-five postmenopausal women with hysterectomy were randomly assigned in open, parallel-group fashion to an oral ET group and a transdermal ET group. Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines were simultaneously measured using a multiplexed human cytokine assay. Serum concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were measured as vascular inflammation markers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth oral ET and transdermal ET significantly decreased serum interleukin (IL)-7 concentrations at 12 months (P=0.020 and P=0.015 respectively). Transdermal ET decreased serum concentrations of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta (P=0.05, P=0.019, and P=0.029), but oral ET increased IL-8 level (P=0.025). There were significant differences in percentage changes in IL-8 and MIP-1beta between the oral and transdermal ET groups. Oral ET significantly decreased E-selectin level after 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTransdermal ET reduces circulating levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1beta, while both oral ET and transdermal ET reduce circulating level of IL-7.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease where lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines that accelerate its initiation and progression. Estrogen has been proven to be vasoprotective against atherosclerosis; however, the anti-inflammatory function of estrogen in the vascular system remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effect of estrogen on LPS-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; listed as CCL2 in the MGI database) production in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). LPS significantly enhances MCP-1 production and this is dependent on nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling, since the use of NFkappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or the silencing of NFkappaB subunit p65 expression with specific siRNA largely impairs LPS-enhanced MCP-1 production. On the contrary, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) inhibits LPS-induced MCP-1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which is related to the suppression of p65 translocation to nucleus. Furthermore, p38 MAPK is rapidly activated in response to LPS, while E(2) markedly inhibits p38 MAPK activation. Transfection with p38 MAPK siRNA or the use of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 markedly attenuates LPS-stimulated p65 translocation to nucleus and MCP-1 production, suggesting that E(2) suppresses NFkappaB signaling by the inactivation of p38 MAPK signaling. LPS promotes VSMCs migration and this is abrogated by MCP-1 antibody, implying that MCP-1 may play a major role as an autocrine factor in atherosclerosis. In addition, E(2) inhibits LPS-promoted cell migration by downregulation of MCP-1 production. Overall, our results demonstrate that E(2) exerts anti-inflammatory property antagonistic to LPS in VSMCs by reducing MCP-1 production, and this effect is related to the inhibition of p38 MAPK/NFkappaB cascade.",

        "title": "High-Mobility Group Box-1 Induces Proinflammatory Cytokines Production of Kupffer Cells through TLRs-Dependent Signaling Pathway after Burn Injury",
        "abstract": "Kupffer cells (KCs) were a significant source of cytokine release during the early stage of severe burns. High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) was recently identified as a new type of proinflammatory cytokine. The ability of HMGB1 to generate inflammatory responses after burn trauma has not been well characterized. KCs were isolated from sham animals and rats with a 30% full-thickness burn, and then were stimulated with increasing concentrations of HMGB1. The levels of Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in culture supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Northern blot analysis was performed to detect the expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNAs. The activities of p38 MAPK and JNK (by Western blot analysis) as well as NF-\u03baB (by EMSA) in KCs were also examined. As a result, HMGB1 in vitro upregulated expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 of KCs in a dose-dependent manner, and HMGB1 promoted KCs from burn rats to produce significantly more TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 proteins than those from sham animals. After harvested from burn rats, KCs were pre-incubated with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 antibody prior to HMGB1 administration. HMGB1 exposure not only significantly increased expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNAs in KCs from burn rats, but also enhanced activities of p38 MAPK, JNK and NF-\u03baB. However, these upregulation events were all reduced by pre-incubation with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 antibody. These results indicate that HMGB1 induces proinflammatory cytokines production of KCs after sever burn injury, and this process might be largely dependent on TLRs-dependent MAPKs/NF-\u03baB signal pathway.",

Therefore, progesterone deficiencies associated with infertility and miscarriage have commonly been treated with progestogens that mimic the activity of progesterone. Among those is dydrogesterone, an oral retrosteroid with a structure closely related to that of progesterone yet with a greater bioavailability and higher selectivity for the progesterone receptor. This review describes the efficacy of dydrogesterone for the treatment of threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and infertility due to luteal phase insufficiency. Data from clinical trials evaluating dydrogesterone in assisted reproductive technology are also discussed. Prospective clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that dydrogesterone significantly improves pregnancy outcomes in women with threatened miscarriage or with a history of miscarriage. Although this is not yet a registered indication, dydrogesterone was as effective as vaginal micronized progesterone for luteal phase support in the setting of assisted reproductive technology. The safety and tolerability of dydrogesterone treatment in pregnant women are also briefly addressed and the data support a well-established and favorable benefit\u2013risk profile.",

        "title": "A Phase III randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral dydrogesterone versus micronized vaginal progesterone for luteal support in in vitro fertilization",
        "abstract": "Abstract STUDY QUESTION Is oral dydrogesterone 30 mg daily (10 mg three times daily [TID]) non-inferior to micronized vaginal progesterone (MVP) 600 mg daily (200 mg TID) for luteal support in in vitro fertilization (IVF), assessed by the presence of fetal heartbeats determined by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks of gestation? SUMMARY ANSWER Non-inferiority of oral dydrogesterone versus MVP was demonstrated at 12 weeks of gestation, with a difference in pregnancy rate and an associated confidence interval (CI) that were both within the non-inferiority margin. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY MVP is routinely used in most clinics for luteal support in IVF, but it is associated with side effects, such as vaginal irritation and discharge, as well as poor patient acceptance. Dydrogesterone may be an alternative treatment due to its patient-friendly oral administration. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Lotus I was an international Phase III randomized controlled trial, performed across 38 sites, from August 2013 to March 2016. Subjects were premenopausal women (>18 to <42 years of age; body mass index (BMI) \u226518 to \u226430 kg/m2) with a documented history of infertility who were planning to undergo IVF. A centralized electronic system was used for randomization, and the study investigators, sponsor's study team, and subjects remained blinded throughout the study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS In total, 1031 subjects were randomized to receive either oral dydrogesterone (n = 520) or MVP (n = 511). Luteal support was started on the day of oocyte retrieval and continued until 12 weeks of gestation (Week 10), if a positive pregnancy test was obtained at 2 weeks after embryo transfer. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In the full analysis set (FAS), 497 and 477 subjects in the oral dydrogesterone and MVP groups, respectively, had an embryo transfer. Non-inferiority of oral dydrogesterone was demonstrated, with pregnancy rates at 12 weeks of gestation of 37.6% and 33.1% in the oral dydrogesterone and MVP treatment groups, respectively (difference 4.7%; 95% CI: \u22121.2\u201310.6%). Live birth rates of 34.6% (172 mothers with 213 newborns) and 29.8% (142 mothers with 158 newborns) were obtained in the dydrogesterone and MVP groups, respectively (difference 4.9%; 95% CI: \u22120.8\u201310.7%). Oral dydrogesterone was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to MVP. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The analysis of the results was powered to consider the clinical pregnancy rate, but the live birth rate may be of greater clinical interest. Conclusions relating to the differences between treatments in live birth rate, observed in this study, should therefore be made with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Oral dydrogesterone may replace MVP as the standard of care for luteal phase support in IVF, owing to the oral route being more patient-friendly than intravaginal administration, as well as it being a well tolerated and efficacious treatment.

This study retrospectively collected data from patients with POR in 156 IVF/ICSI fresh embryo transfer (ET) cycles in single tertiary center from January 2010 to June 2016. All the patients met ESHRE consensus, the Bologna criteria, of POR and had hCG injection for luteal phase support (LPS) on day 2, 5 and 8 after ovum pick-up.

The rates of vaginal \nburning [4 (1.4%) vs 32 (11.4%), respectively, RR 0.12, 95% CI (0.04 to 0.34)], \nvaginal bleeding [9 (3.2%) vs 26 (9.3%), respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI (0.16 to \n0.72)] and overall dissatisfaction [15 (5.3%) vs 68 (24.3%), respectively, RR \n0.22, 95% CI (0.13 to 0.37)] were significantly lower among women of group I \nwhen compared to women of group II. Conclusion: In conclusion, when \ncompared to vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone seems to be \nassociated with comparable live birth, ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy \nrates, and significantly lower dissatisfaction and side effects rates, when \ngiven as luteal phase support in normal responding women undergoing IVF/ICSI \nusing the long GnRHa protocol.",
