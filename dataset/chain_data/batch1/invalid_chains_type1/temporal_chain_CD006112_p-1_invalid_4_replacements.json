        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on inspiratory muscle function (IMF), diaphragm thickness, lung function, physical work capacity (PWC), and psychosocial status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwenty-nine adult patients with CF were randomly assigned to three groups. Two groups were required to complete an 8-week program of IMT in which the training intensity was set at either 80% of maximal effort (group 1; 9 patients) or 20% of maximal effort (group 2; 10 patients). A third group of patients did not participate in any form of training and acted as a control group (group 3; 10 patients).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nIn all patients, baseline and postintervention measures of IMF were determined by maximal inspiratory pressure (Pimax), and sustained Pimax (SPimax); pulmonary function, body composition, and physical activity status were also determined. In addition, diaphragm thickness was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) [TDIcont], and the diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) was calculated (TR = thickness during Pimax at FRC/mean thickness at FRC). Subjects also completed an incremental cycle ergometer test to exhaustion and two symptom-related questionnaires, prior to and following training.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing training, significant increases in Pimax and SPimax (p < 0.05), TDIcont (p < 0.05), TR (p < 0.05), vital capacity (p < 0.05), TLC (p < 0.05), and PWC (p < 0.05) were identified, and decreases in anxiety scores (p < 0.05) and depression scores (p < 0.01) were noted in group 1 patients compared to group 3 patients. Group 2 patients significantly improved Pimax and SPimax (both p < 0.05) only with respect to group 3 patients. No significant differences were observed in group 3 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn 8-week program of high-intensity IMT resulted in significant benefits for CF patients, which included increased IMF and thickness of the diaphragm (during contraction), improved lung volumes, increased PWC, and improved psychosocial status.",

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine whether high-intensity IMT resulted in changes in ventilatory function and exercise capacity in subjects who were healthy.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nTwenty subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe training group completed an 8-week program of IMT set at 80% of maximal effort. The control group did not participate in any form of training. Baseline and posttraining measures of body composition, pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle function (including maximal and sustained maximal inspiratory pressures [MIP and SMIP]), relaxed and contracted diaphragm thickness and thickening ratio (Tdi.rel, Tdi.cont, and TR), and exercise capacity were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe training group demonstrated significant increases in MIP, SMIP, Tdi.cont, TR, VC, total lung capacity, and exercise capacity compared with the control group, which demonstrated no change from baseline measurements at 8 weeks.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nThe findings of this study suggest that high-intensity IMT results in increased contracted diaphragm thickness and increased lung volumes and exercise capacity in people who are healthy.",

        "title": "Respiratory muscle training improves swimming endurance at depth.",
        "abstract": "Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has been shown to improve divers swimming endurance at 4 feet of depth; however, its effectiveness at greater depths, where gas density and the work of breathing are substantially elevated has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of resistance respiratory muscle training (RRMT) on respiratory function and swimming endurance at 55 feet of depth (270.5 kPa). Nine male subjects (25.9 +/- 6.8 years) performed RRMT for 30 min/day, 5 d/ wk, for 4 wks. Pre- and Post RRMT, subjects swam against a pre-determined load (70% VO2 max) until exhausted. As indices of respiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures were measured before and immediately following the swims pre- and post-RRMT. These measurements showed that ventilation was significantly lower during the swims and, at comparable swim duration, that the respiratory muscles were considerably less fatigued following RRMT. The reduced ventilation was due to a lower breathing frequency following RRMT. The ventilatory changes following RRMT coincided with significantly increased swimming time to exhaustion (approximately 60%, 31.3 +/- 11.6 vs. 49.9 +/- 16.0 min, pre- vs. post-RRMT, p < 0.05). These results suggest respiratory muscle fatigue limits swimming endurance at depth as well as at the surface and RRMT improves performance.",

        "title": "Effects of hyperoxia on ventilation and pulmonary hemodynamics during immersed prone exercise at 4.7 ATA: possible implications for immersion pulmonary edema.",
        "abstract": "Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) can occur in otherwise healthy swimmers and divers, likely because of stress failure of pulmonary capillaries secondary to increased pulmonary vascular pressures. Prior studies have revealed progressive increase in ventilation [minute ventilation (Ve)] during prolonged immersed exercise. We hypothesized that this increase occurs because of development of metabolic acidosis with concomitant rise in mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and that hyperoxia attenuates this increase. Ten subjects were studied at rest and during 16 min of exercise submersed at 1 atm absolute (ATA) breathing air and at 4.7 ATA in normoxia and hyperoxia [inspired P(O(2)) (Pi(O(2))) 1.75 ATA]. Ve increased from early (E, 6th minute) to late (L, 16th minute) exercise at 1 ATA (64.1 +/- 8.6 to 71.7 +/- 10.9 l/min BTPS; P < 0.001), with no change in arterial pH or Pco(2). MPAP decreased from E to L at 1 ATA (26.7 +/- 5.8 to 22.7 +/- 5.2 mmHg; P = 0.003). Ve and MPAP did not change from E to L at 4.7 ATA. Hyperoxia reduced Ve (62.6 +/- 10.5 to 53.1 +/- 6.1 l/min BTPS; P < 0.0001) and MPAP (29.7 +/- 7.4 to 25.1 +/- 5.7 mmHg, P = 0.002). Variability in MPAP among subjects was wide (range 14.1-42.1 mmHg during surface and depth exercise). Alveolar-arterial Po(2) difference increased from E to L in normoxia, consistent with increased lung water. We conclude that increased Ve at 1 ATA is not due to acidosis and is more consistent with respiratory muscle fatigue and that progressive pulmonary vascular hypertension does not occur during prolonged immersed exercise. Wide variation in MPAP among healthy subjects is consistent with variable individual susceptibility to IPE.",

        "title": "Human Physiology in an Aquatic Environment.",
        "abstract": "Water covers over 70% of the earth, has varying depths and temperatures and contains much of the earth's resources. Head-out water immersion (HOWI) or submersion at various depths (diving) in water of thermoneutral (TN) temperature elicits profound cardiorespiratory, endocrine, and renal responses. The translocation of blood into the thorax and elevation of plasma volume by autotransfusion of fluid from cells to the vascular compartment lead to increased cardiac stroke volume and output and there is a hyperperfusion of some tissues. Pulmonary artery and capillary hydrostatic pressures increase causing a decline in vital capacity with the potential for pulmonary edema. Atrial stretch and increased arterial pressure cause reflex autonomic responses which result in endocrine changes that return plasma volume and arterial pressure to preimmersion levels. Plasma volume is regulated via a reflex diuresis and natriuresis. Hydrostatic pressure also leads to elastic loading of the chest, increasing work of breathing, energy cost, and thus blood flow to respiratory muscles. Decreases in water temperature in HOWI do not affect the cardiac output compared to TN; however, they influence heart rate and the distribution of muscle and fat blood flow. The reduced muscle blood flow results in a reduced maximal oxygen consumption. The properties of water determine the mechanical load and the physiological responses during exercise in water (e.g. swimming and water based activities). Increased hydrostatic pressure caused by submersion does not affect stroke volume; however, progressive bradycardia decreases cardiac output. During submersion, compressed gas must be breathed which introduces the potential for oxygen toxicity, narcosis due to nitrogen, and tissue and vascular gas bubbles during decompression and after may cause pain in joints and the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Background Recent reports from triathlon and competitive open-water swimming indicate that these events have higher rates of death compared with other forms of endurance sport. The potential causal mechanism for swimming-related death is unclear. Objective To examine available studies on the hypothesised mechanisms of swimming-related death to determine the most likely aetiologies. Material and methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1950 to present) were searched, yielding 1950 potential results, which after title and citation reviews were reduced to 83 possible reports. Studies included discussed mechanisms of death during swimming in humans, and were Level 4 evidence or higher. Results A total of 17 studies (366 total swimmers) were included for further analysis: 5 investigating hyperthermia/hypothermia, 7 examining cardiac mechanisms and responses, and 5 determining the presence of pulmonary edema. The studies provide inconsistent and limited-quality or disease-oriented evidence that make definitive conclusions difficult. Conclusions The available evidence is limited but may suggest that cardiac arrhythmias are the most likely aetiology of swimming-related death. While symptoms of pulmonary edema may occur during swimming, current evidence does not support swimming-induced pulmonary edema as a frequent cause of swimming-related death, nor is there evidence to link hypothermia or hyperthermia as a causal mechanism. Further higher level studies are needed.",

        "title": "Sildenafil: Possible Prophylaxis against Swimming-induced Pulmonary Edema.",
        "abstract": "Swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs during swimming and scuba diving, usually in cold water, in susceptible healthy individuals, especially military recruits and triathletes. We have previously demonstrated that pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and PA wedge pressure are higher during immersed exercise in SIPE-susceptible individuals versus controls, confirming that SIPE is a form of hemodynamic pulmonary edema. Oral sildenafil 50 mg 1 h before immersed exercise reduced PA pressure and PA wedge pressure, suggesting that sildenafil may prevent SIPE. We present a case of a 46-yr-old female ultratriathlete with a history of at least five SIPE episodes. During a study of an exercise submerged in 20\u00b0C water, physiological parameters before and after sildenafil 50 mg orally were as follows: O2 consumption 1.75, 1.76 L\u00b7min; HR 129, 135 bpm; arterial pressure 189/88 (mean 121.5), 172/85 (mean 114.3) mm Hg; mean PA pressure 35.3, 28.8 mm Hg; and PA wedge pressure 25.3, 19.7 mm Hg. She has had no recurrences during 20 subsequent triathlons while taking 50 mg sildenafil before each swim. This case supports sildenafil as an effective prophylactic agent against SIPE during competitive surface swimming.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the mechanisms underlying the development of right heart-associated PE. Background Right heart-related pulmonary edema (PE) refers to PE resulting from impaired right heart function caused by primary or secondary factors, which is common in critically ill patients. Although the clinical manifestations of different types of right heart-related PE are similar, the pathophysiological changes and treatment methods are significantly different. According to the hemodynamic mechanism, right heart-related PE is primarily classified into two types. One is the increase of right heart flow, including extravascular compression, intravascular compression, cardiac compression, and cardiac decompression. The other type is the abnormal distribution of pulmonary circulation, including obstruction, resistance, pleural decompression, or negative pressure. With the development of hemodynamic monitoring, hemodynamic data not only help us understand the specific pathogenesis of right heart-related PE but also assist us in determining the direction of therapy and enabling individualized treatment. Summary. This article presents a review on right heart-associated PE, with a perspective of hemodynamic analysis, and emphasizes the importance of right heart function in the management of circulation. Understanding the mechanism of right heart-associated PE will not only aid in better monitoring right heart function but also help intensivists make a more accurate identification of various types of PE in the clinic.",

Objectives To investigate the effect of intense exercise and associated exposure to air pollution on the airway barrier in adolescent elite athletes compared with healthy controls and to study exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in this population. Methods Early-career elite athletes attending \u2018Flemish-Elite-Sports-Schools\u2019 (12\u201318 years) of 4 different sport disciplines (n=90) and control subjects (n=25) were recruited. Presence of EIB was tested by the eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) test. Markers at mRNA and protein level; RNA-sequencing; carbon load in airway macrophages were studied on induced sputum samples. Results 444 genes were differentially expressed in sputum from athletes compared with controls, which were related to inflammation and epithelial cell damage and sputum samples of athletes contained significantly more carbon loaded airway macrophages compared with controls (24%, 95% CI 20% to 36%, p<0.0004). Athletes had significantly higher substance P (13.3 pg/mL, 95% CI 2.0 to 19.2) and calprotectin (1237 ng/mL, 95% CI 531 to 2490) levels as well as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels compared with controls (p<0.05). The incidence of EIB in athletes was 9%. The maximal fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%) after EVH test in athletes was significantly associated with prior PM10 and PM2.5 exposure. Conclusion Early-career elite athletes showed increased markers of air pollution exposure, epithelial damage and airway inflammation compared with controls. Acute exposure to increased air pollution PM10 levels was linked to increased airway hyper-reactivity. Trial registration number NCT03587675.",

The evaluation consisted of spirometry, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea test (EVH) to evaluate for EIB, FeNO, skin prick testing, blood sampling (serum markers of epithelial damage and mast cell activation), and questionnaires (AQUA\u00a9, ACT, ACQ, and exposure and symptom-related questions).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf all athletes, 22% tested positive for EIB (n\u2009=\u200972), 14% reported a previous asthma diagnosis and 40% were atopic. Eighty percent of EIB+ athletes did not use any inhalation therapy. EIB+ athletes were significantly younger, had decreased FEV1/FVC (%), and increased post-EVH-reversibility (%) post-salbutamol compared with EIB- athletes. Furthermore, EIB was significantly associated with previous asthma diagnosis and atopy. The best predictors for a positive EVH test were AQUA\u00a9 score\u2009\u2265\u20096 (sensitivity of 78%, p\u2009=\u2009.0171) and wheezing during exercise (specificity of 82%, p\u2009=\u2009.0002).
