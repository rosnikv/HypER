        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor peptide derived from the endothelium. We evaluated the contribution of endothelin to blood-pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension by studying the effect of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 293 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute reduction of 5.7 mm Hg at each dose), which was similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to elevated blood pressure in such patients. The favorable effect of treatment with bosentan on blood pressure occurred without reflexive neurohormonal activation.",

        "abstract": "The absorption, excretion, and metabolism of the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was investigated in healthy male subjects by administration of 14C-labeled compound. Four subjects received a single oral dose of 500 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq), and four other subjects received a single i.v. dose of 250 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq). Radioactivity and concentrations of bosentan and its metabolites were measured in plasma, urine, and feces samples. More than 97% of drug-related material was recovered on average within 3.5 days after oral dosing and within 5 days after i.v. dosing. More than 90% of radioactivity was found in feces after both oral and i.v. dosing. Most of the radioactivity in urine and feces represented bosentan and three metabolites. Ro 48-5033, the major metabolite in plasma, urine, and feces, is the result of hydroxylation at the t-butyl group of bosentan. The two other metabolites Ro 47-8634 and Ro 64-1056 represent minor metabolite species. Ro 47-8634 is the product of O-demethylation of the phenolic methyl ester, and Ro 64-1056 is generated by both demethylation and hydroxylation. The radioactivity in plasma could almost entirely be attributed to bosentan and the two metabolites Ro 48-5033 and Ro 47-8634, whereby both metabolites exhibited much lower plasma levels than bosentan. Hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion of the metabolites apparently represents the major pathway of elimination for bosentan in humans.",

        "abstract": "Molecular medicine has led to rapid advances in the characterization of hepatobiliary transport systems that determine the uptake and excretion of bile salts and other biliary constituents in the liver and extrahepatic tissues. The bile salt pool undergoes an enterohepatic circulation that is regulated by distinct bile salt transport proteins, including the canalicular bile salt export pump BSEP (ABCB11), the ileal Na(+)-dependent bile salt transporter ISBT (SLC10A2), and the hepatic sinusoidal Na(+)- taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide NTCP (SLC10A1). Other bile salt transporters include the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATPs (SLC21A) and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2 and 3 MRP2,3 (ABCC2,3). Bile salt transporters are also present in cholangiocytes, the renal proximal tubule, and the placenta. Expression of these transport proteins is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, with the former involving nuclear hormone receptors where bile salts function as specific ligands. During bile secretory failure (cholestasis), bile salt transport proteins undergo adaptive responses that serve to protect the liver from bile salt retention and which facilitate extrahepatic routes of bile salt excretion. This review is a comprehensive summary of current knowledge of the molecular characterization, function, and regulation of bile salt transporters in normal physiology and in cholestatic liver disease and liver regeneration.",

        "title": "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: from bedside to bench to bedside",
        "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a cholestatic disorder that usually manifests during late pregnancy and disappears spontaneously after delivery. ICP complicates less than 1% of pregnancies in Western Europe. A prospective study conducted in west Sweden between February 1, 1999 and January 31, 2002, including 45 485 pregnant women, reveals that ICP (defined as otherwise unexplained pruritus of pregnancy in combination with fasting serum bile acid levels higher than 10mM) was diagnosed in 505 of them, i.e., on average 1.1 of 100 pregnancies (1). The highest incidence is found in Chile where it occurs in up to six of 100 pregnancies. ICP increases the risk of preterm delivery and fetal loss. In up to 3.5% of cases, the fetus dies suddenly for unknown reasons. While there is no vital risk for the mother, pruritus may cause considerable discomfort. Pruritus linked to ICP should be differentiated from specific dermatoses of pregnancy, especially pruritic urticarial papules and plaques, which manifest during the third trimester of pregnancy. These dermatoses not associated with abnormal liver function tests may represent up to one-third of the cases of pruritus occurring in late pregnancy (2). The main biochemical features of ICP are increased serum alanine\u2013aminotransferase activities and serum bile acids levels. Serum bilirubin levels are elevated in the most severe forms. Serum gglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity is increased in about 10\u201315% of the reported cases. The prevalence of cholelithiasis is higher in ICP patients than in the normal population. Signs or symptoms of cholelithiasis are found in up to 22% of the patients presenting with severe forms of ICP (1, 3). The cause of ICP is unknown. Hormonal and genetic factors are likely to be involved. Familial cases clustering as well as the high incidence in the Araucanos Indians of Chile stress the importance of genetic susceptibility (4). Steroids (estrogens, progesterone and corticosteroids) reach at term concentrations up to 1000-fold higher than those in non-pregnant individuals. All these steroids are metabolized by the liver and have a major influence on nuclear hormone receptors governing the activity of their own biliary transporters as well as of bile acids and other cholephilic anion transporters. For this reason, recent studies have focused mainly on genetic variants and polymorphisms of canalicular transporters (3, 5\u20139). Data obtained in the last 3 years support an involvement of MDR3 (ABCB4) genetic variation in the pathogenesis of ICP, especially in patients with cholelithiasis or elevated serum GGT activity. The majority of mutations reported to date are unique, the only exceptions being 959C4T, which has been described in two patients which symptomatic gallstones and ICP from two independent, non-consanguineous families, the 481 G41 (R 150 K) mutation that segregates with ICP in a UK pedigree and the S320F reported in our series of patients with both cholestasis of pregnancy and LPAC syndrome as well as in one of 14 ICP studied in Switzerland and Germany. In total, MDR3 mutation could account for up to 15% of all cases yet explored. Available analysis of BSEP and FICI sequence variation suggests that these genes are probably less important for the development of ICP. Finally, all molecules involved in bile acid metabolism (CYP, biliary transporters, nuclear receptors) could be potential players in the pathogenesis or phenotypic expression of ICP. The clinical heterogeneity of ICP strongly supports this view. In this issue of the journal, Zapata and coworkers report their 12-year experience treating ICP patients with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Thirty-two patients with ICP and absence of cholelithiasis, treated with UDCA (15mg/kg day) for at least 3 weeks before delivery, were compared with 16 historical controls who did not receive UDCA. The study shows that UDCA clearly improves pruritus and biochemical cholestasis, and significantly increases the proportion of deliveries at term with higher birth weight compared with historical controls.

These crosstalks are expected to modify profoundly our vision of xenobiotic/drug disposition and toxicity.

        "abstract": "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is a transcriptional factor involved in detoxification responses to pollutants and in intrinsic biological processes of multicellular organisms. We recently described that Vav3, an activator of Rho/Rac GTPases, is an Ahr transcriptional target in embryonic fibroblasts. These results prompted us to compare the Ahr\u2212/\u2212 and Vav3\u2212/\u2212 mouse phenotypes to investigate the implications of this functional interaction in vivo. Here, we show that Ahr is important for Vav3 expression in kidney, lung, heart, liver, and brainstem regions. This process is not affected by the administration of potent Ahr ligands such as benzo[a]pyrene. We also report that Ahr- and Vav3-deficient mice display hypertension, tachypnea, and sympathoexcitation. The Ahr gene deficiency also induces the GABAergic transmission defects present in the Vav3\u2212/\u2212 ventrolateral medulla, a main cardiorespiratory brainstem center. However, Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice, unlike Vav3-deficient animals, display additional defects in fertility, perinatal growth, liver size and function, closure, spleen size, and peripheral lymphocytes. These results demonstrate that Vav3 is a bona fide Ahr target that is in charge of a limited subset of the developmental and physiological functions controlled by this transcriptional factor. Our data also reveal the presence of sympathoexcitation and new cardiorespiratory defects in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

        "abstract": "Two Vav isoforms could be targeted to prevent breast tumors from metastasizing to the lung. Metastatic Route to the Lung Many individuals with cancer die from secondary tumors or metastases that spread through blood or lymph vessels to other tissues from the primary tumor site. The members of the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) promote tumor growth and metastasis and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rho GEFs are attractive pharmacological targets because they have potentially druggable catalytic activities and more restricted distribution patterns than Rho proteins. Citterio et al. found that the mRNA abundance of the GEFs Vav2 and Vav3 was increased in certain breast cancer subtypes in patient samples. Mice implanted with breast cancer cells in which Vav2 and Vav3 had been silenced developed slowly growing breast tumors and did not develop lung metastases. Vav2- and Vav3-deficient breast cancer cells showed an altered transcriptional profile, leading the authors to further analyze the role of select target genes encoding proteins that could be pharmacologically inhibited, such as the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. When implanted into mice, breast cancer cells with deficiencies in individual Vav target genes showed defects in proliferation, angiogenesis, the ability to enter or exit blood vessels during metastasis, and the ability to colonize the lung. When applied to human breast cancer data sets, the changes in the abundance of a subset of mRNAs from the Vav transcriptome generated a gene signature that accurately predicted if patients survived and were free of detectable lung metastasis. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and preventing secondary lung metastases and provide a potential prognostic tool for clinicians. The guanosine triphosphatases of the Rho and Rac subfamilies regulate protumorigenic pathways and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs), which could be potential targets for anticancer therapies. We report that two Rho GEFs, Vav2 and Vav3, play synergistic roles in breast cancer by sustaining tumor growth, neoangiogenesis, and many of the steps involved in lung-specific metastasis. The involvement of Vav proteins in these processes did not correlate with Rac1 and RhoA activity or cell migration, implying the presence of additional biological programs. Microarray analyses revealed that Vav2 and Vav3 controlled a vast transcriptional program in breast cancer cells through mechanisms that were shared between the two proteins, isoform-specific or synergistic. Furthermore, the abundance of Vav-regulated transcripts was modulated by Rac1-dependent and Rac1-independent pathways. This transcriptome encoded therapeutically targetable proteins that played nonredundant roles in primary tumorigenesis and lung-specific metastasis, such as integrin-linked kinase (Ilk), the transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 family ligand inhibin \u03b2A, cyclooxygenase-2, and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule Tacstd2. It also contained gene signatures that predicted disease outcome in breast cancer patients. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and lung metastases and provide a potential diagnostic tool for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Associations of ErbB4 (ERBB4/HER4), the fourth member of the EGFR family, with cancer are variable, possibly as a result of structural diversity of this receptor. There are multiple structural isoforms of ERBB4 arising by alternative mRNA splicing, and a subset undergo proteolysis that releases membrane-anchored and soluble isoforms that associate with transcription factors and coregulators to modulate transcription. To compare the differential and common signaling activities of full-length (FL) and soluble intracellular isoforms of ERBB4, four JM-a isoforms (FL and soluble intracellular domain (ICD) CYT-1 and CYT-2) were expressed in isogenic MCF10A cells and their biologic activities were analyzed. Both FL and ICD CYT-2 promoted cell proliferation and invasion, and CYT-1 suppressed cell growth. Transcriptional profiling revealed several new and underexplored ERBB4-regulated transcripts, including: proteases/protease inhibitors (MMP3 and SERPINE2), the YAP/Hippo pathway (CTGF, CYR61, and SPARC), the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway (HMGCR, HMGCS1, LDLR, and DHCR7), and cytokines (IL8, CCL20, and CXCL1). Many of these transcripts were subsequently validated in a luminal breast cancer cell line that normally expresses ERBB4. Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments identified ADAP1, APOE, SPARC, STMN1, and MXD1 as novel molecular targets of ERBB4. These findings clarify the diverse biologic activities of ERBB4 isoforms, and reveal new and divergent functions.

We found that statins significantly inhibited spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth. Statins inhibited the mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo and also suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of very late antigens (VLAs). Moreover, statins inhibited the prenylation of Rho as well as the phosphorylation of LIM kinase, serum response factor (SRF), and c-Fos downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. In addition, statins enhanced p53, p21, and p27 expression and reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase and expression of cyclin D1 and E2.

In contrast, further research is needed to study the clinical significance and the detailed mechanism of action of lncRNA-CYTOR in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CYTOR in CRC prognosis and identify the relevant potential signaling pathways and underlying mechanism of competing endogenous RNA. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) indicated that the expression of CYTOR was significantly elevated in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines. Aberrant expression of CYTOR was significantly related to TNM stage, T stage, N stage, and perineural and venous invasions. Survival analysis indicated that high-CYTOR expression was associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0057), and multivariate analysis showed that high-CYTOR expression was an independent prognostic factor, which led to poor OS. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed that there were 18 microRNAs (miRNAs) interacted with CYTOR, and one of them, miR-3679-5p might collaborate with metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1), which was selected for further analysis. Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of CYTOR and MACC1.

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Abstract Reliable biomarkers are of great significance for the treatment and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study identified potential prognostic epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition related lncRNAs (ERLs) by the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and bioinformatics. The differential expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was obtained by analyzing the lncRNA data of 370 HCC samples in TCGA. Then, Pearson correlation analysis was carried out with EMT related genes (ERGs) from molecular signatures database. Combined with the univariate Cox expression analysis of the total survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, the prognostic ERLs were obtained. Then use \u201cstep\u201d function to select the optimal combination of constructing multivariate Cox expression model. The expression levels of ERLs in HCC samples were verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, we identified 5 prognostic ERLs (AC023157.3, AC099850.3, AL031985.3, AL365203.2, CYTOR). The model showed that these prognostic markers were reliable independent predictors of risk factors (P value <.0001, hazard ratio [HR]\u200a=\u200a2.400, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u200a=\u200a1.667\u20133.454 for OS). In the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis, this prognostic marker is a good predictor of HCC survival (area under the curve of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years are 0.754, 0.720, 0.704, and 0.662 respectively). We analyzed the correlation of clinical characteristics of these prognostic markers, and the results show that this prognostic marker is an independent factor that can predict the prognosis of HCC more accurately. In addition, by matching with the Molecular Signatures Database, we obtained 18 ERLs, and then constructed the HCC prognosis model and clinical feature correlation analysis using 5 prognostic ERLs. The results show that these prognostic markers have reliable independent predictive value. Bioinformatics analysis showed that these prognostic markers were involved in the regulation of EMT and related functions of tumor occurrence and migration. Five prognostic types of ERLs identified in this study can be used as potential biomarkers to predict the prognosis of HCC.",

        "title": "Prognostication of Pancreatic Cancer Using The Cancer Genome Atlas Based Ferroptosis-Related Long Non-Coding RNAs",
        "abstract": "Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of pancreatic cancer development and are involved in ferroptosis regulation. LncRNA transcript levels serve as a prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, identifying ferroptosis-related lncRNAs (FRLs) with prognostic value in pancreatic cancer is critical. Methods: In this study, FRLs were identified by combining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and FerrDb databases. For training cohort, univariate Cox, Lasso, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to identify prognosis FRLs and then construct a prognostic FRLs signature. Testing cohort and entire cohort were applied to validate the prognostic signature. Moreover, the nomogram was performed to predict prognosis at different clinicopathological stages and risk scores. A co-expression network with 76 lncRNA-mRNA targets was constructed. Results: Univariate Cox analysis was performed to analyze the prognostic value of 193 lncRNAs. Furthermore, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and the multivariate Cox analysis were used to assess the prognostic value of these ferroptosis-related lncRNAs. A prognostic risk model, of six lncRNAs, including LINC01705, AC068620.2, TRAF3IP2-AS1, AC092171.2, AC099850.3, and MIR193BHG was constructed. The Kaplan Meier (KM) and time-related receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to calculate overall survival and compare high- and low-risk groups. There was also a significant difference in survival time between the high-risk and low-risk groups for the testing cohort and the entire cohort, with AUCs of .723, .753, respectively. Combined with clinicopathological characteristics, the risk model was validated as a new independent prognostic factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma through univariate and multivariate Cox regression. Moreover, a nomogram showed good prediction. Conclusion: The signature of six FRLs had significant prognostic value for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They may be a promising therapeutic target in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Background This study aimed to investigate the potential of a NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature as a reliable prognostic biomarker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods Transcriptome profiles and clinical data of AML patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. NAD+ metabolism-related genes (NMRGs) were identified from the KEGG and Reactome databases. Coexpression analysis was used to screen NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNAs. The NAD+ metabolismrelated lncRNA signature was constructed using univariate analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate analysis. High- and low-risk groups were compared for survival, tumor mutation burden, immune cell infiltration, and response to immunotherapy. Enrichment analysis explored the biological functions. Results LINC01679, AC079922.2, TRAF3IP2-AS1, and LINC02465 were identified to construct the risk model. The model exhibited good predictive power and outperformed age and gender as an independent prognostic marker. High-risk patients showed poorer survival, distinct TP53 mutations, and altered immune cell infiltration compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, low-risk patients exhibited greater sensitivity to immunotherapy. Enriched biological functions included leukocyte migration and positive regulation of cytokine production. Conclusions The NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature shows promise in predicting clinical outcomes for AML patients.",
