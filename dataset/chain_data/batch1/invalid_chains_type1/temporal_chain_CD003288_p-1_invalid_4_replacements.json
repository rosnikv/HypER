        "abstract": "1. The aims of this study were two-fold. First, to define ranges of blood esterase activities in three groups, namely young subjects, fit community dwelling elderly and frail, chronically hospitalised elderly subjects, and second, to determine whether low blood esterase activities in the frail patients could be altered by increasing their nutritional intake. 2. Plasma cholinesterase, aspirin esterase, paraoxonase and phenylacetate esterase activities were all significantly lower in the frail elderly compared with the young and fit elderly volunteers. The activity of red blood cell esterase was not different in the frail elderly. 3. Fourteen frail elderly patients were randomly assigned to receive either hospital meal provision plus supplemental feeding with Build-up (Nestle) and Maxijul (SHS Ltd) or hospital provision alone for 8 weeks. Dietary intake was measured for all patients at the start of the study and at week 8. Measurements of blood esterase (cholinesterase, phenylacetate esterase, paraoxonase, aspirin esterase and red blood cell esterase), albumin and anthropometric indices (weight, triceps skinfold thickness and mid arm circumference) were made before the study and repeated at week 4 and 8. 4. There was a significant increase in plasma cholinesterase at week 4 (P < 0.05) but this was not statistically significant at week 8. There were no significant changes in any of the other esterase activities or anthropometric measurements. 5. We conclude that the lower esterase activities of the frail chronically hospitalised elderly do not respond to dietary supplementation for a period of 8 weeks with routinely available products. The hypothesis that lower esterase activities are the direct result of undernutrition which would be corrected by dietary supplementation has not been supported by this study.",

        "abstract": "Geriatric patients are a subset of older people with multiple comorbidities that usually have significant functional implications. Geriatric patients have impaired homeostasis and wide inter\u2010individual variability. Comprehensive geriatric assessment captures the complexity of the problems that characterize frail older patients and can be used to guide management, including prescribing. Prescribing for geriatric patients requires an understanding of the efficacy of the medication in frail older people, assessment of the risk of adverse drug events, discussion of the harm:benefit ratio with the patient, a decision about the dose regime and careful monitoring of the patient's response. This requires evaluation of evidence from clinical trials, application of the evidence to frail older people through an understanding of changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and attention to medication management issues. Given that most disease occurs in older people, and that older people are the major recipients of drug therapy in the Western world, increased research and a better evidence base is essential to guide clinicians who manage geriatric patients.",

        "title": "Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in the elderly",
        "abstract": "Aging involves progressive impairments in the functional reserve of multiple organs, which might also affect drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. In addition, the elderly population will develop multiple diseases and, consequently, often has to take several drugs. As the hepatic first-pass effect of highly cleared drugs could be reduced (due to decreases in liver mass and perfusion), the bioavailability of some drugs can be increased in the elderly. Significant changes in body composition occur with advancing age. Lipophilic drugs may have an increased volume of distribution (Vd) with a prolonged half-life, and water-soluble drugs tend to have a smaller Vd. In the elderly, hepatic drug clearance of some drugs can be reduced by up to 30% and CYP-mediated phase I reactions are more likely to be impaired than phase II metabolism, which is relatively preserved in the elderly. Concerning the most important CYP3A4 studies with human liver microsomes and clinical studies with the validated probe, midazolam, it is indicated that there are no significant differences in CYP3A4 activity between young and old populations. Finally, renal excretion is decreased (up to 50%) in about two thirds of elderly subjects, but confounding factors such as hypertension and coronary heart disease account also for a decline in kidney function. In conclusion, age-related physiological and pharmacokinetic changes as well as the presence of comorbidity and polypharmacy will complicate drug therapy in the elderly.",

        "abstract": "It is well recognized that expression of enzymes varies during development and growth. However, an in-depth review of this acquired knowledge is needed to translate the understanding of enzyme expression and activity into the prediction of change in effects (e.g. kinetics and toxicity) of xenobiotics with age. Age-related changes in metabolic capacity are critical for understanding and predicting the potential differences resulting from exposure. Such information may be especially useful in the evaluation of the risk of exposure to very low (\u00b5g/kg/day or ng/kg/day) levels of environmental chemicals. This review is to better understand the ontogeny of metabolizing enzymes in converting chemicals to either less-toxic metabolite(s) or more toxic products (e.g. reactive intermediate[s]) during stages before birth and during early development (neonate/infant/child). In this review, we evaluated the ontogeny of major \u201cphase I\u201d and \u201cphase II\u201d metabolizing enzymes in humans and commonly used experimental animals (e.g. mouse, rat, and others) in order to fill the information gap.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric migraine is a disabling condition that can affect the everyday activities and emotional states of children. Due to the multifactorial character of the pathology and the variety of the disease's phenotypes, establishment of an effective treatment is often challenging. Pharmacological treatment is often administered off-label and includes very different drugs, from analgesics to antidepressants. Since interindividual variability in therapy response commonly causes inefficacy and an exacerbation of symptoms, pharmacogenetics may help to decrease the prescription rate of useless or unsafe drugs. If there are many drugs used in migraine, then there are even more candidate or established pharmacogenetic markers that are implicated in clinical profiles. This article presents the current situation regarding the pharmacogenetics of drugs used in pediatric migraine.",

        "abstract": "Objectives This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and risk factors of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis among HIV-positive patients in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of HIV-positive patients who underwent routine abdominal sonography for chronic viral hepatitis, fatty liver, or elevated aminotransferases between January 2004 and January 2015. Therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma concentrations of atazanavir was performed and genetic polymorphisms, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 and multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) G2677T/A, were determined in a subgroup of patients who received ritonavir-boosted or unboosted atazanavir-containing combination antiretroviral therapy. Information on demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory testing were collected and analyzed. Results During the 11-year study period, 910 patients who underwent routine abdominal sonography were included for analysis. The patients were mostly male (96.9%) with a mean age of 42.2 years and mean body-mass index of 22.9 kg/m2 and 85.8% being on antiretroviral therapy. The anchor antiretroviral agents included non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (49.3%), unboosted atazanavir (34.4%), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (20.4%), and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (5.5%). The overall prevalence of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis was 12.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Among 680 antiretroviral-experienced patients with both baseline and follow-up sonography, the crude incidence of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis was 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the independent factors associated with incident cholelithiasis were exposure to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir for >2 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12\u201335.16) and older age (AOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00\u20131.09). The positive association between duration of exposure to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and incident cholelithiasis was also found (AOR, per 1-year exposure, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05\u20132.10). The associated factors with incident nephrolithiasis were hyperlipidemia (AOR, 3.97; 95% CI, 1.32\u201311.93), hepatitis B or C coinfection (AOR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.09\u201310.62), and exposure to abacavir (AOR, 12.01; 95% CI, 1.54\u201393.54). Of 180 patients who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma atazanavir concentrations and pharmacogenetic investigations, we found that the atazanavir concentrations and UGT 1A1*28 and MDR1 G2677T/A polymorphisms were not statistically significantly associated with incident cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis. Conclusions In HIV-positive patients in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, a high prevalence of cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis was observed, and exposure to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir for >2 years was associated with incident cholelithiasis.",
