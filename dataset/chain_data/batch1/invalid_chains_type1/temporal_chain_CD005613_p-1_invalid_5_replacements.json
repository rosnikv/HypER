        "title": "Glimepiride Combined with Morning Insulin Glargine, Bedtime Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Insulin, or Bedtime Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Context Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin preparation that has recently become available. Its optimal role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is being defined. Contribution In this randomized, controlled trial of patients who were taking the sulfonylurea glimepiride, those receiving morning glargine had greater improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels and less frequent nocturnal hypoglycemia than did patients receiving either bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or bedtime glargine. Implications Morning glargine may be a better option for optimizing glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are also taking sulfonylureas than is either bedtime glargine or bedtime NPH. The Editors Type 2 diabetes is an increasing health problem in all western societies (1); the development of macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality rates (1, 2). It has also been demonstrated that achieving good glycemic control substantially contributes to the prevention of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (3). In addition, epidemiologic association analysis of the data suggests that macrovascular complications can also be prevented (4). However, current therapeutic approaches have not attained the defined targets of good metabolic control in most patients with type 2 diabetes (5). During the natural course of type 2 diabetes, -cell function is progressively lost (6), which limits the period when lifestyle modification, diet, and oral antidiabetic drug therapy are sufficient to meet targets of glycemic control. Thus, the therapeutic regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes have to be continually adapted to allow patients to consistently achieve and maintain good glycemic control. Patients with type 2 diabetes benefit from the addition of insulin to their therapeutic regimen (7-9). However, some patients express reservations regarding the administration and side effects of insulin therapy (10); therefore, effective and convenient regimens must be developed. Combination therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs and bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin has proven to be as effective as other, more complex insulin regimens and is associated with less weight gain (11, 12). Combination therapy with insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs is a regimen that can be managed at outpatient visits and that can be conveniently adapted to the patient's needs by adjusting the insulin dose on the basis of self-measured fasting blood glucose levels (13)a therapeutic target predictive of overall glycemic control (13). There are, however, limitations to achieving optimal results in daily practice with a combination of oral antidiabetic drugs and NPH insulin. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin exhibits a peak in its timeaction profile 4 to 6 hours after injection; thus, bedtime NPH insulin is associated with a risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia (14). This risk may limit the feasibility of titrating the NPH insulin dose to reach adequately low fasting blood glucose target values. Furthermore, the activity profile of NPH insulin is too short to provide optimal 24-hour insulin supplementation. Insulin glargine (Lantus, Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) is a recently introduced human insulin analogue that exhibits a 24-hour action profile with no pronounced peak (15-17). One study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with basal and bolus insulin (18) and one study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving oral antidiabetic drugs (14) have suggested that the addition of insulin glargine, injected at bedtime, decreases the risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin. Thus, insulin glargine is an improved basal component for combination regimens with oral antidiabetic drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It remains unclear whether insulin glargine provides both better metabolic control and decreases the risk for hypoglycemia than compared with NPH insulin when used with sulfonylureas, such as glimepiride. The best timing for insulin glargine administration is also unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy of sulfonylurea (3 mg of glimepiride) with either morning insulin glargine, bedtime insulin glargine, or bedtime NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes whose diabetes was poorly controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs alone. Methods Study Design Our study was a 28-week, open-label, randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes who did not achieve good metabolic control while receiving oral antidiabetic drugs had their oral agents replaced by 3 mg of glimepiride for 4 weeks and were then randomly assigned to receive additional treatment for 24 weeks with insulin glargine in the morning or at bedtime or NPH insulin at bedtime. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of the different treatment regimens on glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) and on the percentage of patients who experienced hypoglycemia. Secondary objectives were to compare the three different interventions in terms of response rates, blood glucose levels, insulin dose, and body weight, as well as adjustment of insulin dose by the investigator. A total of 111 centers in 13 European countries participated in this study. The institutional ethics committee of each participating center approved the trial, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study. Patients We recruited patients from January 2000 to October 2000; treatment took place between February 2000 and June 2001. Criteria for study inclusion were as follows: 1) type 2 diabetes, 2) age younger than 75 years, 3) body mass index less than 35 kg/m2, and 4) previous oral therapy with any sulfonylurea as monotherapy or in combination with metformin or acarbose. Furthermore, the fasting blood glucose level had to be 6.7 mmol/L or greater [ 120 mg/dL], and the HbA1c level had to be between 7.5% and 10.5%. Main exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) pregnancy or breast-feeding, 2) pretreatment with insulin or any investigational drugs within the previous 3 months, or 3) presence of any clinically relevant somatic or mental diseases. Screening Phase The study consisted of a 4-week screening phase and a 24-week treatment phase. Before the start of the study, patients gave informed consent, medical histories were recorded, physical examinations were performed, and inclusion as well as exclusion criteria were satisfied. Blood samples were taken for determination of HbA1c levels, complete hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses, and lipid status. Patients were trained to use the OptiPen Pro (Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) insulin injection device and the One Touch II (LifeScan, Milpitas, California) blood glucose meter. Patients discontinued use of their previous oral antidiabetic drug treatment and received 3 mg of glimepiride in the morning. Patients provided a complete 8-point, 24-hour blood glucose profile on the 2 consecutive days of the screening phase. Randomization A sequence of screening patient numbers was assigned to each study center. All patients who had entered the screening phase received a patient number. With a randomization schedule generated by the sponsor, eligible patients were linked sequentially to treatment codes allocated at random. This schedule was stratified by center on a 1:1:1 basis. Intervention During the treatment phase, patients visited the investigation sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after randomization. At these visits, patients had to provide daily self-measured fasting blood glucose values, and episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded in a standardized diary. The investigators checked these values, and the insulin dose was adjusted according to a predefined titration regimen. Furthermore, vital signs (including blood pressure and body weight) were recorded at every visit. At baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after randomization, blood was drawn for measurement of complete hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses. At baseline and 8, 12, and 24 weeks, blood was drawn for measurement of HbA1c levels, and patients had to provide an 8-point daily blood glucose profile on 2 consecutive days. When combination therapy was initiated, insulin glargine or NPH insulin was injected subcutaneously once daily. The insulin glargine and NPH insulin formulation consisted of a cartridge containing 3 mL of either insulin preparation. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin had to be mixed thoroughly by rotating the injection device. The insulin dose for the first day of the treatment phase was calculated according to the formula of Holman and Turner (19) by subtracting 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) from the actual fasting blood glucose value and dividing the result by 0.56 mmol/L (10 mg/dL). During the treatment phase, the insulin dose was titrated every visit by using a predefined regimen: If the fasting blood glucose level was greater than 5.6, 6.7, 7.8, or 8.9 mmol/L (>100, 120, 140, 160 mg/dL) for at least 1 of 2 consecutive days before the visit with no hypoglycemia, the insulin dose was increased by 2, 4, 6, or 8 units, respectively. Doses of glimepiride remained unchanged throughout the study. Analytical Methods Hemoglobin A1c levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Diamat, Munich, Germany) in the central laboratory (INTERLAB, Munich, Germany); the reference range was 4.4% to 6.1%. Hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses were measured in local laboratories according to standard laboratory procedures. Statistical Analysis The primary efficacy assessment was the change in HbA1c level from baseline to end point and the frequency of patients who experienced hypoglycemic episodes during the study. Secondary efficacy measurements were HbA1c level ( 7.5%), fasting blood g",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite indications from epidemiological trials that higher blood glucose concentrations are associated with a higher risk for developing micro- and macrovascular complications, evidence for a beneficial effect of antihyperglycaemic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is conflicting. Two large studies, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), did not find a reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improvement of metabolic control. The theoretical benefits of newer insulin analogues might result in fewer macrovascular and microvascular events.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of long-term treatment with long-acting insulin analogues (insulin glargine and insulin detemir) compared to NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nStudies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and communication with experts in the field as well as insulin producing companies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nStudies were included if they were randomised controlled trials in adults with diabetes mellitus type 2 and had a trial duration of at least 24 weeks.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pooling of studies by means of random-effects meta-analyses was performed.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSix studies comparing insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin and two studies comparing insulin detemir to NPH insulin were identified. In these trials, 1715 patients were randomised to insulin glargine and 578 patients to insulin detemir. Duration of the included trials ranged from 24 to 52 weeks. Metabolic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, and adverse effects did not differ in a clinical relevant way between treatment groups. While no statistically significant difference for severe hypoglycaemia rates was shown in any of the trials, the rate of symptomatic, overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia was statistically significantly lower in patients treated with either insulin glargine or detemir. No evidence for a beneficial effect of long-acting analogues on patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, quality of life or costs could be obtained.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nOur analysis suggests, if at all only a minor clinical benefit of treatment with long-acting insulin analogues for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 treated with \"basal\" insulin regarding symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Until long-term efficacy and safety data are available, we suggest a cautious approach to therapy with insulin glargine or detemir.",

        "title": "Impact of Glycemic Treatment Choices on Cardiovascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes",
        "abstract": "As the diabetic population has significant morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD), much of its medical care focuses on CVD prevention and treatment. Some medications used to treat hyperglycemia may have beneficial effects on CV outcomes, others may have negative effects, while still others seem to have no direct effect. Although past epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels and CV events in patients with type 2 diabetes, recent large randomized clinical trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT) lasting 3.5 to 5.6 years have found that intensive glycemic control either has no impact on CV outcomes or even worsens them. Results of the 10-year follow-up of the UKPDS suggest that tight glycemic control of younger, newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes may have CV benefits many years later. Because the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis spans decades, it may be that beneficial effects of tight glycemic control on CV outcomes are mainly in younger patients without established macrovascular disease. There is an emerging notion that tight glycemic control may be beneficial in primary prevention of CVD in younger patients with diabetes, but may become deleterious in older patients with established or subclinical CVD. Thus, while tight control may lessen microvascular disease, it may increase the risk of hypoglycemia and possibly of adverse CV events. In each patient, the goals of glycemic control need to be individualized based on age, overall prognosis, presence of macrovascular disease, and risk of hypoglycemia.",

        "abstract": "Glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 (GLP\u20101), a gut\u2010derived hormone secreted in response to nutrients, has several glucose and weight regulating actions including enhancement of glucose\u2010stimulated insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, slowing of gastric emptying and reduction in food intake. Because of these multiple effects, the GLP\u20101 receptor system has become an attractive target for type 2 diabetes therapies. However, GLP\u20101 has significant limitations as a therapeutic due to its rapid degradation (plasma half\u2010life of 1\u20132 min) by dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP\u20104). Two main classes of GLP\u20101\u2010mediated therapies are now in use: DPP\u20104 inhibitors that reduce the degradation of GLP\u20101 and DPP\u20104\u2010resistant GLP\u20101 receptor (GLP\u20101R) agonists. The GLP\u20101R agonists can be further divided into short\u2010 and long\u2010acting formulations which have differential effects on their mechanisms of action, ultimately resulting in differential effects on their fasting and postprandial glucose lowering potential. This review summarizes the similarities and differences among DPP\u20104 inhibitors, short\u2010acting GLP\u20101R agonists and long\u2010acting GLP\u20101R agonists. We propose that these different GLP\u20101\u2010mediated therapies are all necessary tools for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and that the choice of which one to use should depend on the specific needs of the patient. This is analogous to the current use of modern insulins, as short\u2010, intermediate\u2010 and long\u2010acting versions are all used to optimize the 24\u2010h plasma glucose profile as needed. Given that GLP\u20101\u2010mediated therapies have advantages over insulins in terms of hypoglycaemic risk and weight gain, optimized use of these compounds could represent a significant paradigm shift for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors belong to one class of drugs that have been approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on the glucose-lowering actions of the gastrointestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. Several different compounds are now available, and although their mechanism of action (inhibition of the catalytic activity of DPP-4) is the same, there are fundamental differences between them. Areas covered: The authors discuss the differences between different DPP-4 inhibitors and review their therapeutic efficacy and key safety data. The literature covered includes original studies and meta-analyses identified in PubMed, recent abstracts presented at major diabetes scientific conferences, and clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Expert opinion: Although there are some differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the different DPP-4 inhibitors, all are small orally active compounds with broadly similar HbA1c-lowering efficacy. They improve glycaemic control in T2D, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or causing weight gain. They can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic therapies, including insulin, regardless of renal or hepatic function, and are efficacious across the spectrum of patients with T2D, including those with long-standing disease duration. DPP-4 inhibitors may also have beneficial effects beyond glycaemic control, although this remains to be demonstrated in purpose-designed clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Kidney fibrosis is the final common pathway of all progressive chronic kidney diseases, of which diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has emerged as one of the most important origins of matrix-producing fibroblasts. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been introduced into the market as antidiabetes drugs. Here, we found that the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin ameliorated kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice without altering the blood glucose levels associated with the inhibition of EndMT and the restoration of microRNA 29s. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic CD-1 mice exhibited kidney fibrosis and strong immunoreactivity for DPP-4 by 24 weeks after the onset of diabetes. At 20 weeks after the onset of diabetes, mice were treated with linagliptin for 4 weeks. Linagliptin-treated diabetic mice exhibited a suppression of DPP-4 activity/protein expression and an amelioration of kidney fibrosis associated with the inhibition of EndMT. The therapeutic effects of linagliptin on diabetic kidneys were associated with the suppression of profibrotic programs, as assessed by mRNA microarray analysis. We found that the induction of DPP-4 observed in diabetic kidneys may be associated with suppressed levels of microRNA 29s in diabetic mice; linagliptin restored microRNA 29s and suppressed DPP-4 protein levels. Using cultured endothelial cells, we found that linagliptin inhibited TGF-\u03b22\u2013induced EndMT, and such anti-EndMT effects of linagliptin were mediated through microRNA 29 induction. These results indicate the possible novel pleiotropic action of linagliptin to restore normal kidney function in diabetic patients with renal impairment.",

Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor, has been reported to show multiple biological activities beyond the antidiabetic property. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of sitagliptin on hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and autophagy and exploring the underlying molecular mechanism. In the current study, ob/ob mice, a mouse model of genetic obesity and diabetes, were administered via gavage with sitagliptin 50\u2009mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Changes in glycolipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and autophagy in the liver were evaluated. Body weight gain, lipid metabolic disorder, and hepatic steatosis as well as systemic and hepatic insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice were significantly attenuated after sitagliptin treatment. Furthermore, sitagliptin decreased inflammatory responses by regulating macrophage M1/M2 polarization and inhibiting the activities of NF-\u03baB and JNK. Moreover, sitagliptin increased the levels of phosphorylation of AMPK and decreased those of mTOR. This study indicates that sitagliptin significantly ameliorates the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in ob/ob mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and activating autophagy via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.",

Sitagliptin phosphorylated YAP in a large tumor suppressor homolog\u2010dependent manner, thereby inhibiting YAP nuclear translocation, and promoted YAP cytoplasm retention. This inhibition can be blocked by adenosine 5\u2032\u2010monophosphate\u2010activated protein kinase (AMPK).

For that purpose, the N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced HCC mouse model was used in the present study using a dose of 100 mg/kg/week, i.p., for 8 weeks. NDEA-induced HCC mice received STGPT 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg starting on day 61 up to day 120. The present study revealed that STGPT inhibited HIF-1\u03b1 activation via the interference with the AKT-AMPK\u03b1-mTOR axis and the interruption of IKK\u03b2, P38\u03b1, and ERK1/2 signals as well. Accordingly, STGPT prolonged the survival, restored the histological features and improved liver function. Additionally, STGPT inhibited angiogenesis, as revealed by a significant downregulation in the VEGF and mRNA expression of CD309 with concomitant inhibition of tissue invasion was evident by an increased ratio of TIMP-1/MMP-2. STGPT exhibited apoptotic stimulatory effect as indicated upon calculating the BCL-2/Bax ratio and by the gene expression of p53. The decrease in AFP and liver index calculation, gene expression of Ki-67 confirmed the antiproliferative activity of STGPT. The anti-inflammatory potential was revealed by the decreased TNF-\u03b1 level and the downregulation of MCP-1 gene expression. Moreover, an antifibrotic potential was supported by lower levels of TGF-\u03b2. These effects appear to be GLP1R-independent. The present study provides a potential basis for repurposing STGPT for the inhibition of HCC progression. Since STGPT is unlikely to cause hypoglycemia, it may be promising as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy to treat diabetic or even normoglycemic patients with HCC.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of FOXO3a plays a significant role in the progression of various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FOXO3a inactivation, driven by oncogenic stimuli, can lead to abnormal cell growth, suppression of apoptosis, and resistance to anticancer drugs. Therefore, FOXO3a emerges as a potential molecular target for the development of innovative treatments in the era of oncology. Linagliptin (LNGTN), a DPP\u20104 inhibitor known for its safe profile, has exhibited noteworthy anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010oxidative properties in previous in vivo studies. Several potential molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain these effects. However, the capacity of LNGTN to activate FOXO3a through AMPK activation has not been investigated. In our investigation, we examined the potential repurposing of LNGTN as a hepatoprotective agent against diethylnitrosamine (DENA) intoxication. Additionally, we assessed LNGTN's impact on apoptosis and autophagy. Following a 10\u2010week administration of DENA, the liver underwent damage marked by inflammation and early neoplastic alterations. Our study presents the first experimental evidence demonstrating that LNGTN can reinstate the aberrantly regulated FOXO3a activity by elevating the nuclear fraction of FOXO3a in comparison to the cytosolic fraction, subsequent to AMPK activation. Moreover, noteworthy inactivation of NF\u03baB induced by LNGTN was observed. These effects culminated in the initiation of apoptosis, the activation of autophagy, and the manifestation of anti\u2010inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic outcomes. These effects were concomitant with improved liver function and microstructure. In conclusion, our findings open new avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the AMPK/FOXO3a signaling pathway in the management of chronic liver damage.",
