        "title": "Small Doses of Subcutaneous Insulin as a Strategy for Preventing Slowly Progressive \u03b2-Cell Failure in Islet Cell Antibody\u2014Positive Patients With Clinical Features of NIDDM",
        "abstract": "We report a pilot study to determine the preventive effect of small doses of insulin injected subcutaneously on slowly progressive \u03b2-cell damage in islet cell antibody (ICA)-positive patients with apparent NIDDM. Ten NIDDM patients who were ICA+ were divided into two groups of five. In the insulin group (age: 51 \u00b1 8 years [mean \u00b1 SD], sex: 3 men and 2 women), intermediate-type insulin (3\u201316 U/day) was given once or twice daily as a subcutaneous injection. The sulfonylurea (SU) group (age: 48 \u00b1 11 years, sex: 3 men and 2 women) was initially treated with a SU agent. Changes in \u03b2-cell function, as indicated by serum C-peptide responses and blood glucose values during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test, as well as ICA and GAD antibody status, were evaluated for up to 30 months in both groups. ICA status became negative in four of five patients in the insulin group. ICA status did not become negative in any of the patients in the SU group (P = 0.047 vs. insulin group). ICA status was persistently positive in two patients whose \u03b2-cell function eventually progressed to an insulin-dependent state and fluctuated in the remaining three patients. In the insulin group, GAD antibody status became negative in one of four initially GAD antibody\u2013positive NIDDM patients. In the SU group, GAD antibody status was persistently positive in three NIDDM patients (NS vs. insulin group). The serum C-peptide response improved significantly within 6 and 12 months in the insulin group, whereas it decreased progressively in the SU group. The changes in C-peptide response were significantly different between the two groups at 6, 12, 24, and 30 months. Two-hour blood glucose and HbA1 values were unchanged in the insulin group, but they increased in the SU group. Subcutaneous small doses of insulin, resulting in a high rate of negative conversion of ICA and an improved serum C-peptide response, may be effective in treating ICA+ NIDDM patients who are at high risk for slowly progressive \u03b2-cell failure.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is associated with autoimmunity to insulin. Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is polygenic and includes the INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus which may regulate the expression of insulin in pancreas and thymus. In order to determine whether insulin autoimmunity could be attributed to a genetic susceptibility conferred by the INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus, peripheral blood T cell proliferation to human insulin and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) was measured in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes and control subjects. IAA were detected in 21 of 53 patients and in none of 25 control subjects, while T cell responses were low (stimulation index range 0.4\u20137.2) and similar in both groups. Both antibody and T cell responses were higher in younger subjects and IAA were more prevalent in patients with the HLA\u2010DR4 allele. No relationship was observed between humoral and cellular responses to insulin. No association was found between the INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2\u2010susceptible allele and insulin autoimmunity. Increased T cell responses and IAA were found in patients with either the diabetes\u2010susceptible or the diabetes\u2010protective INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus genotypes, and increased T cell responses were also found in control subjects with either susceptible or protective INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus genotypes. This study confirms that primary T cell proliferative responses to insulin are low and detectable also in control subjects. The detection of T cell proliferation and autoantibodies to insulin in subjects with and without the protective INS VNTR\u2010IDDM2 locus genotypes does not support the hypothesis of an allele\u2010specific capacity for tolerance induction which could determine a susceptibility to develop autoimmunity against the insulin protein and subsequently diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a good model for human type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by autoreactive T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing islet beta-cells of the pancreas. The 9-23 amino acid region of the insulin B-chain [B((9-23))] is an immunodominant T-cell target antigen in the NOD mouse that plays a critical role in the disease process. By testing a series of B((9-23)) peptide analogs with single or double alanine substitutions, we identified a set of altered peptide ligands (APLs) capable of inhibiting B((9-23))-induced proliferative responses of NOD pathogenic T-cell clones. These APLs were unable to induce proliferation of these clones. However, vaccinations with the APLs induced strong cellular responses, as measured by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and Th2 cytokine production (i.e., interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-10, but not gamma-interferon [IFN-gamma]). These responses were cross-reactive with the native antigen, B((9-23)), suggesting that the APL-induced Th2 responses may provide protection by controlling endogenous B((9-23))-specific Th1 (i.e., IFN-gamma-producing) pathogenic responses. One of these APLs that contained alanine substitutions at residues 16 and 19 (16Y-->A, 19C-->A; NBI-6024) was further characterized for its therapeutic activity because it consistently induced T-cell responses (e.g., T-cell lines and clones) that were of the Th2 type and that were cross-reactive with B((9-23)). Subcutaneous injections of NBI-6024 to NOD mice administered either before or after the onset of disease substantially delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of diabetes. This study is the first to report therapeutic activity of an APL derived from an islet beta-cell-specific antigen in type 1 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "T cell tolerance can be experimentally induced through administration of self-peptides with single amino acid substitution (altered peptide ligands or APLs). However, little is known about the effects of APLs on already differentiated autoreactive CD8+ T cells that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. We generated a panel of APLs derived from an influenza virus hemagglutinin peptide exhibiting in vitro functions ranging from antagonism to superagonism on specific CD8+ T cells. A superagonist APL was further characterized for its therapeutic activity in a transgenic mouse model of type 1 diabetes. When injected i.v. 1 day after the transfer of diabetogenic hemagglutinin-specific CD8+ T cells into insulin promoter-hemagglutinin transgenic mice, the superagonist APL proved more effective than the native hemagglutinin peptide in blocking diabetes. This protective effect was associated with an inhibition of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in vivo and with a decreased accumulation of these cells in the pancreas, leading to a marked reduction of intrainsulitis. In conclusion, a superagonist \u201cself-peptide\u201d APL was more effective than the native peptide in treating a CD8+ T cell-mediated diabetes model.",

        "abstract": "Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells have been implicated in the regulation of autoimmune diseases. In several models of type 1 diabetes, increasing the number of iNKT cells prevents the development of disease. Because CD8 T cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, we have investigated the influence of iNKT cells on diabetogenic CD8 T cells. In the present study, type 1 diabetes was induced by the transfer of CD8 T cells specific for the influenza virus hemagglutinin into recipient mice expressing the hemagglutinin Ag specifically in their \u03b2 pancreatic cells. In contrast to previous reports, high frequency of iNKT cells promoted severe insulitis and exacerbated diabetes. Analysis of diabetogenic CD8 T cells showed that iNKT cells enhance their activation, their expansion, and their differentiation into effector cells producing IFN-\u03b3. This first analysis of the influence of iNKT cells on diabetogenic CD8 T cells reveals that iNKT cells not only fail to regulate but in fact exacerbate the development of diabetes. Thus, iNKT cells can induce opposing effects dependent on the model of type 1 diabetes that is being studied. This prodiabetogenic capacity of iNKT cells should be taken into consideration when developing therapeutic approaches based on iNKT cell manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Invariant NK T (iNKT) cells regulate immune responses, express NK cell markers and an invariant TCR, and recognize lipid Ags in a CD1d-restricted manner. Previously, we reported that activation of iNKT cells by \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) protects against type 1 diabetes (T1D) in NOD mice via an IL-4-dependent mechanism. To further investigate how iNKT cells protect from T1D, we analyzed whether iNKT cells require the presence of another subset(s) of regulatory T cells (Treg), such as CD4+CD25+ Treg, for this protection. We found that CD4+CD25+ T cells from NOD.CD1d\u2212/\u2212 mice deficient in iNKT cell function similarly in vitro to CD4+CD25+ T cells from wild-type NOD mice and suppress the proliferation of NOD T responder cells upon \u03b1-GalCer stimulation. Cotransfer of NOD diabetogenic T cells with CD4+CD25+ Tregs from NOD mice pretreated with \u03b1-GalCer demonstrated that activated iNKT cells do not influence the ability of Tregs to inhibit the transfer of T1D. In contrast, protection from T1D mediated by transfer of activated iNKT cells requires the activity of CD4+CD25+ T cells, because splenocytes pretreated with \u03b1-GalCer and then inactivated by anti-CD25 of CD25+ cells did not protect from T1D. Similarly, mice inactivated of CD4+CD25+ T cells before \u03b1-GalCer treatment were also not protected from T1D. Our data suggest that CD4+CD25+ T cells retain their function during iNKT cell activation, and that the activity of CD4+CD25+ Tregs is required for iNKT cells to transfer protection from T1D.",

Yet the functional changes of the two subsets of regulatory T cells in the development of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice remain unclear, and how NKT cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells cooperate functionally in the regulation of autoimmune diabetes is also uncertain. We provide evidence that in NOD mice, an animal model of human type 1 diabetes, the functions of both NKT cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells decrease in an age-dependent manner. We show that treatment with \u03b1-galactosylceramide increases the size of the CD4 + CD25 + Treg cell compartment in NOD mice, and augments the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor and the potency of CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells to inhibit proliferation of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells. Our data indicate that NKT cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells might cooperate in the prevention of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice treated with \u03b1-galactosylceramide.

Suppression of graft rejection is associated with the accumulation of CD1dhi-expressing CD11c+F4/80hi myeloid cells in hyperplastic skin. Blockade of CD1d, removal of NKT cells, or local inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 signaling is sufficient to restore immune-mediated graft rejection.

In this study, we examined the role of systemically derived NKT cells in regulating the rejection of skin grafts expressing viral proteins. In lymph nodes draining transplanted skin, Ag-specific CD8 T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity were impaired by NKT cells. NKT cell suppression was mediated via CD11c+ dendritic cells. Inhibition of CD8 T cell function did not require Foxp3+ regulatory T cells or NKT cell-secreted IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, or IL-17. Thus, following skin grafting or immunization with human papillomavirus-E7 oncoprotein, NKT cells reduce the capacity of draining lymph node-resident APCs to cross-present Ag to CD8 T cell precursors, as evidenced by impaired expansion and differentiation to Ag-specific CD8 T effector cells. Therefore, in the context of viral Ag challenge in the skin, systemic NKT cells limit the capacity for effective priming of adaptive immunity.",

        "abstract": "During the early stages of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, the innate immune system creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment by recruiting innate immune cells to eliminate the infected cells, initiating an effective acquired immune response. However, HPV exhibits a wide range of strategies for evading immune-surveillance, generating an anti-inflammatory microenvironment. The administration of new adjuvants, such as TLR (Toll-like receptors) agonists and alpha-galactosylceramide, has been demonstrated to reverse the anti-inflammatory microenvironment by down-regulating a number of adhesion molecules and chemo-attractants and activating keratinocytes, dendritic (DC), Langerhans (LC), natural killer (NK) or natural killer T (NKT) cells; thus, promoting a strong specific cytotoxic T cell response. Therefore, these adjuvants show promise for the treatment of HPV generated lesions and may be useful to elucidate the unknown roles of immune cells in the natural history of HPV infection. This review focuses on HPV immune evasion mechanisms and on the proposed response of the innate immune system, suggesting a role for the surrounding pro-inflammatory microenvironment and the NK and NKT cells in the clearance of HPV infections.",

        "abstract": "Tumors are complex structures containing different types of cells and molecules. The importance of the tumor microenvironment in tumor progression, growth, and maintenance is well\u2010established. However, tumor effects are not restricted to the tumor microenvironment. Molecules secreted by, as well as cells that migrate from tumors, may circulate and reach other tissues. This may cause a series of systemic effects, including modulation of immune responses, and in some cases, leukocytosis and metastasis promotion.

The main etiological factor for cervical cancer development is persistent infection with high oncogenic risk HPV. Our laboratory has been exploring the effects of high oncogenic risk, HPV\u2010associated tumors on lymphoid organs of the host. In the present study, we observed an increase in myeloid cell proliferation and alteration in cell signaling in APCs in the spleen of tumor\u2010bearing mice. In parallel, we characterized the cytokines secreted in the inflammatory and tumor cell compartments in the tumor microenvironment and in the spleen of tumor\u2010bearing mice. We show evidence of constitutive activation of the IL\u20106/STAT3 signaling pathway in the tumor, including TAMs, and in APCs in the spleen.

        "abstract": "Therapeutic vaccination against HPV16 is effective with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer patients. Vaccinating cancer away Cervical cancer, a common killer of women worldwide, is most often caused by human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16). Although a vaccine targeting this virus is available and very effective at preventing cervical cancer, it does not work once cancer is already established, and advanced cervical cancer is very difficult to treat. Welters et al. have developed a method of therapeutic vaccination, where they synthesize long peptides mimicking key oncogenic proteins from HPV16 and use them to treat patients. Although it is too early to tell how the new vaccine will affect patient survival, combining it with chemotherapy helped strengthen patients\u2019 immune responses against the cancer, so it is a promising candidate for further clinical development. Therapeutic vaccination with human papillomavirus type 16 synthetic long peptides (HPV16-SLPs) results in T cell\u2013mediated regression of HPV16-induced premalignant lesions but fails to install clinically effective immunity in patients with HPV16-positive cervical cancer. We explored whether HPV16-SLP vaccination can be combined with standard carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy to improve immunity and which time point would be optimal for vaccination. This was studied in the HPV16 E6/E7\u2013positive TC-1 mouse tumor model and in patients with advanced cervical cancer. In mice and patients, the presence of a progressing tumor was associated with abnormal frequencies of circulating myeloid cells. Treatment of TC-1\u2013bearing mice with chemotherapy and therapeutic vaccination resulted in superior survival and was directly related to a chemotherapy-mediated altered composition of the myeloid cell population in the blood and tumor. Chemotherapy had no effect on tumor-specific T cell responses. In advanced cervical cancer patients, carboplatin-paclitaxel also normalized the abnormal numbers of circulating myeloid cells, and this was associated with increased T cell reactivity to recall antigens. The effect was most pronounced starting 2 weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy, providing an optimal immunological window for vaccination. This was validated with a single dose of HPV16-SLP vaccine given in this time window. The resulting proliferative HPV16-specific T cell responses were unusually strong and were retained after all cycles of chemotherapy. In conclusion, carboplatin-paclitaxel therapy fosters vigorous vaccine-induced T cell responses when vaccination is given after chemotherapy and has reset the tumor-induced abnormal myeloid cell composition to normal values.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV)\u2013associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) has a much better prognosis than HPV-negative OPSCC, and this is linked to dense tumor immune infiltration. As the viral antigens may trigger potent immunity, we studied the relationship between the presence of intratumoral HPV-specific T-cell responses, the immune contexture in the tumor microenvironment, and clinical outcome. Experimental Design: To this purpose, an in-depth analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in a prospective cohort of 97 patients with HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative OPSCC was performed using functional T-cell assays, mass cytometry (CyTOF), flow cytometry, and fluorescent immunostaining of tumor tissues. Key findings were validated in a cohort of 75 patients with HPV16-positive OPSCC present in the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Results: In 64% of the HPV16-positive tumors, type I HPV16-specific T cells were present. Their presence was not only strongly related to a better overall survival, a smaller tumor size, and less lymph node metastases but also to a type I\u2013oriented tumor microenvironment, including high numbers of activated CD161+ T cells, CD103+ tissue-resident T cells, dendritic cells (DC), and DC-like macrophages. Conclusions: The viral antigens trigger a tumor-specific T-cell response that shapes a favorable immune contexture for the response to standard therapy. Hence, reinforcement of HPV16-specific T-cell reactivity is expected to boost this process. Clin Cancer Res; 24(3); 634\u201347. \u00a92017 AACR.

        "abstract": "Myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) represent one of the major types of immunoregulatory cells present under abnormal conditions, including cancer. These cells are characterized by their immature phenotype and suppressive effect on various immune effectors. In both human and mouse, there are two main subsets of MDSCs: polymorphonuclear (PMN)\u2010MDSCs and mononuclear (Mo)\u2010MDSCs. Thus, strategies to regulate MDSC\u2010mediated immunosuppression could result in the enhancement of anticancer immune responses. Oxaliplatin, a platinum\u2010based anticancer agent, is widely used in clinical settings. It is known to induce cell death by interfering with double\u2010stranded DNA and interrupting its replication and transcription. In this study, we found that oxaliplatin has the potential to regulate MDSC\u2010mediated immunosuppression in cancer. First, oxaliplatin selectively depleted MDSCs, especially Mo\u2010MDSCs, but only minimally affected T cells. In addition, sublethal doses of oxaliplatin eliminated the immunosuppressive capacity of MDSCs and induced the differentiation of MDSCs into mature cells. Oxaliplatin treatment diminished the expression of the immunosuppressive functional mediators arginase 1 (ARG1) and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) in MDSCs, while an MDSC\u2010depleting agent, gemcitabine, did not downregulate these factors significantly. Oxaliplatin\u2010conditioned MDSCs had no tumor\u2010promoting activity in vivo. In addition, oxaliplatin modulated the intracellular NF\u2010\u03baB signaling in MDSCs. Thus, oxaliplatin has the potential to be used as an immunoregulatory agent as well as a cytotoxic drug in cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary The aim of this review is to detailed immunological effects of chemotherapies focusing on 2 main effects: immunogenic cell death and depletion of suppressive cells. It provides a strong rational for combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Abstract Chemotherapy is initially used to kill proliferative cells. In the current area of emerging immunotherapy, chemotherapies have shown their ability to modulate the tumor micro environment and immune response. We focus here on two main effects: first, immunogenic cell death, defined as a form of regulated cell death (RCD) that is sufficient to activate an adaptive immune response in immunocompetent hosts; and second, the depletion of suppressive cells, known to play a major role in immune escape and resistance to immunotherapy. In this review, we present a review of different classically used chemotherapies focusing on this double effect on immunity. These immunological effects of chemotherapy could be exploited to promote efficacy of immunotherapy. Broadening our understanding will make it possible to provide rationales for the combination of chemoimmunotherapy in early clinical trials.",

        "title": "Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients on Immunotherapy\u2014The Role of Liquid Biopsy in Unraveling the Puzzle",
        "abstract": "Simple Summary The introduction of immunotherapy modified the cancer treatment landscape, especially for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, only a subgroup of patients benefits from this therapy. Currently, the only validated companion diagnostic test for first-line immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC patients is testing for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor tissues. However, obtaining tumor tissue can be challenging and it puts the patient at risk. Liquid biopsy offers an alternative, less invasive approach to select NSCLC patients who would benefit from immunotherapy and to monitor patients during their disease course. Liquid biopsy allows repetitive sampling, which makes it a useful tool in clinical practice. In this review, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of several liquid biopsy-based prognostic and predictive biomarkers in NSCLC patients receiving immunotherapy. Abstract In the last decade, immunotherapy has been one of the most important advances in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment landscape. Nevertheless, only a subset of NSCLC patients benefits from it. Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved diagnostic test for first-line immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC patients uses tissue biopsies to determine the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. However, obtaining tumor tissue is not always feasible and puts the patient at risk. Liquid biopsy, which refers to the tumor-derived material present in body fluids, offers an alternative approach. This less invasive technique gives real-time information on the tumor characteristics. This review addresses different promising liquid biopsy based biomarkers in NSCLC patients that enable the selection of patients who benefit from immunotherapy and the monitoring of patients during this therapy. The challenges and the opportunities of blood-based biomarkers such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), exosomes, epigenetic signatures, microRNAs (miRNAs) and the T cell repertoire will be addressed. This review also focuses on the less-studied feces-based and breath-based biomarkers.",

        "title": "Case Report: Sustained complete remission on combination therapy with olaparib and pembrolizumab in BRCA2-mutated and PD-L1-positive metastatic cholangiocarcinoma after platinum derivate",
        "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) still has a poor prognosis and remains a major therapeutic challenge. When curative resection is not possible, palliative systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and platinum derivate as first line followed by a 5-FU doublet combination as second line is the standard therapy. Recently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have rapidly emerged as personalized therapeutic approaches requiring previous tumor sequencing and molecular profiling. BRCA mutations are well-characterized targets for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, BRCA gene mutations in CCA are rare and few data of PARPi in the treatment of CCA are available. Immunotherapy with programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) has been shown to be effective in combination with chemotherapy or in PD-L1-positive CCA. However, data from immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy, including PARPi, are lacking. In this report, we present the case of a male patient with PD-L1-positive and BRCA2-mutated metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, who was treated with a combined therapy with PARP (PARPi), olaparib, and a PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, as second-line therapy after gemcitabine/platinum derivate failure. Combined therapy was able to induce a long-lasting complete remission for over 15 months. The combined therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Only mild anemia and immune-related thyroiditis were observed, which were easily manageable and did not result in discontinuation of olaparib and pembrolizumab. Conclusion The presented case showed substantial clinical activity of a combination with olaparib/pembrolizumab in advanced BRCA2-mutated CCA. Thus, identifying targetable molecular signatures and combinations of targeted therapies with immunotherapy reveals a promising strategy to effectively treat patients with cholangiocarcinoma and should be considered after failure of standard chemotherapy.",
