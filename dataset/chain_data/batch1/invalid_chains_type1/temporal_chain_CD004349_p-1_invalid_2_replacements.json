        "abstract": "Objective To define the cardiovascular effects of lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease. Design Collaborative prospective meta-analysis of randomised trials. Data sources and eligibility Participating randomised trials of drugs to lower blood pressure compared with placebo or each other or that compare different blood pressure targets, with at least 1000 patient years of follow-up per arm. Main outcome measures Major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) in composite and individually and all cause death. Participants 26 trials (152\u2009290 participants), including 30\u2009295 individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Data extraction Individual participant data were available for 23 trials, with summary data from another three. Meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated with a random effects model. Results Compared with placebo, blood pressure lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced eGFR (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P=1.00 for homogeneity). The results were similar irrespective of whether blood pressure was reduced by regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics/\u03b2 blockers. There was no evidence that the effects of different drug classes on major cardiovascular events varied between patients with different eGFR (all P>0.60 for homogeneity). Conclusions Blood pressure lowering is an effective strategy for preventing cardiovascular events among people with moderately reduced eGFR. There is little evidence from these overviews to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease.",

        "title": "Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial",
        "abstract": "Background Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin\u2013angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. Methods The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke. Results The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.",

Design Population based cohort study using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting UK primary care, 1997-2014. Participants Patients starting treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (n=122\u2009363). Main outcome measures Poisson regression was used to compare rates of end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death among patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more after starting treatment against those without such increases, and for each 10% increase in creatinine. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of other antihypertensive drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Results Among the 2078 (1.7%) patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more, a higher proportion were female, were elderly, had cardiorenal comorbidity, and used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop diuretics, or potassium sparing diuretics. Creatinine increases of 30% or more were associated with an increased adjusted incidence rate ratio for all outcomes, compared with increases of less than 30%: 3.43 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 4.91) for end stage renal disease, 1.46 (1.16 to 1.84) for myocardial infarction, 1.37 (1.14 to 1.65) for heart failure, and 1.84 (1.65 to 2.05) for death. The detailed categorisation of increases in creatinine concentrations (<10%, 10-19%, 20-29%, 30-39%, and \u226540%) showed a graduated relation for all outcomes (all P values for trends <0.001). Notably, creatinine increases of less than 30% were also associated with increased incidence rate ratios for all outcomes, including death (1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) for increases of 10-19% and 1.35 (1.23 to 1.49) for increases of 20-29%, using <10% as reference). Results were consistent across calendar periods, across subgroups of patients, and among continuing users. Conclusions Increases in creatinine after the start of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment were associated with adverse cardiorenal outcomes in a graduated relation, even below the guideline recommended threshold of a 30% increase for stopping treatment.",

        "title": "Severe acute interstitial nephritis induced by valsartan",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can increase serum creatinine or potassium levels in patients with renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis, heart failure or hypovolemia, but hardly cause severe kidney injury in patients without any risk factors. A case of severe acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) induced by valsartan was reported here. Patient concerns: A 62-year-old female with nausea for 1 month and acute deterioration of kidney function for 2 weeks was admitted. She had a history of hypertension for 5 months and had taken valsartan 40\u200amg daily for 4 months. Although the valsartan had been stopped for 2 weeks, the serum creatinine continuously increased after admission. Kidney biopsy demonstrated the eosinophils infiltration in interstitium. Diagnoses: AIN induced by valsartan. Interventions: The patient was treated with glucocorticoid. Outcomes: The serum creatinine decreased gradually and got back to normal level 5 months later. Then therapy of glucocorticoid was stopped. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by computed tomography angiography (CTA). Lessons: Although valsartan-induced allergy has been reported previously, AIN was firstly recognized as a severe complication of this drug. We suggest when there is a ARB-associated continuous deterioration of kidney function for patients without renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis, heart failure or hypovolemia, AIN should be thought of and therapy with glucocorticoid should be considered if necessary.",

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Lowering blood pressure (BP) can lead to an initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). However, there is debate how much eGFR decline is acceptable. We performed a post hoc analysis of ACCORD-BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure) and SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which randomized patients to intensive or standard systolic BP-targets. We determined the relation between initial decline in mean arterial pressure and eGFR. Subsequently, we stratified patients to BP-target and initial eGFR decrease and assessed the relation with annual eGFR decline after 1 year. A total of 13 266 patients with 41 126 eGFR measurements were analyzed. Up to 10 mm Hg of BP-lowering, eGFR did not change. Hereafter, there was a linear decrease of 3.4% eGFR (95% CI, 2.9%\u20133.9%) per 10 mm Hg mean arterial pressure decrease. The observed eGFR decline based on 95% of the subjects varied from 26% after 0 mm Hg to 46% with a 40 mm Hg mean arterial pressure decrease. There was no difference in eGFR slope (P=0.37) according to initial eGFR decline and BP-target, with a decrease of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.09\u20131.39), 1.20 (95% CI, 0.97\u20131.43), and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.77\u20131.50) in the 5%, 5% to 20%, and >20% stratum during intensive and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.81\u20131.09), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.97\u20131.49), and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.65\u20131.69) mL/minute per 1.73 m2 per year during standard treatment. In patients at high cardiovascular risk with and without diabetes mellitus, we found no association between initial eGFR and annual eGFR decline during BP-lowering treatment. Our results support that an eGFR decrease up to 20% after BP lowering can be accepted and suggest that the limit can be extended up to 46% depending on the achieved BP reduction.

        "abstract": "Background: The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are promising treatments in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of the non-steroidal MRAs (finerenone, apararenone, esaxerenone) and detect the differences among them. Methods: We searched several databases for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating non-steroidal MRAs versus placebo in patients with CKD and T2D. We performed a conventional meta-analysis separately, and then indirect comparisons for efficacy and safety outcomes were conducted among these included drugs. Results: Eight RCTs with 14,450 subjects were enrolled. In patients with CKD and T2D, a greater reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (WMD \u22120.40, 95% CI \u22120.48 to \u22120.32, p < 0.001), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (WMD \u22122.69, 95% CI \u22124.47 to \u22120.91, p = 0.003), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD \u22124.84, 95% CI \u22125.96 to \u22123.72, p < 0.001) and a higher risk of hyperkalemia (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.30, p < 0.001) were observed in the non-steroidal MRAs versus placebo; there is no significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events between two groups (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79, p = 0.067). Compared with finerenone, esaxerenone showed no significant difference in UACR reduction (WMD 0.24, 95% CI \u22120.016 to 0.496, p = 0.869); apararenone and esaxerenone showed greater decreases in SBP (WMD 1.37, 95% CI 0.456 to 2.284, p = 0.010; WMD 3.11, 95% CI 0.544 to 5,676, p = 0.021). Conclusions: Despite the moderate increased risk of hyperkalemia, use of non-steroidal MRAs could reduce proteinuria and SBP in patients with CKD and T2D. In terms of renoprotection, esaxerenone and finerenone may have similar effects. Esaxerenone and apararenone may have better antihypertensive effects than finerenone. The head-to-head RCTs are still needed to compare the differences of the efficacy and safety in these non-steroidal MRAs.",
