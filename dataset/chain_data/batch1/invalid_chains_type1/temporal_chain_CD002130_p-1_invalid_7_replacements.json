        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPlatelets are believed to play a part in the ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty, such as abrupt closure of the coronary vessel during or soon after the procedure. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

        "title": "Anti-GPIIb/IIIa Drugs: Current Strategies and Future Directions",
        "abstract": "Summary Three platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists have been approved as adjunctive therapy to decrease the ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and/or unstable angina. They include the chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody 7E3 Fab fragment (abciximab), a cyclic heptapeptide based on the KGD amino acid sequence (eptifibatide), and a nonpeptide mimetic of the RGD sequence (tirofiban). The agents are very effective in providing both short-term and long-term benefit after PCI, and one agent has also demonstrated a progressive long-term mortality benefit. The long-term mortality benefit is highly cost-effective when compared to other medical interventions. The benefits in treating unstable angina without PCI are less dramatic and robust, with some agents providing no benefit. Severe thrombocytopenia is an infrequent, but potentially serious, complication of therapy with all of the agents. The risk of major bleeding is increased only minimally or not at all by the drugs. Currently, a number of new indications for GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are under study, including acute myocardial infarction (\u00b1 thrombolytic therapy, \u00b1 PCI) and stroke. In addition to their impact on improving outcome, the results of clinical trials with these agents provide crucial insights into the contribution of GPIIb/IIIa-mediated platelet function in the pathophysiology of thrombotic vascular disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAs compared with thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in acute myocardial infarction reduces the rates of death, reinfarction, and stroke, but recurrent ischemia, restenosis, and reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. When used in combination with PTCA, coronary stenting and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may further improve outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 2082 patients with acute myocardial infarction to undergo PTCA alone (518 patients), PTCA plus abciximab therapy (528), stenting alone with the MultiLink stent (512), or stenting plus abciximab therapy (524).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNormal flow was restored in the target vessel in 94.5 to 96.9 percent of patients and did not vary according to the reperfusion strategy. At six months, the primary end point - a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel - had occurred in 20.0 percent of patients after PTCA, 16.5 percent after PTCA plus abciximab, 11.5 percent after stenting, and 10.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab (P<0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups in the rates of death, stroke, or reinfarction; the difference in the incidence of the primary end point was due entirely to differences in the rates of target-vessel revascularization (ranging from 15.7 percent after PTCA to 5.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab, P<0.001). The rate of angiographically established restenosis was 40.8 percent after PTCA and 22.2 percent after stenting (P<0.001), and the respective rates of reocclusion of the infarcted-related artery were 11.3 percent and 5.7 percent (P=0.01), both independent of abciximab use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt experienced centers, stent implantation (with or without abciximab therapy) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of coronary artery stents in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nThe review was conducted following accepted guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials that include comparisons of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) versus PTCA with stent, stent versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and drug-eluting stents (DES) versus non-DES in patients with CAD in native or graft vessels and those with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and unstable angina were also included. Data on the following outcome measures were included in the review: combined event rate or event-free survival, death, acute myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation, repeat treatment (PTCA, stent or CABG) and binary restenosis. An economic model was developed based on extrapolation of trends in mortality and revascularisation from clinical trials data to a 5-year time horizon.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 50 studies comparing the use of stents with PTCA, six comparing stents with CABG and 12 comparing DES eluting stents with non-DES. No studies were identified that compared DES with PTCA or DES with CABG. Existing quality of life data suggest that revascularisation procedures reduce the patient's quality of life for a short period only. Stents were found to be more effective than PTCA in preventing adverse events and revascularisations. In multiple-vessel disease there was no evidence of a difference in mortality (at 1 year) between patients treated surgically and those receiving a stent. Patients treated surgically required fewer revascularisations. There is no evidence of a difference in mortality between patients receiving DES and those treated with bare metal stents at 1 year. A reduction in event rate at 9 and 12 months was found in patients treated with DES. This event rate is primarily made up of increased revascularisation rates in patients treated with bare metal stents. Two-year outcome data from one study indicate that this benefit of DES continues over the longer term. The economic model proved sufficient to indicate long-term trends in cost-effectiveness. CABG was found initially to be more expensive than bare metal stenting in multivessel disease and may have higher immediate risks, but over time the cost differential is reduced and long-term outcomes favour CABG over stenting. A similar situation was found for DES versus CABG in multiple-vessel disease. However, DES may not generally be considered a cost-effective alternative to bare metal stenting in single-vessel disease by policy makers as substantially higher costs are involved with a very small outcome benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDES might be considered cost-effective if the additional cost (compared with ordinary stents) was substantially reduced, the outcome benefits from the use of DES were much improved, and/or its use were targeted on the subgroups of patients with the highest risks of requiring reintervention. Long-term clinical studies are needed that focus on significant outcomes such as mortality. Further research should consider: the differences among plain stents; head-to-head comparisons within DES, CABG compared with DES; and the evaluation of newer non-DES against DES. Evaluation of the effects of revascularisation procedures and especially repeat revascularisation procedures on the patient's quality of life would also be useful, as would the development and testing of risk assessment tools to identify patients likely to need further revascularisations.",

        "abstract": "For the past two decades coronary artery bypass grafting has been the standard treatment for patients with severe multivessel ischaemic heart disease.1 In the past few years, however, it has been increasingly challenged by percutaneous coronary intervention. Indeed, in many parts of the developed world percutaneous coronary intervention is done twice as often as coronary artery bypass grafting. Why has this change in practice occurred? I believe that it is not evidence based, does not represent best value for money, and that patients are not appropriately informed of its limitations.\n\nCoronary artery bypass grafting is probably the most intensively studied surgical procedure, with follow up data extending over 20 years.2 It is highly effective in relieving the symptoms of ischaemic heart disease and improving life expectancy in patients with certain anatomical patterns of disease; these benefits are magnified in patients with more severe disease and with impaired left ventricular function.1 Furthermore, coronary artery bypass grafting is remarkably safe. Improvements in medical, anaesthetic, and surgical management have ensured that hospital mortality has remained around 2% over the past decade despite the treatment being used in older and sicker patients.3\n\nOn the other hand, \u2026",

        "abstract": "No recent pharmaceutical or medical device has generated as much ongoing and expanding attention as drug-eluting stents (DES). In fact there has been an explosion of published reports on the topic within cardiology, medical, surgical and subspecialty journals. The device industry has repeatedly sent their own summaries of information directly to physicians, while mainstream media has kept the consumer and Wall Street appraised of safety concerns, often with sensational headlines. The Food and Drug Administration has also taken notice by convening a meeting on DES in late 2006. What have we learned through all this dissemination of data?\n\nArticle p 745 \n\nThe introduction of DES was greeted with intense enthusiasm in a \u201cperfect storm\u201d sort of way. Device representatives were eager to promote this new product that could dramatically reduce restenosis.1 Patients expected to be treated with this new and \u201cbetter\u201d technology. Lastly, cardiologists had a potent new tool at their disposal that they increasingly incorporated into practice until it became the default revascularization device instead of bare-metal stents in many parts of the world. This quick and widespread adoption in DES resulted in its frequent use in relatively untested and off-label indications. At the Cleveland Clinic, the use of DES mirrored the community and many interventional practices throughout the world, where the penetration of this device peaked at >90%.\n\nWhile DES use was increasing, McFadden and colleagues sounded an alarm with the publication of a report on 4 patients who experienced late stent thrombosis.2 Although this could have been a chance finding, DES were systematically shown to confer an increased risk of late thrombosis relative to bare-metal stents.3 This safety issue has been confirmed by several independent analyses with patient-level data from the pivotal randomized trials.1,4,5\n\nStent thrombosis is uncommon, although when it occurs it \u2026",

        "abstract": "Coronary artery disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Over the last 30 years, the development of coronary artery angioplasty and stenting has drastically reduced mortality during acute coronary syndromes while also reducing symptoms of chronic coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, the placement of stents in a coronary artery can be complicated by in-stent thrombosis or restenosis. In 2003\u20132004, a new generation of stents was introduced to the market with the goal of reducing the rate of restenosis. These stents, called drug eluting stents (DES), are coated with a pharmacological agent designed to reduce the neointimal hyperplasia associated with restenosis. Within a year, approximately 80% of all percutaneous coronary interventions performed within the US involved placement of a DES. In 2006, a controversy arose about the possibility of a statistically significant increased risk of acute stent thrombosis associated with DES especially when used for an \u201coff label\u201d indication. This risk was attributed to delayed endothelization. This controversy has led to a reduction in the use of DES along with longer use of dual platelet inhibition with aspirin and clopidogrel.

Methods and Results\u2014 Consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for ULMD had prospective platelet reactivity assessment by light transmittance aggregometry after a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel. The primary end point of the study was cardiac mortality, and the secondary end point was stent thrombosis. From January 2005 to September 2008, 215 consecutive patients were treated with DES for ULMD. The incidence of HRPR after clopidogrel loading was 18.6%. The median follow-up was 19.3 months. The overall estimated 1-, 2- and 3-year cardiac mortality rate was 3.9\u00b11.3%, 7.5\u00b12.2%, and 12.2\u00b13.4%, respectively.

The 3-year stent thrombosis rate was 4.2\u00b11.8% in the low residual platelet reactivity group and 16.0\u00b17.3% in the HRPR group (P=0.021). By forward stepwise regression analysis, HRPR after clopidogrel loading was the only independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio, 3.82; 95% confidence interval,1.38 to 10.54; P=0.010) and stent thrombosis (hazard ratio, 3.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 12.09; P=0.031). Conclusions\u2014 HRPR after 600-mg clopidogrel loading is a strong marker of increased risk of cardiac death and DES thrombosis in patients receiving DES stenting for ULMD. Routine assessment of in vitro residual platelet reactivity after clopidogrel loading in patients with ULMD potentially suitable for DES-supported percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered to guide patient care decisions.",

        "title": "High platelet reactivity and clinical outcome \u2013 Fact and fiction",
        "abstract": "Summary In patients suffering from acute coronary syndromes or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, oral antiplatelet treatment is routinely administered with the primary aim of inhibiting platelet-mediated thrombus formation and subsequent abrupt vessel occlusion. Simultaneous inhibition of blood platelet cyclooxygenase-1 by aspirin and of the P2Y12 receptor by clopidogrel or prasugrel is currently recommended in this setting. Inter-individual response variability to aspirin and especially to clopidogrel is the subject of much debate as evidence has grown over the years linking an attenuated response to treatment with the occurrence of ischaemic events. Consequently, the clinical entity of high (on-treatment) platelet reactivity (HPR) was born and subsequently characterised in numerous studies over the last decade. Until recently, alternative treatment options were limited in patients exhibiting HPR. At present the antiplatelet therapy landscape is changing with the advent of prasugrel and ticagrelor as alternative and more potent treatment options. Different tests for monitoring platelet function are available and are being increasingly employed in research projects and clinical routine. These tests may prove useful for achieving optimal platelet inhibition for the individual patient, and several centres now incorporate such testing in day-to-day practice. Widespread adoption of this practice and incorporation into clinical guidelines awaits the results of ongoing trials in which treatment is changed based on platelet function monitoring. This review aims to summarise available facts and fiction in relation to platelet function testing and reactivity with a particular focus on P2Y12 receptor inhibition in patients undergoing coronary stent placement.",

Patients undergoing these treatments may be receiving exogenous anticoagulants and antithrombotics. Even though the risk of major bleeding is very small, the consequences can be catastrophic. However, the role of antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease to decrease the incidence of acute cerebral and cardiovascular events is also crucial. Overall, there is a paucity of literature on the subject of bleeding risk in interventional pain management along with practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and anti-thrombotic therapy.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nBest evidence synthesis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo critically appraise and synthesize the literature with assessment of the bleeding risk of interventional techniques including practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe available literature on the bleeding risk of interventional techniques and practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was reviewed. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 through December 2012 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients who discontinue antithrombotic therapy, spontaneous epidural hematomas occur with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy associated with stressors such as chiropractic manipulation, diving, and anatomic abnormalities such as ankylosing spondylitis, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques. There is fair evidence that excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation may occur with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon is higher than the risk of epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques, to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal], and Aggrenox [aspirin and dipyridamole]), and that anatomic conditions such as spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis, and procedures involving the cervical spine; multiple attempts; and large bore needles increase the risk of epidural hematoma; and rapid assessment and surgical or nonsurgical intervention to manage patients with epidural hematoma can avoid permanent neurological complications. There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), or prasugrel (Effient) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities. There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas during interventional techniques and to continue to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe recommendations derived from the comprehensive assessment of the literature and guidelines are to continue NSAIDs and low dose aspirin, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole, cilostazol, Aggrenox) during interventional techniques. However, the recommendations for discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) is variable with clinical judgment to continue or discontinue based on the patient's condition, the planned procedure, risk factors, and desires, and the cardiologist's opinion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin may be discontinued 12 hours prior to performing interventional techniques. Warfarin should be discontinued or international normalized ratio (INR) be normalized to 1.4 or less for high risk procedures and 2 or less for low risk procedures based on risk factors. It is also recommended to discontinue Pradaxa for 24 hours for paravertebral interventional techniques in 2 to 4 days for epidural interventions in patients with normal renal function and for longer periods of time in patients with renal impairment, and to discontinue rivaroxaban for 24 hours prior to performing interventional techniques.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\u00a0 The paucity of the literature.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the available literature including guidelines, the recommendations in patients with antithrombotic therapy for therapy prior to interventional techniques are provided.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiplatelet resistance is known to be associated with symptomatic ischemic complication after endovascular coil embolization. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the relationship between antiplatelet resistance and clinically silent thromboembolic complications using DWI in patients who underwent coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2011 and May 2013, 58 patients with 62 unruptured aneurysms who were measured for antiplatelet response using VerifyNow assay and underwent elective coil embolization for an unruptured aneurysm with posttreatment DWI were enrolled. Diffusion-positive lesions were classified into 3 groups according to the number of lesions (n = 0 [grade 0], n < 6 [grade I], and n \u2265 6 [grade II]). The relationship between antiplatelet resistance and diffusion-positive lesions was analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two endovascular coiling procedures were performed on 58 patients. Clopidogrel resistance was revealed in 23 patients (39.7%) and diffusion-positive lesions were demonstrated in 28 patients (48.3%); these consisted of 19 (32.8%) grade I and 9 (15.5%) grade II lesions. Clopidogrel resistance was not relevant to the development of any diffusion-positive lesion (grade I and II, P = .789) but was associated with the development of multiple diffusion-positive lesions (grade II, P = .002). In the logistic regression prediction model, clopidogrel resistance showed significant correlation with the development of grade II lesions (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple diffusion-positive lesions (\u22656 in number) occurred more frequently in patients with clopidogrel resistance after endovascular coiling for unruptured aneurysms.",

        "title": "Association between Postprocedural Infarction and Antiplatelet Drug Resistance after Coiling for Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Procedure-related thromboembolism is a major limitation of coil embolization, but the relationship between thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet resistance is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to verify the association between immediate postprocedural thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet drug resistance after endovascular coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 338 aneurysms between October 2012 and March 2015. All patients underwent postprocedural MR imaging within 48 hours after endovascular coil embolization. Antiplatelet drug resistance was checked a day before the procedure by using the VerifyNow system. Abnormal antiplatelet response was defined as >550 aspirin response units and >240 P2Y12 receptor reaction units. In addition, we explored the optimal cutoff values of aspirin response units and P2Y12 receptor reaction units. The primary outcome was radiologic infarction based on postprocedural MR imaging. RESULTS: Among 338 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 134 (39.6%) showed diffusion-positive lesions on postprocedural MR imaging, and 32 (9.5%) and 105 (31.1%) had abnormal aspirin response unit and P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values, respectively. Radiologic infarction was associated with advanced age (65 years and older, P = .024) only with defined abnormal antiplatelet response (aspirin response units \u2265 550, P2Y12 receptor reaction units \u2265 240). P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values in the top 10th percentile (>294) were associated with radiologic infarction (P = .003). With this cutoff value, age (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.28\u20134.08), P2Y12 receptor reaction units (>294; OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.53\u20137.71), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04\u20134.02) were associated with radiologic infarction in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic infarction after coiling for unruptured aneurysm was closely associated with age. Only very high P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values (>294) predicted postprocedural infarction. Further controlled studies are needed to determine the precise cutoff values, which could provide information regarding the optimal antiplatelet regimen for aneurysm coiling.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe use of antiplatelet medications to prevent thrombosis in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms with stents has become widely emphasized.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare low-dose prasugrel with clopidogrel in stent-assisted coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a retrospective review of 311 aneurysms from 297 patients who underwent stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysm between November 2014 and March 2017. Thromboembolic and hemorrhagic adverse events were compared between 207 patients who received low-dose prasugrel (PSG group) and 90 patients who received clopidogrel (CPG group).\n\n\nRESULTS\nP2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values were significantly lower in the PSG group (PSG group vs CPG group, 132.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076.9 vs 238.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069.1; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001); the percentage of inhibition was also statistically higher in the PSG group (54.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.0% vs 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Thromboembolic events occurred less frequently in the PSG group than in the CPG group (0.9% vs 6.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01), whereas there was no significant difference in the percentage of hemorrhagic complications (0.5% vs 2.2%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.22). In the multivariate analysis, clopidogrel as the antiplatelet medication was the sole significant risk factor for thromboembolism in this series of patients undergoing stent-assisted coil embolization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUse of low-dose PSG as an antiplatelet premedication is quick, effective, and safe for stent-assisted coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Prasugrel premedication significantly lowered the frequency of thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.",

        "title": "Anti-thrombogenic coatings for devices in neurointerventional surgery: Case report and review of the literature",
        "abstract": "Background: Stent-assisted coiling and extra-saccular flow diversion require dual anti-platelet therapy due to the thrombogenic properties of the implants. While both methods are widely accepted, thromboembolic complications and the detrimental effects of dual anti-platelet therapy remain a concern. Anti-thrombogenic surface coatings aim to solve both of these issues. Current developments are discussed within the framework of an actual clinical case. Case description: A 33-year-old male patient lost consciousness while doing sport and was administered 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid on site. Computed tomography revealed a massive subarachnoid haemorrhage, and digital subtraction angiography showed an aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery. Stent-assisted coiling using a neck bridging device with a hydrophilic coating (pCONUS_HPC) was considered as an appropriate approach. Another 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid IV was given. After the single anti-platelet therapy was seen to be effective, a pCONUS_HPC was implanted, and the aneurysm sac subsequently fully occluded using coils. No thrombus formation was encountered. During the following days, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009500 mg acetylsalicylic acid IV daily were required to maintain single anti-platelet therapy, monitored by frequent response testing. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography after 13 days confirmed the occlusion of the aneurysm and the patency of the middle cerebral artery. Conclusion: A variety of ways to reduce the thrombogenicity of neurovascular stents is discussed. Hydrophilic surface coatings are a valid concept to improve the haemocompatibility of neurovascular implants while avoiding the use of dual anti-platelet therapy. Phosphorylcholine and phenox hydrophilic polymer coating are currently the most promising candidates. This concept is supported by anecdotal experience. However, formalised registries and randomised trials are currently being established.",

        "title": "Reduction of thromboembolic complications during the endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms by employing a tailored dual antiplatelet regimen using aspirin and prasugrel",
        "abstract": "Background Thromboembolic complications (TECs) are frequent during the endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms. To prevent TECs, dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for the perioperative period. In patients with a poor response, clopidogrel is a risk factor for TECs. To prevent TECs, our study assessed the stratified use of prasugrel. Methods Patients who underwent endovascular therapy for unruptured cerebral aneurysms from April 2017 to August 2019 were enrolled in this clinical study and given premedication with aspirin and clopidogrel for 2 weeks prior to the procedure. P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) were measured using the VerifyNow assay on the day before the procedure (tailored group). In subgroups with PRU <240, the clopidogrel dose was maintained (CPG subgroup). In subgroups with PRU \u2265240, clopidogrel was changed to prasugrel (PSG subgroup). We compared the occurrence of TECs with retrospective consecutive cases from January 2015 to March 2017 without PRU assessments (non-tailored group). The frequency of TECs within 30 days was assessed as the primary endpoint. Results The tailored and non-tailored groups comprised 167 and 50 patients, respectively. TECs occurred in 11 (6.6%) and 8 (16%) patients in the tailored and non-tailored groups (P=0.048), respectively. The HR for TECs was significantly reduced in the tailored group (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.81); P=0.017) compared with the non-tailored group. Conclusion The results suggest that tailored dual antiplatelet therapy medication with PRU significantly reduces the frequency of TECs without increasing hemorrhagic complications.",

        "title": "Factors influencing early obliteration during flow diverter treatment of cerebral aneurysms: Establishment of an early obliteration inhibition score",
        "abstract": "Objective: This retrospective study aimed to investigate factors associated with inhibition of early aneurysm obliteration after flow diverter (FD) treatment. We also created the early obliteration inhibition (EOI) score for pre-operative evaluation. Methods: We examined 110 cerebral aneurysms in 104 patients who underwent FD treatment. The following parameters were investigated: age, sex, symptoms, aneurysm location and type, maximum aneurysm diameter, parent vessel diameter, neck diameter, and dome\u2013neck ratio. We also noted aneurysm location relative to the curvature of the parent artery and any branches arising from the aneurysm dome. Procedural factors such as FD diameter and length, number of FDs placed, type of FD, and use of adjunctive coiling were also investigated. Aneurysm obliteration was evaluated using digital subtraction angiography 3 months after the procedure. Adequate obliteration was defined as grade C or D on the O\u2019Kelly\u2013Marotta scale. Results: The following factors inhibited early obliteration: 1) extradural location, 2) saccular aneurysm, 3) aneurysm neck located at the outer convexity of the parent artery, and 4) arterial branch arising from the aneurysm dome. Odds ratios were used to create an EOI score. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off EOI score for adequate obliteration was 1.5 (area under the curve, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.73\u20130.9; sensitivity, 0.9; specificity, 0.57). Conclusion: The EOI score, which is based on factors that inhibit early obliteration, may predict early treatment outcomes of FD placement.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe optimal duration for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stent-assisted coiling (SAC) of intracranial aneurysms is unclear. Longer-term therapy may reduce thrombotic complications but increase the risk of bleeding complications.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review of prospectively maintained data at 12 institutions was conducted on patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who underwent SAC between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020, and were followed \u22656 months postprocedure. The type and duration of DAPT, stent(s) used, outcome, length of follow-up, complication rates, and incidence of significant in-stent stenosis (ISS) were collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 556 patients reviewed, 450 met all inclusion criteria. Nine patients treated with DAPT <29 days after SAC and 11 treated for 43-89 days were excluded from the final analysis as none completed their prescribed duration of treatment. Eighty patients received short-term DAPT. There were no significant differences in the rate of thrombotic complications during predefined periods of risk in the short, medium, or long-term treatment groups (1/80, 1.3%; 2/188, 1.1%; and 0/162, 0%, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found in the rate of hemorrhagic complications during period of risk in any group (0/80, 0%; 3/188, 1.6%; and 1/162, 0.6%, respectively). Longer duration DAPT did not reduce ISS risk in any group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuing DAPT >42 days after SAC did not reduce the risk of thrombotic complications or in-stent stenosis, although the risk of additional hemorrhagic complications remained low. It may be reasonable to discontinue DAPT after 42 days following non-flow diverting SAC of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.",
