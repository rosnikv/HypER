        "title": "A randomized clinical trial of ursodeoxycholic acid as adjuvant treatment to prevent liver transplant rejection",
        "abstract": "Acute rejection following orthotopic liver transplantation is a common problem despite current immunosuppressive regimens. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown in small, open\u2010labeled studies to prevent rejection episodes, although its effects on complications such as infections, length of hospital stay, and survival have not been evaluated. We conducted a randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind trial to determine if UDCA (10\u201015 mg/kg/d) added to a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen was associated with a decrease in the incidence of at least one episode of acute cellular rejection. Secondary end\u2010points included determining differences in the total number of rejection episodes, the use of muromonab\u2010CD3, the incidence of infections, length of hospital stay, and survival at 90 days and 1 year. Fifty\u2010two patients were randomized, 28 to the treatment group and 24 to the placebo group. During the 3 months of the trial, there was no difference between the placebo and UDCA groups in the number of patients who were rejection\u2010free; however, there were significantly fewer patients in the treatment group who had multiple episodes of acute rejection (0 vs. 6; P = .007). Patients in the treatment group experienced a significantly lower incidence of bacterial infections (4% vs. 29%; P = .02), shorter hospital stay (25 days vs. 34 days; P = .03), and better 90\u2010day survival (100% vs. 83%; P= .04) and 1\u2010year survival (93% vs. 79%). The addition of UDCA to a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen results in significantly fewer patients experiencing multiple episodes of rejection and improved survival at 90 days and at 1 year. The use of UDCA as adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing liver transplantation who are treated with a cyclosporine\u2010based immunosuppressive regimen should be considered.",

        "abstract": "As ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) delays the need for transplantation, this could result in patients with more comorbid disease, therefore more likely to have a worse outcome posttransplantation. The aim of this study is to compare posttransplantation outcome in patients who received UDCA versus placebo who subsequently required a liver transplant. Data on all trial patients referred for transplantation were retrospectively collected from three randomized controlled trials of UDCA in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted with patients assigned to their original treatment allocation. UDCA and placebo groups were compared at trial entry, transplant referral, just before transplantation, and 1 month and 1 year posttransplantation. From 1987 to 1996, 37 UDCA-treated and 53 placebo patients were referred for transplantation; their age, sex, and serum bilirubin levels were similar at study entry. Immediately before transplantation, these two groups were again similar with respect to age, bilirubin level, Mayo risk score, and serum creatinine level. Posttransplantation survival rates at 1 month were 93.9% in the UDCA group and 88.4% in the placebo group, and 1 year survival rates were 90.3% and 78.4%, respectively (not significant). Posttransplantation, the two groups had similar rates of infection (53.9% v 58%); however, rejection occurred significantly less often in the UDCA group; 42.9% versus 68. 8% in the placebo group (P =.04). The posttransplantation outcome of UDCA-treated patients with PBC is no different from those who were administered placebo. There is no evidence to suggest the beneficial effect of UDCA in delaying the need for transplantation is associated with a worse outcome once liver transplantation becomes necessary.",

We report a case\u2010control cohort study to determine the incidence and microbiologic profile of bilomas and risk factors for biloma formation in 492 patients undergoing liver transplantation from 1994 to 2001. Fifty\u2010seven patients (11.5%) developed one or more bilomas; 95% in the first year post\u2010transplantation. The most common initial infecting pathogens were enterococci (37%), one\u2010half resistant to vancomycin (VRE); coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci (26%); and Candida species (26%). Infection by coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci was strongly associated with the presence of a T\u2010tube (OR 9.60, p = 0.02). In stepwise logistic regression multivariable analyses, hepatic artery thrombosis (OR 90.9, p < 0.0001), hepatic artery stenosis (OR 13.2, p < 0.0001) and Roux\u2010en\u2010Y choledochojejunostomy (OR 5.8, p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for biloma formation; ursodeoxycholic acid use was highly protective (OR 0.1, p = 0.002). Strategies to prevent biloma formation must focus on measures to prevent hepatic artery thrombosis and colonization of liver transplant patients by multiresistant nosocomial pathogens. T\u2010tube drainage post\u2010transplantation bears reassessment.

Here we report a case of hepatic artery thrombosis in a liver recipient whose native and donor livers were heterozygous for FVL. The patient subsequently underwent a successful retransplant.

        "abstract": "Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most common vascular complication after liver transplantation; it has been reported to occur in 2% to 5% of liver transplant recipients. Most reports of HAT in the literature describe single\u2010center series with small numbers of patients and lack the power to definitively identify nontechnical risk factors. We used the United Network for Organ Sharing database of adult deceased donor liver transplants from 1987 to 2006 to identify 1246 patients with graft loss from HAT. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify donor and graft risk factors for HAT\u2010induced graft loss. Although most donor predictors of HAT\u2010induced graft loss were surrogates for vessel size, donor age > 50 years was also a significant predictor of graft loss from HAT (relative risk = 1.45, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the risk of graft loss from HAT increased progressively with each decade of donor age > 50 years, such that a 61% increased risk of HAT\u2010related graft loss (relative risk = 1.61, P < 0.001) was associated with donor age > 70 years. A separate analysis of risk factors for early HAT graft loss (\u226490 days) and late HAT graft loss (> 90 days) found that older donor age was associated with increased late HAT graft loss. These findings are of interest in an era of ongoing organ shortages requiring maximum utilization of potential allografts and increasing allocation of older allografts.

The aim of this study was to determine whether changes in clinical practice in the era of the Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has affected biliary complications after liver transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed all deceased donor liver transplants at a single center. Patients were categorized as pre\u2010 or post\u2010MELD (transplant before or after February 28, 2002). A total of 1798 recipients underwent deceased donor liver transplants. Biliary stricture was more common in the post\u2010MELD era (15.4% versus 6.4%, P < 0.001). The strongest risk factors for stricture development were donor age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01), presence of a prior bile leak (OR = 2.24), use of choledochocholedochostomy (OR = 2.22), and the post\u2010MELD era (OR = 2.30).

Surgical factors did not influence the biliary complication rate. In conclusion, even when employing multivariate analysis to allow for factors that may influence biliary strictures, transplant in the post\u2010MELD era was an independent predictor for stricture development.

        "abstract": "Because of the shortage of deceased donor organs, transplant centers accept organs from marginal deceased donors, including older donors. Organ\u2010specific donor risk indices have been developed to predict graft survival with various combinations of donor and recipient characteristics. Here we review the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) and the liver donor risk index (LDRI) and compare and contrast their strengths, limitations, and potential uses. The KDRI has a potential role in developing new kidney allocation algorithms. The LDRI allows a greater appreciation of the importance of donor factors, particularly for hepatitis C virus\u2013positive recipients; as the donor risk index increases, the rates of allograft and patient survival among these recipients decrease disproportionately. The use of livers with high donor risk indices is associated with increased hospital costs that are independent of recipient risk factors, and the transplantation of livers with high donor risk indices into patients with Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease scores < 15 is associated with lower allograft survival; the use of the LDRI has limited this practice. Significant regional variations in donor quality, as measured by the LDRI, remain in the United States. We also review other potential indices for liver transplantation, including donor\u2010recipient matching and the retransplant donor risk index. Although substantial progress has been made in developing donor risk indices to objectively assess donor variables that affect transplant outcomes, continued efforts are warranted to improve these indices to enhance organ allocation policies and optimize allograft survival.

        "abstract": "Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion might allow viability assessment of livers before transplantation. Perfusion characteristics were studied in 47 liver perfusions, of which 22 resulted in transplants. Hepatocellular damage was reflected in the perfusate transaminase concentrations, which correlated with posttransplant peak transaminase levels. Lactate clearance occurred within 3 hours in 46 of 47 perfusions, and glucose rose initially during perfusion in 44. Three livers required higher levels of bicarbonate support to maintain physiological pH, including one developing primary nonfunction. Bile production did not correlate with viability or cholangiopathy, but bile pH, measured in 16 of the 22 transplanted livers, identified three livers that developed cholangiopathy (peak pH < 7.4) from those that did not (pH > 7.5). In the 11 research livers where it could be studied, bile pH > 7.5 discriminated between the 6 livers exhibiting >50% circumferential stromal necrosis of septal bile ducts and 4 without necrosis; one liver with 25\u201050% necrosis had a maximum pH 7.46.

        "abstract": "Ex-situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of transplant kidneys allows assessment of kidney quality and targeted intervention to initiate repair processes prior to transplantation. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to possess the capacity to stimulate kidney repair. Therefore, the combination of NMP and MSC therapy offers potential to repair transplant kidneys. It is however unknown how NMP conditions affect MSC. In this study the effect of NMP perfusion fluid on survival, metabolism and function of thawed cryopreserved human (h)MSC and porcine (p)MSC in suspension conditions was studied. Suspension conditions reduced the viability of pMSC by 40% in both perfusion fluid and culture medium. Viability of hMSC was reduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid, whilst no differences were found in survival in culture medium. Under adherent conditions, survival of the cells was not affected by perfusion fluid. The perfusion fluid did not affect survival of fresh MSC in suspension compared to the control culture medium. The freeze-thawing process impaired the survival of hMSC; 95% survival of fresh hMSC compared to 70% survival of thawed hMSC. Moreover, thawed MSC showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species, which indicates elevated levels of oxidative stress, and reduced mitochondrial activity, which implies reduced metabolism. The adherence of pMSC and hMSC to endothelial cells was reduced after the thawing process, effect which was particularly profound in in the perfusion fluid. To summarize, we observed that conditions required for machine perfusion are influencing the behavior of MSC. The freeze-thawing process reduces survival and metabolism and increases oxidative stress, and diminishes their ability to adhere to endothelial cells. In addition, we found that hMSC and pMSC behaved differently, which has to be taken into consideration when translating results from animal experiments to clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Organ transplantation is undergoing profound changes. Contraindications for donation have been revised in order to better meet the organ demand. The use of lower-quality organs and organs with greater preoperative damage, including those from donation after cardiac death (DCD), has become an established routine but increases the risk of graft malfunction. This risk is further aggravated by ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in the process of transplantation. These circumstances demand a preservation technology that ameliorates IRI and allows for assessment of viability and function prior to transplantation. Oxygenated hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (MP) have emerged as valid novel modalities for advanced organ preservation and conditioning. Ex vivo prolonged lung preservation has resulted in successful transplantation of high-risk donor lungs. Normothermic MP of hearts and livers has displayed safe (heart) and superior (liver) preservation in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Normothermic kidney preservation for 24 h was recently established. Early clinical outcomes beyond the market entry trials indicate bioenergetics reconditioning, improved preservation of structures subject to IRI, and significant prolongation of the preservation time. The monitoring of perfusion parameters, the biochemical investigation of preservation fluids, and the assessment of tissue viability and bioenergetics function now offer a comprehensive assessment of organ quality and function ex situ. Gene and protein expression profiling, investigation of passenger leukocytes, and advanced imaging may further enhance the understanding of the condition of an organ during MP. In addition, MP offers a platform for organ reconditioning and regeneration and hence catalyzes the clinical realization of tissue engineering. Organ modification may include immunological modification and the generation of chimeric organs. While these ideas are not conceptually new, MP now offers a platform for clinical realization. Defatting of steatotic livers, modulation of inflammation during preservation in lungs, vasodilatation of livers, and hepatitis C elimination have been successfully demonstrated in experimental and clinical trials. Targeted treatment of lesions and surgical treatment or graft modification have been attempted. In this review, we address the current state of MP and advanced organ monitoring and speculate about logical future steps and how this evolution of a novel technology can result in a medial revolution.",

        "abstract": "Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is a novel clinical approach to overcome the limitations of traditional hypothermic organ preservation. NMP can be used to assess and recondition organs prior to transplant and is the subject of clinical trials in solid organ transplantation. In addition, NMP provides an opportunity to deliver therapeutic agents directly to the organ, thus avoiding many limitations associated with systemic treatment of the recipient. We report the delivery of oligonucleotide\u2010based therapy to human kidneys during NMP, in this case to target microRNA function (antagomir). An antagomir targeting mir\u201024\u20103p localized to the endothelium and proximal tubular epithelium. Endosomal uptake during NMP conditions facilitated antagomir co\u2010localization with proteins involved in the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC) and demonstrated engagement of the miRNA target. This pattern of uptake was not seen during cold perfusion. Targeting mir\u201024\u20103p action increased expression of genes controlled by this microRNA, including heme oxygenase\u20101 and sphingosine\u20101\u2010phosphate receptor 1. The expression of genes not under the control of mir\u201024\u20103p was unchanged, indicating specificity of the antagomir effect.

        "abstract": "Objective The mouse kidney transplantation model presents challenges in terms of surgical difficulty and low success rate, making it difficult to master. This study aims to provide a crucial model for transplantation immunology research by modifying and developing novel techniques for mouse kidney transplantation. Methods A total of 57 pairs of mice were used to establish and compare the modified and innovative surgical techniques for mouse kidney transplantation. Three different surgical models were established, including the abdominal suture technique for orthotopic kidney transplantation, the abdominal cuff technique for orthotopic kidney transplantation, and the cervical cuff technique for ectopic kidney transplantation. BALB/c or C57BL/6 male mice, aged 8 to 12 weeks and weighed 20 to 25 g with specified pathogen free-grade were served as the donor mice or the recipient mice. The surgical technique characteristics, key surgical times, complications, and pathological examination in the early postoperative period were summarized and compared. Results Three different surgical models of mouse kidney transplantation were successfully established. The comparison of warm ischemic time for the 3 groups of mice showed no statistical significance (P=0.510 4). The abdominal suture group had the shortest total operation time of the donor compared with the abdominal cuff group and the cervical cuff group [(18.3\u00b13.6) min vs (26.2\u00b14.7) min and (22.8\u00b12.5) min; both P<0.000 1]. There was a significant difference in cold ischemia time among the 3 groups (all P<0.000 1), with (60.8\u00b14.1) min in the cervical cuff group, (43.3\u00b15.0) min in the abdominal suture group, and (88.8\u00b16.7) min in the abdominal cuff group. Due to different anastomosis methods, the cervical cuff group had the shortest time [(17.6\u00b12.7) min], whereas the abdominal cuff group had the longest time [(38.8\u00b15.4) min]. The total operation time for the recipients showed significant differences (P<0.000 1), with the abdominal suture group having the shortest time [(44.0\u00b16.9) min], followed by the cervical cuff group [(64.1\u00b15.2) min], and the abdominal cuff group [(80.0\u00b16.0) min] being the longest. In the 32 mice of the abdominal suture group, there were 6 with intraoperative bleeding, including 1 arterial intimal injury bleeding and 5 with bleeding after vessel opening. Six mice had ureteral complications, including ureteral bladder anastomotic stenosis, necrosis, and renal pelvis dilation. Two mice had postoperative abdominal infections. In the abdominal cuff group, there was no intraoperative bleeding, but 6 mice showed mild arterial stenosis and 5 showed venous stenosis, 4 arterial injury, 4 arterial thrombosis, and 2 ureteral complications. No postoperative infections occurred in the mice. In the cervical cuff group, no intraoperative bleeding, arterial intimal injury, arterial/venous stenosis, or thrombosis were found in 13 mice. Five mice had ureteral complications, including ureteral necrosis and infection, which were the main complications in the cervical cuff group. The renal function in mice of the 3 groups remained stable 7 days after surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining showed no significant differences in terms of acute rejection among the 3 surgical methods (all P>0.05). Conclusion All 3 surgical methods are able to successfully establish mouse kidney transplantation models, with no significant differences observed in the short-term graft survival and acute rejection. The modified abdominal suture technique and abdominal cuff technique have their respective advantages in research applications. The novel cervical cuff technique for ectopic kidney transplantation model is relatively simple to be prepared and causes less trauma to the mice, providing more options for studies involving xenotransplantation, secondary transplantation, and local lymphatic drainage. However, the difficulty in harvesting the donor kidney and the high incidence of ureteral infections need further validation in long-term survival. This study holds important reference value for choosing the type of mouse kidney transplantation model for different research needs.",
