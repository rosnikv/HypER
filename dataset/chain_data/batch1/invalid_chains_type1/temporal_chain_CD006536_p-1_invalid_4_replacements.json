        "abstract": "In this study, we hypothesized that bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) protect ischemic myocardium through paracrine effects that can be further augmented with preconditioning. In in vitro experiments, cell survival factors such as Akt and eNOS were significantly increased in BMSCs following anoxia. In the second series of experiments following coronary ligation in mice, left ventricles were randomly injected with the following: DMEM (G-1), BMSCs (G-2), and preconditioned BMSCs (G-3). Four days after myocardial infarction, BMSCs were observed within injured myocardium in G-2 and G-3. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes within periinfarct area were significantly reduced in G-3. Four weeks after myocardial infarction, smaller left ventricular (LV) dimension and increased LV ejection fraction were observed in G-3. Infarct area was significantly reduced in G-3. However, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were observed in low numbers within periinfarct area in G-2 and G-3. In conclusion, BMSCs secreted cell survival factors under ischemia, and they prevented apoptosis in cardiomyocytes adjacent to the infarcted area. Preconditioning of BMSCs enhanced their survival and ability to attenuate LV remodeling, which was attributable, in part, to paracrine effects.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a major public health problem that causes significant mortality despite recent advances in its prevention and treatment. Therefore, approaches based on adult stem cells represent a promising alternative to conventional therapies for this life-threatening condition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that have been isolated from multiple tissues and differentiate to various cell types. Here we have analyzed the capacity of MSCs from human bone marrow (BMSC), adipose tissue (ATSC), and dental pulp (DPSC) to differentiate to cells with a cardiac phenotype. Differentiation of MSCs was induced by long-term co-culture with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs). Shortly after the establishment of MSC-CM co-cultures, expression of connexin 43 and the cardiac-specific markers troponin I, beta-myosin heavy chain, atrial natriuretic peptide, and alpha-sarcomeric actinin was detected in BMSCs, ATSCs, and DPSCs. Expression of differentiation markers increased over time in the co-cultures, reaching the highest levels at 4 weeks. Translocation of the transcription factors NKX2.5 and GATA4 to the nucleus was observed in all three cultures of MSCs during the differentiation process; moreover, nuclear localization of NKX2.5 and GATA4 correlated with expression of alpha-sarcomeric actinin. These changes were accompanied by an increase in myofibril organization in the resulting CM-like cells as analyzed by electron microscopy. Thus, our results provide novel information regarding the differentiation of tissue-specific MSCs to cardiomyocytes and support the potential use of MSCs in cell-based cardiac therapies.",

        "title": "Mesenchymal stem cells for cardiac cell therapy.",
        "abstract": "Despite refinements of medical and surgical therapies, heart failure remains a fatal disease. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure, and only palliative measures are available to relieve symptoms and prolong the patient's life span. Because mammalian cardiomyocytes irreversibly exit the cell cycle at about the time of birth, the heart has traditionally been considered to lack any regenerative capacity. This paradigm, however, is currently shifting, and the cellular composition of the myocardium is being targeted by various regeneration strategies. Adult progenitor and stem cell treatment of diseased human myocardium has been carried out for more than 10 years (Menasche et al., 2001; Stamm et al., 2003), and it has become clear that, in humans, the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells, despite potent proangiogenic effects, is limited (Stamm et al., 2009). More recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and related cell types are being evaluated in preclinical models of heart disease as well as in clinical trials (see Published Clinical Trials, below). MSCs have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into lineages that normally originate from the embryonic mesenchyme (connective tissues, blood vessels, blood-related organs) (Caplan, 1991; Prockop, 1997; Pittenger et al., 1999). The current definition of MSCs includes plastic adherence in cell culture, specific surface antigen expression (CD105(+)/CD90(+)/CD73(+), CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD11b(-) or CD14(-)/CD19(-) or CD79\u03b1(-)/HLA-DR1(-)), and multilineage in vitro differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic) (Dominici et al., 2006 ). If those criteria are not met completely, the term \"mesenchymal stromal cells\" should be used for marrow-derived adherent cells, or other terms for MSC-like cells of different origin. For the purpose of this review, MSCs and related cells are discussed in general, and cell type-specific properties are indicated when appropriate. We first summarize the preclinical data on MSCs in models of heart disease, and then appraise the clinical experience with MSCs for cardiac cell therapy.",

        "title": "Intracoronary Infusion of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Precursor Cells Directly After Experimental Acute Myocardial Infarction Reduces Infarct Size, Abrogates Adverse Remodeling, and Improves Cardiac Function",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) are a specific Stro-3+ subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow. MPCs exert extensive cardioprotective effects, and are considered to be immune privileged. Objective: This study assessed the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of intracoronary delivery of allogeneic MPCs directly after acute myocardial infarction in sheep. Methods and Results: Initially, intracoronary delivery conditions were optimized in 20 sheep. These conditions were applied in a randomized study of 68 sheep with an anterior acute myocardial infarction. Coronary flow was monitored during MPC infusion, and cardiac function was assessed using invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography at baseline and during 8 weeks follow-up. Coronary flow remained within thrombolysis in myocardial infarction III definitions in all sheep during MPC infusion. Global left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by pressure\u2013volume loop analysis deteriorated in controls to 40.7\u00b12.6% after 8 weeks. In contrast, MPC treatment improved cardiac function to 52.8\u00b10.7%. Echocardiography revealed significant improvement of both global and regional cardiac functions. Infarct size decreased by 40% in treated sheep, whereas infarct and border zone thickness were enhanced. Left ventricular adverse remodeling was abrogated by MPC therapy, resulting in a marked reduction of left ventricular volumes. Blood vessel density increased by >50% in the infarct and border areas. Compensatory cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was reduced in border and remote segments, accompanied by reduced collagen deposition and apoptosis. No microinfarctions in remote myocardial segments or histological abnormalities in unrelated organs were found. Conclusions: Intracoronary infusion of allogeneic MPCs is safe, feasible, and markedly effective in a large animal model of acute myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of the reviewIn this review, recent findings on the effects of tissue and donor origin, culturing conditions and preconditioning regimens on the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in organ transplantation are discussed and the importance of understanding the characteristics of MSC for developing efficient therapy is stressed. Recent findingsMSC research in organ transplantation is currently moving from safety-feasibility studies to efficacy studies and finding the optimal MSC for therapy is therefore highly relevant. Although sharing basic properties, there are subtle differences between MSC from different tissue sources that may affect their efficacy. Furthermore, the use of MSC from diseased organ recipients, donor or third party may affect their therapeutic effect. The importance of these differences in MSC properties may however be overshadowed by the impact of culture conditions on MSC. Culture conditions dramatically change the characteristics of MSC, and this situation can be exploited by exposing MSC to preconditioning treatment to bring about the desired properties in MSC. As MSC appear to be short-lived after infusion, the specific characteristics of MSC are mostly relevant for short-term interactions between MSC and host cells, which will subsequently take over the effects of MSC. The multiple effects of MSC are by no means unique, but the full spectrum of the effects in combination with their easy isolation and expansion make MSC a suitable cell type for therapy. SummaryTissue source, donor source and culture conditions affect the phenotypical and functional properties of MSC. The efficacy of MSC therapy will therefore depend on the source and manipulation of MSC.",

        "title": "Rebuilding the Damaged Heart: Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Cell-Based Therapy, and Engineered Heart Tissue.",
        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are broadly distributed cells that retain postnatal capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. MSCs evade immune detection, secrete an array of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mediators, and very importantly activate resident precursors. These properties form the basis for the strategy of clinical application of cell-based therapeutics for inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. In cardiovascular medicine, administration of autologous or allogeneic MSCs in patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy holds significant promise. Numerous preclinical studies of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy employing MSC-based therapy have demonstrated that the properties of reducing fibrosis, stimulating angiogenesis, and cardiomyogenesis have led to improvements in the structure and function of remodeled ventricles. Further attempts have been made to augment MSCs' effects through genetic modification and cell preconditioning. Progression of MSC therapy to early clinical trials has supported their role in improving cardiac structure and function, functional capacity, and patient quality of life. Emerging data have supported larger clinical trials that have been either completed or are currently underway. Mechanistically, MSC therapy is thought to benefit the heart by stimulating innate anti-fibrotic and regenerative responses. The mechanisms of action involve paracrine signaling, cell-cell interactions, and fusion with resident cells. Trans-differentiation of MSCs to bona fide cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels is also thought to occur, although at a nonphysiological level. Recently, MSC-based tissue engineering for cardiovascular disease has been examined with quite encouraging results. This review discusses MSCs from their basic biological characteristics to their role as a promising therapeutic strategy for clinical cardiovascular disease.",

In contrast to MSCs which had to be expanded in culture to reach optimal cell number for transplantation, MSC-sourced secretome is immediately available for treatment of acute conditions, including fulminant hepatitis, cerebral ischemia and myocardial infarction. Additionally, MSC-derived secretome could be massively produced from commercially available cell lines avoiding invasive cell collection procedure. In this review article we emphasized molecular and cellular mechanisms that were responsible for beneficial effects of MSC-derived secretomes in the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory diseases of hepatobiliary, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and nervous system. Results obtained in a large number of studies suggested that administration of MSC-derived secretomes represents a new, cell-free therapeutic approach for attenuation of inflammatory and degenerative diseases.

Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after MI has been recognized as a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Thus, prevention of fibrosis or alleviation of fibrosis progression is important for cardiac repair. To this end, a biocompatible microneedle (MN) patch based on gelatin is fabricated to load exosomes containing microRNA\u201029b (miR\u201029b) mimics with antifibrotic activity to prevent excessive cardiac fibrosis after MI. Exosomes are isolated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and loaded with miR\u201029b mimics via electroporation, which can be internalized effectively in cardiac fibroblasts to upregulate the expression of miR\u201029b and downregulate the expression of fibrosis\u2010related proteins.

        "abstract": "Introduction Cardiac fibrosis is one of the important causes of heart failure and death in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules in eukaryotes and have high stability. Their role in myocardial fibrosis with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to understand the expression profiles of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis with DCM, exploring the possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DCM. Methods At 21 weeks of age, db/db mice established the type 2 DCM model measured by echocardiography, and the cardiac tissue was extracted for Hematoxylin\u2013eosin, Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, the expression profile of circRNAs in myocardial fibrosis of db/db mice was constructed using microarray hybridization and verified by real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A circRNA\u2013microRNA\u2013messenger RNA coexpression network was constructed, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were done. Results Compared with normal control mice, db/db mice had 77 upregulated circRNAs and 135 downregulated circRNAs in their chromosomes (fold change \u22651.5, P \u2264 0.05). Moreover, the enrichment analysis of circRNA host genes showed that these differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. CircPHF20L1, circCLASP1, and circSLC8A1 were the key circRNAs. Moreover, circCLASP1/miR-182-5p/Wnt7a, circSLC8A1/miR-29b-1-5p/Col12a1, and most especially circPHF20L1/miR-29a-3p/Col6a2 might be three novel axes in the development of myocardial fibrosis in DCM. Conclusion The findings will provide some novel circRNAs and molecular pathways for the prevention or clinical treatment of DCM through intervention with specific circRNAs.",
