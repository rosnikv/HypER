        "title": "Mulberry leaf extract reduces postprandial hyperglycemia with few side effects by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase in normal rats.",
        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf extract (MLE) was investigated as a potent plant-derived \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor with low \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. MLE was prepared by heating in an autoclave at 121 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, and its in vitro and in vivo antihyperglycemic activities were investigated. The adverse side effects of MLE were analyzed by measuring the weight and volume of the cecum, stool color, starch content in the cecum, and the integrity of intestinal transporting capacity. The in vitro inhibitory activity of MLE on intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase was potent and that on intestinal \u03b1-amylase was very weak compared with acarbose. Sugar loading tests with starch, maltose, and sucrose showed that MLE may reduce postprandial increases in blood glucose by acting as an intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Feeding tests suggested that MLE may exhibit fewer adverse side effects than other \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, such as abdominal flatulence and meteorism, which are attributed to the impaired digestion of starch by strong inhibition of intestinal \u03b1-amylase. These results suggest that MLE could be used in the development of pharmaceutical foods to control the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients by inhibiting intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase with reduced side effects.",

        "title": "Inhibitory effects of medicinal mushrooms on \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase - enzymes related to hyperglycemia.",
        "abstract": "In Asia, medicinal mushrooms have been popularly used as folk medicine and functional foods. In this study, our aim was to examine the inhibitory effects of six medicinal mushrooms on key enzymes (\u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase) related to hyperglycemia; chemical profiles of bioactive extracts were also examined. The results showed that the n-hexane extract of Coriolus versicolor had the strongest anti-\u03b1-amylase activity, while the n-hexane extract of Grifola frondosa showed the most potent anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity. Compared with acarbose, the anti-\u03b1-amylase activity of all mushroom extracts was weaker, however a stronger anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity was noted. GC-MS analysis showed that the magnitude of potency of inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase activity varied with the levels of oleic acid and linoleic acid present in the extracts. These findings were consistent with the IC50 values of these free fatty acids on inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase activity. Taken together, this study suggests that oleic acid and linoleic acid could have contributed to the potent anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity of selected medicinal mushrooms.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nMulberry (genus Morus) is a significant source of polyphenols, which can promote positive effects on human health. China has various mulberry cultivars, however, many Chinese mulberry cultivars have been only minimally studied. To solve this lack of research, 8 mulberry cultivars (Da10, Tang10, Yueshen74, Yuefenshen, Longsang, Ningxia1hao, Taiwanguosang, and Baiyuwang) from 4 regions of China were assessed to determine their polyphenol profiles using HPLC-MS/MS and then tested for their antioxidant and anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activities in vitro. A total of 18 nonanthocyanins and 4 anthocyanins were quantified in mulberry cultivars; among these polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside were confirmed as the major phenolic acid, flavonol derivative, and anthocyanin, respectively. Two types of stilbene compounds, piceid, and piceatannol, were detected for the 1st time in all mulberry cultivars. Moreover, the methanolic extracts of different mulberry cultivars showed disparate antioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities, and this discrepancy was mainly attributed to varying the anthocyanin content. Based on our results, Taiwanguosang is proposed to be a good candidate suitable for further process due to its high level of anthocyanins.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION\nThe polyphenols of mulberry cultivars are vital for human health and are relevant to the further development of mulberry-based products. China has a wide range of mulberry cultivar resources, and many of these cultivars have not yet been studied. Our research concentrated on the polyphenol profiles, antioxidant, and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities of various mulberry cultivars from different regions of China to provide basic information for mulberry cultivar selection and mulberry-based food production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The compositions of phenolic compounds in 10 cultivars of two mulberry species (Morus atropurpurea Roxb. and Morus alba Linn.) grown in four regions of China were analysed using HPLC-TOF-MS. Results showed that a total of 27 phenolic compounds were identified in these mulberry cultivars. The Taiwan cultivar from the Jiangsu region showed the highest concentration of hydroxycinnamic acids, quercetin derivatives, and anthocyanins. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that six mulberry cultivars grown in the region of Jiangsu, Ningxia, and Guangdong were differentiated regarding their species feature and regional characteristics. Cyanidin rhamnosylglucoside, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, dihydroquercetin, and quercetin were further screened out to be the key compounds for the differentiation of these cultivars. The correlation between the regional climate feature (including rainfall, humidity, and temperature) and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in these mulberry cultivars was established.",

        "abstract": "The differences in metabolites in male and female individuals of dioecious Morus alba L. (Moraceae) are usually ignored and lack study. In the present study, 58 leaves and 61 stem barks from male and female individuals were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics via headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) coupled with chemometrics, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). A total of 66 and 44 metabolites were identified from leaves and stem barks, respectively. Four and eight differential metabolites among candidate metabolites in leaves and stem barks from male and female individuals were identified. Moreover, females possessed stronger antioxidant activity than males. This is the first report where untargeted metabolomics coupled with chemometrics was used to analyze the different metabolites and to discriminate the gender of leaves and stem barks of dioecious M. alba. It provided the basis for further study of M. alba and reference value for researching dioecious plants.",

        "abstract": "Morus alba L. is a tradition medical and edible plant. It is rich in many important bioactive components. However, there is a dearth of systematic information about the components. Here, the Mori Cortex, Mori Folium, Mori Fructus, and Mori Ramulus were studied. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2013MS) is used to study primary and secondary metabolites. Eight hundred two metabolites were identified and classified into 10 different categories in total. Correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and principal component analysis of metabolites showed that different parts of the sample could be significantly different. In different medicinal parts, alkaloids accounted for 4.0%, 3.6%, 5.1%, and 4.5%; flavonoids accounted for 0.7%, 27.2%, 5.6%, 1.2%; terpenes accounted for 20.1%, 2.1%, 2.6%, 2.5%. Furthermore, the abundance of phenols, phenylpropanoids, and lipids metabolites sequentially accounted for 2.3\u20134.4%, 0.5\u20131.8%, and 2.4\u20135.3%. These results have improved our understanding of metabolites and provided a reference for research on the medicinal and edible value of Morus alba L. In addition, the study reveals the correlation between the components of Traditional Chinese medicine and the basic theory of TCM properties and reinterprets the ancient wisdom in the world\u2019s traditional herbs through the perspective of modern science.",
