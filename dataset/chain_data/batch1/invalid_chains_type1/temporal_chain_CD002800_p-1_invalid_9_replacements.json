        "abstract": "surveying the literature on alcoholic liver disease is struck by the dissociation between the vast information that has accumulated and the relative lack of its integration into coherent knowledge of the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. It is our impression that we lack the framework to allow us to differentiate between what is central to alcoholic liver disease and what are epiphenomena. The reader in this field cannot escape the feeling that we may have engaged too actively in pursuit of peripheral areas which are concomitants or consequences of liver dysfunction but not necessarily the causes of alcoholic liver disease in man. In general, research by clinical and basic investigators has been slanted toward explaining mechanisms of obvious morphological abnormalities that often accompany liver disease. This has occurred despite the fact that some morphological abnormalities are not present in all patients with clinical manifestations of alcoholic liver disease, while other morphological abnormalities that follow chronic alcohol consumption occur without clinical liver disease",

        "abstract": "Chronic alcohol administration to baboons results in perivenular lesions in the liver. To study possible mechanisms, the effect of ethanol on splanchnic oxygen consumption was measured. Acute ethanol administration increased splanchnic oxygen consumption in the control baboons, but the consequences of this effect on oxygenation of the perivenular zones were offset by a concomitant rise in blood flow, resulting in unchanged hepatic venous oxygen tensions. In alcohol-fed baboons, splanchnic oxygen consumption was not increased, either in the withdrawal state or after ethanol infusion. To study the magnitude of the shift in redox state induced by ethanol in the perivenular zones, we compared the effects of ethanol on the lactate/pyruvate ratio in hepatic venous blood (an approximation of that in perivenular hepatocytes) with the ratio in total liver. Prior to ethanol infusion, the lactate and pyruvate were the same in liver and in hepatic venous blood. By contrast, in all baboons, ethanol produced a much greater rise in the lactate/pyruvate ratio and decreased pyruvate more in hepatic venous blood than in total liver. Moreover, in isolated rat hepatocytes, the ethanol-induced redox shift was markedly exaggerated by oxygen tensions similar to those found in centrolobular zones. This suggests that the normally low oxygen tensions existing in perivenular zones exaggerate the ethanol-induced redox shift, a change which may contribute to the exacerbation of the damage in the perivenular area of the hepatic lobule.",

        "abstract": "The periportal hepatotoxicity of allyl alcohol (AlOH) was investigated by studying its metabolism and cytotoxicity in suspensions of periportal (pp) and perivenous (pv) rat hepatocytes isolated by digitonin-collagenase perfusion. No marked difference in alcohol dehydrogenase activity between the cell types was observed. The cells also oxidised AlOH at about equal rates. AlOH depleted cellular glutathione by about 95% within 10 minutes in both cell types, but was partially restored during subsequent incubation. The pp cells suffering from AlOH toxicity in vivo tended to resist AlOH in vitro better than pv hepatocytes, as judged from the measurement of cellular ATP and K+ ion content, and LDH leakage. It is suggested that the oxidation of AlOH may be restricted to the pp region in intact liver simply because of the high rate of uptake and oxidation of AlOH by the liver tissue.",

        "abstract": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes are known to display various functional differences. In this study we present a new method to separate periportal and perivenous cells: after selectively loading zone 1 or zone 3 with the fluorescent label acridine orange in an antegrade or retrograde perfusion, respectively, we separated the isolated hepatocytes on a fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorter. The common way to check on proper separation is to estimate activities of enzymes known to exhibit a heterogeneous acinar distribution. Using enzyme histochemistry, however, we found that already on short collagenase perfusion, some enzymes displayed a more shallow gradient than in vivo, making enzyme activities less suitable as zonal markers. We therefore used colloidal gold granules (17 nm) injected intravenously (2.5 mg) into the rat 2 to 3 hr before cell isolation. The gold is taken up predominantly by perivenous hepatocytes, probably because of the efficient removal of gold granules in zone 1 by competing Kupffer cells. We compared acridine orange fluorescence, presence of gold particles and activities of six marker enzymes, three biochemically and three histochemically determined. Acridine orange and gold both pointed to a high enrichment of the fractions, whereas most enzyme activities were more randomly distributed among the cells as a result of the isolation procedure. Our separation procedure yielded fractions highly enriched in either viable periportal or perivenous cells, both from one liver. The use of colloidal gold as a marker to monitor separation is a valuable alternative to the more risky estimation of enzyme activities. (HEPATOLOGY 1991;13:73\u201382).",

        "abstract": "Anterograde or retrograde perfusion of rat liver with digitonin selectively permeabilizes the periportal or the perivenous zone of the hepatic lobule. Digitonin perfusion is used to analyze the effluents released by permeabilized hepatocytes or, combined with collagenase perfusion, to obtain cell suspensions enriched in either periportal or perivenous hepatocytes. Despite the wide use of digitonin to study lobular heterogeneity, its affects on rat hepatocytes are not well documented. We therefore analyzed the effects of digitonin perfusion on the intracellular content of rat hepatocytes by combining electron microscopy, histoenzymology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. At the concentration currently used for the study of lobular heterogeneity, digitonin perfusion induced a marked cytosolic clarification of permeabilized hepatocytes, while most organelles except mitochondria were well preserved. In the digitonin-altered zones, there was no histochemical detection of non-membrane-bound enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas membrane-bound enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, NADPH dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase) were still detected. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed significant amounts of several plasma proteins (albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-inhibitor 3, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein) and their respective mRNAs in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes. The demonstration that digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes retain many intracellular constituents shows that biochemical analysis of cellular effluents released from digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes must be interpreted with caution and that the apparent characteristics of cell suspensions obtained by the digitonin-collagenase technique might be significantly altered by contamination with permeabilized hepatocytes from the opposite zone.",

        "abstract": "Morphological and functional heterogeneity of hepatocytes according to their position in the liver lobule has been known for many years. The digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique is widely used to study hepatocyte heterogeneity and has yielded reliable data. However, with this procedure, periportal (PP) or perivenous (PV) hepatocytes are isolated from different livers, allowing only comparison between cell populations issued from two separate animals. To overcome this drawback, we have modified this technique by perfusing the two main rat liver lobes of a single animal in succession. The procedure involved alternate clamping of the median and the left lateral lobes, restricting digitonin infusion to one lobe via the portal vein, and to the other via the caudal vena cava. Lobe exclusion during digitonin perfusion, and zonal restriction of digitonin\u2010induced damage, were monitored using macroscopic and histological controls. We compared our results with previous data on PP and PV hepatocytes issued from two different livers using the conventional digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. First, we found that the cellular sensitivity to angiotensin II, a calcium\u2010mobilizing agonist, was 60% to 80% higher in PV than in PP hepatocytes, whereas, previously, no difference had been recorded. Second, we found that albumin messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were 35% more abundant in PP than in PV hepatocytes, whereas, previously, larger differences had been reported. Our results show that PP and PV hepatocytes may be isolated from a single liver using an improved digitonin\u2010collagenase perfusion technique. Furthermore, we suggest that zonal differences can be artificially masked or amplified when comparing PP and PV cell populations from two different livers, indicating that it is preferable to use a single liver for accurate zonal comparisons between hepatocytes.",

        "abstract": "Agonist\u2010induced intracellular calcium signals may propagate as intercellular Ca2+ waves in multicellular systems as well as in intact organs. The mechanisms initiating intercellular Ca2+ waves in one cell and determining their direction are unknown. We investigated these mechanisms directly on fura2\u2010loaded multicellular systems of rat hepatocytes and on cell populations issued from peripheral (periportal) and central (perivenous) parts of the hepatic lobule. There was a gradient in vasopressin sensitivity along connected cells as demonstrated by low vasopressin concentration challenge. Interestingly, the intercellular sensitivity gradient was abolished either when D\u2010myo\u2010inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor was directly stimulated after flash photolysis of caged InsP3 or when G proteins were directly stimulated with AlF4\u2212. The gradient in vasopressin sensitivity in multiplets was correlated with a heterogeneity of vasopressin sensitivity in the hepatic lobule. There were more vasopressin\u2010binding sites, vasopressin\u2010induced InsP3 production and V1a vasopressin receptor mRNAs in perivenous than in periportal cells. Therefore, we propose that hormone receptor density determines the cellular sensitivity gradient from the peripheral to the central zones of the liver cell plate, thus the starting cell and the direction of intercellular Ca2+ waves, leading to directional activation of Ca2+\u2010dependent processes.",

        "abstract": "Intercellular calcium signals are propagated in multicellular hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The stimulation of connected hepatocytes by glycogenolytic agonists induces reproducible sequences of intracellular calcium concentration increases, resulting in unidirectional intercellular calcium waves. Hepatocytes are characterized by a gradient of vasopressin binding sites from the periportal to perivenous areas of the cell plate in hepatic lobules. Also, coordination of calcium signals between neighboring cells requires the presence of the agonist at each cell surface as well as gap junction permeability. We present a model based on the junctional coupling of several hepatocytes differing in sensitivity to the agonist and thus in the intrinsic period of calcium oscillations. In this model, each hepatocyte displays repetitive calcium spikes with a slight phase shift with respect to neighboring cells, giving rise to a phase wave. The orientation of the apparent calcium wave is imposed by the direction of the gradient of hormonal sensitivity. Calcium spikes are coordinated by the diffusion across junctions of small amounts of inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphos phate (InsP3). Theoretical predictions from this model are confirmed experimentally. Thus, major physiological insights may be gained from this model for coordination and spatial orientation of intercellular signals.\u2014Dupont, G., Tordjmann, T., Clair, C., Swillens, S., Claret, M., Combettes, L.

        "abstract": "Glycogenolytic agonists induce coordinated Ca(2+) oscillations in multicellular rat hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The coordination of intercellular Ca(2+) signals requires functional gap-junction coupling. The mechanisms ensuring this coordination are not precisely known. We investigated possible roles of Ca(2+) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) as a coordinating messengers for Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes. Application of ionomycin or of supra-maximal concentrations of agonists show that Ca(2+) does not significantly diffuse between connected hepatocytes, although gap junctions ensure the passage of small signaling molecules, as demonstrated by FRAP experiments. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes can be favored by a rise in the level of InsP(3), via the increase of agonist concentrations, or by a shift in the affinity of InsP(3) receptor for InsP(3). In the same line, coordination cannot be achieved if the InsP(3) is rapidly metabolized by InsP(3)-phosphatase in one cell of the multiplet. These results demonstrate that even if small amounts of Ca(2+) diffuse across gap junctions, they most probably do not play a significant role in inducing a coordinated Ca(2+) signal among connected hepatocytes. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) oscillations is fully dependent on the diffusion of InsP(3) between neighboring cells.",

        "abstract": "Intercellular signaling is highly coordinated in excitable tissues such as heart, but the organization of intercellular signaling in epithelia is less clear. We examined Ca2+ signaling in hepatoma cells expressing the hepatocyte gap junction protein connexin32 (cx32) or the cardiac gap junction protein cx43, plus a fluorescently tagged V1avasopressin receptor (V1aR). Release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in wild type cells increased Ca2+ in the injected cell but not in neighboring cells, while the Ca2+ signal spread to neighbors when gap junctions were expressed. Photorelease of caged Ca2+ rather than InsP3 resulted in a small increase in Ca2+that did not spread to neighbors with or without gap junctions. However, photorelease of Ca2+ in cells stimulated with low concentrations of vasopressin resulted in a much larger increase in Ca2+, which spread to neighbors via gap junctions. Cells expressing tagged V1aR similarly had increased sensitivity to vasopressin, and could signal to neighbors via gap junctions. Higher concentrations of vasopressin elicited Ca2+ signals in all cells. In cx32 or cx43 but not in wild type cells, this signaling was synchronized and began in cells expressing the tagged V1aR. Thus, intercellular Ca2+ signals in epithelia are organized by three factors: 1) InsP3 must be generated in each cell to support a Ca2+ signal in that cell; 2) gap junctions are necessary to synchronize Ca2+ signals among cells; and 3) cells with relatively increased expression of hormone receptor will initiate Ca2+ signals and thus serve as pacemakers for their neighbors. Together, these factors may allow epithelia to act in an integrated, organ-level fashion rather than as a collection of isolated cells.",

Nuclear InsP3R channels were active at lower InsP3 concentrations than InsP3R from cytosol.

        "abstract": "Water homeostasis is a critical challenge to survival for land mammals. Mice display increased locomotor activity when dehydrated, a behavior that improves the likelihood of locating new sources of water and simultaneously places additional demands on compromised hydration levels. The neurophysiology underlying this well known behavior has not been previously elucidated. We report that the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this response. AVP and oxytocin directly induced depolarization and an inward current in orexin/hypocretin neurons. AVP-induced activation of orexin neurons was inhibited by a V1a receptor (V1aR)-selective antagonist and was not observed in V1aR knock-out mice, suggesting an involvement of V1aR. Subsequently activation of phospholipase C\u03b2 triggers an increase in intracellular calcium by both calcium influx through nonselective cation channels and calcium release from calcium stores in orexin neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of AVP or water deprivation increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice, but not in transgenic mice lacking orexin neurons. V1aR knock-out mice were less active than wild-type mice. These results suggest that the activation of orexin neurons by AVP or oxytocin has an important role in the regulation of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. This system appears to play a key role in water deprivation-induced hyperlocomotor activity, a response to dehydration that increases the chance of locating water in nature.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have implicated the orexin system as a critical regulator of sleep/wake states as well as feeding behavior and reward processes. Orexin deficiency results in narcolepsy in humans, dogs, and rodents, suggesting that the orexin system is particularly important for maintenance of wakefulness. In addition, orexin deficiency also cause abnormalities in energy homeostasis and reward systems. Orexin activates waking active monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem regions to maintain a long, consolidated waking period. Orexin neurons receive abundant input from the limbic system. Orexin neurons also have reciprocal links with the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which regulates feeding. Moreover, the responsiveness of orexin neurons to peripheral metabolic cues, such as leptin and glucose, suggest that these neurons have important role as a link between the energy homeostasis and vigilance states. Orexin neurons also have a link with the dopaminergic reward system in the ventral tegmental nucleus. These findings suggest that the orexin system interacts with systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis to maintain proper vigilance states. Therefore, this system may be a potentially important therapeutic target for treatment of sleep disorder, obesity, emotional stress, and addiction.",

        "title": "Short sleep duration and its association with energy metabolism",
        "abstract": "A growing body of observational evidence suggests that short sleep duration is a risk factor for the development of obesity. Although increased energy intake is the most prevailing causal explanation for this association, we should also consider possible effects on energy metabolism to understand fully the potential impact of short sleep duration on the regulation of energy balance. We performed a search of the literature from 1970 to 2011, including original papers, investigating the relation between short sleep and energy metabolism in animals and humans. Although the limited number of experimental studies in humans precludes any definitive conclusions about causality, short sleep duration does not seem to substantially affect total daily energy expenditure, nor is there sufficient evidence in support of any meaningful effect of restricted sleep on the specific components of energy metabolism (i.e. resting metabolic rate, intentional as well as unintentional physical activity, diet\u2010induced thermogenesis, and substrate utilization). As studies on rats suggest that other factors that can potentially influence energy metabolism could be affected (i.e. hormonal systems and thermoregulation), we included these factors in our literature search and found some indications in support of an up\u2010regulation of thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids as well as increased heat dissipation following total or severe sleep deficit. Although we found some evidence also in humans that suggests a possible effect on energy metabolism, the limitations of the studies make it difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of short sleep on energy metabolism under relevant free living conditions. To explore this area further, more studies using suitable methodology under relevant conditions to mimic real\u2010life situations are needed.",

        "abstract": "Many people in our society experience curtailment and disruption of sleep due to work responsibilities, care-giving, or life style choice. Delineating the health effect of acute and chronic disruptions in sleep is essential to raising awareness of and creating interventions to manage these prevalent concerns. To provide a platform for studying the health impact and underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with inadequate sleep, we developed and characterized an approach to creating chronic disruption of sleep in laboratory mice. We used this method to evaluate how 3 durations of sleep fragmentation (SF) affect sleep recuperation and blood and lung analyte concentrations in male C57BL/6J mice. Mice housed in environmentally controlled chambers were exposed to automated SF for periods of 6, 12, or 24 h or for 12 h daily during the light (somnolent) phase for 4 sequential days. Sleep time, slow-wave amplitude, or bout lengths were significantly higher when uninterrupted sleep was permitted after each of the 3 SF durations. However, mice did not recover all of the lost slow-wave sleep during the subsequent 12- to 24-h period and maintained a net loss of sleep. Light-phase SF was associated with significant changes in serum and lung levels of some inflammatory substances, but these changes were not consistent or sustained. The data indicate that acute light-phase SF can result in a sustained sleep debt in mice and may disrupt the inflammatory steady-state in serum and lung.",

BPA level was measured in urine samples and analyzed as loge-transformed variable and in quartiles (< 0.9 ng/mL; 0.9 to < 1.9 ng/mL; 1.9 to < 3.7 ng/mL; 3.7+ ng/mL). Sleep adequacy was operationalized with three questions: \"How much sleep do you usually get at night on weekdays or workdays?\", \"Have you ever told a doctor or other health professionals that you have trouble sleeping?\" and \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have a sleep disorder?\" Sleep duration was further categorized as (< 6 h, \u2265 6 h); (< 7 h, 7-8 h, > 8 h); (< 5 h, 5-6 h, 7-8 h, \u2265 9 h). Linear, binary, and ordinal logistic regression models were constructed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLoge-transformed BPA level was inversely related to sleep duration defined, in hours, as a continuous variable, a dichotomous variable (\u2265 6, < 6), or an ordinal variable (\u2265 9, 7-8, 5-6, < 5), after adjustment for confounders. Help-seeking behavior for sleep problems and diagnosis with sleep disorders were not significantly associated with loge-transformed BPA level in fully adjusted models.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLoge-transformed BPA level may be associated with fewer hours of sleep among U.S. adults, with implications for prevention. Further research involving diverse populations are needed to confirm these study findings.",

        "abstract": "Sleep duration and sleep quality are important predictors of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One potential link between sleep health and CVD is through lifestyle factors such as diet. To clarify the association between diet and sleep, we assessed the associations of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with current Mediterranean-style diet (aMed) and with historical changes in aMed score. Actigraphy-measured sleep duration and self-reported insomnia symptoms categorized as insomnia with short sleep (<6 hr/night), insomnia without short sleep, no insomnia with short sleep, and no insomnia or short sleep were obtained from 2068 individuals who also had dietary intake data. A 10-point aMed score, derived from a self-report food frequency questionnaire, was collected concurrently with the sleep assessment and 10 years before. Compared with individuals who currently reported a low aMed score, those with a moderate-high aMed score were more likely to sleep 6-7 vs. <6 hr/night (p < 0.01) and less likely to report insomnia symptoms occurring with short sleep (vs. no insomnia or short sleep alone; p < 0.05). An increase in aMed score over the preceding 10 years was not associated with sleep duration or insomnia symptoms. However, compared with those with decreasing aMed score, individuals with an unchanging score reported fewer insomnia symptoms (p \u2264 0.01). These results suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with adequate sleep duration, less insomnia symptoms, and less likely to have insomnia accompanied by short sleep. Further research should identify possible mediators through which diet may promote adequate sleep duration and reduce the risk of insomnia.",

        "abstract": "Sleep is essential to and an integral part of life and when lacking or disrupted, a multitude of mental and physical pathologies ensue, including cardiovascular (CV) disease, which increase health care costs. Several prospective studies and meta-analyses show that insomnia, short (<7h) or long (>9h) sleep and other sleep disorders are associated with an increased risk of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, CV disease risk and/or mortality. The mechanisms by which insomnia and other sleep disorders lead to increased CV risk may encompass inflammatory, immunological, neuro-autonomic, endocrinological, genetic and microbiome perturbations. Guidelines are emerging that recommend a target of >7 h of sleep for all adults >18 years for optimal CV health. Treatment of sleep disorders includes cognitive-behavioral therapy considered the mainstay of non-pharmacologic management of chronic insomnia, and drug treatment with benzodiazepine receptor agonists binding to gamma aminobutyric acid type A (benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine agents) and some antidepressants. However, observational studies and meta-analyses indicate an increased mortality risk of anxiolytics and hypnotics, although bias may be involved due to confounding and high heterogeneity in these studies. Nevertheless, it seems that the risk incurred by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents (Z drugs) may be relatively less than the risk of anxiolytics, with evidence indicating that at least one of these agents, zolpidem, may even confer a lower risk of mortality in adjusted models.

We evaluated an expanded measure of CVH that includes sleep as an eighth metric in relation to CVD risk. Methods and Results The analytic sample consisted of MESA (Multi\u2010Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Sleep Study participants who had complete data on sleep characteristics from overnight polysomnography, 7\u2010day wrist actigraphy, validated questionnaires, and the outcome. We computed the LS7 score and 4 iterations of a new CVH score: score 1 included sleep duration, score 2 included sleep characteristics linked to CVD in the literature (sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea), scores 3 and 4 included sleep characteristics associated with CVD in MESA (score 3: sleep duration and efficiency, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea; score 4: score 3+sleep regularity). Multivariable\u2010adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of the LS7 and CVH scores 1 to 4 with CVD prevalence and incidence. Among 1920 participants (mean age: 69\u00b19\u2009years; 54% female), there were 95 prevalent CVD events and 93 incident cases (mean follow\u2010up, 4.4\u2009years). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of the LS7 score and CVH scores 1 to 4 had up to 80% lower odds of prevalent CVD. The LS7 score was not significantly associated with CVD incidence (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.37\u20131.04]). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of CVH score 1, which included sleep duration, and CVH score 4, which included multidimensional sleep health, had 43% and 47% lower incident CVD risk (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33\u20130.97]; and hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32\u20130.89]), respectively. Conclusions CVH scores that include sleep health predicted CVD risk in older US adults. The incorporation of sleep as a CVH metric, akin to other health behaviors, may enhance CVD primordial and primary prevention efforts.

        "abstract": "Background: The American Heart Association recently released a new cardiovascular health (CVH) metric, Life\u2019s Essential 8 (LE8), for health promotion. However, the association between levels of LE8 and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is not known from a large prospective cohort. We aim to analyze the relationship between CVH, indicated by LE8, and risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Moreover, we sought to test whether the genetic susceptibility to CHD or stroke could be modified by LE8. Methods: A total of 137\u2009794 participants free of CVD from the UK Biobank were included. CVH was scored using LE8 and categorized as low, moderate, and high. Results: During a median of 10 years, 8595 CVD cases (6968 CHDs and 1948 strokes) were documented. A higher LE8 score was associated with remarkably lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). Comparing the high CVH to the low CVH, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30\u20130.38) for CHD, 0.45 (0.37\u20130.54) for stroke, and 0.36 (0.33\u20130.40) for CVD. Moreover, the model with LE8 achieved higher accuracy and outperformed the model with Life\u2019s Simple 7 for CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). The protective associations of the LE8 score with CVD outcomes were more pronounced among women (P interaction, <0.001 for CHD and 0.0013 for CVD, respectively) and among younger adults (P interaction, <0.001, 0.007, and <0.001 for CHD, stroke, and CVD, respectively). In addition, a significant interaction was found between the genetic risk of CHD and the LE8 score (P interaction, <0.001). The inverse association was stronger among those with a lower genetic risk of CHD. Conclusions: High level of CVH, defined by LE8, was associated with significantly lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD.",

Methods and Results LE8 score was calculated for 5682 Framingham Heart Study participants.

We found that a 1 SD increase in the LE8 score was associated with a 35% (95% CI, 27\u201341; P=1.8E\u201015) lower risk of incident CVD, a 36% (95% CI, 24\u201347; P=7E\u20107) lower risk of CVD\u2010specific mortality, and a 29% (95% CI, 22\u201335; P=7E\u201015) lower risk of all\u2010cause mortality. These associations were partly mediated by epigenetic age biomarkers, particularly the GrimAge and the DunedinPACE scores. The potential mediation effects by epigenetic age biomarkers tended to be more profound in participants with higher genetic risk for older epigenetic age, compared with those with lower genetic risk.
