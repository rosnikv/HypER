        "title": "Targeting Pioglitazone Hydrochloride Therapy After Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack According to Pretreatment Risk for Stroke or Myocardial Infarction",
        "abstract": "Importance There is growing recognition that patients may respond differently to therapy and that the average treatment effect from a clinical trial may not apply equally to all candidates for a therapy. Objective To determine whether, among patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and insulin resistance, those at higher risk for future stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) derive more benefit from the insulin-sensitizing drug pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with patients at lower risk. Design, Setting, and Participants A secondary analysis was conducted of the Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone for secondary prevention. Patients were enrolled from 179 research sites in 7 countries from February 7, 2005, to January 15, 2013, and were followed up for a mean of 4.1 years through the study\u2019s end on July 28, 2015. Eligible participants had a qualifying ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 180 days of entry and insulin resistance without type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Interventions Pioglitazone or matching placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures A Cox proportional hazards regression model was created using baseline features to stratify patients above or below the median risk for stroke or MI within 5 years. Within each stratum, the efficacy of pioglitazone for preventing stroke or MI was calculated. Safety outcomes were death, heart failure, weight gain, and bone fracture. Results Among 3876 participants (1338 women and 2538 men; mean [SD] age, 63 [11] years), the 5-year risk for stroke or MI was 6.0% in the pioglitazone group among patients at lower baseline risk compared with 7.9% in the placebo group (absolute risk difference, \u20131.9% [95% CI, \u20134.4% to 0.6%]). Among patients at higher risk, the risk was 14.7% in the pioglitazone group vs 19.6% for placebo (absolute risk difference, \u20134.9% [95% CI, \u20138.6% to 1.2%]). Hazard ratios were similar for patients below or above the median risk (0.77 vs 0.75; P\u2009=\u2009.92). Pioglitazone increased weight less among patients at higher risk but increased the risk for fracture more. Conclusions and Relevance After an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients at higher risk for stroke or MI derive a greater absolute benefit from pioglitazone compared with patients at lower risk. However, the risk for fracture is also higher. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00091949",

        "title": "Personalized evidence based medicine: predictive approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects",
        "abstract": "Abstract The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of \u201creference class forecasting\u201d: implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of \u201csimilar\u201d patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to \u201cpredictive\u201d heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on \u201crisk modeling\u201d (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on \u201ceffect modeling\u201d (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.",

        "title": "The Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity (PATH) Statement",
        "abstract": "Heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) refers to the nonrandom variation in the magnitude or direction of a treatment effect across levels of a covariate, as measured on a selected scale, against a clinical outcome. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), HTE is typically examined through a subgroup analysis that contrasts effects in groups of patients defined \"1 variable at a time\" (for example, male vs. female or old vs. young). The authors of this statement present guidance on an alternative approach to HTE analysis, \"predictive HTE analysis.\" The goal of predictive HTE analysis is to provide patient-centered estimates of outcome risks with versus without the intervention, taking into account all relevant patient attributes simultaneously. The PATH (Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity) Statement was developed using a multidisciplinary technical expert panel, targeted literature reviews, simulations to characterize potential problems with predictive approaches, and a deliberative process engaging the expert panel. The authors distinguish 2 categories of predictive HTE approaches: a \"risk-modeling\" approach, wherein a multivariable model predicts the risk for an outcome and is applied to disaggregate patients within RCTs to define risk-based variation in benefit, and an \"effect-modeling\" approach, wherein a model is developed on RCT data by incorporating a term for treatment assignment and interactions between treatment and baseline covariates. Both approaches can be used to predict differential absolute treatment effects, the most relevant scale for clinical decision making. The authors developed 4 sets of guidance: criteria to determine when risk-modeling approaches are likely to identify clinically important HTE, methodological aspects of risk-modeling methods, considerations for translation to clinical practice, and considerations and caveats in the use of effect-modeling approaches. The PATH Statement, together with its explanation and elaboration document, may guide future analyses and reporting of RCTs.",

        "abstract": "Importance\nPatent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated strokes comprise approximately 10% of ischemic strokes in adults aged 18 to 60 years. While device closure decreases stroke recurrence risk overall, the best treatment for any individual is often unclear.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect of PFO closure on stroke recurrence based on previously developed scoring systems.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nInvestigators for the Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation (SCOPE) Consortium pooled individual patient data from all 6 randomized clinical trials that compared PFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone in patients with PFO-associated stroke, and included a total of 3740 participants. The trials were conducted worldwide from 2000 to 2017.\n\n\nExposures\nPFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone. Subgroup analyses used the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Score (a 10-point scoring system in which higher scores reflect younger age and the absence of vascular risk factors) and the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) Classification System, which combines the RoPE Score with high-risk PFO features (either an atrial septal aneurysm or a large-sized shunt) to classify patients into 3 categories of causal relatedness: unlikely, possible, and probable.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nIschemic stroke.\n\n\nResults\nOver a median follow-up of 57 months (IQR, 24-64), 121 outcomes occurred in 3740 patients. The annualized incidence of stroke with medical therapy was 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) and with device closure was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]). The subgroup analyses showed statistically significant interaction effects. Patients with low vs high RoPE Score had HRs of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.00) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.11-0.42), respectively (P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02). Patients classified as unlikely, possible, and probable using the PASCAL Classification System had HRs of 1.14 (95% CI, 0.53-2.46), 0.38 (95% CI, 0.22-0.65), and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.35), respectively (P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.003). The 2-year absolute risk reduction was -0.7% (95% CI, -4.0% to 2.6%), 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.6%), and 2.1% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively. Device-associated adverse events were generally higher among patients classified as unlikely; the absolute risk increases in atrial fibrillation beyond day 45 after randomization with a device were 4.41% (95% CI, 1.02% to 7.80%), 1.53% (95% CI, 0.33% to 2.72%), and 0.65% (95% CI, -0.41% to 1.71%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nAmong patients aged 18 to 60 years with PFO-associated stroke, risk reduction for recurrent stroke with device closure varied across groups classified by their probabilities that the stroke was causally related to the PFO. Application of this classification system has the potential to guide individualized decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Patients who exhibit high systemic inflammation after cardiac surgery may benefit most from pre-emptive anti-inflammatory treatments. In this secondary analysis (n\u2009=\u2009813) of the randomised, double-blind Intraoperative High-Dose Dexamethasone for Cardiac Surgery trial, we set out to develop an inflammation risk prediction model and assess whether patients at higher risk benefit from a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone (1\u2009mg/kg). Inflammation risk before surgery was quantified from a linear regression model developed in the placebo arm, relating preoperatively available covariates to peak postoperative C-reactive protein. The primary endpoint was the interaction between inflammation risk and the peak postoperative C-reactive protein reduction associated with dexamethasone treatment. The impact of dexamethasone on the main clinical outcome (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure within 30 days) was also explored in relation to inflammation risk. Preoperatively available covariates explained a minority of peak postoperative C-reactive protein variation and were not suitable for clinical application (R2\u2009=\u20090.058, P\u2009=\u20090.012); C-reactive protein before surgery (excluded above 10\u2009mg/L) was the most predictive covariate (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone increased as the inflammation risk increased (\u20130.689\u2009mg/L per unit predicted peak C-reactive protein, P\u2009=\u20090.002 for interaction). No treatment-effect heterogeneity was detected for the main clinical outcome (P\u2009=\u20090.167 for interaction). Overall, risk predictions from a model of inflammation after cardiac surgery were associated with the degree of peak postoperative C-reactive protein reduction derived from dexamethasone treatment. Future work should explore the impact of this phenomenon on clinical outcomes in larger surgical populations.",

A dedicated database compiled baseline, procedural, and follow-up data. Competing risk and adjusted outcome predictor analyses were conducted.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 689 patients were included (median age 65 years, 41.2% female, mean Risk of Paradoxical Embolism [RoPE] score 4.5). The procedural success rate was 99.4%. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range 1-5) years, 66 patients (9.6%) had died. CVE and stroke rates were 1.21 and 0.55 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 3.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.67-9.07; p=0.002) and atrial septal aneurysm (ASA; HR 5.25, 95% CI: 1.56-17.62; p=0.007) increased the CVE risk. New-onset AF occurred at a rate of 3.30 per 100 patient-years, with 51.3% within one month post-procedure. Older age (HR 1.05 per year, 95% CI: 1.00-1.09; p=0.023) and the absence of hypertension (HR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.19-3.57; p=0.010) were associated with an increased risk of AF.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOlder patients undergoing PFO closure had a relatively low rate of CVE and new-onset AF after a median follow-up of 2 years. The presence of diabetes, ASA, and a more advanced age determined an increased risk of adverse clinical events. These factors may be considered in the clinical decision-making process regarding PFO closure in this challenging population.",
