        "abstract": "The specific maneuvers that cause women to be incontinent can become important diagnostic aids and major factors in differentiating the effectiveness of the current pharmacological, surgical, and behavioral treatments for urinary incontinence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether meaningful dimensions could be identified within the multiple movements that produce urine loss in stress\u2010incontinent women. The Stress Incontinence Questionnaire (SIQ) was constructed from items derived from a compilation of studies and reports of urinary incontinence experts. An exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood method of extraction and a varimax rotation procedure identified four dimensions: active maneuvers, passive maneuvers, planned maneuvers, and unplanned maneuvers. The alpha coefficients for the four identified factors were acceptable and ranged from 0.71 to 0.79, with 8\u2010week test\u2010retest correlations for the active (r =.87), passive (r =.87), planned (r =.85), and the unplanned maneuvers (r =.60) all highly significant. The four factors also showed differential patterns of relationships with various gynecologic and urologic measures. These latter findings suggest that the factors identified in this study may be acknowledging different types or components of stress incontinence. In either case, the findings may have implications for treatment approaches to stress incontinence. Further research is needed to substantiate the various components of stress incontinence found in this study and the implications these findings may have for treatment of incontinence.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate obstetric risk factors of fecal incontinence among middle-aged women. METHODS: We conducted a mail survey of the Gazel cohort of volunteers for epidemiologic research. In 2000, a questionnaire on anal incontinence was mailed to 3,114 women who were then between the ages of 50 and 61 years; 2,640 (85%) women returned the completed questionnaire. Fecal incontinence was defined by involuntary loss of stool. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of obstetric and general risk factors. RESULTS: Prevalence of fecal incontinence in the past 12 months was 9.5% (250). Significant risk factors for fecal incontinence were completion of high school (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1\u20132.0), self-reported depression (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\u20132.7), overweight or obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.5 for BMI of 25\u201330, 95% CI 1.1\u20132.0; OR 1.6 for BMI more than 30, 95% CI 1.1\u20132.5), surgery for urinary incontinence (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.0\u20136.1), and anal surgery (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1\u20132.9). No obstetric variable (parity, mode of delivery, birth weight, episiotomy, or third-degree perineal tear) was significant. Prevalence of fecal incontinence was similar for nulliparous, primiparous, secundiparous, and multiparous women (11.3%, 9.0%, 9.0%, and 10.4%, respectively), and among parous women, it was similar for women with spontaneous vaginal, instrumental (at least one), or only cesarean deliveries (9.3%, 10.0%, and 6.6%, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our population of women in their 50s, fecal incontinence was not associated with either parity or mode of delivery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III",

        "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Fecal Incontinence in the Elderly",
        "abstract": "The incidence of fecal incontinence in elderly patients (age\u226565 years) ranges from 3.0%-16.9%, and is more prevalent in women. It is associated with significant psychosocial morbidity. The causes of fecal incontinence include sphincter injury, impaired sensation, incomplete evacuation, and neuropathy. The most common cause is obstetrical injury during forceps delivery. Some drugs such as oxybutinin, antidepressants, caffeine, and laxatives can also result in fecal incontinence. Eighty percent of patients have more than one causative abnormality. Fecal incontinence can be classified as passive incontinence, urge incontinence, or fecal seepage (soiling). Fecal seepage involves incomplete evacuation and impaired rectal sensation. When fecal incontinence is associated with urinary incontinence, it usually suggests significant pelvic floor abnormality. Physical examination should include a thorough perineal and rectal examination including the anocutaneous reflex. Laboratory data including anal manometry, anal endosonography, and pudendal nerve latency are usually informative for an accurate diagnosis. The treatment of fecal incontinence in the elderly should focus on treating underlying conditions, providing supportive measures, and following specific measures. Education and counseling for patients, including dietary control (with attention to fructose and caffeine), are important. Medications such as lomotil, loperamide, cholestyramine, amitryptyline, and alosetron are sometimes useful. Evidence-based data shows that biofeedback is beneficial in the elderly population. Surgical methods including sphincteroplasty, anterior repair, graciloplasty, and an artificial sphincter vary in treatment efficacy, and can be applied to the elderly population after deliberation of their comobidities. Other less invasive treatment modalities such as anal plugs, sphincter bulking, electrical stimulation, and sacra l nerve stimulation are sometimes particularly beneficial in improving the quality of life of elderly patients.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To compare the relative frequencies of constipation and other functional bowel disorders between patients with and without pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Methods: This was a case-control study design. Cases were patients with stage 3-4 POP presenting to a urogynecology clinic and controls were patients presenting to a general gynecology or women's health clinic for annual examinations with stage 0-1 vaginal support. Constipation disorders were defined using responses to the Rome II Modular Questionnaire for functional bowel disorders as well as predefined defecatory disorders. Results: 128 cases and 127 controls were enrolled. After controlling for race, education, and comorbidities, women with POP were more likely to report symptoms consistent with outlet constipation, including straining during a bowel movement (odds ratio [OR] 3.9, confidence interval [CI] 2.1-7.3), feeling of incomplete rectal emptying (OR 4.0, CI 2.1-7.7), a sensation that stool cannot be passed (OR 3.4, CI 1.7-6.7), and splinting (OR 2.7, CI 1.3-5.7). In spite of this, cases were just as likely to meet the criteria for functional constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation as controls but more likely to meet the criteria for IBS-any type (OR 3.8, CI 1.6-9.1) as women with POP reported more discomfort or pain in the abdomen (OR 3.4 CI 1.6-7.1) and >3 bowel movements per day (OR 2.9, CI 1.3-6.3). Conclusions: Patients with POP are more likely to have symptoms of outlet constipation and other functional bowel disorders compared with patients without POP. The Rome II criteria may not be an appropriate classification system for functional bowel disorders in patients with advanced POP.",

        "abstract": "Objectives The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of outlet constipation at 1 year after robotic sacrocolpopexy (RSCP) with and without a concomitant distal posterior repair (PR). We sought, first, to determine the rate of persistent outlet constipation and second, to determine de novo outlet constipation. Methods This was a cohort study of women who underwent RSCP alone versus RSCP + PR, at each surgeon\u2019s discretion, between November 2007 and February 2011 at an academic center. Specific questions in the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form correlating to outlet constipation and its colorectal-anal subscale scores were compared between and within groups. Rates of posterior compartment reoperation were assessed. Results Of the 77 women who underwent RSCP, 21 (27%) had a concomitant distal PR. Overall, there was significant improvement in pelvic floor function and quality of life at 1 year after surgery (P = 0.01). Preoperatively, outlet constipation was present in 63.4% of those who underwent RSCP only and in 53.3% of those with concomitant PR. Postoperatively at 1 year, 56% of preoperative outlet constipation resolved and 44% persisted (P = 0.001), with no differences between groups (RSCP vs RSCP + PR). The rate of postoperative de novo outlet constipation was 13.6%. At 1 year after RSCP, 18.2% of patients had symptomatic posterior prolapse, with no difference between both groups (P = 0.746). Overall, 11.7% underwent a subsequent PR, none of whom underwent PR with the initial RSCP (P = 0.104). Conclusions At 1 year after RSCP, there was a high rate of persistent outlet constipation and a moderate rate of de novo outlet constipation. Concomitant PR did not significantly affect these bowel symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Background: Repeat sacrocolpopexy (reSCP) for recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a rare and complex condition with little understanding of how to manage. Most authors recommend complete reSCP regardless of the underlying cause of the failure. This retrospective cohort study presents our management workflow and how to systematically approach this challenging situation. Methods: From 2017 to 2021, we analyzed all women undergoing surgery for recurrent POP after sacrocolpopexy at our tertiary referral hospital at the department of urogynecology. Preoperatively, all women underwent a structured work-up consisting of answering the validated German female pelvic floor questionnaires, a clinical examination utilizing the POP-Q staging system according to the International Continence Society (ICS), and a pelvic floor ultrasound. The surgical management was based on the preoperative findings and was adapted individually during surgery if indicated according to the estimated underlying problem for recurrence. Results: In total, 377 women underwent a primary laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. However, ten women presented with a symptomatic recurrent prolapse requiring further surgical intervention. A reSCP was performed in eight women, including two with additional laparoscopic paravaginal repair to correct the displaced mesh placement at initial surgery. A vaginal correction was indicated in two women with an isolated posterior compartment prolapse. The analysis demonstrates that reSCP has a low intraoperative complication rate and high subjective and objective success rates. Conclusions: We could demonstrate that individualized reSCP after initial SCP is a challenging yet feasible and safe treatment option, but there may be suitable alternatives. If women undergo pre- and intraoperative standardized problem-oriented examinations, we can often identify the cause of the recurrent prolapse. Tailored surgery must be subsequently performed.",
