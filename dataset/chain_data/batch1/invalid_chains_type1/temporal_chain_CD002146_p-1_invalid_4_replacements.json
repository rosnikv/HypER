        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension.\n\n\nDESIGN\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.\n\n\nSETTING\nCommunity-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\n--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nResearch in Western countries has shown most centenarians to be survivors with multiple comorbidities. However, Japanese centenarians' morbidity and its relationship to functional status has yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to clarify the association of morbidity with the physical and cognitive function of centenarians. We examined Tokyo-area centenarians to determine their kinds of morbidity profiles and how such morbidity related to their functional status.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 302 centenarians living in Tokyo (101.2+/-1.8 years; 65 men, 237 women), and assessed their physical status, morbidity, and use of medication. Activities of daily living and cognitive function were also assessed using the Barthel Index and the Clinical Dementia Rating.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMore than 95% of the centenarians had chronic diseases. Both the physical and cognitive functions were significantly higher in men. The present and previous illnesses most frequently included hypertension, heart disease, stroke, fractures, and cataracts. Fractures were observed significantly more frequently in women. Diabetes mellitus was uncommon. The physical and cognitive function of centenarians with a history of stroke or fracture were particularly poor, whereas those centenarians with hypertension tended to show a high level of physical and cognitive function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlmost all centenarians had chronic diseases. Stroke and fracture were correlated with poorer function; therefore, we hypothesize that prevention of stroke and fracture might improve functional status in the oldest-old.",

The Rotterdam Elderly Study is a single-center study of a cohort of 11,854 elderly persons > or = 55 years old. Baseline measurements included ultrasonic evaluation of plaques and vessel wall thickness of both carotid arteries and extensive measurements of cardiovascular risk factors. Mean IMT and lumen diameter of subjects with ISH (systolic pressure > or = 160 mm Hg and diastolic pressure < 90 mm Hg) among the first 1,000 participants (n = 33) and 66 age- and sex-matched control subjects were compared. None of the subjects were using antihypertensive drug treatment, and all were free of cardiovascular disease. Mean IMT of the right common carotid artery was significantly higher in those with ISH than in normotensive subjects, with a mean difference of 0.07 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01, 0.14). Results for the left carotid artery were similar (mean difference, 0.06 mm; 95% CI, -0.01, 0.13). The end-diastolic mean lumen diameter was significantly larger in subjects with ISH than in control subjects for both right and left sides, with a mean difference of 0.70 mm (95% CI, 0.38, 1.01) and 0.48 mm (95% CI, 0.17, 0.80), respectively. Adjustment for differences in body mass index, serum lipids, smoking, and fibrinogen did not materially change the findings.

        "title": "Methodological considerations of ultrasound investigation of intima\u2010media thickness and lumen diameter",
        "abstract": "The present development of noninvasive methods capable of quantitatively evaluating atherosclerotic manifestations in carotid and femoral arteries in a valid way will very probably be of great importance for clinical research relating to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and also for the evaluation of preventive measures in randomized clinical trials [ 1-61, With an ever-increasing number of studies ongoing, however, it is important to try to reach a consensus on standardized investigational routines. This will simplify comparisons between different groups, and also aid uniform interpretation of results. Pignoli et al. published their important observations on ultrasound measurement of intima-media thickness in 1986 [7]. They concluded that B-mode imaging represented a useful approach for measurement of the intima-media complex of human arteries in vivo. However, their experiments were performed on far walls only because the typical double-line pattern on which measurements were made could be more consistently and repeatably visualized on far walls compared with near walls. Therefore, they concluded that the results of their experiments could only be applied to far-wall measurements. With the present technique, however, the typical double-line pattern can often also be recorded from the near wall of the carotid artery and the question arises : can near-wall intima-media thickness be measured accurately from these images, e.g. can the adventitia-media interface and the intima-lumen interface be clearly defined from near-wall images ? The aim of the present paper is to discuss some of the fundamental principles of the ultrasound method that indicate that measurements preferably should be done on so-called leading edges of echoes, which permit accurate measurements only of the lumen Small structures, the dimensions of which are far beyond the resolution limits, can be detected and produce a clearly visible echo. The explanation for this phenomenon is that each tissue interface, no matter what size, produces an echo if there is sufficient difference in structure, i.e. in acoustic impedance. However, the dimension or thickness of any echo defining an interface is of no interest because it carries no biological information. The anatomical location of a biological structure is always defined by the leading edge, i.e. the upper demarcation line of an echo, and the thickness of an anatomical entity as the distance between the leading edges of two different echoes (Fig. 1). In order to accurately define the intima-media complex of the near wall, we must identify the leading edge of the echo from the interface between adventitia and media, and the leading edge from the echo from the interface between intima and lumen.",

        "title": "Low diastolic blood pressure and atherosclerosis in elderly subjects. The Rotterdam study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA low diastolic blood pressure has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The following proposed mechanisms underlie this phenomenon: a low diastolic pressure that compromises coronary blood flow, a low diastolic pressure that is due to deteriorating health, and a low diastolic pressure that is a consequence of stiffening of the large arteries. Atherosclerosis may be the link between stiffening of the arteries, a low diastolic pressure, and an increased cardiovascular risk.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo study whether a low diastolic blood pressure in older subjects is a reflection of atherosclerosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Rotterdam (the Netherlands) Study is a population-based follow-up study of 7983 subjects (age, > or = 55 years) who are living in the suburb of Ommoord of Rotterdam. Baseline measurements included ultrasonographic evaluation of the carotid arteries, measurement of blood pressure, and determination of other cardiovascular risk factors. The main cross-sectional analyses were performed among 930 subjects who currently were not using blood pressure-lowering drugs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA J-shaped association of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery with diastolic blood pressure was found with a nadir from 60 to 69 mm Hg. The intima-media thickness was increased in subjects with a diastolic pressure that was less than 60 mm Hg compared with that in subjects with a diastolic pressure that was between 60 and 69 mm Hg (a difference of 0.033 mm [95% confidence limits; 0.001, 0.065]). Beyond a diastolic pressure of 70 mm Hg, a gradual increase in the intima-media thickness was observed. The association was most pronounced among subjects with relatively high pulse pressures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults of the present study indicate the existence of a J-shaped association between carotid atherosclerosis and diastolic pressure. These findings support the hypothesis that in elderly subjects, a low diastolic pressure may be a reflection of widespread atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNoninvasive assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) is widely used in observational studies and trials as an intermediate or proxy end point for cardiovascular disease. However, data showing that IMT predicts cardiovascular disease are limited. We studied whether common carotid IMT is related to future stroke and myocardial infarction.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe used a nested case-control approach among 7983 subjects aged > or =55 years participating in the Rotterdam Study. At baseline (March 1990 through July 1993), ultrasound images of the common carotid artery were stored on videotape. Determination of incident myocardial infarction and stroke was predominantly based on hospital discharge records. Analysis (logistic regression) was based on 98 myocardial infarctions and 95 strokes that were registered before December 31, 1994. IMT was measured from videotape for all case subjects and a sample of 1373 subjects who remained free from myocardial infarction and stroke during follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 years. Results were adjusted for age and sex. Stroke risk increased gradually with increasing IMT. The odds ratio for stroke per standard deviation increase (0.163 mm) was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.82). For myocardial infarction, an odds ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.16 to 1.78) was found. When subjects with a previous myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded, odds ratios were 1.57 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.94) for stroke and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.92) for myocardial infarction. Additional adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors attenuated these associations: 1.34 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.67) and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.58), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study, based on a short follow-up period, provides evidence that an increased common carotid IMT is associated with future cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "Objective. The goal of this study was to compare internal carotid artery (ICA) intima\u2010media thickness (IMT) with common carotid artery (CCA) IMT as global markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. Cross\u2010sectional measurements of the mean CCA IMT and maximum ICA IMT were made on ultrasound images acquired from the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 3316; mean age, 58 years; 52.7% women). Linear regression models were used to study the associations of the Framingham risk factors with CCA and ICA IMT. Multivariate logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to compare the associations of prevalent CVD with CCA and ICA IMT and determine sensitivity and specificity. Results. The association between age and the mean CCA IMT corresponded to an increase of 0.007 mm/y; the increase was 0.037 mm/y for the ICA IMT. Framingham risk factors accounted for 28.6% and 27.5% of the variability in the CCA and ICA IMT, respectively. Age and gender contributed 23.5% to the variability of the CCA IMT and 22.5% to that of the ICA IMT, with the next most important factor being systolic blood pressure (1.9%) for the CCA IMT and smoking (1.6%) for the ICA IMT. The CCA IMT and ICA IMT were statistically significant predictors of prevalent CVD, with the ICA IMT having a larger area under the ROC curve (0.756 versus 0.695). Conclusions. Associations of risk factors with CCA and ICA IMT are slightly different, and both are independently associated with prevalent CVD. Their value for predicting incident cardiovascular events needs to be compared in outcome studies.",

Cardiovascular-disease outcomes were evaluated for an average follow-up of 7.2 years. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were generated for intima-media thickness and risk factors. We evaluated the reclassification of cardiovascular disease on the basis of the 8-year Framingham risk score category (low, intermediate, or high) after adding intima-media thickness values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 296 participants had a cardiovascular event. The risk factors of the Framingham risk score predicted these events, with a C statistic of 0.748 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.719 to 0.776). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease with a 1-SD increase in the mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.24), with a nonsignificant change in the C statistic of 0.003 (95% CI, 0.000 to 0.007); the corresponding hazard ratio for the maximum intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.29), with a modest increase in the C statistic of 0.009 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.016). The net reclassification index increased significantly after addition of intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery (7.6%, P<0.001) but not intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (0.0%, P=0.99).

        "abstract": "Carotid intima-media thickness assessed by ultrasonography of carotid arteries is a safe, non-expensive, feasible and accurate method for detecting early signs of atherosclerosis and carotid intima-media thickness and change in carotid intima-media thickness over time reflect cardiovascular disease risk. Technical aspects impact on the measurement, variability and interpretation of carotid intima-media thickness. These include device aspects, inter- and intra-sonographer variability and the ultrasound protocol used. The mean common carotid intima-media thickness and the mean maximum common carotid intima-media thickness are the most widely used carotid intima-media thickness measurements. Common carotid intima-media thickness values of around 0.5\u2009mm are considered \u2018normal\u2019 in young adults. Values are higher in men than in women, in African\u2013Americans than Caucasians and increase with age. Carotid intima-media thickness values at or above the 75th percentile of a reference population indicate increased cardiovascular risk. Guidelines differ in their recommendations for the use of carotid intima-media thickness measurements for risk assessment in primary prevention because evidence suggesting that it improves upon conventional risk scores is inconsistent. Carotid intima-media thickness is frequently used in clinical trials as a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events on the assumption that regression or slowed progression of carotid intima-media thickness, induced by cardiovascular risk interventions, reflects a reduction in cardiovascular events. However, further data are required to confirm this linear relationship. No international guidelines exist on the use of carotid intima-media thickness as a research tool. Quality control in acquisition, measurement and interpretation of carotid intima-media thickness are important considerations and the carotid intima-media thickness protocol used should be determined by the research question under investigation.",

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid machine learning method named Subset Learning (S-learning) to predict and discover the risk factors of these different stages. The S-learning algorithm can elucidate the variables that have significant influence on the outcome of carotid atherosclerotic.
