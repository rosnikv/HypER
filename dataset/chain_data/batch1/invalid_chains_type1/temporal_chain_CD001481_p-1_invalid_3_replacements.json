By chart review 1,369 patient-practitioner encounters were examined. Physicians identified less symptoms and signs in their patients and prescribed less non-drug therapies than did non-physicians. Likewise, at follow-up visits, physicians tended to document less follow-up of these types of problems and therapies than non-physicians. When examining the interaction between practitioners, the highest rates of follow-up of all types of problems and therapies were found when the same practitioner saw the patient at two successive visits to the same clinic. When a physician saw a patient following a previous visit to a nurse practitioner, there was a significant drop-off in the follow-up rate of problems and therapies. However, when a nurse practitioner saw the patient following a previous visit to a physician, the drop-off in follow-up rates was not as striking. These findings indicate that the skills of physician and nonphysician practitioners are potentially complementary. However, this potential is not fully exploited, particularly by physicians.",

When random sampling is not possible, providers should be selected using variables known to correlate with quality of care; (5) random assignment of patients to providers is strongly recommended, taking care to use clients new to both providers; (6) use of multiple data sources is recommended to decrease the current heavy reliance on audits; (7) conclusions should point out differential findings identifying those which favor physicians, those which favor nurse practi tioners, and those identifying no differences between providers.",

While the effectiveness of rural providers and hospitals has been evaluated in previous studies, this study focuses on poor birth outcomes in a population of rural residents, including those who leave rural areas for obstetrical care. Rural and urban differences in rates of inadequate prenatal care, neonatal death, and low birth weight were examined in the general population and in subpopulations stratified by risk and race using data from five years (1984-88) of birth and infant death certificates from Washington state. Also examined were care and outcome differences between rural women delivering in rural hospitals and those delivering in urban facilities. Bivariate analyses were confirmed with logistic regression. Results indicate that rural residents in the general population and in various subpopulations had similar or lower rates of poor outcome than did urban residents but experienced higher rates of inadequate prenatal care than did urban residents. Rural residents delivering in urban hospitals had higher rates of poor outcomes than those delivering in rural hospitals. We conclude that rural residence is not associated with greater risk of poor birth outcome. White and nonwhite differences appear to exceed any rural and urban resident differences in rates of poor birth outcome.",

Yet scarce data exist on actual patterns of prenatal care use in nonmetropolitan areas. This study provides national estimates of prenatal care use among African American, White, and Hispanic women who delivered in 1988 in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas of the United States. This study finds that nonmetropolitan residents are no more likely than metropolitan residents to go without care, to enter care late, or to make fewer visits. Nonmetropolitan residents are more likely to receive \"inadequate\" prenatal care as measured by the Kotelchuck Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, with Hispanic residents having the highest rates of inadequate care. These findings are consistent with recent state-level reports, and they suggest the need to target prenatal care policies for populations in greatest need.",

        "abstract": "Adequate prenatal care is known to reduce the risks of low birth weight and neonatal death, yet nearly one quarter of all women giving birth in the United States receive delayed, inadequate or no prenatal care. This suboptimal use of prenatal care has contributed to rates of low birth weight and neonatal mortality higher than those in most other industrialized nations. This paper examines the relationships among race/ethnicity, residence, maternal sociodemographic and medical risk characteristics, and use of prenatal care in the United States. Using data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey, this study found important differences in prenatal care use by race/ethnicity and residence, as well as interactive effects of these variables. Single marital status, nonmetropolitan residence, poverty, low level of education, and no insurance were more strongly associated with inadequate prenatal care for whites and Hispanics than for blacks. Nonmetropolitan residents were more likely to receive inadequate care, regardless of race/ethnicity or sociodemographic characteristics. Predicted probabilities of prenatal care use by race/ethnicity and residence showed that, regardless of risk, nonmetropolitan Hispanic women had the highest probability of obtaining inadequate prenatal care. Results highlight the continued importance of race/ethnicity and rural residence in determining prenatal care use and the need to design interventions targeted to these populations.",

Methods We designed a prospective, comparative survey study of patient perception of clinician communication using a convenience sampling of health professionals enrolled in an interprofessional medical Spanish course. We analyzed the patient-reported quality of communication skills from 214 clinical encounters and self-evaluations of 18 clinicians with Spanish- and English-speaking patients. Results Communication scores were lower for Spanish vs. English encounters as reported by both patients and clinicians (p<0.001).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo measure what patients with Spanish language preference and limited English proficiency value most when selecting a prenatal care clinician.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA discrete choice experiment was administered at two large academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants were identified by electronic medical record, had preferred Spanish language and self-identified limited English proficiency, and either were pregnant with a completed fetal anatomy scan or had given birth within the past 12 months at the time of the study. The discrete choice experiment consisted of eight attributes to consider when selecting a prenatal care clinician: clinician Spanish proficiency, type of interpreter used, interpersonal dynamics (ie, making patients feel seen, heard, and cared for), cultural concordance, continuity of care, shared decision making, distance from home, and wait times for appointments. Descriptive statistics of demographic variables were calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to analyze discrete choice experiment data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe attributes that were most important to 166 participants when choosing their prenatal care clinician were interpersonal dynamics within the patient-clinician dyad and clinician Spanish language proficiency (average importance 21.4/100 and 20.8/100, respectively). Of lowest importance were wait time to receive an appointment and continuity of care (average importance 5.1 and 6.1, respectively). Although participants highly preferred that their clinician be \"fluent or near fluent in Spanish,\" the second most preferred option was having a clinician with only basic Spanish proficiency rather than a more advanced level of Spanish proficiency with some misunderstandings.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study demonstrates the importance of positive clinician-patient interpersonal dynamics and language-concordant care for patients with Spanish language preference in prenatal care. Promoting equitable patient-centered care for patients with limited English proficiency requires responding to preferences regarding clinician language proficiency and demonstrating attentiveness, empathy, and concern for prenatal care experiences.",
