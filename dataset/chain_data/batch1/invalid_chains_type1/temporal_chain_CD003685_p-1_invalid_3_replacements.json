        "title": "Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEach year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.",

        "title": "Assessment and management of pain in haemophilia patients",
        "abstract": "Summary.\u2002 Haemophilia patients experience acute pain during joint bleeds and chronic pain from haemophilic arthropathy. More than 50% of haemophilia patients have painful joints that cause disability and impair quality of life. Unfortunately, only a few clinical studies have investigated the non\u2010pharmacological or pharmacological treatments for pain or the adverse effects of pain on the health and quality of life of children and adults with haemophilia. There are no detailed algorithms or guidelines for pain management in haemophilia patients, and treatment is largely empirical. Therefore, a standardized approach to the management of pain in haemophilia patients is needed. This approach should include a close relationship between pain specialists and the staffs at haemophilia treatment centres; validated instruments specific to haemophilia for assessing pain, quality of life and disability; and stepwise algorithms/protocols for treatment of chronic vs. acute pain and prophylactic vs early treatment. A pain treatment protocol should include a definition of the problem of pain and best practices for physicians. A call to action is needed to standardize treatment approaches to pain and to develop algorithms/protocols for the management of pain in haemophilia patients. This review will highlight the prevalence and devastating impact of pain in haemophilia patients, currently available treatment options and identify the unmet needs for pain management.",

        "title": "Nutraceuticals: Potential for Chondroprotection and Molecular Targeting of Osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease and a leading cause of adult disability. There is no cure for OA, and no effective treatments which arrest or slow its progression. Current pharmacologic treatments such as analgesics may improve pain relief but do not alter OA disease progression. Prolonged consumption of these drugs can result in severe adverse effects. Given the nature of OA, life-long treatment will likely be required to arrest or slow its progression. Consequently, there is an urgent need for OA disease-modifying therapies which also improve symptoms and are safe for clinical use over long periods of time. Nutraceuticals\u2014food or food products that provide medical or health benefits, including the prevention and/or treatment of a disease\u2014offer not only favorable safety profiles, but may exert disease- and symptom-modification effects in OA. Forty-seven percent of OA patients use alternative medications, including nutraceuticals. This review will overview the efficacy and mechanism of action of commonly used nutraceuticals, discuss recent experimental and clinical data on the effects of select nutraceuticals, such as phytoflavonoids, polyphenols, and bioflavonoids on OA, and highlight their known molecular actions and limitations of their current use. We will conclude with a proposed novel nutraceutical-based molecular targeting strategy for chondroprotection and OA treatment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare the efficacies of oral glucosamine, chondroitin, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin, acetaminophen and celecoxib on the treatment of knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library and the reference lists of relevant articles published from inception to October 23, 2017. A Bayesian hierarchical random effects model was used to examine the overall effect size among mixed multiple interventions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 61 randomised controlled trials of patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. There was no obvious difference in the results between the traditional meta-analysis and the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis demonstrated that celecoxib was most likely the best option (SMD, -0.32 [95% CI, -0.38 to -0.25]) for pain, followed by the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. For physical function, all interventions were significantly superior to oral placebo except for acetaminophen. In terms of stiffness, glucosamine (SMD, -0.36 [95% CI, -0.67 to -0.06]) and celecoxib (SMD, -0.29 [95% CI, -0.51 to -0.08]) were significantly better compared to placebo. In view of safety, compared to placebo only, celecoxib and acetaminophen presented significant differences.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGiven the effectiveness of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and symptomatic slow-acting drugs, oral celecoxib is more effective than placebo on relieving pain and improving physical function, followed by the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. Acetaminophen is likely the least efficacious intervention option. This information, accompanied by the tolerability and economic costs of the included treatments, would be conducive to making decisions for clinicians.",

        "abstract": "Glucosamine (GLU) is a natural compound found in cartilage, and supplementation with glucosamine has been shown to improve joint heath and has been linked to reduced mortality rates. GLU is poorly absorbed and may exhibit functional properties in the gut. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of glucosamine on gastrointestinal function as well as changes in fecal microbiota and metabolome. Healthy males (n = 6) and females (n = 5) (33.4 \u00b1 7.7 years, 174.1 \u00b1 12.0 cm, 76.5 \u00b1 12.9 kg, 25.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg/m2, n = 11) completed two supplementation protocols that each spanned three weeks separated by a washout period that lasted two weeks. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion, participants ingested a daily dose of GLU hydrochloride (3000 mg GlucosaGreen\u00ae, TSI Group Ltd., Missoula, MT, USA) or maltodextrin placebo. Study participants completed bowel habit and gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires in addition to providing a stool sample that was analyzed for fecal microbiota and metabolome at baseline and after the completion of each supplementation period. GLU significantly reduced stomach bloating and showed a trend towards reducing constipation and hard stools. Phylogenetic diversity (Faith\u2019s PD) and proportions of Pseudomonadaceae, Peptococcaceae, and Bacillaceae were significantly reduced following GLU consumption. GLU supplementation significantly reduced individual, total branched-chain, and total amino acid excretion, with no glucosamine being detected in any of the fecal samples. GLU had no effect on fecal short-chain fatty acids levels. GLU supplementation provided functional gut health benefits and induced fecal microbiota and metabolome changes.",

        "title": "Glucosamine effects on platelet aggregation of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: in vitro assays.",
        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and endothelium dysfunction are related to platelet hyperactivity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients. Glucosamine (GlcN) has inhibitory effects on platelets of animals and healthy donors, but this role in platelets from T2D patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the GlcN in vitro effects on platelet aggregation in T2D patients and healthy donors. Donors\u00b4 and T2D patients' samples were analyzed through flow cytometry, Western blot, and platelet aggregometry. Platelet aggregation was induced using ADP and thrombin, with or without GlcN, N-Acetyl-glucosamine, galactose, or fucose. GlcN inhibited ADP and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, while the other carbohydrates did not. GlcN suppressed the second wave of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. No differences in the percent of inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by GlcN were found between donors and T2D patients, but this effect was significantly higher in healthy donors using thrombin as an agonist. In addition, GlcN increased protein O-GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc) in the platelets from T2D patients but not in healthy donors. In conclusion, GlcN inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by ADP and thrombin for both study groups and increased O-GlcNAc in platelets from T2D patients. Further studies are required to evaluate the possible use of GlcN as an antiplatelet agent.",
