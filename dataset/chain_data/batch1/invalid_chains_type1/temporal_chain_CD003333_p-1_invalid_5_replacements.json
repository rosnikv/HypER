        "abstract": "AIM\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the antithrombotic treatment adopted after coronary stenting in patients requiring long-term anticoagulation.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe analysed retrospectively all consecutive patients on warfarin therapy (n = 239, mean age 70 years, men 74%) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 2003-04 in six hospitals. An age- and sex-matched control group with similar disease presentation (unstable or stable symptoms) was selected from the study period. Primary endpoint was defined as the occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 12 months. Warfarin treatment was an independent predictor of both primary endpoint (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0, P = 0.05) and major bleeding (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.3, P = 0.02). Triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was the most common (48%) option in stented patients in warfarin group, and there was a significant (P = 0.004) difference between the drug combinations in stent thrombosis with the highest (15.2%) incidence in patients receiving warfarin plus aspirin combination.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study shows that the prognosis is unsatisfactory in warfarin-treated patients irrespective of the drug combination used. Aspirin plus warfarin combination seems to be inadequate to prevent stent thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended after coronary stenting (PCI-S). There is scant evidence defining optimal post-PCI-S antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom oral anticoagulation (OAC) is mandated. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the antithrombotic strategies for this population, we conducted a systematic review of the available evidence in patients treated with OAC undergoing PCI-S. AF was the most frequent indication for OAC. Post-PCI-S management was highly variable, and triple therapy with warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel was the most frequent and effective combination. Warfarin plus aspirin alone was not sufficiently effective in the early period after PCI-S and should not be prescribed. While acknowledging that the optimal antithrombotic treatment for patients with AF at medium or high thromboembolic risk undergoing PCI-S is currently undefined, triple therapy of warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel is currently recommended, although associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. Restrictive use of drug-eluting stent is also recommended, due to the need for prolonged multiple-drug antithrombotic therapy which may increase the bleeding risk. Whether the combination of warfarin and clopidogrel (without aspirin) will preserve efficacy and produce less bleeding is an important issue still needing to be addressed.",

Outside of clinical trials, few published data describe the magnitude and nature of hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo estimate the numbers and rates of emergency department (ED) visits for hemorrhage-related AEs (hemorrhage or evaluation for potential hemorrhage) from DAT in the United States and put them in the context of those from warfarin, we analyzed AEs from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project, 2006-2008, and outpatient prescribing from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2006-2007.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBased on 384 cases, there were an estimated 7654 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3325-11 983) ED visits annually for hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT compared with 2926 cases and an estimated 60 575 (36 117-85 033) ED visits from warfarin. Approximately 60% of ED visits for DAT consisted of epistaxis or other minor hemorrhages (eg, bleeding from small cuts). The risk of hospitalization for ED visits involving acute hemorrhages was not significantly different between DAT and warfarin (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38-1.08). The estimated rate of ED visits involving acute hemorrhages from DAT was 1.2 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits vs 2.5 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits for warfarin (risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings indicate that the acute hemorrhagic risk with DAT is clinically significant and reinforce the importance of practitioners and patients recognizing and anticipating this risk.",

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, and is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Patients' absolute risk of stroke depends on the presence or absence of additional risk factors as well as AF, including prior thromboembolism, increased age, hypertension, diabetes, structural heart disease, and female sex. The risk to benefit ratio of stroke prevention therapy differs according to the patients' absolute risk. There is evidence that even those with an estimated annual stroke risk of 2%-4%, who were once classified as medium risk, would benefit from anticoagulation and should be included in an expanded high-risk category. Alternatives to anti- coagulation include the restoration of sinus rhythm and left atrial appendage surgery, but these may not be suitable for many high-risk patients with comorbidities. Antiplatelets are substantially less effective than anticoagulation and cause similar rates of bleeding. Self-monitoring and computerized decision support increases the time in therapeutic range and effectiveness of vitamin K antagonists. Novel oral anticoagulants including dabigatran, rivoraxaban, and apixaban have been shown to be noninferior to warfarin, do not require monitoring, and increase the prescribing options for stroke prevention in AF.",

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that evaluated the use of warfarin in patients with AF and CKD to evaluate the risks of ischemic stroke/thromboembolism, major bleeding, and mortality.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases were electronically searched through January 12, 2015. Additionally, a manual search was performed for relevant references. Random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. CKD was divided into non-end-stage CKD and end-stage CKD (on renal replacement therapy) and separate analyses were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen publications from 11 cohorts (six retrospective and five prospective) including >48,500 total patients with >11,600 warfarin users were included in the meta-analysis. In patients with AF and non-end-stage CKD, warfarin resulted in a lower risk of ischemic stroke/thromboembolism (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.89; P = .004) and mortality (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59-0.72; P < .00001), but had no effect on major bleeding (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.88-1.49; P = .31).

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate how treatment with DOACs for VTE affects thrombosis and bleeding outcomes compared to warfarin in CKD and dialysis patients. Data Sources: A literature search was conducted for studies evaluating VTE and bleeding outcomes with DOAC use in CKD and dialysis patients. Searches conducted through EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to September 22, 2020. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series with \u226510 patients included. Data Synthesis: From 7286 studies, nine studies met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and warfarin for reducing recurrent VTE and bleeding events in moderate CKD patients. The risk of overall major bleeding increased when the degree of kidney impairment increased. There was no significant difference between apixaban and warfarin for VTE outcomes in dialysis patients. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: There continues to be a controversial debate whether it may be more beneficial to use DOACs versus warfarin in CKD/dialysis patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk vs benefit of using DOACs in the CKD/ESKD population should continue to be evaluated for each individual patient. Conclusion: Apixaban may be used cautiously as an alternative in acute VTE treatment in severe CKD patients. Insufficient evidence is available to suggest the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in this patient population. The benefit of using DOACs in this population for VTE treatment should be weighed against the potential bleeding risk in patients with CKD.",

The clotting factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) and the direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban and dabigatran) have shown non-inferiority in preventing thromboembolic events and a superior safety profile in terms of bleeding in several trials when compared to warfarin [2-6].

The optimal therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with ESKD is unknown. Objective To compare the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE. Design, Setting and Participants New\u2010user, active\u2010comparator retrospective United States population\u2010based cohort with inverse probability of treatment weighting, using the United States Renal Data System data from 2014 to 2018. We included adults with ESKD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who were newly initiated on apixaban or warfarin for an acute VTE. Main Outcome and Measures The coprimary outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all\u2010cause mortality within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation. Secondary outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. The primary analyses were based on intent\u2010to\u2010treat defined by the first drug received and accounted for competing risks of death. Sensitivity analyses included varied follow\u2010up time, as\u2010treated analyses, and dose\u2010specific apixaban subgroups. Results The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70\u20130.94), intracranial bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48\u20130.98), and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69\u20130.96).

        "abstract": "Background: Apixaban has been increasingly utilized for various FDA-approved indications, including stroke prevention and venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis. However, the safety and efficacy of its use in this population is not well established. Hence, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of apixaban by examining outcomes in this population. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study that involved adults with ESKD who were on hemodialysis and prescribed apixaban from our hospital\u2019s outpatient pharmacy between 1 May 2015, and 31 March 2022. Demographics, apixaban indications, dose appropriateness, concomitant antiplatelet use, and comorbidities data were collected. Bleeding and thromboembolic events were also collected. Results: Sixty-six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 50% of them males. Median age was 71 (63.5\u201382) years, and the median BMI 28.2 (59.5\u201386.25) kg/m2. The median follow-up time was 5 (1.9\u201312.3) months. Concomitant antiplatelet use (39.4%) and high medication adherence (84.8%) were observed. During follow-up, major bleeding events occurred in 15.2% of cases, with minor bleeding being more common (36.4%), and VTE and stroke events occurred in 4.5% of cases; appropriate dosing was prevalent (62.1%), and there was an overall all-cause mortality rate of 34.8%. Most patients received a 2.5 mg BID apixaban dose (56.1%), including both NVAF and VTE groups. Notably, the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that weight, and daily dose were insignificant predictors of bleeding events (p = 0.104, 0.591), however, the BMI was the main independent risk factor for bleeding in this population [OR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8\u20130.99; p = 0.023]. Conclusions: Our analysis of apixaban-treated ESKD patients highlights that the risk of bleeding is significant, and BMI was the main independent risk factor. A larger prospective study is needed to confirm our findings.",
