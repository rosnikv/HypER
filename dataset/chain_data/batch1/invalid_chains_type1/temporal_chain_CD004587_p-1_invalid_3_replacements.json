        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRestenosis after coronary stenting necessitates repeated percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedures. The delivery of paclitaxel to the site of vascular injury may reduce the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt 73 U.S. centers, we enrolled 1314 patients who were receiving a stent in a single, previously untreated coronary-artery stenosis (vessel diameter, 2.5 to 3.75 mm; lesion length, 10 to 28 mm) in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A total of 652 patients were randomly assigned to receive a bare-metal stent, and 662 to receive an identical-appearing, slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent. Angiographic follow-up was prespecified at nine months in 732 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn terms of base-line characteristics, the two groups were well matched. Diabetes mellitus was present in 24.2 percent of patients; the mean reference-vessel diameter was 2.75 mm, and the mean lesion length was 13.4 mm. A mean of 1.08 stents (length, 21.8 mm) were implanted per patient. The rate of ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization at nine months was reduced from 12.0 percent with the implantation of a bare-metal stent to 4.7 percent with the implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.59; P<0.001). Target-lesion revascularization was required in 3.0 percent of the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent, as compared with 11.3 percent of the group that received a bare-metal stent (relative risk, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.43; P<0.001). The rate of angiographic restenosis was reduced from 26.6 percent to 7.9 percent with the paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.46; P<0.001). The nine-month composite rates of death from cardiac causes or myocardial infarction (4.7 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively) and stent thrombosis (0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively) were similar in the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent and the group that received a bare-metal stent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with bare-metal stents, the slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent is safe and markedly reduces the rates of clinical and angiographic restenosis at nine months.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been in clinical use for nearly a decade; however, the relative short- and long-term efficacy and safety of DES compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) and among the DES types are less well defined. Methods and Results\u2014 PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for randomized clinical trials, until March 2012, that compared any of the Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved durable stent and polymer DES (sirolimus-eluting stent [SES], paclitaxel-eluting stent [PES], everolimus-eluting stent [EES], zotarolimus-eluting stent [ZES], and ZES-Resolute [ZES-R]) with each other or against BMS for de novo coronary lesions, enrolling at least 100 patients and with follow-up of at least 6 months. Short-term (\u2a7d1 year) and long-term efficacy (target-vessel revascularization, target-lesion revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis) outcomes were evaluated and trial-level data pooled by both mixed-treatment comparison and direct comparison analyses. From 76 randomized clinical trials with 117 762 patient-years of follow-up, compared with BMS, each DES reduced long-term target-vessel revascularization (39%\u201361%), but the magnitude varied by DES type (EES\u223cSES\u223cZES-R>PES\u223cZES>BMS), with a >42% probability that EES had the lowest target-vessel revascularization rate. There was no increase in the risk of any long-term safety outcomes, including stent thrombosis, with any DES (versus BMS). In addition, there was reduction in myocardial infarction (all DES except PES versus BMS) and stent thrombosis (with EES versus BMS: Rate ratio, 0.51; 95% credibility interval, 0.35\u20130.73). The safest DES appeared to be EES (>86% probability), with reduction in myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis compared with BMS. Short-term outcomes were similar to long-term outcomes, with SES, ZES-R, and everolimus-eluting stent being the most efficacious and EES being the safest stent. Conclusions\u2014 DES are highly efficacious at reducing the risk of target-vessel revascularization without an increase in any safety outcomes, including stent thrombosis. However, among the DES types, there were considerable differences, such that EES, SES, and ZES-R were the most efficacious and EES was the safest stent.",

        "abstract": "Over the last few years, drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for the management of obstructive cardiovascular disease. The dictum of this novel technology is that effective prevention of restenosis can be achieved by the short-term transfer of antiproliferative drug to local arterial tissue by means of a single prolonged balloon angioplasty dilatation. Its main attraction is that no foreign body is implanted eliminating thus the risk of late inflammatory response to device components without preventing positive remodeling. Here, we discuss the evidence regarding the effectiveness of DCB in different lesion types and clinical settings as well as the types of DCB commercially available or under development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDual antiplatelet therapy is recommended after coronary stenting to prevent thrombotic complications, yet the benefits and risks of treatment beyond 1 year are uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients were enrolled after they had undergone a coronary stent procedure in which a drug-eluting stent was placed. After 12 months of treatment with a thienopyridine drug (clopidogrel or prasugrel) and aspirin, patients were randomly assigned to continue receiving thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo for another 18 months; all patients continued receiving aspirin. The coprimary efficacy end points were stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) during the period from 12 to 30 months. The primary safety end point was moderate or severe bleeding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 9961 patients were randomly assigned to continue thienopyridine treatment or to receive placebo. Continued treatment with thienopyridine, as compared with placebo, reduced the rates of stent thrombosis (0.4% vs. 1.4%; hazard ratio, 0.29 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.17 to 0.48]; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (4.3% vs. 5.9%; hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85]; P<0.001). The rate of myocardial infarction was lower with thienopyridine treatment than with placebo (2.1% vs. 4.1%; hazard ratio, 0.47; P<0.001). The rate of death from any cause was 2.0% in the group that continued thienopyridine therapy and 1.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.85]; P=0.05). The rate of moderate or severe bleeding was increased with continued thienopyridine treatment (2.5% vs. 1.6%, P=0.001). An elevated risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction was observed in both groups during the 3 months after discontinuation of thienopyridine treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDual antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year after placement of a drug-eluting stent, as compared with aspirin therapy alone, significantly reduced the risks of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events but was associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

        "abstract": "Aims The aim of this study is to develop models to aid the decision to prolong dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) that requires balancing an individual patient\u2019s potential benefits and harms. Methods and results Using population-based electronic health records (EHRs) (CALIBER, England, 2000\u201310), of patients evaluated 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (MI), we developed (n\u2009=\u200912 694 patients) and validated (n\u2009=\u20095613) prognostic models for cardiovascular (cardiovascular death, MI or stroke) events and three different bleeding endpoints. We applied trial effect estimates to determine potential benefits and harms of DAPT and the net clinical benefit of individuals. Prognostic models for cardiovascular events (c-index: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.77)) and bleeding (c index 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.77)) were well calibrated: 3-year risk of cardiovascular events was 16.5% overall (5.2% in the lowest- and 46.7% in the highest-risk individuals), while for major bleeding, it was 1.7% (0.3% in the lowest- and 5.4% in the highest-risk patients). For every 10 000 patients treated per year, we estimated 249 (95% CI: 228, 269) cardiovascular events prevented and 134 (95% CI: 87, 181) major bleeding events caused in the highest-risk patients, and 28 (95% CI: 19, 37) cardiovascular events prevented and 9 (95% CI: 0, 20) major bleeding events caused in the lowest-risk patients. There was a net clinical benefit of prolonged DAPT in 63\u201399% patients depending on how benefits and harms were weighted. Conclusion Prognostic models for cardiovascular events and bleeding using population-based EHRs may help to personalise decisions for prolonged DAPT 1-year following acute MI.",

        "abstract": "Background: The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) risk score was developed from the DAPT trial to inform the optimal duration of DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention. We assessed the performance of the DAPT score in the ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy with drug-eluting stents) all-comers registry and tested the utility of additional predictors of adverse events. Methods and Results: Outcomes between 1 and 2 years were examined according to DAPT score \u22652 versus <2, adjusted for DAPT continuation as a time-dependent variable. To assess the incremental utility of variables not included in the DAPT score, baseline high platelet reactivity was added to the ischemia model, and high platelet reactivity, baseline hemoglobin, and warfarin use 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention were added to the bleeding model. Among 8582 patients enrolled in ADAPT-DES, 5397 were event-free after 1 year. Between 1 and 2 years, ischemic (myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis) and bleeding events occurred in 75 (1.5%) and 124 (2.3%) patients, respectively. Patients with higher DAPT scores (\u22652 versus <2) had higher rates of myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis (1.9% versus 1.1%; P=0.01) and similar rates of bleeding (2.2% versus 2.4%, respectively; P=0.79). For the prediction of myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis, bleeding and death, DAPT score \u22652 had sensitivities of 57%, 41%, and 56%, respectively; specificities of 58%, 57%, and 58%, respectively; positive predictive values of 1.9%, 2.2%, and 2.1%, respectively; and negative predictive values of 99%, 98%, and 99%, respectively. Addition of baseline high platelet reactivity to the DAPT score did not improve discrimination for ischemic events. Addition of high platelet reactivity and 2 other bleeding covariates to the DAPT score marginally improved discrimination. Conclusions: In ADAPT-DES, the DAPT score was predictive of ischemic events between 1 and 2 years after drug-eluting stents. Prediction of bleeding improved marginally after addition of variables not incorporated in the DAPT score.",

        "title": "Patient-tailored antithrombotic therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention",
        "abstract": "Abstract Dual antiplatelet therapy has long been the standard of care in preventing coronary and cerebrovascular thrombotic events in patients with chronic coronary syndrome and acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, but choosing the optimal treatment duration and composition has become a major challenge. Numerous studies have shown that certain patients benefit from either shortened or extended treatment duration. Furthermore, trials evaluating novel antithrombotic strategies, such as P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy, low-dose factor Xa inhibitors on top of antiplatelet therapy, and platelet function- or genotype-guided (de-)escalation of treatment, have shown promising results. Current guidelines recommend risk stratification for tailoring treatment duration and composition. Although several risk stratification methods evaluating ischaemic and bleeding risk are available to clinicians, such as the use of risk scores, platelet function testing , and genotyping, risk stratification has not been broadly adopted in clinical practice. Multiple risk scores have been developed to determine the optimal treatment duration, but external validation studies have yielded conflicting results in terms of calibration and discrimination and there is limited evidence that their adoption improves clinical outcomes. Likewise, platelet function testing and genotyping can provide useful prognostic insights, but trials evaluating treatment strategies guided by these stratification methods have produced mixed results. This review critically appraises the currently available antithrombotic strategies and provides a viewpoint on the use of different risk stratification methods alongside clinical judgement in current clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The values of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) score in the stratification of ischemic risk were assessed in this study. Methods A total of 489 patients with acute coronary syndrome who received DAPT at discharge between June 2020 and August 2020 were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization, all-cause death, or ischemic stroke during a 27-month follow-up period. Results Patients with ESC-defined high-risk showed a significantly higher risk of MACE (HR 2.75, 95% CI 1.78\u20134.25), all-cause death (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.14\u20135.43), and recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization (HR 2.80, 95% CI 1.57\u20134.99) than those with ESC-defined low/medium-risk during follow-up. The results of landmark analysis showed that patients in the high-risk group had a significantly higher risk of MACE (HR 2.80,95 CI% 1.57\u20134.97), recurrent ACS or unplanned revascularization (HR 3.19,95 CI% 1.47\u20136.93) within one year, and a higher risk of MACE (HR 2.69,95 CI% 1.38\u20135.23) after one year. There was no significant difference in the incidence of MACE between patients with a DAPT score \u22652 and a DAPT score <2. The C-indices of ESC criteria and DAPT score for prediction of MACE were 0.63 (95% CI 0.57\u20130.70) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.48\u20130.61), respectively. The predictive value of ESC criteria for MACE was better than the DAPT score according to the DeLong test (z-statistic=2.30, P=0.020). Conclusion Patients with ESC-defined high-risk had a higher risk of MACE compared to those with ESC-defined low/medium-risk. The discriminant ability of the ESC criteria was better than the DAPT score for MACE. The ESC criteria demonstrated moderate discriminatory capacity of MACE in ACS patients treated with DAPT.",
