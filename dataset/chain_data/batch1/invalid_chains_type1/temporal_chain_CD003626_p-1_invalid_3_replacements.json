        "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial. Fourteen patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis documented by cholestatic serum enzyme pattern, liver histological appearance and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were included in the trial. Six patients received ursodeoxycholic acid (13 to 15 mg/kg body wt/day), and eight patients received placebo. Two patients had to be withdrawn from the study, one because of UDCA\u2010related diarrhea and the other because of worsening of the disease during placebo treatment. Patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group improved significantly during 1 yr of treatment with respect to serum levels of bilirubin (median = \u2212 50%), alkaline phosphatase (median = \u2212 67%), \u03b3\u2010glutamyltransferase (median = \u2212 53%), AST (median = \u2212 54%) and ALT (median = \u2212 36%) compared with the placebo group, but not with respect to serum levels of hydrophobic bile acids. During ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, histopathological features also improved significantly, as evaluated by multiparametric score. Expression of human leukocyte antigen class I molecules appeared to be markedly reduced on liver cells after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. We conclude that ursodeoxycholic acid is beneficial in reducing disease activity in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (HEPATOLOGY 1992;16:707\u2013714.)",

        "title": "Pharmacologic Treatment of Cholestasis",
        "abstract": "Cholestasis, the failure to produce bile, ranges in its manifestations from a biochemical abnormality without clinical significance over annoying illnesses with fatigue and pruritus but without propensity for progression to diseases, which inexorably lead to malnutrition, hepatocellular failure, and death. This variety of clinical presentations has to be taken into account when considering a patient for treatment; moreover, the treating physician should select appropriate measures of efficacy of treatment. This review therefore will consider some pathogenetically important features of cholestasis as they relate to novel pharmacologic approaches and evaluate measures of efficacy before discussing old and novel forms of treatment of cholestasis.",

Scanning electron micrographs showed loss of 70% of canalicular microvilli in BADP, 13% loss and pathologic changes in the remaining 75% of microvilli in BAPP, and no canalicular changes in BACIP. Cholestasis was not due to hydromechanical obstruction of bile ductules or bile Ca2+ depletion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBilirubin causes cholestasis in BADP by injuring canalicular microvilli. Intravenous glycocholate infusions fully protect the liver against bilirubin-induced cholestasis and canalicular microvillar injury.",

In contrast, intravenous bilirubin infusion caused canalicular injury and cholestasis in four of six PCD-connected BADP.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBilirubin photoconversion products do not destroy CMV or cause cholestasis in BADP. A bilirubin photoconversion shunt device can confer cholestasis protection to bilirubin-loaded BADP.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nPreclinical results suggest therapeutic potential of mild hyperbilirubinemia in T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Translational data are limited, because an appropriate bilirubin formulation for parenteral human use is lacking. Considering its use in both clinical practice and medical research in the past, we explored the feasibility to reintroduce parenteral bilirubin for translational experiments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe developed a preparation method in accordance with good manufacturing practice and evaluated the parenteral applicability in healthy volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Explorative pharmacokinetic and safety data were compared to the results from a literature study on the former parenteral use of bilirubin. Bilirubin was administered intra-arterially to raise the local plasma concentration in the forearm vascular bed (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and intravenously to raise the systemic plasma concentration (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Finally, pharmacokinetic characteristics were studied following a single bolus infusion (n\u00a0=\u00a03).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring parenteral application, no side effects occurred. Adverse events mentioned during the two-week observation period were in general mild and self-limiting. Three more significant adverse events (appendicitis, asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmia and atopic eczema) were judged unrelated by independent physicians. A dose-concentration relationship appeared sufficiently predictable for both intra-arterial and intravenous administration. In line with existing knowledge, bilirubin pharmacokinetics could be described best according to a two-compartment model with a volume of distribution of 9.9 (\u00b12.0) l and a total plasma clearance of 36 (\u00b116) ml per minute.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSupported by previous reports, our data suggest that it is both feasible and safe to perform translational experiments with parenteral albumin bound bilirubin.",

        "title": "Bilirubin improves the quality and function of hypothermic preserved islets by its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effect.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIslet transplantation is a promising option for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, the current lack of practical techniques for the isolated islets preservation still hampers the advancement of life-saving islet transplantation. Islet suffers from internal or external stimuli induced oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation during preservation, which leads to disappointing outcomes regarding islet yield, survival and function. ROS overproduction is the primary cause of oxidative stress that induces islet loss and dysfunction. Thus, in this paper, we hypothesized that an endogenous antioxidant, bilirubin, that could efficiently scavenge ROS and inhibit inflammatory reactions could be beneficial for islet preservation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHerein, we studied the effect of bilirubin on the hypothermic preserved (4\u00b0C) islets, and evaluate the islets viability, insulin secretory function, oxidative stress levels, and in vivo transplantation performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBilirubin could prevent cellular damages during short-term preservation, and maintain the co-cultured islets viability and function. The protective role of bilirubin is associated with its antioxidative ability, which dramatically increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH-Px), and decreased the levels of ROS and MDA. Diabetic mice transplanted with bilirubin preserved islets were normoglycemic for 28 days, even overmatched the diabetic mouse transplanted with fresh islets. Mice receiving bilirubin co-cultured islets required the least time to achieve normoglycemia among all groups and exhibited minimum inflammatory responses during the early transplantation stage.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy utilizing bilirubin, we achieved highly viable and functional islets after hypothermic preservation to reverse diabetes in mice.",

        "title": "Bioinspired biliverdin/silk fibroin hydrogel for antiglioma photothermal therapy and wound healing",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Photothermal therapy employs the photoabsorbers to generate heat under the near-infrared (NIR) irradiation for thermal tumor ablation. However, NIR irradiation might damage the adjacent tissue due to the leakage of the photoabsorbers and the residual materials after treatment might hinder the local healing process. A bifunctional hydrogel that holds both photothermal property and potent pro-healing ability provides a viable option to resolve this issue. Methods: In this study, we developed a bioinspired green hydrogel (BVSF) with the integration of bioproduct biliverdin into natural derived silk fibroin matrix for antiglioma photothermal therapy and wound healing. Results: The BVSF hydrogel possessed excellent and controllable photothermal activity under NIR irradiation and resulted in effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the BVSF hydrogel exerted anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo, and stimulated angiogenesis and wound healing in a full-thickness defect rat model. Conclusion: Overall, this proof-of-concept study was aimed to determine the feasibility and reliability of using an all-natural green formulation for photothermal therapy and post-treatment care.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The apoptosis of grafted islets is an urgent problem due to the high rate of islet loss soon after transplantation. MicroRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) is an essential mediator of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) during anti-apoptosis, but its effect and the underlying molecular mechanism in islet transplantation remain partially understood. Here, we found that miR-21-5p could be delivered to islet cells via BMSCs-Exo. Subsequently, we demonstrated that miR-21-5p overexpression reduced apoptosis in islets and INS-1 cells, whereas miR-21-5p inhibition enhanced apoptosis. A mechanistic analysis involving RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis was performed to determine the interaction between miR-21-5p and its target gene programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which was further verified by a dual luciferase assay. In vivo, the grafted islets overexpressing miR-21-5p showed a higher survival rate, better insulin secretion function, and a lower apoptosis rate. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that miR\u201121\u20115p from BMSCs-Exo protects against the apoptosis of grafted islets by inhibiting PDCD4 expression. Hence, miR-21-5p can be used as a cell-free therapeutic agent to minimize \u03b2-cell apoptosis at the early stage of islet transplantation.",
