        "title": "Effect of silymarin and silybinin on oxygen radicals",
        "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the scavenging action of the flavonoids, silymarin and silybinin (two well known hepatoprotective agents) against different types of oxygen radicals which were generated by specific chemical reactions and detected by luminol\u2010sensitized chemiluminescence. A well known scavenger for each radical was used as control for the paradigm and for comparing its effect with those of the flavonoids. It was found that 0.8 \u03bcg/ml of silymarin and 5.5 mg/ml of silybinin produced the same effect as 3.2 ng/ml superoxide dismutase (SOD). An alkoxy radical scavenging effect similar to the one produced by 0.35 ng/ml of vitamin E was caused by 2 \u03bc/ml silymarin and 1.6 ng/ml silybinin. Silybinin was evaluated as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals by determining the inhibition of the chemiluminescence produced by the Fenton reaction with luminol; this was compared with the results obtained from a more conventional method which determines the inhibition of the damage to 2\u2010deoxyribose by the Fenton reaction. In both methods, inhibition was observed at a relatively high concentration of the flavonoid as compared with ethanol. The action of silymarin and silybinin as scavengers of oxygen radicals may explain the protective effect of these flavonoids in certain forms of liver disease where free radicals are involved. However, other properties of these compounds cannot be discarded for their hepatoprotective actions. \u00a9 1993 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of three pharmaceutical forms of silymarin (silymarin MZ-80, silybinin-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, and silybinin) on the liver oxidative status in vitro and after oral administration to rats with extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO) and sham-operated animals. We evaluated thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and their related enzyme activities (GSH peroxidase, GSSG reductase and GSH transferase). All three compounds inhibited the in vitro production of TBARS (IC50 56\u2013533 \u00b5mol/l). These compounds, mainly silymarin MZ-80, also increased GSH peroxidase and GSH transferase activities. In EBO rats we found increases in TBARS production which was inhibited by 50\u201370% after treatment. Glutathione was reduced by 55% and elevated by silymarin MZ-80. GSH transferase increased in the group given silymarin MZ-80. We conclude that all three derivatives of silymarin show a clear ability to reduce lipid peroxidation in the liver. Silymarin MZ-80 was the only compound that enhanced the glutathione antioxidant system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 We have reported that orally administered melatonin exerts a therapeutic effect on cholestatic liver injury in rats treated with bile duct ligation (BDL) possibly through its antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory actions. Herein, we examined whether successively postadministered melatonin prevents the disruption of hepatic antioxidant status in BDL\u2010treated rats. Wistar rats with BDL were killed 5 and 13\u2003days after BDL. Melatonin (10 or 100\u2003mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to rats with and without BDL everyday for 8\u2003days, starting 5\u2003days after BDL. The hepatic concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, an index of lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione increased 5\u2003days after BDL and further increased at 13\u2003days. Hepatic vitamin E concentration and catalase and Se\u2010glutathione peroxidase (Se\u2010GSH\u2010Px) activities were similarly reduced at 5 and 13\u2003days after BDL. Hepatic ascorbic acid concentration and the hepatic activities of Cu,Zn\u2010 and Mn\u2010superoxide dismutases, glutathione reductase, and glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase decreased 13\u2003days after BDL. Melatonin postadministered to BDL\u2010treated rats attenuated all these changes observed at 13\u2003days after the treatment more effectively at the higher dose than at the lower dose. Melatonin administered to BDL\u2010untreated rats increased the hepatic Se\u2010GSH\u2010Px activity at both doses and the hepatic activities of Cu,Zn\u2010 and Mn\u2010superoxide dismutases at the higher dose. These results indicate that successively postadministered melatonin at pharmacological doses prevents the disruption of hepatic antioxidant status in rats with BDL through its direct and indirect antioxidant action, which may contribute to its therapeutic effect of BDL\u2010induced cholestatic liver injury.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 The present study was performed to determine whether melatonin protects mouse liver against severe damage induced by acetaminophen (APAP) administration and where melatonin primarily functions in the metabolic pathway of APAP to protect mouse liver against APAP\u2010induced injury. Treatment of mice with melatonin (50 or 100\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) 8 or 4\u2003hr before APAP administration (750\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) suppressed the increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in a dose\u2010 and a time\u2010dependent manner. Melatonin treatment (100\u2003mg/kg, p.o.) 4\u2003hr before APAP administration remarkably inhibited centrilobular hepatic necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration and increases in hepatic lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase activity, an index of tissue neutrophil infiltration, as well as release of nitric oxide and interleukin\u20106 into blood circulation at 9\u2003hr after APAP administration. However, melatonin neither affected hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content nor spared hepatic GSH consumption by APAP treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with melatonin 4\u2003hr before APAP administration did not influence the induction of hepatic heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) by APAP and melatonin alone did not induce HSP70 in mouse liver. These results indicate that exogenously administered melatonin exhibits a potent hepatoprotective effect against APAP\u2010induced hepatic damage probably downstream of the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1, which works upstream of GSH conjugation in the pathway of APAP metabolism, via its anti\u2010nitrosative and anti\u2010inflammatory activities in addition to its antioxidant activity.",

There is no pharmacological treatment for this pathological condition. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of melatonin treatment on Ca2+ signaling pathways and contractility altered by cholecystitis. [Ca2+]i was determined by epifluorescence microscopy in fura\u20102 loaded isolated gallbladder smooth muscle cells, and isometric tension was recorded from gallbladder muscle strips. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents were determined by spectrophotometry and cycloxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) expression was quantified by western blot. Melatonin was tested in two experimental groups, one of which underwent common bile duct ligation for 2\u2003days and another that was later de\u2010ligated for 2\u2003days. Inflammation\u2010induced impairment of Ca2+ responses to cholecystokinin and caffeine were recovered by melatonin treatment (30\u2003mg/kg). This treatment also ameliorated the detrimental effects of AC on Ca2+ influx through both L\u2010type and capacitative Ca2+ channels, and it was effective in preserving the pharmacological phenotype of these channels. Despite its effects on Ca2+ homeostasis, melatonin did not improve contractility. After de\u2010ligation, Ca2+ influx and contractility were still impaired, but both were recovered by melatonin. These effects of melatonin were associated to a reduction of MDA levels, an increase in GSH content and a decrease in COX\u20102 expression. These findings indicate that melatonin restores Ca2+ homeostasis during AC and resolves inflammation. In addition, this indoleamine helps in the subsequent recovery of functionality.",

Melatonin has previously been demonstrated to be a powerful organ protective substance in numerous models of injury; these beneficial effects have been attributed to the hormone's intense radical scavenging capacity. The present report reviews the hepatoprotective potential of the pineal hormone in various models of oxidative stress in vivo, and summarizes the extensive literature showing that melatonin may be a suitable experimental substance to reduce liver damage after sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, ischemia/reperfusion, and in numerous models of toxic liver injury. Melatonin's influence on hepatic antioxidant enzymes and other potentially relevant pathways, such as nitric oxide signaling, hepatic cytokine and heat shock protein expression, are evaluated. Based on recent literature demonstrating the functional relevance of melatonin receptor activation for hepatic organ protection, this article finally suggests that melatonin receptors could mediate the hepatoprotective actions of melatonin therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 Although melatonin treatment following trauma\u2010hemorrhage or ischemic reperfusion prevents organs from dysfunction and injury, the precise mechanism remains unknown. This study tested whether melatonin prevents liver injury following trauma\u2010hemorrhage involved the protein kinase B (Akt)\u2010dependent heme oxygenase (HO)\u20101 pathway. After a 5\u2010cm midline laparotomy, male rats underwent hemorrhagic shock (mean blood pressure approximately 40\u2003mmHg for 90\u2003min) followed by fluid resuscitation. At the onset of resuscitation, rats were treated with vehicle, melatonin (2\u2003mg/kg), or melatonin plus phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (1\u2003mg/kg). At 2\u2003hr after trauma\u2010hemorrhage, the liver tissue myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde, adenosine triphosphate, serum alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly increased compared with sham\u2010operated control. Trauma\u2010hemorrhage resulted in a significant decrease in the Akt activation in comparison with the shams (relative density, 0.526\u2003\u00b1\u20030.031 versus 1.012\u2003\u00b1\u20030.066). Administration of melatonin following trauma\u2010hemorrhage normalized liver Akt phosphorylation (0.993\u2003\u00b1\u20030.061), further increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation (5.263\u2003\u00b1\u20030.338 versus 2.556\u2003\u00b1\u20030.225) and HO\u20101 expression (5.285\u2003\u00b1\u20030.325 versus 2.546\u2003\u00b1\u20030.262), and reduced cleaved caspase\u20103 levels (2.155\u2003\u00b1\u20030.297 versus 5.166\u2003\u00b1\u20030.309).

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. Exercise has been reported to be effective to protect the heart from cardiac injury during the development of DCM. However, the potential cardioprotective effect of exercise in advanced DCM remains unclear. Methods: Seven-week old male C57BL/6 wild-type or db/db mice were either subjected to a running exercise program for 15 weeks or kept sedentary. Cardiac function, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, and mitochondrial biogenesis were examined for evaluation of cardiac injury. Results: A reduction in ejection fraction and fractional shortening in db/db mice was significantly reversed by exercise training. DCM induced remarkable cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 at the protein level. Meanwhile, DCM caused slightly myocardial fibrosis with elevated mRNA levels of collagen I and collagen III. Also, DCM resulted in a reduction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and transcription, together with reduced mtDNA content and impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure. All of these changes could be abolished by exercise training. Furthermore, DCM-associated inhibition of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling was significantly activated by exercise, indicating that exercise-induced activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling might be responsible for mediating cardioprotective effect of exercise in DCM. Conclusion: Exercise preserves cardiac function, prevents myocardial apoptosis and fbrosis, and improves mitochondrial biogenesis in the late stage of DCM. Exercise-induced activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and Akt signaling might be promising therapeutic targets for advanced DCM.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an independent clinical entity defined as structural and functional changes in the myocardium because of metabolic and cellular abnormali ties induced by diabetes, resulting in cardiac failure. Hyperglycemia has been seen as a major cause of DCM due to activation of different mechanisms leading to oxidative stress. Several body of evidence show that distinct pathways of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species formation contribute to myocardial impairment. Abnormal mitochon drial morphology and energetics, evoked by abnormal Ca 2+ handling, metabolic changes and oxidative stress, are observed in DCM, suggesting a pivotal role of mitochondrial dynamics in disease pathogenesis. In addition, insulin resistance compromises myocar dial glucose uptake due to cellular depletion of glucose transporter proteins, together with increased myocardial uptake of free fatty acids and augmented triglyceride levels, which cause cardiomyocyte lipotoxicity. Finally, the state of chronic low-grade inflam - mation, a feature of obese type 2 diabetes, seems to also play a major role in DCM pro -gression, whose mechanisms have been progressively disclosed.

        "abstract": "Objective- This study investigates the functional significance of mitochondria present in endothelial microparticles (EMP) and how MK2 (MAPKAPK2 [MAPK-activated protein kinase 2]) governs EMP production and its physiological effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Approach and Results- Flow cytometric analysis, confocal imaging, oxygen consumption rate measurement through Seahorse were used to confirm the presence of functionally active mitochondria in nontreated EMP (EMP derived from untreated control cells), lipopolysaccharide, and oligomycin treatment increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species activity in EMP (EMP derived from cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin, respectively). The dysfunctional mitochondria contained in EMP derived from cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin induced the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the target endothelial cells leading to the augmented adhesion of human monocytic cell line on EA.hy926 cells. Multiphoton real-time imaging detected the increased adherence of EMP derived from cells treated with oligomycin at the site of carotid artery injury as compared to EMP derived from untreated control cells. MK2 regulates EMP generation during inflammation by reducing E-selectin expression and regulating the cytoskeleton rearrangement through ROCK-2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2) pathway. MK2-deficient EMP reduced the E-selectin and ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1) expression on target endothelial cells leading to reduced monocyte attachment and reduced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Conclusions- MK2 promotes the proinflammatory effect of EMP mediated through dysfunctional mitochondria. MK2 modulates the inflammatory effect induced during cardiac hypertrophy through EMP.",

        "abstract": "An adequate protection from oxidative and inflammatory reactions, together with the promotion of oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) differentiation, is needed to recover from myelin damage in demyelinating diseases. Mitochondria are targets of inflammatory and oxidative insults and are essential in oligodendrocyte differentiation. It is known that nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor/antioxidant responsive element (NRF2/ARE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma/PPAR-\u03b3 response element (PPAR-\u03b3/PPRE) pathways control inflammation and overcome mitochondrial impairment. In this study, we analyzed the effects of activators of these pathways on mitochondrial features, protection from inflammatory/mitochondrial insults and cell differentiation in OP cultures, to depict the specificities and similarities of their actions. We used dimethyl-fumarate (DMF) and pioglitazone (pio) as agents activating NRF2 and PPAR-\u03b3, respectively, and two synthetic hybrids acting differently on the NRF2/ARE pathway. Only DMF and compound 1 caused early effects on the mitochondria. Both DMF and pio induced mitochondrial biogenesis but different antioxidant repertoires. Moreover, pio induced OP differentiation more efficiently than DMF. Finally, DMF, pio and compound 1 protected from tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) insult, with pio showing faster kinetics of action and compound 1 a higher activity than DMF. In conclusion, NRF2 and PPAR-\u03b3 by inducing partially overlapping pathways accomplish complementary functions aimed at the preservation of mitochondrial function, the defense against oxidative stress and the promotion of OP differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke characterized by high mortality and disability rates. The long-term effects of ICH-induced intracranial hematoma on patients\u2019 neurological function are unclear. Currently, an effective treatment that significantly reduces the rates of death and disability in patients with ICH is not available. Based on accumulating evidence, ferroptosis may be the leading factor contributing to the neurological impairment caused by ICH injury. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is a ligand-activated receptor in the nuclear hormone receptor family that synergistically interacts with the nuclear factor erythrocyte 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway to promote the expression of related genes and inhibit ferroptosis. Primary rat hippocampal neurons were treated with heme (50 \u03bcM) and erastin (50 \u03bcM) to induce ferroptosis, followed by the PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (PDZ, 10 \u03bcM) to verify the inhibitory effect of PPAR\u03b3 activation on ferroptosis. ML385 (2 \u03bcM), a novel and specific NRF2 inhibitor, was administered to the inhibitor group, followed by an analysis of cellular activity and immunofluorescence staining. In vivo Assays, ICH rats injected with autologous striatum were treated with 30 mg/kg/d pioglitazone, and the inhibitor group was injected with ML385 (30 mg/kg). The results showed that PDZ inhibited ferroptosis in neurons by increasing the expression of PPAR\u03b3, Nrf2 and Gpx4 in vitro, while PDZ reduced ferroptosis in neurons after ICH and promoted the recovery of neural function in vivo. Our results suggest that PDZ, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, promotes Gpx4 expression through the interaction between PPAR\u03b3 and the Nrf2 pathway, inhibits ferroptosis of neurons after ICH, and promotes the recovery of neural function.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Ferroptosis, a recently identified form of non-apoptotic cell death, is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation accumulation and a defect in glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4)-dependent antioxidant defenses. Unlike the previously discovered regulated cell death, it has certain morphology, biochemistry, and genetic characteristics [1]. Epilepsy is caused by the imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory conduction and mitochondrial dysfunction [2,3]. Notably, growing evidence has shown that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Seizures induce elevated extracellular glutamate [4,5], which inhibits cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xcand serves as a natural trigger for ferroptosis [6]. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction, as the phenomenal characteristic of ferroptosis, has been identified as one potential cause of epileptic seizures [7]. Most convincingly, studies have unraveled that inhibition of ferroptosis could alleviate the symptoms and improve the prognosis of epileptic seizures [8].",

        "explanation": "The paper builds upon the source paper's findings by investigating the role of PPAR\u03b3 in preventing ferroptosis-induced damage in a different context (epilepsy), and it uses the same signaling pathway (Nrf2/Gpx4) as the source paper."
