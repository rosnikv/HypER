        "title": "Efficacy of low-dose methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-eight patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis completed a randomized 24-week double-blind crossover trial comparing oral methotrexate (2.5 to 5 mg every 12 hours for three doses weekly) with placebo. The methotrexate group had significant reductions (P less than 0.01 as compared with the placebo group) in the number of tender or painful joints, the duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity according to physician and patient assessments at the 12-week crossover visit; reductions in the number of swollen joints (P less than 0.05) and 15-m walking time (P less than 0.03) also occurred. These variables, as well as the grip strength and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, showed significant (P less than 0.01) improvement at 24 weeks in the population crossed over to methotrexate. A significantly increased frequency (P less than 0.03) of the HLA-DR2 haplotype occurred in the eight patients with the most substantial response to methotrexate. Adverse reactions during methotrexate therapy included transaminase elevation (21 per cent), nausea (18 per cent), and diarrhea (12 per cent); one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of diarrhea. One patient died while receiving the placebo. Methotrexate did not affect measures of humoral or cellular immunity. We conclude that this trial provides evidence of the short-term efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Longer trials will be required to determine the ultimate safety and effectiveness of this drug.",

        "title": "Rheumatoid arthritis associated with expanded populations of granular lymphocytes.",
        "abstract": "Two patients with classic rheumatoid arthritis developed severe neutropenia and increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow. These lymphocytes exhibited homogeneous surface membrane immunophenotypes of Leu5+, Leu11-, Leu4+, Leu3-, Leu2-, Leu7+ and Leu5+, Leu11+, Leu4+, Leu3-, Leu2+, Leu7-, respectively. In both patients, neutropenia was initially corrected with corticosteroid therapy; long-term improvement followed low-dose oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate therapies. In these 2 patients and 12 previous patients with rheumatoid arthritis associated with expanded populations of immunophenotypically homogeneous large granular lymphocytes, neutropenia occurred in all 14, thrombocytopenia in 6, anemia in 7, and mild or moderate splenomegaly in 12. In contrast to Felty's syndrome, granular lymphocyte expansions in rheumatoid arthritis usually occur in older patients, may appear simultaneously with arthritis, and are usually associated with normal or elevated blood leukocyte counts. Mild hemocytopenias in these patients can often be managed with observation. Therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive-cytotoxic drugs may be beneficial in more severe cases, but splenectomy is not recommended.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-six patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis who had completed a randomized crossover trial of methotrexate elected to continue to receive the drug in a long-term prospective study. At 36 months, 16 patients remained in the study. Over this period of time, significant improvement was noted in the number of painful and swollen joints, physician and patient global assessments, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prednisone dose. Adverse reactions occurred in 16 patients (62%), including nausea, alopecia, headache, stomatitis, herpes zoster, and diarrhea. Mild leukopenia (3 patients), thrombocytopenia (3 patients), and elevated transaminase levels (8 patients) resolved with temporary drug discontinuation. No patient withdrew due to drug toxicity. Liver biopsy specimens in 17 patients after 24 months of treatment showed no evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. A significant increase in the percentage of T3 and T4 blood cells and increases in lymphocyte proliferation to concanavalin A and purified protein derivative of tuberculin were found after 2 years of therapy. Our findings indicate that methotrexate has remained effective over 36 months of therapy, with acceptable toxicity levels and no evidence of systemic immunosuppression.",

        "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term oral weekly methotrexate (MTX) therapy were studied to determine the extent of their hepatic architectural changes. Liver biopsies (n = 101) were performed in all patients before the initiation of MTX therapy, after 2 years, and annually thereafter (mean duration of therapy 53 months). The hepatic histologic grade (5-point scale) in 25 patients increased (worsened) (mean +/- SEM change 0.84 +/- 1.02; P = 0.001). Fibrosis, confirmed by trichrome staining, developed in 14 of 27 patients (52%). A history of alcohol consumption prior to starting MTX correlated significantly with subsequent worsening of the liver biopsy grade (r = 0.55, P = 0.0054). Alcohol intake prior to study entry, elevated weight at MTX initiation, and dose and duration of MTX were significantly associated with the development of fibrosis. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at 29-53 months of therapy correlated with the increase in hepatic histologic grade at the 3-year biopsy (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) and 4-year biopsy (r = 0.58, P = 0.03). We conclude that long-term MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients results in a statistically significant worsening in hepatic histologic grade, with common development of mild fibrosis. We do not consider these changes to be clinically significant at present.",

        "abstract": "Levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from 5 centers involved in the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System were correlated with the use of specific antirheumatic medications. Elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT were most frequent in patients taking salicylates and methotrexate (MTX) and least frequent in patients taking hydroxychloroquine. The combination of MTX and salicylates greatly increased the frequency of abnormal liver enzyme values. In contrast, the addition of hydroxychloroquine to a regimen of either MTX or aspirin essentially eliminated the SGOT and SGPT abnormalities. Results from all 5 centers were consistent and remained so after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. Knowledge of these important drug interactions may permit continuation of MTX therapy in patients in whom the drug might otherwise be discontinued.",

        "abstract": "T HERE ARE THREE major questions to be addressed regarding chemotherapeutic agents and hepatotoxicity. What is the spectrum of hepatotoxicity? Which drugs should be avoided in patients with pre-existing liver disease? And what dosage modifications should be made when faced with abnormal liver function tests? Several recent articles have reviewed this subject.1-5 In the population being considered for chemotherapy, there are multiple other potential causes of abnormal liver function tests that must be considered (Table 1). Patients with metastatic disease may have known or occult hepatic metastases. All patients may have been exposed to hepatotoxins, including other medications, alcohol, chemicals. They may have other coexisting medical conditions that affect the liver or, because of their immunocompromised state, be prone to infectious complications, including the several forms of viral hepatitis. Baseline evaluation of patients about to undergo chemotherapy should therefore always include liver function tests, and when clinically indicated, hepatic imaging.6 The spectrum of hepatic toxicities ranges from the (usually) incidental elevations of transaminases observed with the nitrosoureas to life-threatening massive hepatic necrosis observed with dacarbazine. For the most part, pure single-drug toxicity is observed less often as the emphasis in chemotherapy shifts to combination regimes. Furthermore, the increased use of high-dose regimens with autologous bone marrow or stem-cell support has complicated the picture by revealing toxicities at very high doses that are not observed with conventional doses. Combination chemotherapy has been implicated in the development of fatal hepatic necrosis after haloalkane anesthesia.7 Allopurinol, frequently administered before chemotherapy to prevent urate nephropathy and secondary gout, has also been linked to fulminant hepatic failure, presumably caused by a hypersensitivity reaction.8,9 There is also a report of allopurinol hepatotoxicity potentiated by tamoxifen, a possible drug interaction. lo Several instances of",

        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs comprise an important class of medications that reduce the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. They bring relief to millions of people but do not eliminate underlying disease. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs also bring relief, but these drugs are often ineffective and not well tolerated. Failure to provide long-term benefits combined with the high toxicity of most of the disease-modifying agents has prompted a search for more effective treatments. New methods using modern technologies have generated much enthusiasm and hold promise for the future. In the meantime, administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and judicious use of disease-modifying agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for arthritis.",

        "abstract": "approaches needs to be considered; triple therapy has been reported to be well tolerated at three to five years, while similar data are not available for methotrexate and cyclosporin A. The success of combination DMARD therapy in recent double blind controlled studies is encouraging.2223 As is frequently the case, however, the success of these approaches raises as many questions as it answers. Should all patients with rheumatoid arthritis receive combination DMARD therapy, or should it be reserved for only those with severe disease? Are there ways to predict who will respond best? When in the course of disease should combinations be used? Which combinations are best, or does this vary among patients? After an excellent response occurs, can some or all of these drugs be tapered or discontinued? Where do biological agents fit in, and should they be used in combinations? I do not have the answer to any of these questions. Until these answers are available, we will have to do as we have always done-make the best decisions we can based on the limited data available. As I stated earlier, our goal when treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be remission. As we try to achieve this goal, the data available now support the use of certain combinations of DMARD. Whether combinations should be used early in the disease process as suggested by Wilske and Healey'5 or added later is still open to question. As we better understand the mechanisms of actions of drugs and the disease process itself, we will be able to intervene more intelligently at the right time with the right drugs or combinations of drugs to improve the long term outcome for our patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
