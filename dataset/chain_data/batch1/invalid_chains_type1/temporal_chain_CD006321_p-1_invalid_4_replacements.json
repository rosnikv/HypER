        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe effects of parenteral growth hormone, glutamine supplementation, and a high carbohydrate-low fat (HCLF) diet on gut adaptation in short-bowel syndrome are unclear. The aim of this study was to compare effects of this treatment regimen and placebo in patients with short-bowel syndrome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 8 patients with short-bowel syndrome (average small bowel length, 71 cm; mean duration, 12.9 years) was performed. Active treatment was growth hormone (0.14 mg.kg-1.day-1), oral glutamine (0.63 g.kg-1.day-1), and the HCLF diet for 21 days. The weight, basal metabolic rate, nutrient and electrolyte balance, serum insulin-like growth factor I levels, D-xylose absorption, morphology and DNA proliferation of small intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal transit were evaluated. Treatments were compared by paired t test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActive treatment transiently increased body weight, significantly but modestly increased the absorption of sodium and potassium, and decreased gastric emptying. The assimilation of macronutrients, stool volumes, and morphometry of small bowel mucosa were not statistically different in the two treatment arms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough treatment with growth hormone, glutamine, and HCLF diet for 3 weeks resulted in modest improvements in electrolyte absorption and delayed gastric emptying, there were no improvements in small bowel morphology, stool losses, or macronutrient absorption.",

        "title": "Short Bowel Syndrome in Adults",
        "abstract": "Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder characterized by severe intestinal dysfunction leading to malabsorption of macronutrients and micronutrients that often results in permanent need of parenteral nutrition support. Patients can develop SBS because of massive intestinal resection or loss of intestinal function and consequently experience significant morbidity and increased healthcare utilization. The remaining anatomy and length of bowel after intestinal resection have important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Because patients with SBS constitute a heterogenous group, management is complex and multifaceted, involving nutrition support, fluid and electrolyte management, and pharmacologic therapies in particular to control diarrhea. Surgical interventions including intestinal transplantation may be considered in selected individuals. Successful care of these patients is best accomplished by a multidisciplinary team that is experienced in the management of this syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Glucagon\u2010like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP\u20101 and GLP\u20102) are coencoded within a single mammalian proglucagon precursor, and are liberated in the intestine and brain. GLP\u20101 exerts well known actions on islet hormone secretion, gastric emptying, and food intake. Recent studies suggest GLP\u20101 plays a central role in the development and organization of islet cells. GLP\u20101 receptor signaling appears essential for \u03b2 cell signal transduction as exemplified by studies of GLP\u20101R\u2212/\u2212 mice. GLP\u20102 promotes energy assimilation via trophic effects on the intestinal mucosa of the small and large bowel epithelium via a recently cloned GLP\u20102 receptor. The actions of GLP\u20102 are preserved in the setting of small and large bowel injury and inflammation. The biological actions of the glucagon\u2010like peptides suggest they may have therapeutic efficacy in diabetes (GLP\u20101) or intestinal disorders (GLP\u20102).",

        "abstract": "Exogenous glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) mimics the stimulatory effect of enteral nutrition on intestinal mucosal growth in preterm neonatal pigs. Little is known about its effects on small intestinal function. In this study, we investigated whether the trophic actions of GLP-2 and enteral nutrition are paralleled by effects on small intestinal function. Cesarean-delivered piglets (92% of gestation) were given either a parenteral nutrient infusion [total parenteral nutrition (TPN), n = 7], TPN + human GLP-2 (25 nmol/kg/d, n = 8), or enteral nutrition (ENT, n = 6) for 6 d. Gene expression (mRNA) and activities of lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), maltase-glucoamylase (MGA), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), aminopeptidase N (ApN), and A (ApA) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured. Both GLP-2 and enteral nutrition increased mucosal weight (+30\u201340%, p < 0.05) relative to TPN. GLP-2 stimulated jejunal MGA and SI mRNA abundance and activity levels but did not change LPH in parenterally fed pigs (p < 0.05). Enteral nutrition decreased jejunal LPH and MGA mRNA abundance and activity and increased ileal ApN, ApA, and DPP IV activities relative to TPN (p < 0.05). We conclude that GLP-2 and enteral nutrition exert different effects on intestinal enzyme function despite similar effects on intestinal growth. In addition, the effects of GLP-2 on intestinal function in these parenterally fed, premature neonatal pigs differed from those previously reported for similarly fed term neonates.",

        "abstract": "Early development of the digestive tract is crucial for achieving maximal growth and development of chickens. Because the late-term embryo naturally consumes the amniotic fluids, insertion of a nutrient solution into the embryonic amniotic fluid [in ovo (IO) feeding] may enhance development. This study examined the effect of IO feeding on d 17.5 of incubation of carbohydrates (CHO) and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on small intestinal development of chickens during the pre and posthatch periods. Results shows that 48 h post-IO feeding procedure all IO feeding treatments exhibited increased villus width and surface area compared with the control group. At d 3 posthatch the surface area of an average villi was increased by 45% for the HMB IO group and by 33% for the CHO and CHO+HMB IO groups compared with controls (noninjected fertile eggs). The activity of jejunal sucrase-isomaltase (SI) was higher (P < 0.05) 48 h after IO feeding in all the IO fed embryos, whereas at day of hatch and at d 3 the CHO+HMB IO group had the highest maltase activity (P < 0.05), which was approximately 50% greater than control embryos. These observations indicated that small intestines of IO fed hatchlings were functionally at a similar stage of development as a conventionally fed 2-d-old chick. Body weight of all IO fed hatchlings was greater than controls, and these differences (P < 0.05) were sustained until the end of the experiment (10 d). At d 10 chicks that were IO fed with CHO had BW that were 2.2% higher, whereas HMB and CHO+HMB IO fed chicks showed 5 to 6.2% BW increase, respectively, compared with controls. The current study shows that the administration of exogenous nutrients into the amnion enhanced intestinal development by increasing the size of the villi and by increasing the intestinal capacity to digest disaccharides. This advantage probably leads to higher BW in IO fed chicks.",

        "title": "Glucagon-like Peptide 2 Stimulates Intestinal Nutrient Absorption in Parenterally Fed Newborn Pigs",
        "abstract": "Objectives: Parenteral nutrition is a critically important intervention for children with intestinal dysfunctions. However, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with no enteral feeding is associated with small intestine atrophy and malabsorption, which complicate the transition to enteral nutrition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the intestinotrophic peptide glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which reduces TPN-associated atrophy and maintains nutrient absorption in adult rats, for preventing nutrient malabsorption in neonates receiving TPN. Methods: Term pigs obtained by cesarean delivery received from birth TPN alone (TPN; n = 7) or TPN with GLP-2 (25 nmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121; GLP-2; n = 8) or were fed sow milk enterally (n = 7). The small intestine was removed on postnatal day 6 to measure morphological responses and absorption of glucose, leucine, lysine and proline by intact tissues and brush border membrane vesicles and to quantify the abundances of mRNA and protein for enterocyte glucose transporters (SGLT-1 and GLUT2). Results: Relative to TPN alone, administration of GLP-2 resulted in small intestines that were larger (P < 0.01), had greater abundances of mRNA and protein for SGLT-1, but not for GLUT2, and had higher capacities to absorb nutrients (P < 0.01). Moreover, the intestines of GLP-2 pigs were comparable in size and absorptive capacities with those of pigs fed sow milk enterally. Conclusions: Providing GLP-2 to neonates receiving TPN prevents small intestine atrophy, results in small intestine absorptive capacities that are comparable to when nutrients are provided enterally and may accelerate the transition from TPN to enteral nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Luminal nutrients stimulate structural and functional regeneration in the intestine through mechanisms thought to involve insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). We investigated the relationship between IGF-I and GLP-2 responses and mucosal growth in rats fasted for 48 h and then refed for 2 or 4 days by continuous intravenous or intragastric infusion or ad libitum feeding. Fasting induced significant decreases in body weight, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and bioactive GLP-2, jejunal mucosal cellularity (mass, protein, DNA, and villus height), IGF-I mRNA, and ileal proglucagon mRNA. Plasma IGF-I concentration was restored to fed levels with 2 days of ad libitum refeeding but not with 4 days of intravenous or intragastric refeeding. Administration of an inhibitor of endogenous GLP-2 (rat GLP-2 3-33) during ad libitum refeeding partially attenuated mucosal growth and prevented the increase in plasma IGF-I to fed levels; however, plasma GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA were restored to fed levels. Intragastric refeeding restored intestinal cellularity and functional capacity (sucrase activity and sodium-glucose transporter-1 expression) to fed levels, whereas intravenous refeeding had no effect. Intestinal regeneration after 4 days of intragastric or 2 days of ad libitum refeeding was positively associated with increases in plasma concentrations of GLP-2 and jejunal IGF-I mRNA. These data suggest that luminal nutrients stimulate intestinal growth, in part, by increased expression of both GLP-2 and IGF-I.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Obese and diabetic mice display enhanced intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxaemia that participate in the occurrence of metabolic disorders. Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes. Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation. Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota. Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of organic (selenium-enriched yeast) vs inorganic (sodium selenite) selenium source on fecal end-fermentation products and gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. Alpha and beta diversity of the gut bacterial community were affected by age but not by gender or selenium source. The relative abundance of taxa was differently affected by age, and the DNA concentration of all selected bacterial groups increased with age, although total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate, propionate, caproate and lactate concentrations decreased. Organic selenium was associated with a higher concentration of total VFA, propionate and butyrate, a higher number of DNA copies of Lactobacillus, and a trend to lower DNA copies of Escherichia coli. Effects on fecal microbiome during growth differed with selenium source. Females had higher fecal end-fermentation products related to protein degradation, whereas males had higher DNA concentration of Bifidobacterium. Organic selenium might be beneficial over inorganic for dog food supplementation due to the positive modulation of the gut microbiome observed in puppies.",

        "abstract": "Selenium is both an essential nutrient and a highly toxic element, depending on its dose and chemical forms. We aimed to quantify urinary selenium excretion and dietary selenium intake in 137 healthy non-smoking blood donors living in the northern Italian province of Reggio Emilia. We assessed selenium status by determining urinary selenium levels (mean 26.77 \u00b5g/L), and by estimating dietary selenium intake (mean 84.09 \u00b5g/day) using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Fasting blood levels of glucose, lipids and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured using automatized laboratory procedures. Dietary and urinary selenium were correlated (beta coefficient (\u03b2) = 0.19). Despite this, the association of the two indicators with health endpoints tended to diverge. Using linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, cotinine levels and alcohol intake, we observed a positive association between urinary selenium and blood triglyceride (\u03b2 = 0.14), LDL-cholesterol (\u03b2 = 0.07) and glucose levels (\u03b2 = 0.08), and an inverse one with HDL-cholesterol (\u03b2 = \u22120.12). Concerning dietary selenium, a slightly positive association could be found with glycemic levels only (\u03b2 = 0.02), while a negative one emerged for other endpoints. The two selenium indicators showed conflicting and statistically highly imprecise associations with circulating TSH levels. Our findings suggest that higher selenium exposure is adversely associated with blood glucose levels and lipid profile. This is the case even at selenium exposures not exceeding tolerable upper intake levels according to current guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Due to climate change, heat waves occur more often, and the annual average temperature increases, which may contribute to the negative effects of heat stress in pigs. This study explored ways to help growing\u2013finishing pigs cope with heat stress during hot weather. Two groups of pigs were given different diets\u2014one standard and one enriched with specific feed additives. The pigs\u2019 respiration rates, rectal and skin temperatures, performances, and meat qualities were monitored. During a heat wave, the group with the enriched diet did not need as much drinking water compared to the standard diet group. Both groups, without distinguishing between dietary treatments, showed increased respiration rates and skin temperatures during higher heat loads. The findings suggest that the enriched diet may help reduce the need to increase daily water intake during hot periods. Furthermore, this study highlighted the sensitivity of the parameter of respiration rate in pigs suffering from (mild) heat stress. Abstract Heat stress in pigs negatively affects welfare, health, and performance. Osmoprotectants and antioxidants may alleviate oxidative damage during hot periods. We investigated whether an additive-enriched feed can reduce negative effects in pigs during summer conditions. Sixty growing\u2013finishing pigs were allocated into two groups: the control (CF) and summer feed (SF) group. The CF group contained 0.4 mg/kg inorganic selenium and 100 ppm vitamin E, while the SF group contained 0.3 mg/kg inorganic selenium, 0.1 mg/kg selenomethionine, 200 ppm vitamins E and C, and 0.2% betaine. Feed was offered ad libitum. Respiration rate, rectal and skin temperature, behaviour, and weight gain were assessed weekly. Daily measurements of these parameters were performed during a 3-day heat wave (temperature humidity index (THI) \u2265 75) and during an artificial heating period. Individual average daily water intake (ADWI) and feed intake were measured using RFID systems. The ADWI of the SF group did not change during heat load while it increased for the CF group. Independent of dietary treatment, increases in \u2206THI or the THI were accompanied by significant increases in both respiration rate and skin temperature. In conclusion, the SF may induce a reduced need to increase ADWI during hot periods. In addition, mainly skin temperatures and especially respiration rates revealed the sensitivity of pigs to heat stress.",
