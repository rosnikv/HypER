        "abstract": "The definition of psychiatric illness by specific criteria has provided a new method for examining the relationship of certain gastrointestinal (GI) diseases to psychiatric disorder. Using this technique, researchers have found that rates of psychiatric diagnosis in patients with certain functional GI syndromes and Crohn's disease exceed those found in the general population and in comparably ill control groups. Timing of onset of both sets of symptoms (GI and psychiatric) suggests that the functional syndromes generally follow or coincide with the onset of psychiatric symptoms, whereas the onset of Crohn's disease is more independent. A relationship of psychiatric illness to other GI disease is suspected based on results of psychometric testing or on less structured attempts at psychiatric diagnosis employed in earlier studies. Psychiatric diagnosis by criteria definition may play an important role in more clearly understanding any relationship of psychiatric disorder to somatic GI disease as the applications of this scientific technique are expanded.",

        "abstract": "We carried out a study to determine the proportion of patients attending a university-based gastroenterology outpatient clinic who sought alternative medical care for the same health problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. After the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire, the gastroenterologist gave a diagnosis and assigned a functional rating. Of the 395 patients 287 (73%) had not used alternative medicine, and 36 (9%) had sought alternative medical care for the problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. There were no significant differences between alternative medicine users and nonusers in sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services or general health status. Patients with a functional disease were more likely to seek alternative medical care than those with organic disease (33% v. 7%) (p less than 0.0001). Fewer alternative medicine users (54%) than nonusers (85%) were satisfied with conventional medicine (p less than 0.001), and more alternative medicine users (49%) than nonusers (13%) were very sceptical of conventional medicine (p less than 0.0001).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany people use unconventional therapies for health problems, but the extent of this use and the costs are not known. We conducted a national survey to determine the prevalence, costs, and patterns of use of unconventional therapies, such as acupuncture and chiropractic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe limited the therapies studied to 16 commonly used interventions neither taught widely in U.S. medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals. We completed telephone interviews with 1539 adults (response rate, 67 percent) in a national sample of adults 18 years of age or older in 1990. We asked respondents to report any serious or bothersome medical conditions and details of their use of conventional medical services; we then inquired about their use of unconventional therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne in three respondents (34 percent) reported using at least one unconventional therapy in the past year, and a third of these saw providers for unconventional therapy. The latter group had made an average of 19 visits to such providers during the preceding year, with an average charge per visit of $27.60. The frequency of use of unconventional therapy varied somewhat among socio-demographic groups, with the highest use reported by nonblack persons from 25 to 49 years of age who had relatively more education and higher incomes. The majority used unconventional therapy for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, medical conditions. Among those who used unconventional therapy for serious medical conditions, the vast majority (83 percent) also sought treatment for the same condition from a medical doctor; however, 72 percent of the respondents who used unconventional therapy did not inform their medical doctor that they had done so. Extrapolation to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy. This number exceeds the number of visits to all U.S. primary care physicians (388 million). Expenditures associated with use of unconventional therapy in 1990 amounted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 billion) was paid out of pocket. This figure is comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe frequency of use of unconventional therapy in the United States is far higher than previously reported. Medical doctors should ask about their patients' use of unconventional therapy whenever they obtain a medical history.",

The majority of visits are to physicians, followed by chiropractors. We attempted to understand more about this disparity by examining social and demographic factors that differentiate between persons who see these providers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEpisodes of care were constructed from participants in 2 panels from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey who had spinal pain. The provider of care was identified for each episode, and logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with MD/PT use compared to MD use, and MD/PT use compared to DC use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe majority of patients (61%) received MD care for spinal pain, followed by those who received DC (28%) and MD/PT (11%) care. Female sex, higher levels of education, and higher income were significantly associated with MD/PT care over MD care. Increased age, female sex, lower self-health rating, and presence of at least 1 disability day were all significantly associated with MD/PT care over DC care.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSociodemographic and clinical factors are associated with those who get MD/PT care as compared to MD or DC care. We found evidence of an access disparity for physical therapy and identified population characteristics that both increase and reduce the likelihood of physical therapy service use.",

        "abstract": "Study Design. A retrospective cohort. Objective. To describe physical therapy utilization following primary care consultation for low back pain (LBP) and evaluate associations between the timing and content of physical therapy and subsequent health care utilization and costs. Summary of Background Data. Primary care management of LBP is highly variable and the implications for subsequent costs are not well understood. The importance of referring patients from primary care to physical therapy has been debated, and information on how the timing and content of physical therapy impact subsequent costs and utilization is needed. Methods. Data were extracted from a national database of employer-sponsored health plans. A total of 32,070 patients with a new primary care LBP consultation were identified and categorized on the basis of the use of physical therapy within 90 days. Patients utilizing physical therapy were further categorized based on timing (early [within 14 d] or delayed)] and content (guideline adherent or nonadherent). LBP-related health care costs and utilization in the 18-months following primary care consultation were examined. Results. Physical therapy utilization was 7.0% with significant geographic variability. Early physical therapy timing was associated with decreased risk of advanced imaging (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 0.41), additional physician visits (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.32), surgery (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), injections (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), and opioid medications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) compared with delayed physical therapy. Total medical costs for LBP were $2736.23 lower (95% CI: 1810.67, 3661.78) for patients receiving early physical therapy. Physical therapy content showed weaker associations with subsequent care. Conclusion. Early physical therapy following a new primary care consultation was associated with reduced risk of subsequent health care compared with delayed physical therapy. Further research is needed to clarify exactly which patients with LBP should be referred to physical therapy; however, if referral is to be made, delaying the initiation of physical therapy may increase risk for additional health care consumption and costs.",

        "title": "Practice patterns when treating patients with low back pain: a survey of physical therapists",
        "abstract": "Abstract Low back pain (LBP), is a common musculoskeletal problem, affecting 75\u201385% of adults in their lifetime. Direct costs of LBP in the USA were estimated over 85 billion dollars in 2005 resulting in a significant economic burden for the healthcare system. LBP classification systems and outcome measures are available to guide physical therapy assessments and intervention. However, little is known about which, if any, physical therapists use in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to identify the use of and barriers to LBP classification systems and outcome measures among physical therapists in one state. A mixed methods study using a cross-sectional cohort design with descriptive qualitative methods was performed. A survey collected both quantitative and qualitative data relevant to classification systems and outcome measures used by physical therapists working with patients with LBP. Physical therapists responded using classification systems designed to direct treatment predominantly. The McKenzie method was the most frequent approach to classify LBP. Barriers to use of classification systems and outcome measures were lack of knowledge, too limiting and time. Classification systems are being used for decision-making in physical therapy practice for patients with LBP. Lack of knowledge and training seems to be the main barrier to the use of classification systems in practice. The Oswestry Disability Index and Numerical Pain Scale were the most commonly used outcome measures. The main barrier to their use was lack of time. Continuing education and reading the literature were identified as important tools to teach evidence-based practice to physical therapists in practice.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Mechanical diagnosis and therapy is one of the most common approaches for the management of low back pain. In mechanical diagnosis and therapy, a great emphasis is placed on patient education so that patients can manage their problems by themselves. However, there has been no evidence that mechanical diagnosis and therapy actually enhances patient\u2019s self-management skills. This study aimed to preliminarily investigate whether self-reported skills of self-management for musculoskeletal problems are enhanced through the course of mechanical diagnosis and therapy. Method: Outpatients with musculoskeletal disorders in a local orthopedic clinic were included. The primary outcome measures were the \u201cSelf-monitoring and Insight\u201d and \u201cSkill and Technique Acquisition\u201d scores of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire, where higher scores indicate greater self-management skills. Mechanical diagnosis and therapy was undertaken up to a maximum of twice per week for 1\u2009month. The Self-monitoring and Insight and Skill and Technique Acquisition scores before and 1\u2009month after the mechanical diagnosis and therapy interventions were compared. Proportions of patients who exceed the threshold for \u201creliable change\u201d in the Health Education Impact Questionnaire scores (% >positive \u201creliable change\u201d) and proportions of patients with the net positive \u201creliable change\u201d (% net positive \u201creliable change\u201d) were investigated. Results: Forty-five patients participated and 97.8% completed the 1-month follow-up. The Self-monitoring and Insight and Skill and Technique Acquisition scores significantly increased at the follow-up (Self-monitoring and Insight, p\u2009=\u20090.002; Skill and Technique Acquisition, p\u2009<\u20090.001. The % >positive \u201creliable change\u201d (Self-monitoring and Insight\u2009=\u200922.2%, Skill and Technique Acquisition\u2009=\u200948.9%) and % net positive \u201creliable change\u201d (Self-monitoring and Insight\u2009=\u200913.3%, Skill and Technique Acquisition\u2009=\u200946.7%) in this study were comparative to or greater than self-management programs in previous studies (%> positive \u201creliable change\u2019: Self-monitoring and Insight\u2009=\u200920.5%, Skill and Technique Acquisition\u2009=\u200930.7%; % net positive \u201creliable change\u201d: Self-monitoring and Insight\u2009=\u200914.1%, Skill and Technique Acquisition\u2009=\u200923.0%).

For modeling knee pain reduction at the 1-month follow-up, 3 MDT provisional or concluding classifications (Spinal Derangement, Knee Derangement, and Non-Derangement) and the following variables were included: 1) gender, 2) symptom duration, 3) presence of low back pain (LBP), 4) the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure, 5) average pain intensity at the initial session using a 0\u201310 numerical rating scale, and 6) the Kellgren\u2013Lawrence grade.Results: Data from 101 patients were extracted. The percentage of patients with the concluding classification of Spinal Derangement was 44.6%. This was greater in those patient\u2019s reporting concomitant LBP (p = .002) and without radiographic findings of knee osteoarthritis (p < .001). A concluding classification was determined by the fourth session in 80% of patients. Multiple regression modeling demonstrated that only the concluding classification significantly predicted the knee pain reduction at the 1-month follow-up.Discussion: These findings suggest the importance of careful screening assessments of the lumbar spine and the importance of detecting Derangements throughout the follow-up sessions for patients with a primary complaint of knee pain.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The current standard to evaluate the presence of somatosensory dysfunctions is quantitative sensory testing, but its clinical utility remains limited. Low\u2010cost and time\u2010efficient clinical sensory testing (CST) batteries have thus been developed. Recent studies show moderate to substantial reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability of people with spine\u2010related leg and arm pain, representing mixed pain mechanisms. Methods Fifty\u2010three patients with spine\u2010related leg (n\u2009=\u200941) and arm pain (n\u2009=\u200912) attended three CST sessions. The CST battery consisted of eleven tests, determining loss and gain of sensory nerve function. CST was performed by the same investigator twice and by an additional investigator to determine inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability. Fleiss' (inter\u2010tester) and Cohen's (intra\u2010tester) kappa were calculated for dichotomized and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous outcomes. Results Fleiss' kappa varied among modalities from fair to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.23\u20130.66). Cold, warm, and vibration detection thresholds and cold and pressure pain thresholds reached kappa >0.4 (moderate to substantial reliability). Cohen's kappa ranged from moderate to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.45\u20130.66). The reliability of the windup ratio was poor (ICC <0.18). Conclusion CST modalities with moderate to substantial inter\u2010tester reliability could be of benefit as a screening tool. The moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability for all sensory modalities (except windup ratio) supports their potential use in clinical practice and research to monitor somatosensory changes over time in patients with spine\u2010related limb pain of mixed pain mechanisms. Significance We already know that most modalities of clinical sensory test (CST) batteries achieve moderate to substantial inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the reliability of a CST battery in populations with mixed pain mechanisms. We found inter\u2010tester reliability varied from poor to substantial for sensory modalities, questioning the value of some CST modalities. The CST battery showed moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability, suggesting its usefulness to monitor sensory changes over time in this cohort.",
