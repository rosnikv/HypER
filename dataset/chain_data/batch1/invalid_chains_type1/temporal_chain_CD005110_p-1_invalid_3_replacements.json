Significantly more patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (16%) had consulted practitioners of alternative medicine about their condition than had patients in either of the other groups. Similarly, significantly more irritable bowel syndrome patients said they would consult an alternative medicine practitioner (41%) if conventional treatment failed. Current usage of alternative medicine remedies was significantly greater in the irritable bowel syndrome patients (11%) than in patients with Crohn's disease (4%) and tended to be greater than in patients with organic upper gastrointestinal disorders (6%). This study has shown that the use of alternative medicine is common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and this does not appear to be explicable in terms of the nature, chronicity or refractoriness to treatment of symptoms.",

        "abstract": "We carried out a study to determine the proportion of patients attending a university-based gastroenterology outpatient clinic who sought alternative medical care for the same health problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. After the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire, the gastroenterologist gave a diagnosis and assigned a functional rating. Of the 395 patients 287 (73%) had not used alternative medicine, and 36 (9%) had sought alternative medical care for the problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. There were no significant differences between alternative medicine users and nonusers in sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services or general health status. Patients with a functional disease were more likely to seek alternative medical care than those with organic disease (33% v. 7%) (p less than 0.0001). Fewer alternative medicine users (54%) than nonusers (85%) were satisfied with conventional medicine (p less than 0.001), and more alternative medicine users (49%) than nonusers (13%) were very sceptical of conventional medicine (p less than 0.0001).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany people use unconventional therapies for health problems, but the extent of this use and the costs are not known. We conducted a national survey to determine the prevalence, costs, and patterns of use of unconventional therapies, such as acupuncture and chiropractic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe limited the therapies studied to 16 commonly used interventions neither taught widely in U.S. medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals. We completed telephone interviews with 1539 adults (response rate, 67 percent) in a national sample of adults 18 years of age or older in 1990. We asked respondents to report any serious or bothersome medical conditions and details of their use of conventional medical services; we then inquired about their use of unconventional therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne in three respondents (34 percent) reported using at least one unconventional therapy in the past year, and a third of these saw providers for unconventional therapy. The latter group had made an average of 19 visits to such providers during the preceding year, with an average charge per visit of $27.60. The frequency of use of unconventional therapy varied somewhat among socio-demographic groups, with the highest use reported by nonblack persons from 25 to 49 years of age who had relatively more education and higher incomes. The majority used unconventional therapy for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, medical conditions. Among those who used unconventional therapy for serious medical conditions, the vast majority (83 percent) also sought treatment for the same condition from a medical doctor; however, 72 percent of the respondents who used unconventional therapy did not inform their medical doctor that they had done so. Extrapolation to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy. This number exceeds the number of visits to all U.S. primary care physicians (388 million). Expenditures associated with use of unconventional therapy in 1990 amounted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 billion) was paid out of pocket. This figure is comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe frequency of use of unconventional therapy in the United States is far higher than previously reported. Medical doctors should ask about their patients' use of unconventional therapy whenever they obtain a medical history.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate national utilization and expenditures on chiropractic care between 1997 and 2006.\n\n\nDATA SOURCE\nThe nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWe performed descriptive analyses and generated national estimates from data obtained from U.S. adult (>or=18 years) MEPS respondents who reported having visited a chiropractor (annual sample size between 789 and 1,082). For each year, we examined the estimated total national expenditure, the total number of U.S. adults who received chiropractic care, the total number of ambulatory visits to U.S. chiropractors, and the inflation-adjusted charges and expenditures per U.S. adult chiropractic patient.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nThe total number of U.S. adults who visited a chiropractor increased 57 percent from 7.7 million in 2000 to 12.1 million in 2003. From 1997 to 2006, the inflation-adjusted national expenditures on chiropractic care increased 56 percent from U.S.$3.8 billion to U.S.$5.9 billion. Inflation-adjusted total mean expenditures per patient and expenditures per office visit remained unchanged.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe large increase in U.S. adult expenditures on chiropractic care between 1997 and 2006 was due to a 57 percent increase in the total number of U.S. adult chiropractic patients that occurred from 2000 to 2003. From 2003 to 2006, the total number of U.S. adult chiropractic patients has remained stable.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN\nSecondary analysis of longitudinal population-based survey data.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo investigate factors associated with care seeking for physician-referred physical therapy (MD/PT), as compared to physician-only (MD) or chiropractic-only (DC) care for spinal pain.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nAlthough a large proportion of ambulatory physical therapy visits are related to spinal pain, physical therapists are not the most commonly seen provider. The majority of visits are to physicians, followed by chiropractors. We attempted to understand more about this disparity by examining social and demographic factors that differentiate between persons who see these providers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEpisodes of care were constructed from participants in 2 panels from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey who had spinal pain. The provider of care was identified for each episode, and logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with MD/PT use compared to MD use, and MD/PT use compared to DC use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe majority of patients (61%) received MD care for spinal pain, followed by those who received DC (28%) and MD/PT (11%) care. Female sex, higher levels of education, and higher income were significantly associated with MD/PT care over MD care. Increased age, female sex, lower self-health rating, and presence of at least 1 disability day were all significantly associated with MD/PT care over DC care.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSociodemographic and clinical factors are associated with those who get MD/PT care as compared to MD or DC care.

        "abstract": "Study Design. A retrospective cohort. Objective. To describe physical therapy utilization following primary care consultation for low back pain (LBP) and evaluate associations between the timing and content of physical therapy and subsequent health care utilization and costs. Summary of Background Data. Primary care management of LBP is highly variable and the implications for subsequent costs are not well understood. The importance of referring patients from primary care to physical therapy has been debated, and information on how the timing and content of physical therapy impact subsequent costs and utilization is needed. Methods. Data were extracted from a national database of employer-sponsored health plans. A total of 32,070 patients with a new primary care LBP consultation were identified and categorized on the basis of the use of physical therapy within 90 days. Patients utilizing physical therapy were further categorized based on timing (early [within 14 d] or delayed)] and content (guideline adherent or nonadherent). LBP-related health care costs and utilization in the 18-months following primary care consultation were examined. Results. Physical therapy utilization was 7.0% with significant geographic variability. Early physical therapy timing was associated with decreased risk of advanced imaging (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 0.41), additional physician visits (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.32), surgery (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), injections (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), and opioid medications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) compared with delayed physical therapy. Total medical costs for LBP were $2736.23 lower (95% CI: 1810.67, 3661.78) for patients receiving early physical therapy. Physical therapy content showed weaker associations with subsequent care. Conclusion. Early physical therapy following a new primary care consultation was associated with reduced risk of subsequent health care compared with delayed physical therapy. Further research is needed to clarify exactly which patients with LBP should be referred to physical therapy; however, if referral is to be made, delaying the initiation of physical therapy may increase risk for additional health care consumption and costs.",

        "abstract": "Clinical decision support systems are important healthcare systems that help in improving healthcare quality and in reducing cost. These systems have multiple levels of outcomes on the individual, group, organization, and society levels. However, despite the abundant studies conducted to evaluate CDSS, most of these studies failed to recognize these multiple levels of impact and mostly focused on the clinical efficacy of these systems using randomized controlled trials (RCT) designs. In this paper, we propose that CDSS evaluation is a complex task that cannot be accomplished using a single research methodology. We propose a framework that identifies the multiple levels impacted by CDSS and the appropriate methodologies that can be used to evaluate these impacts. We also provide an example of using this framework to evaluate a pain management CDSS. This study informs future evaluation studies on what and how to evaluate at different levels of CDSS interventions.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: It has been difficult to monitor the pelvic position during actual daily life. However, recent developments in wearable device technologies, such as the LUMOback device, provide the possibility to evaluate habitual pelvic posture and time spent sitting during daily life. The current study aimed (1) to investigate test\u2013retest reliability for habitual pelvic posture and time spent sitting with the LUMOback in individuals with prolonged low back pain (low back pain group) and without low back pain (control group), and (2) to preliminarily investigate differences in those measures between groups. Methods: Fifteen individuals in each group wore the LUMOback daily for 2\u2009weeks. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated in each group by comparing the mean from the first week with the mean from the second week: (1) for the posture score, which is a proportion of time with neutral posture, and (2) for time spent sitting. The two measures for the first week were compared between the low back pain and control groups. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for the posture score were .82 in the low back pain group and .91 in the control group. The intraclass correlation coefficients for time spent sitting were .75 in the low back pain group and .85 in the control group. The posture score in the low back pain group (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 37.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3%) was less than that in the control group (49.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0%; p\u2009<\u2009.001), but there was no difference in time spent sitting between the groups (p\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions: The current study found (1) acceptable test\u2013retest reliability for the posture score and time spent sitting evaluated by the LUMOback device, and (2) preliminary evidence of a difference in the posture score, indicating a more slouched lumbopelvic posture in individuals with prolonged low back pain than those without low back pain.",

Working alliance can be measured by a 12-item self-reporting measure with 7-point Likert scale, the Working Alliance Inventory Short-Form Client (WAI-SC). Objectives: To develop a shorter version of the Japanese WAI-SC through examination of factor structure and test\u2013retest reliability. Design: Survey. Method: A convenience sample of 118 outpatients with musculoskeletal disorders completed the WAI-SC immediately after the third consultation and 101 of them completed the WAI-SC immediately before the fourth consultation. Results/findings: Through investigations of internal consistency, test\u2013retest reliability, and factor structure, a single structure was detected by excluding Item 4 and Item 10. Score calculation was also modified to dichotomous variables (Score 7 or other scores) due to serious ceiling effects, where >50% of responses were Score 7. A five-item questionnaire with dichotomous score rating (Modified WAI-SC Japanese musculoskeletal version) was developed through consideration of internal consistency and item-total correlation analysis. This questionnaire demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.88) and excellent test\u2013retest reliability for each item (Cohen\u2019s \u03ba for all > 0.4) and total scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84).

Methods The data were from a prospective cohort study (n = 369). Potential indicators were gathered from a typical Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) history and examination.

A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to examine the number of significant indicators that could predict group classification. Results Five indicators were identified to predict group classification. Classification into the spinal group was associated with the presence of paresthesia [odds ratio (OR) 1.984], change in symptoms with sitting/neck or trunk flexion/turning neck/when still (OR 2.642), change in symptoms with posture change (OR 3.956), restrictions in spinal movements (OR 2.633), and no restrictions in extremity movements (OR 2.241).

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The current standard to evaluate the presence of somatosensory dysfunctions is quantitative sensory testing, but its clinical utility remains limited. Low\u2010cost and time\u2010efficient clinical sensory testing (CST) batteries have thus been developed. Recent studies show moderate to substantial reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability of people with spine\u2010related leg and arm pain, representing mixed pain mechanisms. Methods Fifty\u2010three patients with spine\u2010related leg (n\u2009=\u200941) and arm pain (n\u2009=\u200912) attended three CST sessions. The CST battery consisted of eleven tests, determining loss and gain of sensory nerve function. CST was performed by the same investigator twice and by an additional investigator to determine inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability. Fleiss' (inter\u2010tester) and Cohen's (intra\u2010tester) kappa were calculated for dichotomized and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous outcomes. Results Fleiss' kappa varied among modalities from fair to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.23\u20130.66). Cold, warm, and vibration detection thresholds and cold and pressure pain thresholds reached kappa >0.4 (moderate to substantial reliability). Cohen's kappa ranged from moderate to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.45\u20130.66). The reliability of the windup ratio was poor (ICC <0.18). Conclusion CST modalities with moderate to substantial inter\u2010tester reliability could be of benefit as a screening tool. The moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability for all sensory modalities (except windup ratio) supports their potential use in clinical practice and research to monitor somatosensory changes over time in patients with spine\u2010related limb pain of mixed pain mechanisms. Significance We already know that most modalities of clinical sensory test (CST) batteries achieve moderate to substantial inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the reliability of a CST battery in populations with mixed pain mechanisms. We found inter\u2010tester reliability varied from poor to substantial for sensory modalities, questioning the value of some CST modalities. The CST battery showed moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability, suggesting its usefulness to monitor sensory changes over time in this cohort.",
