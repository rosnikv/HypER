        "title": "Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe administration of growth hormone can attenuate the catabolic response to injury, surgery, and sepsis. However, the effect of high doses of growth hormone on the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the outcome in critically ill adults who are hospitalized for long periods is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out two prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in parallel involving 247 Finnish patients and 285 patients in other European countries who had been in an intensive care unit for 5 to 7 days and who were expected to require intensive care for at least 10 days. The patients had had cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple trauma, or acute respiratory failure. The patients received either growth hormone (mean [+/-SD] daily dose, 0.10 +/- 0.02 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo until discharge from intensive care or for a maximum of 21 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe in-hospital mortality rate was higher in the patients who received growth hormone than in those who did not (P<0.001 for both studies). In the Finnish study, the mortality rate was 39 percent in the growth hormone group, as compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. The respective rates in the multinational study were 44 percent and 18 percent. The relative risk of death for patients receiving growth hormone was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.9) in the Finnish study and 2.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.5) in the multinational study. Among the survivors, the length of stay in intensive care and in the hospital and the duration of mechanical ventilation were prolonged in the growth hormone group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with prolonged critical illness, high doses of growth hormone are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.",

        "title": "Effect of growth hormone on muscle and liver protein synthesis in septic rats receiving glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveAdministration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to critically ill adults in an attempt to attenuate catabolism was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Possible explanations included inhibition of glutamine release from skeletal muscle and consequent restriction of splanchnic glutamine supply. In this study, we examined the effects of rhGH on plasma glutamine levels and on muscle and liver glutamine concentrations and protein synthesis rates in sepsis. We investigated the possibility that administration of supplemental glutamine might ameliorate any adverse effects of rhGH. DesignProspective study in rats rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture. SettingUniversity hospital laboratory. SubjectsA total of 78 male Wistar rats in six groups. InterventionsAnimals received 6-hr tail vein infusions, commencing 18 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, of either (a) 0.9% sodium chloride, (b) a standard parenteral nutrition (PN) solution without glutamine, or (c) an isocaloric, isonitrogenous PN solution with glutamine. PN groups received 400 &mgr;g rhGH or equivolume 0.9% sodium chloride vehicle in a divided subcutaneous and intravenous dose at PN commencement. Sacrifice was at the end of the infusion period. A further group was unoperated and uninfused and killed at 24 hrs as baseline controls. Measurements and Main ResultsGlutamine concentrations were measured by fluorometry. Protein synthesis in muscle and liver was measured by a \u201cflooding-dose\u201d technique employing l-[4-H]phenylalanine. Plasma glutamine was increased after cecal ligation and puncture except in the saline and glutamine with rhGH animals. Muscle glutamine was reduced after cecal ligation and puncture and was significantly lower in animals receiving standard PN with rhGH vs. saline alone. Liver glutamine was increased in animals receiving saline and those receiving standard PN with rhGH. PN, with or without glutamine, increased muscle protein synthesis, and the administration of rhGH tended to further increase this effect. Neither PN, glutamine, nor rhGH had an effect on the increased liver protein synthesis characteristic of sepsis. ConclusionsIn sepsis, increased muscle protein synthesis with PN and rhGH administration is not associated with increased muscle glutamine levels. Administration of rhGH does not result in reduced liver glutamine levels or rates of hepatic protein synthesis. PN containing glutamine was no more efficacious than standard PN at increasing muscle protein synthesis.",

        "title": "Liver albumin synthesis in sepsis in the rat: influence of parenteral nutrition, glutamine and growth hormone.",
        "abstract": "The effect of sepsis on liver synthesis of albumin remains controversial, with studies in man suggesting that synthesis increases, whereas in animals increased, decreased and unaltered synthesis have been reported. To reconcile these conflicting data, total and relative albumin synthesis was measured in rats 24 h after caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) by immunoprecipitation of albumin following a flooding dose of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine. Following CLP, animals were starved for 18 h and then received intravenous infusions of saline or parenteral nutrition (PN) with or without glutamine for 6 h. In animals receiving PN, parenteral injections of growth hormone (GH) or saline vehicle were also administered. Fractional rate of liver total protein synthesis was elevated and total albumin synthesis rate was reduced in all CLP groups when compared with non-operated animals. Total albumin synthesis was also lower in all animals receiving PN than those receiving saline alone, although these differences did not attain statistical significance, except for the group receiving PN+GH. Relative albumin synthesis was also reduced after CLP, and was significantly lower in animals receiving PN than in those receiving saline alone. These findings suggest that in sepsis hepatic protein synthesis is reprioritized away from the production of albumin towards the production of acute-phase proteins and that this change is not influenced by the provision of nutritional support, glutamine or the administration of GH.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background & Aim: to analyze the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of parenteral immunonutrition (PN). Methods: prospective clinical trial of a group of 105 patients operated on for gastric carcinoma between 2001-2003. During the postoperative period, patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups: standard PN (A), PN + glu-tamine (B) and PN + omega-3-FA (C). The rate and type of complications, hepatic and renal function, cost and treatment tolerance in all groups were analyzed. Results: postoperative complications were observed in 11 patients (36,6%) in group A, in 7 (23,3%) in B and in 8 (26,6%) in C. The most common complication was pneumonia. Prealbumin concentration and TLC increased faster in groups B and C. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the immunonutrition groups. The cost of PN was highest in C group, while cost of hospital stay was longer in A. Conclusions: immunostimulating parenteral nutrition helps to reduce the number of infectious complications, improves the function of the immune system, and has no influence on surgical complications, hepatic and renal function and protein synthesis. The cost of immunostimulating treatment based on omega-3-unsaturated fatty acids is higher than standard.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess the safety and efficacy of an early enteral pharmaconutrition supplement containing glutamine dipeptides, antioxidative vitamins and trace elements, and butyrate in critically ill, septic patients. Design:A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Setting:Adult intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients:Fifty-five critically ill, septic patients requiring enteral feeding. Interventions:Patients received either an enteral supplement (500 mL of Intestamin, Fresenius Kabi) containing conditionally essential nutrients or a control solution via the nasogastric route for up to 10 days. Inclusion occurred within 24 hrs of intensive care unit admission. Additionally, patients received enteral feeding with an immunonutrition formula (experimental group) or standard formula (control group) initiated within 48 hrs after enrollment. Measurements and Main Results:Organ dysfunction was assessed by daily total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score over the 10-day study period in both patient groups. Patients receiving the experimental supplement showed a significantly faster decline in the regression slopes of delta daily total SOFA score over time compared with control. The difference between the regression coefficients of the two slopes was significant irrespective of the level of analysis: intent to treat \u22120.32 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; per protocol \u22120.34 vs. \u22120.14, p < .0001; and completers (patients receiving \u226580% of the calculated caloric target over a period of 6 days), \u22120.26 vs. \u22120.16, p = .0005.

        "title": "Selenium and glutamine supplements: where are we heading? A critical care perspective",
        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThere is considerable interest in glutamine and selenium in critical care as both offer the potential to enhance host defences, through different but complimentary mechanisms and may reduce subsequent infections and mortality. The SIGNET trial (randomized controlled factorial trial) is the largest, critical care study of both supplements. The data have been presented publicly, but the data are not published or available for review and will therefore not be discussed fully in this update. In the present review I will explore the recently available (past 1\u20132 years) published literature. Recent findingsThe current literature demonstrates that there are currently insufficient data to enable confident recommendations on the optimal route, timing, duration and dosage of each of these nutritional supplements. The pending results of SIGNET, the largest critical care trial of parenteral nutrition supplemented by glutamine and or selenium promises to clarify some of the current ambiguities and inform future practice. SummaryTo be able to confidently establish or refute the hypothesis that either glutamine or selenium alone or in combination improves outcome in critical care requires a well designed prospective randomized controlled trial. To design such a trial we require the optimal dose and duration of the nutritional supplement (balancing efficacy and toxicity, ease of administration and cost) and then conduct an adequately powered trial. Such a trial is still lacking for these two agents. There are some supportive data for selenium but the case is less strong for parenteral glutamine and weakest for enteral glutamine.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewComplete parenteral nutrition solutions contain mixed amino acid products providing all nine essential amino acids and a varying composition of nonessential amino acids. Relatively little rigorous comparative efficacy research on altered parenteral nutrition amino acid composition has been published in recent years. Recent findingsLimited data from randomized, double-blind, adequately powered clinical trials to define optimal doses of total or individual amino acids in parenteral nutrition are available. An exception is the growing number of studies on the efficacy of glutamine supplementation of parenteral nutrition or given as a single parenteral agent. Parenteral glutamine appears to confer benefit in selected patients; however, additional data to define optimal glutamine dosing and the patient subgroups who may most benefit from this amino acid are needed. Although some promising studies have been published, little data are available in the current era of nutrition support on the clinical efficacy of altered doses of arginine, branched chain amino acids, cysteine, or taurine supplementation of parenteral nutrition. SummaryDespite routine use of parenteral nutrition, surprisingly little clinical efficacy data are available to guide total or specific amino acid dosing in adult and pediatric patients requiring this therapy. This warrants increased attention by the research community and funding agencies to better define optimal amino acid administration strategies in patient subgroups requiring parenteral nutrition.",

        "title": "Amino Acid Concentrations in Critically Ill Children Following Cardiac Surgery*",
        "abstract": "Objective: Guidelines for administering amino acids to critically ill children are largely based on uncontrolled observational studies and expert opinion, without support from rigorous outcome studies. Also, data on circulating amino acid concentrations during critical illness are scarce. We thoroughly studied the time profiles of circulating amino acid concentrations in critically ill children who received standard nutritional care according to international guidelines. Design: This is a subanalysis of pediatric critically ill patients included in a large (n = 700) randomized controlled study on intensive insulin therapy. Setting: The study was conducted at a university hospital PICU. Patients: We studied 100 patients in PICU for at least 3 days following cardiac surgery. Interventions: Patients were assigned to intensive insulin therapy targeting normal-for-age fasting blood glucose concentrations or insulin infusion only to prevent excessive hyperglycemia. Measurements and Main Results: Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured at admission, day 3, and day 7 in PICU. At admission, the concentrations of most amino acids were comparable to those reported for healthy children. Total amino acid concentrations remained stable during ICU stay, but individual amino acids showed different time profiles with eight of them showing an increase and five a decrease. Nonsurviving children had higher total amino acid concentrations and individual amino acids compared with survivors at admission and/or during ICU stay. Intensive insulin therapy lowered the concentrations of total amino acids and several individual amino acids. Neonates showed somewhat different amino acid profiles with rather increased concentrations from baseline with time in ICU for total amino acids and several individual amino acids as compared with older infants and children. Conclusions: Circulating amino acid concentrations in critically ill children after cardiac surgery differ according to survival status, blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy, and age.",

Their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains uncertain, particularly in youth. We investigated the role of BCAA and aromatic amino acids (AAA) in obesity, their relationships with novel biomarkers of CVD and response to a physical activity-based lifestyle intervention (PAL-I) in a randomized controlled study in youth with normal weight (NW) and obesity (OB).\n\n\nMETHODS\nAge (14-18 years) and Tanner stage (\u2265IV) matched youth (OB, n=15 and NW, n=6) were studied; the 15 participants with OB underwent a 3-month randomized controlled PAL-I. Circulating amino acid profile, glucose, insulin, lipids, adiponectin, retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4), fibrinogen, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 25-hydroxy vitamin-D, along with body composition (DXA) were measured at baseline and after PAL-I. Independent t-tests, analysis of covariance and mixed effect models were used for analysis of the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to NW, the concentration of various amino acids including BCAA and AAA were altered in the OB (P<0.05). BCAA and AAA showed baseline correlations with body composition and novel biomarkers of CVD, particularly inflammatory factors (p<0.05 for all). The PAL-I produced only negligible effects (p>0.05) on BCAA and AAA. Glutamine, glycine, and aspartic acid decreased with PAL-I (p<0.05 for all).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe novel finding of the BCAA-inflammation relationship along with strong correlations with nontraditional biomarkers of CVD may evoke the prospect of BCAA as a biomarkers of CVD and a potential link between obesity, T2DM and CVD.",

        "abstract": "Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes, severely affecting patients\u2019 vision and even leading to blindness. The development of DR is influenced by metabolic disturbance and genetic factors, including gene polymorphisms. The research aimed to uncover the causal relationships between blood metabolites and DR. Methods The two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to estimate the causality of blood metabolites on DR. The genetic variables for exposure were obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of 486 blood metabolites, while the genetic predictors for outcomes including all-stage DR (All DR), non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) were derived from the FinnGen database. The primary analysis employed inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and supplementary analyses were performed using MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), simple mode and weighted mode methods. Additionally, MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran\u2019s Q test, and leave-one-out analysis were also conducted to guarantee the accuracy and robustness of the results. Subsequently, we replicated the MR analysis using three additional datasets from the FinnGen database and conducted a meta-analysis to determine blood metabolites associated with DR. Finally, reverse MR analysis and metabolic pathway analysis were performed. Results The study identified 13 blood metabolites associated with All DR, 9 blood metabolites associated with NPDR and 12 blood metabolites associated with PDR. In summary, a total of 21 blood metabolites were identified as having potential causal relationships with DR. Additionally, we identified 4 metabolic pathways that are related to DR. Conclusion The research revealed a number of blood metabolites and metabolic pathways that are causally associated with DR, which holds significant importance for screening and prevention of DR. However, it is noteworthy that these causal relationships should be validated in larger cohorts and experiments.",
