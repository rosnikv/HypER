        "title": "Persistent acid reflux and symptoms in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitor therapy",
        "abstract": "Objectives To assess both acid gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) suppression in patients with Barrett's oesophagus on proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) and the predictive value of symptoms. Design A prospective study of patients with Barrett's epithelium (> 3 cm, containing specialized intestinal metaplasia). Patients and methods Forty-five patients with Barrett's epithelium were recruited. Therapy was adjusted to omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Oesophageal manometry and 24 h pH studies were performed on treatment. Heartburn score was calculated before and after PPI dose adjustment. In patients with persisting acid reflux, omeprazole dose was increased to 20 mg three times daily and pH studies repeated. Adequacy of GOR suppression, assessed by pH monitoring, was related to heartburn score (0\u20133). Results Twenty of the 45 patients were symptomatic (mean score 1.9) on pre-study treatment (mainly omeprazole < 20 mg once daily); on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, only six patients remained symptomatic (mean score 1.6). Ten patients (22%) had persisting GOR on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (median % total time with pH < 4 was 8%). Abnormal nocturnal reflux was found in nine and abnormal daytime reflux in only four patients. Heartburn persisted in three of these 10 patients (30%). Those remaining symptomatic had more daytime acid reflux than the asymptomatic patients with persistent reflux (median percentage daytime at pH < 4 was 13.6% vs 0.6%, respectively; P < 0.01). By increasing the omeprazole dose to 20 mg three times daily, only three of the 10 had persistent acid reflux. Conclusions Persistent acid reflux on PPI therapy is common in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. Although nocturnal acid reflux is the most common finding, symptoms tended to occur in those with abnormal daytime reflux. Symptom resolution does not guarantee acid reflux control.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe diagnosis and management of Barrett's esophagus (BE) are controversial. We conducted a critical review of the literature in BE to provide guidance on clinically relevant issues.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multidisciplinary group of 18 participants evaluated the strength and the grade of evidence for 42 statements pertaining to the diagnosis, screening, surveillance, and treatment of BE. Each member anonymously voted to accept or reject statements based on the strength of evidence and his own expert opinion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was strong consensus on most statements for acceptance or rejection. Members rejected statements that screening for BE has been shown to improve mortality from adenocarcinoma or to be cost-effective. Contrary to published clinical guidelines, they did not feel that screening should be recommended for adults over age 50, regardless of age or duration of heartburn. Members were divided on whether surveillance prolongs survival, although the majority agreed that it detects curable neoplasia and can be cost-effective in selected patients. The majority did not feel that acid-reduction therapy reduces the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma but did agree that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are associated with a cancer risk reduction and are of promising (but unproven) value. Participants rejected the notion that mucosal ablation with acid suppression prevents adenocarcinoma in BE but agreed that this may be an appropriate strategy in a subgroup of patients with high-grade dysplasia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on this review of BE, the opinions of workshop members on issues pertaining to screening and surveillance are at variance with published clinical guidelines.",

        "title": "Role of chemoprophylaxis with either NSAIDs or statins in patients with Barrett's esophagus.",
        "abstract": "The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a poor prognosis neoplasia, has risen dramatically in recent decades. Barrett's esophagus represents the best-known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma development. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs through cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and prostaglandin metabolism regulation could control cell proliferation, increase cell apoptosis and regulate the expression of growth and angiogenic factors. Statins can achieve equivalent effects through prenylation and subsequently control of cellular signaling cascades. At present, epidemiological studies are small and underpowered. Their data could not justify either medication as a chemo-preventive agent. Population based studies have shown a 43% reduction of the odds of developing an esophageal adenocarcinoma, leaving out or stating a 25% reduction in patients consuming non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a 50% reduction in those patients consuming aspirin. They have also stated a 19% reduction of esophageal cancer incidence when statins have been used. Observational studies have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could reduce the adenocarcinoma incidence in patients with Barrett's esophagus by 41%, while statins could reduce the risk by 43%. The cancer preventive effect has been enhanced in those patients taking a combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins (a 74% decrease). Observational data are equivocal concerning the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug subclasses. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs clearly have substantial potential for toxicity, while statins are rather safe drugs. In conclusion, both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins are promising chemopreventive agents and deserve further exploration with interventional studies. In the meanwhile, their use is justified only in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leads to the accumulation of bile-induced reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in esophageal tissues, causing inflammation and DNA damage. The progression sequence from healthy esophagus to GERD and eventually cancer is associated with a microbiome shift. Lactobacillus species are commensal organisms known for their probiotic and antioxidant characteristics in the healthy esophagus. This prompted us to investigate how Lactobacilli survive in a bile-rich environment during GERD, and to identify their interaction with the bile-injured esophageal cells. To model human reflux conditions, we exposed three Lactobacillus species (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum) to bile. All species were tolerant to bile possibly enabling them to colonize the esophageal epithelium under GERD conditions. Next, we assessed the antioxidant potential of Lactobacilli and role in bile injury repair: we measured bile-induced DNA damage using the ROS marker 8-oxo guanine and COMET assay. Lactobacillus addition after bile injury accelerated repair of bile-induced DNA damage through recruitment of pH2AX/RAD51 and reduced NF\u03baB-associated inflammation in esophageal cells. This study demonstrated anti-genotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of Lactobacilli, making them of significant interest in the prevention of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with GERD.",

        "abstract": "General Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women, with increasing incidence worldwide. Specific Background: Recent research has focused on the role of epigenetic changes in DNA damage, repair mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic effects of probiotics. Probiotics have shown promise in promoting tissue regeneration and DNA repair. Knowledge Gap: However, the precise impact of probiotics on DNA repair in cancer cells, specifically breast cancer cells, remains underexplored. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on DNA damage repair in AMJ13 Iraqi breast cancer cells and assess the cytotoxic effects of probiotics on these cells. Results: Using the comet assay, we found significant increases in DNA damage repair in AMJ13 cells treated with Lactobacillus plantarum (T1) and a combination of eight probiotic strains (T2). Exposure to T1 for 48 hours resulted in significant increases in tail DNA (P\u22640.001), head DNA (P\u22640.001), and tail moment (P<0.001), while T2 showed similar significant increases at 72 hours (P<0.05). Image analysis further supported the DNA repair potential of probiotics, as indicated by a small tail curve for treated cells. Novelty: This study provides novel insights into the therapeutic potential of probiotics in breast cancer treatment by demonstrating their capacity to enhance DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. Implications: The findings suggest that probiotic therapy may be a promising adjunct treatment in breast cancer, offering a new avenue for cancer management through the enhancement of DNA repair and reduction of DNA damage. \nHighlights: \n\u00a0 \n \nProbiotics significantly repaired DNA damage in breast cancer cells. \nT1 and T2 enhanced DNA repair within 48-72 hours. \nProbiotics offer potential as breast cancer adjunct therapy. \n \n\u00a0 \nKeywords: Breast cancer, probiotics, DNA repair, AMJ13 cells, cytotoxicity",
