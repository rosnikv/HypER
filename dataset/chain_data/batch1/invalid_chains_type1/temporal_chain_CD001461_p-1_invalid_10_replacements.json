        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

We have recently generated a novel monoclonal antibody against a rheumatoid synovial T cell line that recognizes an antigen termed UM4D4 (CDw60). This antigen is expressed on a minority of peripheral blood T cells, and represents the surface component of a distinct pathway of human T cell activation. The current studies were performed to examine the expression and function of UM4D4 on T cells obtained from synovial fluid and synovial membranes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory joint disease. The UM4D4 antigen is expressed at high surface density on about three-fourths of synovial fluid T cells and on a small subset of synovial fluid natural killer cells; in synovial tissue it is present on more than 90% of T cells in lymphoid aggregates, and on approximately 50% of T cells in stromal infiltrates In addition, UM4D4 is expressed in synovial tissue on a previously undescribed population of HLA-DR/DP-negative non-T cells with a dendritic morphology. Anti-UM4D4 was co-mitogenic for both RA and non-RA synovial fluid mononuclear cells, and induced IL-2 receptor expression. The UM4D4/CDw60 antigen may represent a functional activation pathway for synovial compartment T cells, which could play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Although autoreactive T cells are thought to play a prominent role in autoimmune disease in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, it has been difficult to directly determine if autoreactive T cells escape from the thymus and react with self-antigens in the periphery. Defective expression of the Fas apoptosis antigen in MRL-lpr/lpr mice results from the insertion of the ETn retrotransposon. The fas defect can be partially corrected in CD2-fas transgenic mice in which the expression of fas is corrected in T cells. To identify a possible defect in clonal deletion or clonal anergy induction of auto-specific T cells, we have studied C57BL/6-lpr/lpr transgenic mice that express TcR genes that recognize a known self-antigen, the male H-Y antigen. In addition, we have analyzed clonal deletion and tolerance induction after neonatal tolerance induction and superantigen-induced arthritis with the class II MHC reactive superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in V beta 8 TcR transgenic and non-transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Neonatal tolerance induction to SEB was normal in lpr/lpr mice. However, over time a loss of tolerance (thymic or peripheral) was observed in lpr/lpr mice but not in +/+ TcR transgenic mice. This defect in lpr/lpr mice was thymic-dependent and was due to increased CD28/CTLA4 signaling. These results suggest that an apoptosis defect involving both thymocytes and peripheral lymphoid cells leads to autoimmune disease in lpr/lpr mice. The challenge in the future will be to determine the role of defective apoptosis in other autoimmune diseases.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether cell lines derived from RA type B synoviocytes could also serve as accessory cells for T lymphocyte activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCells from RA synoviocyte lines, with or without preculture in interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), were cultured with purified peripheral blood T cells, in the presence or absence of superantigens or other accessory cell-dependent T cell mitogens. T cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation, and synoviocyte surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA type B synoviocyte lines were potent accessory cells for T cell responses to bacterial superantigens or lectins, and direct cell-cell contact was required. Preculture in IFN gamma augmented synoviocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and of ligands for some T cell costimulatory receptors, but synoviocyte accessory cell function was evident even in the absence of IFN gamma. Blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies supported the notion of a role CD2, CD11a/CD18 and MHC class II molecules in synoviocyte-dependent T cell activation. Monoclonal antibodies against IFN gamma, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha failed to block the T cell proliferative responses, but anti-IL-2 was strongly inhibitory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCultured RA and type B synoviocytes can perform some of the functions of professional antigen-presenting cells. If such cells have similar properties in vivo, they may be important participants in activation of immune responses, in addition to their previously described synthetic and proinflammatory roles. If RA synovial tissue T cells, like normal peripheral blood T cells, can respond to superantigens presented by synoviocytes, this interaction could be important in the pathogenesis of RA.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

        "title": "Class II Transactivator: Mastering the Art of Major Histocompatibility Complex Expression",
        "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are the predominant presenters of exogenous antigens to T helper cells (reviewed in references 21, 77, and 99). These key molecules are critical for numerous aspects of immune function, including T-cell selection, tolerance induction, antibody production, T-cell-mediated immunity, and the inflammatory response. As principal mediators of transplant rejection, these molecules are often common targets for immune therapies to prevent the rejection of grafted tissues. Class II MHC is implicated as a contributing factor in a host of diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes to Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. \n \nConstitutive expression of class II MHC is restricted to \u201cprofessional\u201d antigen-presenting cells but can be induced on various tissues by gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3). In humans, a congenital lack of both constitutive and inducible class II results in a profound and generally fatal immunodeficiency (type II bare lymphocyte syndrome [BLS]) (7, 29, 45, 61, 67, 75, 112) marked by a significant reduction of CD4+ T cells. Early molecular forays addressing BLS revealed that the genes encoding class II MHC were not defective. Instead, the defect lay in transcription factors controlling class II MHC gene expression. BLS thus became the first disease known to be caused by defective or absent transcription factors. The availability of patient-derived cell lines with class II MHC transcription defects provided a unique tool of nature to identify the requisite transcription factors. \n \nTranscriptional regulation of class II MHC expression is complex. Class II MHC and related promoters are characterized by the presence of conserved W (or S), X, and Y boxes (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1)1) (reviewed in references 10, 67, and 75). The X element is bipartite. The upstream X1 region is recognized by RFX, a trimeric complex of RFX family members including RFX5, RFXANK (RFX-B), and RFXAP (32, 74, 87, 117). The downstream X2 box is bound by X2BP (NF-X2), a complex comprising CREB, and an unidentified 120-kDa protein (83, 84). Another trimeric complex, NF-Y (CBF), which is highly conserved in eukaryotes, binds the Y box (69, 71, 146; reviewed in reference 70). A number of factors interacting with the W box have been described, including the RFX complex (26, 48, 120). The factors involved in X and Y box binding are ubiquitous and expressed constitutively yet fail to account for either constitutive or IFN-\u03b3-inducible class II MHC expression. Somatic cell fusions using BLS patient-derived cells allowed the definition of complementation groups, with each group containing a defect in a single genetic locus. This type of analysis revealed a crucial locus, aIr-1, which in all likelihood encodes the class II transactivator (CIITA), which explained the lack of class II transcription in BLS complementation group A (1, 118). Group A cells express the requisite X and Y binding proteins but fail to transcribe class II. CIITA expression appears to be a nearly absolute requisite for expression of class II MHC, whether constitutive or inducible (17, 19, 23, 47, 85, 103, 114, 118, 119). A number of class II MHC-related genes including genes encoding HLA-DM (H-2M in mice) and invariant chain (Ii), with promoters similar to those for classical class II genes, are also regulated by CIITA (17, 18, 22, 23, 50, 137). CIITA can also upregulate expression of class I MHC genes and beta-2-microglobulin (\u03b22m) through effects at site \u03b1 in addition to X- and Y-like sequences in the promoters for these genes (40, 72, 104). These initial observations have led to the view that CIITA is a master, or global, regulator for expression of class II MHC and related genes. \n \n \n \nFIG. 1 \n \nOrganization of W, X, Y, and other motifs in the promoters of class II MHC and related genes. Genes coding for class II MHC and related proteins contain well conserved W, X, and Y boxes, the presence of which correlates with transcriptional regulation ... \n \n \n \nSince the discovery of CIITA, numerous primary articles and several reviews on its role in regulating the class II MHC have been published. In this review, we will discuss the molecular structure of this novel protein, its mechanism of function, and its biologic and clinical relevance, which is broad.",

These effects have led to the use of GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant with promising results; however, the mechanisms underlying GM-CSF-mediated immune potentiation are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the immune stimulatory role of GM-CSF is in part due to effects on class II MHC Ag presentation. We find that, in primary human monocytes treated for 24\u201348 h, GM-CSF increases surface class II MHC expression and decreases the relative level of the invariant chain-derived peptide, CLIP, bound to surface class II molecules. GM-CSF also increases expression of the costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40, but not the differentiation marker CD1a or CD16. Furthermore, GM-CSF-treated monocytes are better stimulators in a mixed leukocyte reaction. Additional analyses of the class II pathway revealed that GM-CSF increases total protein and RNA levels of HLA-DR, DM, and DO\u03b1. Expression of class II transactivator (CIITA) types I and III, but not IV, transcripts increases in response to GM-CSF. Furthermore, GM-CSF increases the amount of CIITA associated with the DR promoter. Thus, our data argue that the proinflammatory role of GM-CSF is mediated in part through increased expression of key molecules involved in the class II MHC pathway via induction of CIITA.",

        "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

        "abstract": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 is a critical negative regulator of cytokine signaling and is induced by Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Gue\u0301rin (M. bovis BCG) in mouse macrophages. However, little is known about the early receptor proximal signaling mechanisms underlying mycobacteria-mediated induction of SOCS3. We demonstrate here for the first time that M. bovis BCG up-regulates NOTCH1 and activates the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, leading to the expression of SOCS3. We show that perturbing Notch signaling in infected macrophages results in the marked reduction in the expression of SOCS3. Furthermore, enforced expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in RAW 264.7 macrophages induces the expression of SOCS3, which can be further potentiated by M. bovis BCG. The perturbation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling resulted in marked reduction in SOCS3 levels and expression of the NOTCH1 target gene, Hes1. The down-regulation of MyD88 resulted in a significant decrease in SOCS3 expression, implicating the role of the TLR2-MyD88 axis in M. bovis BCG-triggered signaling. However, the SOCS3 inducing ability of M. bovis BCG remains unaltered also upon infection of macrophages from TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice. More importantly, signaling perturbation data suggest the involvement of cross-talk among members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades with NOTCH1 signaling in SOCS3 expression. Furthermore, SOCS3 expression requires the NOTCH1-mediated recruitment of Suppressor of Hairless (CSL) and nuclear factor-\u03baBtothe Socs3 promoter. Overall, these results implicate NOTCH1 signaling during inducible expression of SOCS3 following infection of macrophages with an intracellular bacillus-like M. bovis BCG.",

        "abstract": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are found to be accompanied with innate immunity dysregulation including abnormally macrophage activation. But the functional polarization of the activated macrophages and its underlying molecular mechanism during the pathogenesis of SLE remains unknown. As an important local cellular interaction mechanism responsible for cell fate determination, Notch signaling is reported to exert crucial functions in the development and differentiation of various immunocytes, whereas its role in macrophage polarization is not fully understood. In this study, in the SLE murine model generated by immunization with activated lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA), infiltrated macrophages in the nephritic tissues were found to exhibit activation and M2b functional polarization. Notch1 signaling activity was significantly upregulated in the ALD-DNA\u2013induced M2b macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ALD-DNA\u2013induced M2b polarization was found to be dependent on enhanced Notch1 signaling through accelerating NF-\u03baB p50 translocation into the nucleus mediated by PI3K and MAPK pathways. Moreover, blockade of Notch1 signaling with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor treatment before or after the disease initiation could ameliorate murine lupus through impeding macrophage M2b polarization. Our results implied that Notch1 signaling-dependent macrophage M2b polarization might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE, which could provide Notch1 signaling blockade as a potential therapeutic approach for SLE disease.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage differentiation and polarization is influenced by, and act on, many processes associated with autoimmunity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage polarization in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remain largely debated. We previously demonstrated that macrophage M2b polarization conferred by activated lymphocyte-derived (ALD)-DNA immunization could initiate and propagate murine lupus nephritis. Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a conserved acute-phase protein in mice, has been reported to bind to DNA and modulate immune responses. In this study, murine SAP was shown to promote macrophage-mediated ALD-DNA uptake through binding to ALD-DNA (SAP/ALD-DNA). Moreover, macrophage phenotypic switch from a proinflammatory M2b phenotype induced by ALD-DNA alone to an anti-inflammatory M2a phenotype stimulated with SAP/ALD-DNA were found because of PI3K/Akt\u2013ERK signaling activation. Both in vivo SAP supplements and adoptive transfer of ex vivo programmed M2a macrophages induced by SAP/ALD-DNA into SLE mice could efficiently alleviate lupus nephritis. Importantly, increased IL-10 secretion, accompanied by anti-inflammatory effect exerted by M2a macrophages, was found to predominantly impede macrophage M2b polarization. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-10 notably reduced the suppressive effect of M2a macrophages. Our results demonstrate that binding of SAP to ALD-DNA could switch macrophage phenotypic polarization from proinflammatory M2b to anti-inflammatory M2a via PI3K/Akt\u2013ERK signaling activation, thus exerting protective and therapeutic interventions on murine lupus nephritis. These data provide a possible molecular mechanism responsible for modulation of macrophage polarization in the context of lupus nephritis and open a new potential therapeutic avenue for SLE.",

In extraembryonic life, under homeostatic conditions, the macrophage trophic and remodelling functions are recapitulated in tissues such as bone, mammary gland, decidua and placenta. In pathology, macrophages are key components of tissue repair and remodelling that occur during wound healing, allergy, parasite infection and cancer.

        "abstract": "Mitochondria present a unique set of key intracellular functions such as ATP synthesis, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ buffering. Mitochondria both encode and decode Ca2+ signals and these interrelated functions have a direct impact on cell signaling and metabolism. High proliferative potential is a key energy-demanding feature shared by cancer cells and activated T lymphocytes. Switch of a metabolic state mediated by alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis plays a fundamental role in maintenance of the proliferative state. Recent studies show that tumor suppressors have the ability to affect mitochondrial homeostasis controlling both cancer and autoimmunity. Herein, we discuss established and putative mechanisms of calcium\u2013dependent regulation of both T cell and tumor cell activities. We use the mitochondrial protein Fus1 as a case of tumor suppressor that controls immune response and tumor growth via maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. We focus on the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling as a key function of Fus1 and highlight the mechanisms of a crosstalk between Ca2+ accumulation and mitochondrial homeostasis. Given the important role of Ca2+ signaling, mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and ROS production in the activation of NFAT and NF-\u03baB transcription factors, we outline the importance of Fus1 activities in this context.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that promotes inflammation when released extracellularly after cellular activation, stress, damage or death. HMGB1 operates as one of the most intriguing molecules in inflammatory disorders via recently elucidated signal and molecular transport mechanisms. Treatments based on antagonists specifically targeting extracellular HMGB1 have generated encouraging results in a wide number of experimental models of infectious and sterile inflammation. Clinical studies are still to come. Areas covered: We here summarize recent advances regarding pathways for extracellular HMGB1 release, receptor usage, and functional consequences of post-translational modifications. The review also addresses results of preclinical HMGB1-targeted therapy studies in multiple inflammatory conditions and outlines the current status of emerging clinical HMGB1-specific antagonists. Expert opinion: Blocking excessive amounts of extracellular HMGB1, particularly the disulfide isoform, offers an attractive clinical opportunity to ameliorate systemic inflammatory diseases. Therapeutic interventions to regulate intracellular HMGB1 biology must still await a deeper understanding of intracellular HMGB1 functions. Future work is needed to create more robust assays to evaluate functional bioactivity of HMGB1 antagonists. Forthcoming clinical studies would also greatly benefit from a development of antibody-based assays to quantify HMGB1 redox isoforms, presently assessed by mass spectrometry methods.",

        "abstract": "Key Points ApoE was found in complex with C4d in RA patient SF. Deposited ApoE activates complement whereas ApoE in solution is inhibitory. Posttranslational modifications alter ApoE's capacity to bind FH and C4BP. We identified apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as one of the proteins that are found in complex with complement component C4d in pooled synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Immobilized human ApoE activated both the classical and the alternative complement pathways. In contrast, ApoE in solution demonstrated an isoform-dependent inhibition of hemolysis and complement deposition at the level of sC5b-9. Using electron microscopy imaging, we confirmed that ApoE interacts differently with C1q depending on its context; surface-bound ApoE predominantly bound C1q globular heads, whereas ApoE in a solution favored the hinge/stalk region of C1q. As a model for the lipidated state of ApoE in lipoprotein particles, we incorporated ApoE into phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes and found that the presence of ApoE on liposomes increased deposition of C1q and C4b from serum when analyzed using flow cytometry. In addition, posttranslational modifications associated with RA, such as citrullination and oxidation, reduced C4b deposition, whereas carbamylation enhanced C4b deposition on immobilized ApoE. Posttranslational modification of ApoE did not alter C1q interaction but affected binding of complement inhibitors factor H and C4b-binding protein. This suggests that changed ability of C4b to deposit on modified ApoE may play an important role. Our data show that posttranslational modifications of ApoE alter its interactions with complement. Moreover, ApoE may play different roles in the body depending on its solubility, and in diseased states such as RA, deposited ApoE may induce local complement activation rather than exert its typical role of inhibition.",

Certain microbial infections, such as those caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella copri, can induce autoantigens in RA. Anti-modified protein antibodies (AMPA) containing anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies, and anti-acetylated protein antibodies (AAPAs) play a role in pathogenesis as well as in prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis.

Yet, the verdict is still out on the definitive role of P. copri in human health, and on the effect of different diets on its relative abundance in the gut microbiome. The puzzling discrepancies among P. copri studies have only recently been attributed to the diversity of its strains, which substantially differ in their encoded metabolic patterns from the commonly used reference strain. However, such strain differences cannot be resolved by common 16S rRNA amplicon profiling methods. Here, we scrutinize P. copri, its versatile metabolic potential, and the hypotheses behind the conflicting observations on its association with diet and human health. We also provide suggestions for designing studies and bioinformatics pipelines to better research P. copri.",
