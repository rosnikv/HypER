        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPlatelets are believed to play a part in the ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty, such as abrupt closure of the coronary vessel during or soon after the procedure. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIschemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhen administered in conjunction with primary coronary stenting for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may provide additional clinical benefit, but data on this combination therapy are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 300 patients with acute myocardial infarction in a double-blind fashion either to abciximab plus stenting (149 patients) or placebo plus stenting (151 patients) before they underwent coronary angiography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 30 days and 6 months after the procedure. The angiographic patency of the infarct-related vessel and the left ventricular ejection fraction were evaluated at 24 hours and 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 30 days, the primary end point--a composite of death, reinfarction, or urgent revascularization of the target vessel--had occurred in 6.0 percent of the patients in the abciximab group, as compared with 14.6 percent of those in the placebo group (P=0.01); at 6 months, the corresponding figures were 7.4 percent and 15.9 percent (P=0.02). The better clinical outcomes in the abciximab group were related to the greater frequency of grade 3 coronary flow (according to the classification of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) in this group than in the placebo group before the procedure (16.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent, P=0.01), immediately afterward (95.1 percent vs. 86.7 percent, P=0.04), and six months afterward (94.3 percent vs. 82.8 percent, P=0.04). One major bleeding event occurred in the abciximab group (0.7 percent); none occurred in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with placebo, early administration of abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction improves coronary patency before stenting, the success rate of the stenting procedure, the rate of coronary patency at six months, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAs compared with thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in acute myocardial infarction reduces the rates of death, reinfarction, and stroke, but recurrent ischemia, restenosis, and reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. When used in combination with PTCA, coronary stenting and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may further improve outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 2082 patients with acute myocardial infarction to undergo PTCA alone (518 patients), PTCA plus abciximab therapy (528), stenting alone with the MultiLink stent (512), or stenting plus abciximab therapy (524).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNormal flow was restored in the target vessel in 94.5 to 96.9 percent of patients and did not vary according to the reperfusion strategy. At six months, the primary end point - a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel - had occurred in 20.0 percent of patients after PTCA, 16.5 percent after PTCA plus abciximab, 11.5 percent after stenting, and 10.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab (P<0.001). There were no significant differences among the groups in the rates of death, stroke, or reinfarction; the difference in the incidence of the primary end point was due entirely to differences in the rates of target-vessel revascularization (ranging from 15.7 percent after PTCA to 5.2 percent after stenting plus abciximab, P<0.001). The rate of angiographically established restenosis was 40.8 percent after PTCA and 22.2 percent after stenting (P<0.001), and the respective rates of reocclusion of the infarcted-related artery were 11.3 percent and 5.7 percent (P=0.01), both independent of abciximab use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt experienced centers, stent implantation (with or without abciximab therapy) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of coronary artery stents in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nThe review was conducted following accepted guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials that include comparisons of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) versus PTCA with stent, stent versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and drug-eluting stents (DES) versus non-DES in patients with CAD in native or graft vessels and those with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and unstable angina were also included. Data on the following outcome measures were included in the review: combined event rate or event-free survival, death, acute myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation, repeat treatment (PTCA, stent or CABG) and binary restenosis. An economic model was developed based on extrapolation of trends in mortality and revascularisation from clinical trials data to a 5-year time horizon.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 50 studies comparing the use of stents with PTCA, six comparing stents with CABG and 12 comparing DES eluting stents with non-DES. No studies were identified that compared DES with PTCA or DES with CABG. Existing quality of life data suggest that revascularisation procedures reduce the patient's quality of life for a short period only. Stents were found to be more effective than PTCA in preventing adverse events and revascularisations. In multiple-vessel disease there was no evidence of a difference in mortality (at 1 year) between patients treated surgically and those receiving a stent. Patients treated surgically required fewer revascularisations. There is no evidence of a difference in mortality between patients receiving DES and those treated with bare metal stents at 1 year. A reduction in event rate at 9 and 12 months was found in patients treated with DES. This event rate is primarily made up of increased revascularisation rates in patients treated with bare metal stents. Two-year outcome data from one study indicate that this benefit of DES continues over the longer term. The economic model proved sufficient to indicate long-term trends in cost-effectiveness. CABG was found initially to be more expensive than bare metal stenting in multivessel disease and may have higher immediate risks, but over time the cost differential is reduced and long-term outcomes favour CABG over stenting. A similar situation was found for DES versus CABG in multiple-vessel disease. However, DES may not generally be considered a cost-effective alternative to bare metal stenting in single-vessel disease by policy makers as substantially higher costs are involved with a very small outcome benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDES might be considered cost-effective if the additional cost (compared with ordinary stents) was substantially reduced, the outcome benefits from the use of DES were much improved, and/or its use were targeted on the subgroups of patients with the highest risks of requiring reintervention. Long-term clinical studies are needed that focus on significant outcomes such as mortality. Further research should consider: the differences among plain stents; head-to-head comparisons within DES, CABG compared with DES; and the evaluation of newer non-DES against DES. Evaluation of the effects of revascularisation procedures and especially repeat revascularisation procedures on the patient's quality of life would also be useful, as would the development and testing of risk assessment tools to identify patients likely to need further revascularisations.",

        "abstract": "No recent pharmaceutical or medical device has generated as much ongoing and expanding attention as drug-eluting stents (DES). In fact there has been an explosion of published reports on the topic within cardiology, medical, surgical and subspecialty journals. The device industry has repeatedly sent their own summaries of information directly to physicians, while mainstream media has kept the consumer and Wall Street appraised of safety concerns, often with sensational headlines. The Food and Drug Administration has also taken notice by convening a meeting on DES in late 2006. What have we learned through all this dissemination of data?\n\nArticle p 745 \n\nThe introduction of DES was greeted with intense enthusiasm in a \u201cperfect storm\u201d sort of way. Device representatives were eager to promote this new product that could dramatically reduce restenosis.1 Patients expected to be treated with this new and \u201cbetter\u201d technology. Lastly, cardiologists had a potent new tool at their disposal that they increasingly incorporated into practice until it became the default revascularization device instead of bare-metal stents in many parts of the world. This quick and widespread adoption in DES resulted in its frequent use in relatively untested and off-label indications. At the Cleveland Clinic, the use of DES mirrored the community and many interventional practices throughout the world, where the penetration of this device peaked at >90%.\n\nWhile DES use was increasing, McFadden and colleagues sounded an alarm with the publication of a report on 4 patients who experienced late stent thrombosis.2 Although this could have been a chance finding, DES were systematically shown to confer an increased risk of late thrombosis relative to bare-metal stents.3 This safety issue has been confirmed by several independent analyses with patient-level data from the pivotal randomized trials.1,4,5\n\nStent thrombosis is uncommon, although when it occurs it \u2026",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nInterventional pain management is a specialty that utilizes invasive procedures to diagnose and treat chronic pain. Patients undergoing these treatments may be receiving exogenous anticoagulants and antithrombotics. Even though the risk of major bleeding is very small, the consequences can be catastrophic. However, the role of antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease to decrease the incidence of acute cerebral and cardiovascular events is also crucial. Overall, there is a paucity of literature on the subject of bleeding risk in interventional pain management along with practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and anti-thrombotic therapy.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nBest evidence synthesis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo critically appraise and synthesize the literature with assessment of the bleeding risk of interventional techniques including practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe available literature on the bleeding risk of interventional techniques and practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was reviewed. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 through December 2012 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients who discontinue antithrombotic therapy, spontaneous epidural hematomas occur with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy associated with stressors such as chiropractic manipulation, diving, and anatomic abnormalities such as ankylosing spondylitis, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques. There is fair evidence that excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation may occur with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon is higher than the risk of epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques, to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal], and Aggrenox [aspirin and dipyridamole]), and that anatomic conditions such as spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis, and procedures involving the cervical spine; multiple attempts; and large bore needles increase the risk of epidural hematoma; and rapid assessment and surgical or nonsurgical intervention to manage patients with epidural hematoma can avoid permanent neurological complications. There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), or prasugrel (Effient) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities. There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas during interventional techniques and to continue to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe recommendations derived from the comprehensive assessment of the literature and guidelines are to continue NSAIDs and low dose aspirin, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole, cilostazol, Aggrenox) during interventional techniques. However, the recommendations for discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) is variable with clinical judgment to continue or discontinue based on the patient's condition, the planned procedure, risk factors, and desires, and the cardiologist's opinion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin may be discontinued 12 hours prior to performing interventional techniques. Warfarin should be discontinued or international normalized ratio (INR) be normalized to 1.4 or less for high risk procedures and 2 or less for low risk procedures based on risk factors. It is also recommended to discontinue Pradaxa for 24 hours for paravertebral interventional techniques in 2 to 4 days for epidural interventions in patients with normal renal function and for longer periods of time in patients with renal impairment, and to discontinue rivaroxaban for 24 hours prior to performing interventional techniques.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\u00a0 The paucity of the literature.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the available literature including guidelines, the recommendations in patients with antithrombotic therapy for therapy prior to interventional techniques are provided.",

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the relationship between antiplatelet resistance and clinically silent thromboembolic complications using DWI in patients who underwent coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2011 and May 2013, 58 patients with 62 unruptured aneurysms who were measured for antiplatelet response using VerifyNow assay and underwent elective coil embolization for an unruptured aneurysm with posttreatment DWI were enrolled. Diffusion-positive lesions were classified into 3 groups according to the number of lesions (n = 0 [grade 0], n < 6 [grade I], and n \u2265 6 [grade II]). The relationship between antiplatelet resistance and diffusion-positive lesions was analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two endovascular coiling procedures were performed on 58 patients. Clopidogrel resistance was revealed in 23 patients (39.7%) and diffusion-positive lesions were demonstrated in 28 patients (48.3%); these consisted of 19 (32.8%) grade I and 9 (15.5%) grade II lesions. Clopidogrel resistance was not relevant to the development of any diffusion-positive lesion (grade I and II, P = .789) but was associated with the development of multiple diffusion-positive lesions (grade II, P = .002). In the logistic regression prediction model, clopidogrel resistance showed significant correlation with the development of grade II lesions (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple diffusion-positive lesions (\u22656 in number) occurred more frequently in patients with clopidogrel resistance after endovascular coiling for unruptured aneurysms.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Procedure-related thromboembolism is a major limitation of coil embolization, but the relationship between thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet resistance is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to verify the association between immediate postprocedural thromboembolic infarction and antiplatelet drug resistance after endovascular coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 338 aneurysms between October 2012 and March 2015. All patients underwent postprocedural MR imaging within 48 hours after endovascular coil embolization. Antiplatelet drug resistance was checked a day before the procedure by using the VerifyNow system. Abnormal antiplatelet response was defined as >550 aspirin response units and >240 P2Y12 receptor reaction units. In addition, we explored the optimal cutoff values of aspirin response units and P2Y12 receptor reaction units. The primary outcome was radiologic infarction based on postprocedural MR imaging. RESULTS: Among 338 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 134 (39.6%) showed diffusion-positive lesions on postprocedural MR imaging, and 32 (9.5%) and 105 (31.1%) had abnormal aspirin response unit and P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values, respectively. Radiologic infarction was associated with advanced age (65 years and older, P = .024) only with defined abnormal antiplatelet response (aspirin response units \u2265 550, P2Y12 receptor reaction units \u2265 240). P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values in the top 10th percentile (>294) were associated with radiologic infarction (P = .003). With this cutoff value, age (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.28\u20134.08), P2Y12 receptor reaction units (>294; OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.53\u20137.71), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04\u20134.02) were associated with radiologic infarction in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic infarction after coiling for unruptured aneurysm was closely associated with age. Only very high P2Y12 receptor reaction unit values (>294) predicted postprocedural infarction. Further controlled studies are needed to determine the precise cutoff values, which could provide information regarding the optimal antiplatelet regimen for aneurysm coiling.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe use of antiplatelet medications to prevent thrombosis in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms with stents has become widely emphasized.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare low-dose prasugrel with clopidogrel in stent-assisted coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a retrospective review of 311 aneurysms from 297 patients who underwent stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysm between November 2014 and March 2017. Thromboembolic and hemorrhagic adverse events were compared between 207 patients who received low-dose prasugrel (PSG group) and 90 patients who received clopidogrel (CPG group).\n\n\nRESULTS\nP2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values were significantly lower in the PSG group (PSG group vs CPG group, 132.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076.9 vs 238.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a069.1; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001); the percentage of inhibition was also statistically higher in the PSG group (54.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.0% vs 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Thromboembolic events occurred less frequently in the PSG group than in the CPG group (0.9% vs 6.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01), whereas there was no significant difference in the percentage of hemorrhagic complications (0.5% vs 2.2%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.22). In the multivariate analysis, clopidogrel as the antiplatelet medication was the sole significant risk factor for thromboembolism in this series of patients undergoing stent-assisted coil embolization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUse of low-dose PSG as an antiplatelet premedication is quick, effective, and safe for stent-assisted coil embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Prasugrel premedication significantly lowered the frequency of thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVEIn the presence of symmetric A1 flow, the safety and efficacy of compromising the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) during coil embolization of ACoA aneurysms has yet to be evaluated. Herein, the authors describe their experience, focusing on procedural safety.METHODSBetween October 2012 and July 2017, 285 ACoA aneurysms with symmetric A1 flows were treated at the authors' institution by endovascular coil embolization. Clinical and angiographic outcome data were subjected to binary logistic regression analysis.RESULTSACoA compromise was chosen in the treatment of 71 aneurysms (24.9%), which were completely (n = 15) or incompletely (n = 56) compromised. In the remaining 214 lesions, the ACoA was preserved. Although 9 patients (3.2%) experienced procedure-related thromboembolisms (compromised, 4; preserved, 5), all but 1 patient (with ACoA compromise) were asymptomatic. In multivariate analysis, subarachnoid hemorrhage at presentation was the sole independent risk factor for thromboembolism (OR 15.98, p < 0.01), with ACoA compromise being statistically unrelated. In 276 aneurysms (96.8%) with follow-up of > 6 months (mean 20.9 \u00b1 13.1 months, range 6-54 months), recanalization was confirmed in 21 (minor, 15; major, 6). A narrow (\u2264 4 mm) saccular neck (p < 0.01) and ACoA compromise (p = 0.04) were independently linked to prevention of recanalization.CONCLUSIONSDuring coil embolization of ACoA aneurysms, the ACoA may be compromised without serious complications if A1 flows are symmetric. This approach may also confer some long-term protection from recanalization, serving as a valid treatment option for such lesions.",

        "abstract": "The use of antiplatelets is widespread in clinical practice. However, for neurointerventional procedures, protocols for antiplatelet use are scarce and practice varies between individuals and institutions. This is further complicated by the quantity of antiplatelet agents which differ in route of administration, dosage, onset of action, efficacy and ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. Clarifying the individual characteristics for each antiplatelet agent, and their associated risks, will increasingly become relevant as the practice of mechanical thrombectomy, stenting, coiling and flow diversion procedures grows.

        "abstract": "Background Antiplatelet therapy, where regimens are tailored based on platelet function testing, has been introduced into neurointerventional surgery. This nationwide registry study evaluated the effect and safety of tailored antiplatelet therapy in stent assisted coiling for unruptured aneurysms compared with conventional therapy using a standard regimen. Methods This study enrolled 1686 patients in 44 participating centers who received stent assisted coiling for unruptured aneurysms between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. The standard regimen (aspirin and clopidogrel) was used for all patients in the conventional group (924, 19 centers). The regimen was selected based on platelet function testing (standard regimen for clopidogrel responders; adding cilostazol or replacing clopidogrel with other thienopyridines (ticlopidine, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for clopidogrel non-responders) in the tailored group (762, 25 centers). The primary outcome was thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes were bleeding and poor outcomes (increase in modified Rankin Scale score). Outcomes within 30 days after coiling were compared using logistic regression analysis. Results The thromboembolic event rate was lower in the tailored group than in the conventional group (30/762 (3.9%) vs 63/924 (6.8%), adjusted OR 0.560, 95% CI 0.359 to 0.875, P=0.001). The bleeding event rate was not different between the study groups (62/762 (8.1%) vs 73/924 (7.9%), adjusted OR 0.790, 95%\u2009CI 0.469 to 1.331, P=0.376). Poor outcomes were less frequent in the tailored group (12/762 (1.6%) vs 34 (3.7%), adjusted OR 0.252, 95%\u2009CI 0.112 to 0.568, P=0.001).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe optimal duration for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stent-assisted coiling (SAC) of intracranial aneurysms is unclear. Longer-term therapy may reduce thrombotic complications but increase the risk of bleeding complications.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review of prospectively maintained data at 12 institutions was conducted on patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who underwent SAC between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020, and were followed \u22656 months postprocedure. The type and duration of DAPT, stent(s) used, outcome, length of follow-up, complication rates, and incidence of significant in-stent stenosis (ISS) were collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 556 patients reviewed, 450 met all inclusion criteria. Nine patients treated with DAPT <29 days after SAC and 11 treated for 43-89 days were excluded from the final analysis as none completed their prescribed duration of treatment. Eighty patients received short-term DAPT. There were no significant differences in the rate of thrombotic complications during predefined periods of risk in the short, medium, or long-term treatment groups (1/80, 1.3%; 2/188, 1.1%; and 0/162, 0%, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found in the rate of hemorrhagic complications during period of risk in any group (0/80, 0%; 3/188, 1.6%; and 1/162, 0.6%, respectively). Longer duration DAPT did not reduce ISS risk in any group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuing DAPT >42 days after SAC did not reduce the risk of thrombotic complications or in-stent stenosis, although the risk of additional hemorrhagic complications remained low. It may be reasonable to discontinue DAPT after 42 days following non-flow diverting SAC of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.",
