        "title": "Supplementation with Folic Acid during Methotrexate Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "The folic acid antagonist methotrexate (n-10-methyl-aminopterin) is useful in low doses (2.5 to 20 mg/wk) for treating chronic inflammatory diseases [1-7]. Many trials have established the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis [7-13]. Compared with other disease-modifying drugs, methotrexate has the highest probability of drug continuation at 10 years. Dose response-related toxic effects have been reported in 30% to 90% of patients given methotrexate [13]. Toxic effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic abnormalities, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity [14-22]. Some side effects of methotrexate administration, such as gastrointestinal intolerance, mimic complicated folate deficiency [23]. Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; further, folate stores are decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate, suggesting that impaired folate status is related to toxicity [24-26]. Folic acid supplementation has been reported anecdotally to lessen toxicity in patients receiving methotrexate treatment [27, 28]. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7 mg of folic acid weekly (1 mg/d or 2265 nmol/d) decreased methotrexate toxicity without affecting efficacy [29]. This was confirmed by Stewart and colleagues [30] in a retrospective chart review. Folinic acid (leucovorin, citrovorum factor) is a one-carbon-substituted, fully reduced folate that has also been administered during methotrexate therapy [31-36]. Low doses of the vitamin (1 to 7 mg/wk) have decreased methotrexate toxicity [35, 36]. Higher doses negate efficacy and lessen toxicity [31, 32]. Thus, the folinic acid dose may critically affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The influence of the folic acid dose on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy remains controversial, and the effects of different doses of folic acid are not known [37, 38]. Some investigators argue that if toxic effects occur, the most rational approach is to reduce the dose of methotrexate rather than to provide folic acid supplements [37]. We designed a larger and longer study to evaluate different doses of folic acid, assuming that toxicity could be reduced without changing the efficacy of methotrexate. Methods Participants Patients aged 19 to 78 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology's revised criteria for rheumatoid arthritis consented to participate in the trial [39]. Enrollment criteria included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed more than 6 months previously, onset after the age of 16 years, and at least three of the following signs or symptoms: 3 or more swollen joints, 6 or more tender joints, at least 45 minutes of morning stiffness, and a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h. Referring rheumatologists and the principal investigator did the screening. Exclusion criteria included serious concomitant medical illnesses, liver enzyme levels twice the upper limit of normal, leukocyte counts less than 3.5 109/L or platelet counts less than 150 109/L, and use of methotrexate within the past 6 months. Gold salts were stopped for at least 10 days before the trial. This short washout period mirrors actual rheumatology practice. Patients remained under the care of their rheumatologists, abstained from alcohol use, did not become pregnant, and received stable doses of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If prednisone was taken at entry, the dose could not exceed 10 mg/d. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was allowed during the study. Study Design Figure 1 shows the trial design. To maintain the double-blind status of the trial, the statistician carried out the randomization using a computer program in which the algorithm was transparent and a coded vial number represented the treatment assignment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups by a sequential treatment assignment process designed to balance the sample with respect to baseline features, including age, sex, folate-containing vitamin use, rheumatoid factor status, and prednisone use [40]. Patients agreed to discontinue therapy with folate-containing vitamins during the trial. Rheumatoid factor was considered positive if the level was more than 30 IU/mL or if the titer was more than 1:160. Patients received either visually identical placebo or 5 mg (low-dose folic acid group) or 27.5 mg folic acid (high-dose folic acid group) each week, prepared by the Hospital Investigational Drug Service. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the mean SD folic acid content was 1 0.15 mg (2.3 0.3 mol) and 5.5 0.3 mg (12.5 0.7 mol) per capsule in the low-dose and high-dose folic acid groups, respectively. Lederle Laboratories provided the methotrexate (Rheumatrex; Pearl River, New York), which was started in a median oral dose of 16.5 mol (7.5 mg) per week and increased in 5.5-mol (2.5 mg) increments at the rheumatologist's discretion. Methotrexate was taken either in an undivided or a divided dose (that is, every 12 hours for three doses). The methotrexate dosing regimens were identical among the study groups. Folic acid supplements were given 5 days per week when methotrexate was not ingested. Compliance with the regimen was reinforced using a digital reminder cap (Counter Cap; Senetics, Boulder, Colorado). All participants and investigators were blinded to vitamin capsule content until the study was complete. Figure 1. Study design for the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical Assessment Patients were evaluated immediately before methotrexate initiation at a mean of 13, 26, 39, and 53 weeks (Figure 1). Each patient was assessed by the same physician-nutritionist (SLM). Two research assistants (JSA or WHV) did the joint evaluations. In most cases, patients were examined by the same observer throughout the study. The joint counts for tenderness and swelling were not significantly different between the two observers (P = 0.6 for tenderness; P = 0.9 for swelling). The following variables were evaluated at each visit: 1) number of the 58 diarthrodial joints with swelling; 2) number of the 60 joints with tenderness on pressure or with pain on passive motion (or both); 3) joint swelling and tenderness indices, expressed as a sum, with each joint graded for swelling as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 [severe]; 4) mean grip strength (three measurements) for both hands expressed in mm Hg; 5) duration of morning stiffness expressed in hours; 6) patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity graded as 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (very severe); 7) current medications and doses; 8) a 1-day dietary recall using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software, Food Database version 6A, Nutrient Database version F21 [41]; 9) eight activities of daily living assessed and averaged at baseline and at 12 months using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and scored on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) [42]; and 10) presence, duration, intensity, and severity of toxic effects at every follow-up visit and every 3 weeks by telephone interview (done by SLM). Laboratory Assessments At the initial visit, complete blood cell count, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzyme (aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase), rheumatoid factor by nephelometry, and serum creatinine values were obtained. The complete blood cell count, creatinine, and liver function tests were repeated at all visits. If laboratory values were obtained more frequently than stipulated in the protocol, they were recorded and became part of the toxicity score. Blood for plasma and erythrocyte folate levels, using a methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay, was drawn at all visits [43]. At baseline, blood was drawn for a vitamin panel (plasma and erythrocyte folate, vitamins B12, A, C, and E, carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, pyridoxine) [44-51]. If patients had abnormal values for any of the vitamins, other than folate, the abnormality was treated with single vitamin supplements. Radiographic Assessment Hand and wrist radiographs taken within 6 months of entering the trial were assessed by one of the rheumatologists (GSA) without knowledge of study status. Joint erosions and space narrowing were determined by the modified method of Sharp [52]. Results were expressed as the mean raw scores for joint erosion and joint space narrowing. Toxicity: Frequency and Severity Toxic effects and discontinuation of therapy with study medications due to toxicity were considered primary outcomes. We determined a toxicity score, modified from the one previously used, for each patient at each visit or until methotrexate therapy was discontinued [29] (Appendix). Efficacy We determined patient response to treatment using a modification of the criteria used in our previous folic acid supplementation trial and by others [8, 29, 53]. We defined marked improvement in the joint swelling index and the joint tenderness and pain index as a net decrease of 50% or more in value at any follow-up visit compared with visit 1. We defined moderate improvement as a 30% to 49% net decrease in the index, and no change as the index value remaining within 30% of the original value. We defined worsening as an increase in the index value of 30% or more. We examined the effects of folic acid supplementation on changes in physician and patient global assessments, grip strength, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, findings of the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, complete blood cell counts, blood folate levels, and dietary folate and vitamin B12 intake.

Long-term low-dose methotrexate therapy (25 mg or less once a week) inhibits production of thymidylate, purines, and methionine and leads to accumulation of adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory substance. These actions inhibit cellular proliferation, decrease formation of antibodies, and decrease production of mediators of inflammation such as interleukins and eicosanoids. Three uncontrolled trials and two controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy of low-dose methotrexate therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease and have also suggested possible benefit for ulcerative colitis and for remission maintenance indications in both diseases. Although methotrexate is generally well tolerated for long-term use at a low dose, several serious toxicities potentially limit its use.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethotrexate is a promising new agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

Recent findings The year 2003 was highlighted by further knowledge on the use of biologic therapy in Crohn disease. Important lessons were learned from the expanding clinical experience with infliximab. Several other studies of agents targeting tumor necrosis factor-&agr; revealed mixed and sometimes disappointing results. However, this was balanced by encouraging results of several studies of biologic agents that inhibit lymphocyte trafficking. Other studies evaluated a variety of small molecules, including tacrolimus, leflutamide, and mycophenolate. Finally, controversy was raised with published studies looking at the efficacy and safety of 6-thiogunaine. Summary There appears to be an expanding array of treatment options that will become available to clinicians for the treatment of Crohn disease. New treatment paradigms have emerged for managing mild to moderate disease. Small molecules may provide alternatives for immunomodulation other than the purine antimetabolites and methotrexate. Increased understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of Crohn disease has allowed the development of novel therapeutics directed at specific molecular targets. However, as the treatment options expand, questions regarding optimal combination treatment strategies will need to be answered.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine associations of methotrexate (MTX) efficacy and toxicity with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for folate pathway enzymes in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients (n=205) with active RA received MTX at an initial dosage of 7.5 mg/week, which was increased to 15 mg/week and combined with folic acid (1 mg/day) after 4 weeks. If the Disease Activity Score in 44 joints (DAS44) was >2.4 at 3 months, MTX was increased to 25 mg/week. MTX efficacy was evaluated at 3 and 6 months and compared for genotypes in 3 analyses: patients with and without good response (DAS44<or=2.4), patients with and without good improvement (DeltaDAS44>1.2), and patients with and without moderate improvement (DeltaDAS44>0.6). The association between MTX-related adverse drug events (ADEs) and genotype was evaluated by comparing genotypes between patients with and without ADEs, specifically pneumonitis, gastrointestinal ADEs, skin and mucosal ADEs, and elevated liver enzyme levels. The following SNPs were analyzed: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) -473G>A, DHFR 35289G>A, and reduced folate carrier 80G>A. In case of significant differences, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 6 months, MTHFR 1298AA was associated with good improvement relative to 1298C (OR 2.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-4.41), which increased with increased copies of the MTHFR 677CC haplotype. In contrast, MTHFR 1298C allele carriers developed more ADEs (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.32-4.72).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with MTHFR 1298AA and MTHFR 677CC showed greater clinical improvement with MTX, whereas only the MTHFR 1298C allele was associated with toxicity. In the future, MTHFR genotypes may help determine which patients will benefit most from MTX treatment.",

        "abstract": "Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are uptake transporters for a broad range of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. To investigate the physiologic and pharmacologic roles of OATPs of the 1A and 1B subfamilies, we generated mice lacking all established and predicted mouse Oatp1a/1b transporters (referred to as Slco1a/1b-/- mice, as SLCO genes encode OATPs). Slco1a/1b-/- mice were viable and fertile but exhibited markedly increased plasma levels of bilirubin conjugated to glucuronide and increased plasma levels of unconjugated bile acids. The unexpected conjugated hyperbilirubinemia indicates that Oatp1a/1b transporters normally mediate extensive hepatic reuptake of glucuronidated bilirubin. We therefore hypothesized that substantial sinusoidal secretion and subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated reuptake of glucuronidated compounds can occur in hepatocytes under physiologic conditions. This alters our perspective on normal liver functioning. Slco1a/1b-/- mice also showed drastically decreased hepatic uptake and consequently increased systemic exposure following i.v. or oral administration of the OATP substrate drugs methotrexate and fexofenadine. Importantly, intestinal absorption of oral methotrexate or fexofenadine was not affected in Slco1a/1b-/- mice. Further analysis showed that rifampicin was an effective and specific Oatp1a/1b inhibitor in controlling methotrexate pharmacokinetics. These data indicate that Oatp1a/1b transporters play an essential role in hepatic reuptake of conjugated bilirubin and uptake of unconjugated bile acids and drugs. Slco1a/1b-/- mice will provide excellent tools to study further the role of Oatp1a/1b transporters in physiology and drug disposition.",

We then used MTA to predict the effects of a subset of inhibitors on atorvastatin uptake in vivo. Using a data set of 225 drug-like compounds, 91 OATP inhibitors were identified. In silico models indicated that lipophilicity and polar surface area are key molecular features of OATP inhibition.

This work aimed to characterize the interaction of a series of compounds with rat and human organic anion transporters (OATs) and develop quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs) to optimize renal clearance. 2.\u2002In vitro inhibition assays were established for human OAT1 and rat Oat3 and rat in vivo renal clearance was obtained. Statistically significant quantitative relationships were explored between the compounds\u2019 physical properties, their affinity for OAT1 and oat3 and the inter-relationship with unbound renal clearance (URC) in rat. 3.\u2002Many of the compounds were actively secreted and in vitro analysis demonstrated that these were ligands for rat and human OAT transporters (IC50 values ranging from <1 to >100\u2009\u00b5M). Application of resultant QSAR models reduced renal clearance in the rat from 24 to <0.1\u2009ml/min/kg. Data analysis indicated that the properties associated with increasing affinity at OATs are the same as those associated with reducing URC but orthogonal in nature. 4.\u2002This study has demonstrated that OAT inhibition data and QSAR models can be successfully used to optimize rat renal clearance in vivo and provide confidence of translation to humans.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic cancer is a class of cancer that is relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, and cancers that harbor EGFR active mutations are more sensitive to EGFR-TK inhibitor such as gefitinib, which becomes the first-line treatment of this subtype of cancer. However, almost all patients treated with gefitinib will develop drug resistance. Here we show that a protein called integrin beta-8 (ITGB8) when over-expressed, is correlated with the gefitinib resistance of hepatic cancer cell line HepG2/G. After ITGB8 silencing, the drug resistance is reversed as the cell proliferation decreases and apoptosis rate increases significantly by gefitinib treatment when compared to HepG2/G. We demonstrated that multi-drug resistant proteins ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCG2, anti-apoptosis proteins like survivin and Bcl-2, and cycle promoting protein CDK1 are involved in drug resistance of HepG2/G. Other drug-resistance relative proteins like SOD, GST, TS and HIF-1 are also modulated by ITGB8 silencing, but their role in this gefitinib resistance might be indirect. TGF beta pathway could be a critical pathway by which ITGB8 modulates the sensitivity of HepG2/G to gefitinib.",

        "title": "Quantification of Flavin-containing Monooxygenases 1, 3, and 5 in Human Liver Microsomes by UPLC-MRM-Based Targeted Quantitative Proteomics and Its Application to the Study of Ontogeny",
        "abstract": "Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) have a significant role in the metabolism of small molecule pharmaceuticals. Among the five human FMOs, FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5 are the most relevant to hepatic drug metabolism. Although age-dependent hepatic protein expression, based on immunoquantification, has been reported previously for FMO1 and FMO3, there is very little information on hepatic FMO5 protein expression. To overcome the limitations of immunoquantification, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based targeted quantitative proteomic method was developed and optimized for the quantification of FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5 in human liver microsomes (HLM). A post-in silico product ion screening process was incorporated to verify LC-MRM detection of potential signature peptides before their synthesis. The developed method was validated by correlating marker substrate activity and protein expression in a panel of adult individual donor HLM (age 39\u201367 years). The mean (range) protein expression of FMO3 and FMO5 was 46 (26\u201365) pmol/mg HLM protein and 27 (11.5\u201349) pmol/mg HLM protein, respectively. To demonstrate quantification of FMO1, a panel of fetal individual donor HLM (gestational age 14\u201320 weeks) was analyzed. The mean (range) FMO1 protein expression was 7.0 (4.9\u20139.7) pmol/mg HLM protein. Furthermore, the ontogenetic protein expression of FMO5 was evaluated in fetal, pediatric, and adult HLM. The quantification of FMO proteins also was compared using two different calibration standards, recombinant proteins versus synthetic signature peptides, to assess the ratio between holoprotein versus total protein. In conclusion, a UPLC-MRM-based targeted quantitative proteomic method has been developed for the quantification of FMO enzymes in HLM.",

Plasma concentrations of the victim drug can be modified by drug\u2013drug interactions occurring in enterocytes (e.g., P\u2010glycoprotein), hepatocytes (e.g., organic anion\u2010transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1)), and/or renal proximal tubular cells (e.g., organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2)/multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 and 2\u2010K (MATE1/MATE2\u2010K)). In addition, transporter\u2010mediated drug\u2013drug interactions can cause altered local tissue concentrations and possibly altered effects/toxicity (e.g., in liver and kidneys). During drug development, there is now an intensive in vitro screening of new molecular entities as transporter substrates and inhibitors, followed if necessary by drug\u2013drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, there are still unresolved issues, which will also be discussed in this review article (e.g., the clinical significance of transporter\u2010mediated drug\u2013drug interactions of particular relevance to the elderly who are prescribed multiple drugs, with additional impaired liver or kidney function, and the extent to which medication safety in real life could be improved by a reduction of those interactions).",

        "title": "Toxicity induced by ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin: oxidative stress and metabolism",
        "abstract": "Abstract Ciprofloxacin (CIP) (human use) and enrofloxacin (ENR) (veterinary use) are synthetic anti-infectious medications that belong to the second generation of fluoroquinolones. They have a wide antimicrobial spectrum and strong bactericidal effects at very low concentrations via enzymatic inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are required for DNA replication. They also have high bioavailability, rapid absorption with favorable pharmacokinetics and excellent tissue penetration, including cerebral spinal fluid. These features have made them the most applied antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine. ENR is marketed exclusively for animal medicine and has been widely used as a therapeutic veterinary antibiotic, resulting in its residue in edible tissues and aquatic environments, as well as the development of resistance and toxicity. Estimation of the risks to humans due to antimicrobial resistance produced by CIP and ENR is important and of great interest. Moreover, in rare cases due to their overdose and/or prolonged administration, the development of CIP and ENR toxicity may occur. The toxicity of these fluoroquinolones antimicrobials is mainly related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS) generation, besides metabolism-related toxicity. Therefore, CIP is restricted in pregnant and lactating women, pediatrics and elderly similarly ENR do in the veterinary field. This review manuscript aims to identify the toxicity induced by ROS and OS as a common sequel of CIP and ENR. Furthermore, their metabolism and the role of metabolizing enzymes were reported.",

        "title": "Screening of phytochemicals from Clerodendrum inerme (L.) Gaertn as potential anti-breast cancer compounds targeting EGFR: an in-silico approach.",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy among women around the world. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) of the ErbB/HER family. It is essential for triggering the cellular signaling cascades that control cell growth and survival. However, perturbations in EGFR signaling lead to cancer development and progression. Hence, EGFR is regarded as a prominent therapeutic target for breast cancer. Therefore, in the current investigation, EGFR was targeted with phytochemicals from Clerodendrum inerme (L.) Gaertn (C. inerme). A total of 121 phytochemicals identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis were screened against EGFR through molecular docking, ADMET analyses (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity), PASS predictions, and molecular dynamics simulation, which revealed three potential hit compounds with CIDs 10586 [i.e. alpha-bisabolol (-6.4\u2009kcal/mol)], 550281 [i.e. 2,(4,4-Trimethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-5a-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohexene) (-6.5\u2009kcal/mol)], and 161271 [i.e. salvigenin (-7.4\u2009kcal/mol)]. The FDA-approved drug gefitinib was used to compare the inhibitory effects of the phytochemicals. The top selected compounds exhibited good ADMET properties and obeyed Lipinski's rule of five (ROF). The molecular docking analysis showed that salvigenin was the best among the three compounds and formed bonds with the key residue Met 793. Furthermore, the molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MMGBSA) calculations, molecular dynamics simulation, and normal mode analysis validated the binding affinity of the compounds and also revealed the strong stability and compactness of phytochemicals at the docked site. Additionally, DFT and DOS analyses were done to study the reactivity of the compounds and to further validate the selected phytochemicals. These results suggest that the identified phytochemicals possess high inhibitory potential against the target EGFR and can treat breast cancer. However, further in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo investigations are warranted towards the development of these constituents into novel anti-cancer drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Successful neuropharmacology requires optimization of CNS drug delivery and, by extension, free drug concentrations at brain molecular targets. Detailed assessment of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) physiological characteristics is necessary to achieve this goal. The \u2018next frontier\u2019 in CNS drug delivery is targeting BBB uptake transporters, an approach that requires evaluation of brain endothelial cell transport processes so that effective drug accumulation and improved therapeutic efficacy can occur. Areas covered BBB permeability of drugs is governed by tight junction protein complexes (i.e., physical barrier) and transporters/enzymes (i.e., biochemical barrier). For most therapeutics, a component of blood-to-brain transport involves passive transcellular diffusion. Small molecule drugs that do not possess acceptable physicochemical characteristics for passive permeability may utilize putative membrane transporters for CNS uptake. While both uptake and efflux transport mechanisms are expressed at the brain microvascular endothelium, uptake transporters can be targeted for optimization of brain drug delivery and improved treatment of neurological disease states. Expert opinion Uptake transporters represent a unique opportunity to optimize brain drug delivery by leveraging the endogenous biology of the BBB. A rigorous understanding of these transporters is required to improve translation from the bench to clinical trials and stimulate the development of new treatment paradigms for neurological diseases.",
