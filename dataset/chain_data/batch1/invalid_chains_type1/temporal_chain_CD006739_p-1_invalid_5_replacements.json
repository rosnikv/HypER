        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the 12- and 52-week efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor LAF237 versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes continuing metformin treatment.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 107 patients with type 2 diabetes with a 40-week extension in those completing the core study and agreeing, together with the investigator, to extend treatment to 1 year. Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P <0.0001). Mean prandial glucose and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P <0.0001) and 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P=0.0001), 40 +/- 16 pmol/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (P=0.0312), respectively. HbA1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in LAF237-treated patients (n=42) but increased in participants given placebo (n=29). The between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c after 1 year was -1.1 +/- 0.2% (P <0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nData from this study demonstrate that LAF237 effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to metformin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes.",

        "title": "Effect of single oral doses of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, on incretin and plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test in patients with type 2 diabetes.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIn response to a meal, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are released and modulate glycemic control. Normally these incretins are rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors are a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The degree of DPP-4 inhibition and the level of active incretin augmentation required for glucose lowering efficacy after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the study was to examine the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of sitagliptin.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, single-dose crossover study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted at six investigational sites.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nThe study population consisted of 58 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not on antihyperglycemic agents.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nInterventions included sitagliptin 25 mg, sitagliptin 200 mg, or placebo.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMeasurements included plasma DPP-4 activity; post-OGTT glucose excursion; active and total incretin GIP levels; insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentrations; and sitagliptin pharmacokinetics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSitagliptin dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity over 24 h, enhanced active GLP-1 and GIP levels, increased insulin/C-peptide, decreased glucagon, and reduced glycemic excursion after OGTTs administered at 2 and 24 h after single oral 25- or 200-mg doses of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with no hypoglycemic events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study in patients with type 2 diabetes, near maximal glucose-lowering efficacy of sitagliptin after single oral doses was associated with inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity of 80% or greater, corresponding to a plasma sitagliptin concentration of 100 nm or greater, and an augmentation of active GLP-1 and GIP levels of 2-fold or higher after an OGTT.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewTo review recent clinical trials of oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and examine their role in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent findingsOral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors improve islet function by increasing \u03b1-cell and \u03b2-cell responsiveness to glucose, resulting in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduced inappropriate glucagon secretion. These agents appear to have physiologically based antihyperglycemic effects and may modify the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In clinical trials sitagliptin and vildagliptin have modest demonstrated effectiveness, with clinically meaningful reductions of glycated hemoglobin when used as monotherapy. They appear promising in combination or added to ongoing therapy with other antidiabetic drugs (e.g. metformin, thiazolidinediones, or insulin). Dipetidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors themselves are not associated with hypoglycemia or weight gain and appear to have a benign safety profile. SummaryOral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors may prove valuable in the treatment of diabetes, given their effectiveness in reducing glycated hemoglobin with neutral weight effects and without the adverse events associated with other agents. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors appear to improve islet function and may modify the course of diabetes; this, however, must be confirmed with long-term controlled studies to demonstrate sustained glycemic control that translates into \u03b2-cell preservation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication of type 2 diabetes and can limit therapeutic efforts to improve glycaemic control in order to protect against long-term complications. It is a potential side effect of the drugs used to treat diabetes, specifically exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues. As many people are prescribed these agents, hypoglycaemia is frequent in clinical practice, although patients commonly do not inform their healthcare professional of the problems spontaneously. The impact of hypoglycaemia on the patient and to the healthcare system is significant through reduced treatment satisfaction and adherence, reduced quality of life and serious health consequences. This has financial implications and costs for the patient, the public and the economy at large. The single most important risk factor for hypoglycaemia is previous hypoglycaemia. Prevention depends on appropriate education regarding diabetes management and selfcare, self-monitoring of blood glucose, awareness of factors that may precipitate hypoglycaemia, and an individualized approach to therapy and glycaemic control targets. The purpose of this review is to increase understanding of the impact and consequences of hypoglycaemia, in particular that associated with sulphonylurea therapy, and to highlight areas requiring more attention in order to improve the overall management of people with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract During the month of Ramadan, all healthy, adult Muslims are required to fast from dawn to sunset. Fasting during Ramadan involves abstaining from food, water, beverages, smoking, oral drugs, and sexual intercourse. Although the Quran exempts chronically ill from fasting, many Muslims with diabetes still fast during Ramadan. Patients with diabetes who fast during the month of Ramadan can have acute complications. The risk of complications in fasting individuals with diabetes increases with longer periods of fasting. All patients with diabetes who wish to fast during Ramadan should be prepared by undergoing a medical assessment and engaging in a structured education program to undertake the fast as safely as possible. Although some guidelines do exist, there is an overwhelming need for better designed clinical trials which could provide us with evidence-based information and guidance in the management of patients with diabetes fasting Ramadan.",

Body composition, arterial stiffness and echocardiography were assessed before and after Ramadan. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis using segmental body composition analyser. Arterial stiffness and haemodynamic parameters were also measured.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT There are no studies evaluating the glucose variability in different periods of Ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This study examined the effect of Ramadan fasting on interstitial glucose (IG) variability in early,- late-, and post-Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan days in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. Participants had a CGM system connected 2 or 3 days before Ramadan start, which was removed on the third or fourth day of Ramadan. CGM performance continued for a total of 6 days. A second CGM performance started on the 27th or 28th day of Ramadan and ended on the 4th or 5th post-Ramadan day. First, CGM recordings were divided into pre-Ramadan and early-Ramadan CGM, and second recordings into late-Ramadan and post-Ramadan. At each visit, blood pressure, body weight, and waist circumference were measured, and fasting blood samples were collected for HbA1c and plasma glucose. All patients received recommended Ramadan education before Ramadan. Thirty-three patients (mean age 55.0 \u00b1 9.8 years, 73% males) were prospectively included. IG variability, estimated as mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), increased significantly in early-Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan (P = 0.006) but not in late-Ramadan and post-Ramadan recording days. Only patients on >2 anti-diabetic drugs (n = 16, P = 0.019) and those on sulphonylureas (n = 14, P = 0.003) showed significant increase in MAGE in early-Ramadan. No significant changes were seen in coefficient of variation, time in range, time in hyperglycaemia, or time in hypoglycaemia. Except for an initial increase in glucose variability, fasting Ramadan for patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes did not cause any significant changes in glucose variability or time in hypoglycaemia during CGM recording days compared to non-fasting pre-Ramadan period.",

        "abstract": "Fasting the Holy month of Ramadan constitutes one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith. Although there is some evidence that intermittent fasting during Ramadan may be of benefit in losing weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, there is no strong evidence these benefits apply to people with diabetes. The American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus recommendations emphasize the importance of patient factors and comorbidities when choosing diabetes medications including the presence of comorbidities, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hypoglycemia risk, weight issues and costs. Structured education and pre-Ramadan counseing are key components to successful management of patients with diabetes. These should cover important aspects like glycemic targets, self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet, physical activity including Taraweeh prayers, medication and dose adjustment, side effects and when to break the fast. The decision cycle adapted for the specific situation of Ramadan provides an aid for such an assessment. Children with type 1 diabetes should strongly be advised not to fast due to the high risk of acute complications such as hypoglycemia and probably diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), although there is very little evidence that DKA is increased in Ramadan. Pregnant women with diabetes or gestational diabetes should be advised to avoid fasting because of possible negative maternal and fetal outcomes. Hypoglycemia is a common concern during Ramadan fasting. To prevent hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, we recommend the adoption of diabetes self-management education and support principles. The use of the emerging technology and continuous glucose monitoring during Ramadan could help to recognize hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic complications related to omission and/or medication adjustment during fasting; however, the cost represents a significant barrier.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Impact of ramadan fasting on healthy and women with diabetes is already known. However, there is a scarcity of data on impact of fasting on pregnant women with diabetes. Moreover, religious and medical recommendations advise pregnant women against fasting as it is unsafe. Despite being exempted, many pregnant Muslim women with diabetes still choose to fast during ramadan. This study investigated different glycemic marker as an indicator for diabetes control in fasting pregnant women. Patients and Methods This is a prospective observational study. A total of 89 pregnant diabetes women were recruited. Blood glucose was self-monitored in all the pregnant women using glucose monitoring device at home. We measure the fructosamine, HbA1c levels before, during and after ramadan. Results Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes were 14 (25%), type 2 diabetes were 21 (37.5%), and gestational diabetes were 21 (37.5%). The mean fructosamine level decreased during and after ramadan in gestation diabetes pregnant women compared to type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes pregnant women subjects (p = 0.009). Conclusion The present study indicates that pregnant women with diabetes were able to fast during ramadan and there fructosamine level reduced during fasting. Utilization of fructosamine for short-term monitoring of glycemic control in addition to home glucose monitoring in pregnant women with diabetes will provide a good index of glycemic control. Recommendation Religious and medical recommendations advise pregnant women against fasting as it is unsafe, and they are under high risk. However, if they insist to do fast, they must do under strict medical supervision and fructosamine can be used as a glycemic control marker.",
