Videla, J. Bernstein, and Y. Israel: Biochem. J, 134: 507\u2013514, 1973). Whole animal minimal oxygen consumption, a sensitive indicator of the effects of thyroid hormone (W. D. Denckla: J. Clin. Invest, 53:572\u2013581, 1974) was unchanged in rats maintained 3 wk on a liquid diet containing 34% of the calories as ethanol (2.49 \u00b1 0.06 ml of O2/min/1O0 g of fat-free body weight) when compared to animals fed an equicaloric sucrose containing liquid diet (2.61 \u00b1 0.20 ml of 02/min/100 g of fat-free body weight) or Purina chow (2.50 \u00b1 0.12 ml of O2/min/100 g of fat-free body weight). Ethanol treatment lowered serum thyroxine (5.09 \u00b1 0.20 pg/100 ml) compared to sucrose-fed control rats (7.66 \u00b1 0.40 pg/100 ml), while serum triiodothyronine was unaffected (59.3 \u00b1 4.0 compared to 66.9 \u00b1 3.1 ng/100 ml for controls). Measurement of O2 consumption in the isolated perfused rat liver showed no significant difference after chronic treatment with the ethanol diet compared to either the sucrose or chow control diets. Infusion of 10-7 M norepinephrine into the perfusion medium resulted in an approximately 22% increase in O2 consumption in ethanol-fed animal and sucrose controls, while a 31 % increase was observed for sucrose-treated animals given 10 \u03bcg of T3/kg of body weight/day for 3 wk. These data indicate that T3 potentiates the ability of norepinephrine to increase O2 consumption. The data presented give no support to the concept that chronic ethanol ingestion results in hyperthyroidism or liver hypermetabolism and, consequently, the rationale for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with the antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil, is incorrect (H. Orrego, H. Ka-lant, Y. Israel, et al.: Gastroenterology, 76:105\u2013115, 1979).",

        "abstract": "Chronic alcohol administration to baboons results in perivenular lesions in the liver. To study possible mechanisms, the effect of ethanol on splanchnic oxygen consumption was measured. Acute ethanol administration increased splanchnic oxygen consumption in the control baboons, but the consequences of this effect on oxygenation of the perivenular zones were offset by a concomitant rise in blood flow, resulting in unchanged hepatic venous oxygen tensions. In alcohol-fed baboons, splanchnic oxygen consumption was not increased, either in the withdrawal state or after ethanol infusion. To study the magnitude of the shift in redox state induced by ethanol in the perivenular zones, we compared the effects of ethanol on the lactate/pyruvate ratio in hepatic venous blood (an approximation of that in perivenular hepatocytes) with the ratio in total liver. Prior to ethanol infusion, the lactate and pyruvate were the same in liver and in hepatic venous blood. By contrast, in all baboons, ethanol produced a much greater rise in the lactate/pyruvate ratio and decreased pyruvate more in hepatic venous blood than in total liver. Moreover, in isolated rat hepatocytes, the ethanol-induced redox shift was markedly exaggerated by oxygen tensions similar to those found in centrolobular zones. This suggests that the normally low oxygen tensions existing in perivenular zones exaggerate the ethanol-induced redox shift, a change which may contribute to the exacerbation of the damage in the perivenular area of the hepatic lobule.",

Chronic ethanol consumption for 12 weeks (mean daily ethanol intake 11.4 gm per body weight corresponding to 29% of total energy intake) did not cause histological changes but decreased GPT activity, increased glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase activities and did not alter their pp/pv distribution. Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities were evenly distributed in pp\u2010 and pv\u2010hepatocytes. Chronic ethanol treatment slightly decreased alcohol dehydrogenase activity (p < 0.05) and increased the activity of low Km aldehyde dehydrogenase (p < 0.001, p < 0.05).

        "abstract": "The periportal hepatotoxicity of allyl alcohol (AlOH) was investigated by studying its metabolism and cytotoxicity in suspensions of periportal (pp) and perivenous (pv) rat hepatocytes isolated by digitonin-collagenase perfusion. No marked difference in alcohol dehydrogenase activity between the cell types was observed. The cells also oxidised AlOH at about equal rates. AlOH depleted cellular glutathione by about 95% within 10 minutes in both cell types, but was partially restored during subsequent incubation. The pp cells suffering from AlOH toxicity in vivo tended to resist AlOH in vitro better than pv hepatocytes, as judged from the measurement of cellular ATP and K+ ion content, and LDH leakage. It is suggested that the oxidation of AlOH may be restricted to the pp region in intact liver simply because of the high rate of uptake and oxidation of AlOH by the liver tissue.",

        "abstract": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes are known to display various functional differences. In this study we present a new method to separate periportal and perivenous cells: after selectively loading zone 1 or zone 3 with the fluorescent label acridine orange in an antegrade or retrograde perfusion, respectively, we separated the isolated hepatocytes on a fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorter. The common way to check on proper separation is to estimate activities of enzymes known to exhibit a heterogeneous acinar distribution. Using enzyme histochemistry, however, we found that already on short collagenase perfusion, some enzymes displayed a more shallow gradient than in vivo, making enzyme activities less suitable as zonal markers. We therefore used colloidal gold granules (17 nm) injected intravenously (2.5 mg) into the rat 2 to 3 hr before cell isolation. The gold is taken up predominantly by perivenous hepatocytes, probably because of the efficient removal of gold granules in zone 1 by competing Kupffer cells. We compared acridine orange fluorescence, presence of gold particles and activities of six marker enzymes, three biochemically and three histochemically determined. Acridine orange and gold both pointed to a high enrichment of the fractions, whereas most enzyme activities were more randomly distributed among the cells as a result of the isolation procedure. Our separation procedure yielded fractions highly enriched in either viable periportal or perivenous cells, both from one liver. The use of colloidal gold as a marker to monitor separation is a valuable alternative to the more risky estimation of enzyme activities. (HEPATOLOGY 1991;13:73\u201382).",

        "abstract": "Anterograde or retrograde perfusion of rat liver with digitonin selectively permeabilizes the periportal or the perivenous zone of the hepatic lobule. Digitonin perfusion is used to analyze the effluents released by permeabilized hepatocytes or, combined with collagenase perfusion, to obtain cell suspensions enriched in either periportal or perivenous hepatocytes. Despite the wide use of digitonin to study lobular heterogeneity, its affects on rat hepatocytes are not well documented. We therefore analyzed the effects of digitonin perfusion on the intracellular content of rat hepatocytes by combining electron microscopy, histoenzymology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. At the concentration currently used for the study of lobular heterogeneity, digitonin perfusion induced a marked cytosolic clarification of permeabilized hepatocytes, while most organelles except mitochondria were well preserved. In the digitonin-altered zones, there was no histochemical detection of non-membrane-bound enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas membrane-bound enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, NADPH dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase) were still detected. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed significant amounts of several plasma proteins (albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-inhibitor 3, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein) and their respective mRNAs in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes. The demonstration that digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes retain many intracellular constituents shows that biochemical analysis of cellular effluents released from digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes must be interpreted with caution and that the apparent characteristics of cell suspensions obtained by the digitonin-collagenase technique might be significantly altered by contamination with permeabilized hepatocytes from the opposite zone.",

        "abstract": "Maternal protein restriction is a model of fetal programming of adult glucose intolerance. Perfused livers of 48-h- starved adult offspring of rat dams fed 8% protein diets during pregnancy and lactation produced more glucose from 6 mM lactate than did control livers from rats whose dams were fed 20% protein. In control livers, a mean of 24% of the glucose formed from lactate in the periportal region of the lobule was taken up by the most distal perivenous cells; this distal perivenous uptake was greatly diminished in maternal low protein (MLP) livers, accounting for a major fraction of the increased glucose output of MLP livers. In control livers, the distal perivenous cells contained 40% of the total glucokinase of the liver; this perivenous concentration of glucokinase was greatly reduced in MLP livers. Intralobular distribution of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase was unaltered, though overall increased activity could have contributed to the elevated glucose output. Hepatic lobular volume in MLP livers was twice that in control livers, indicating that MLP livers had half the normal number of lobules. Fetal programming of adult glucose metabolism may operate partly through structural alterations and changes in glucokinase expression in the immediate perivenous region.",

We investigated these mechanisms directly on fura2\u2010loaded multicellular systems of rat hepatocytes and on cell populations issued from peripheral (periportal) and central (perivenous) parts of the hepatic lobule. There was a gradient in vasopressin sensitivity along connected cells as demonstrated by low vasopressin concentration challenge. Interestingly, the intercellular sensitivity gradient was abolished either when D\u2010myo\u2010inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor was directly stimulated after flash photolysis of caged InsP3 or when G proteins were directly stimulated with AlF4\u2212.

There were more vasopressin\u2010binding sites, vasopressin\u2010induced InsP3 production and V1a vasopressin receptor mRNAs in perivenous than in periportal cells. Therefore, we propose that hormone receptor density determines the cellular sensitivity gradient from the peripheral to the central zones of the liver cell plate, thus the starting cell and the direction of intercellular Ca2+ waves, leading to directional activation of Ca2+\u2010dependent processes.",

        "abstract": "The field of calcium signalling has evolved rapidly the last 20 years. Physiologists had worked with cytosolic Ca2+ as the coupler of excitation and contraction of muscles and as a secretory signal in exocrine glands and in the synapses of the brain for several decades before the discovery of cellular calcium as a second messenger. Development of powerful techniques for measuring the concentration of cytosolic free calcium ions in cell suspensions and later in single cells and even in different cellular compartments, has resulted in an upsurge in the knowledge of the cellular machinery involved in intracellular calcium signalling. However, the focus on intracellular mechanisms might have led this field of study away from physiology. During the last few years there is an increasing evidence for an important role of calcium also as an intercellular signal. Via gap junctions calcium is able to co-ordinate cell populations and even organs like the liver. Here we will give an overview of the general mechanisms of intracellular calcium signalling, and then review the recent data on intercellular calcium signals. A functional coupling of cells in different tissues and organs by the way of calcium might be an important mechanism for controlling and synchronizing physiological responses",

        "abstract": "Glycogenolytic agonists induce coordinated Ca(2+) oscillations in multicellular rat hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The coordination of intercellular Ca(2+) signals requires functional gap-junction coupling. The mechanisms ensuring this coordination are not precisely known. We investigated possible roles of Ca(2+) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) as a coordinating messengers for Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes. Application of ionomycin or of supra-maximal concentrations of agonists show that Ca(2+) does not significantly diffuse between connected hepatocytes, although gap junctions ensure the passage of small signaling molecules, as demonstrated by FRAP experiments. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes can be favored by a rise in the level of InsP(3), via the increase of agonist concentrations, or by a shift in the affinity of InsP(3) receptor for InsP(3). In the same line, coordination cannot be achieved if the InsP(3) is rapidly metabolized by InsP(3)-phosphatase in one cell of the multiplet. These results demonstrate that even if small amounts of Ca(2+) diffuse across gap junctions, they most probably do not play a significant role in inducing a coordinated Ca(2+) signal among connected hepatocytes. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) oscillations is fully dependent on the diffusion of InsP(3) between neighboring cells.",

        "abstract": "Intercellular signaling is highly coordinated in excitable tissues such as heart, but the organization of intercellular signaling in epithelia is less clear. We examined Ca2+ signaling in hepatoma cells expressing the hepatocyte gap junction protein connexin32 (cx32) or the cardiac gap junction protein cx43, plus a fluorescently tagged V1avasopressin receptor (V1aR). Release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in wild type cells increased Ca2+ in the injected cell but not in neighboring cells, while the Ca2+ signal spread to neighbors when gap junctions were expressed. Photorelease of caged Ca2+ rather than InsP3 resulted in a small increase in Ca2+that did not spread to neighbors with or without gap junctions. However, photorelease of Ca2+ in cells stimulated with low concentrations of vasopressin resulted in a much larger increase in Ca2+, which spread to neighbors via gap junctions. Cells expressing tagged V1aR similarly had increased sensitivity to vasopressin, and could signal to neighbors via gap junctions. Higher concentrations of vasopressin elicited Ca2+ signals in all cells. In cx32 or cx43 but not in wild type cells, this signaling was synchronized and began in cells expressing the tagged V1aR. Thus, intercellular Ca2+ signals in epithelia are organized by three factors: 1) InsP3 must be generated in each cell to support a Ca2+ signal in that cell; 2) gap junctions are necessary to synchronize Ca2+ signals among cells; and 3) cells with relatively increased expression of hormone receptor will initiate Ca2+ signals and thus serve as pacemakers for their neighbors. Together, these factors may allow epithelia to act in an integrated, organ-level fashion rather than as a collection of isolated cells.",

The type II isoform of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) was expressed to a similar extent in the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, whereas the type III InsP3R was concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the type I isoform was not expressed. Ca2+ signals induced by low InsP3 concentrations started earlier or were larger in the nucleus than in the cytosol, indicating higher sensitivity of nuclear Ca2+ stores for InsP3. Nuclear InsP3R channels were active at lower InsP3 concentrations than InsP3R from cytosol. Enriched expression of type II InsP3R in the nucleus results in greater sensitivity of the nucleus to InsP3, thus providing a mechanism for independent regulation of Ca2+-dependent processes in this cellular compartment.",

        "title": "Vasopressin Increases Locomotion through a V1a Receptor in Orexin/Hypocretin Neurons: Implications for Water Homeostasis",
        "abstract": "Water homeostasis is a critical challenge to survival for land mammals. Mice display increased locomotor activity when dehydrated, a behavior that improves the likelihood of locating new sources of water and simultaneously places additional demands on compromised hydration levels. The neurophysiology underlying this well known behavior has not been previously elucidated. We report that the anti-diuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this response. AVP and oxytocin directly induced depolarization and an inward current in orexin/hypocretin neurons. AVP-induced activation of orexin neurons was inhibited by a V1a receptor (V1aR)-selective antagonist and was not observed in V1aR knock-out mice, suggesting an involvement of V1aR. Subsequently activation of phospholipase C\u03b2 triggers an increase in intracellular calcium by both calcium influx through nonselective cation channels and calcium release from calcium stores in orexin neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of AVP or water deprivation increased locomotor activity in wild-type mice, but not in transgenic mice lacking orexin neurons. V1aR knock-out mice were less active than wild-type mice. These results suggest that the activation of orexin neurons by AVP or oxytocin has an important role in the regulation of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. This system appears to play a key role in water deprivation-induced hyperlocomotor activity, a response to dehydration that increases the chance of locating water in nature.",

        "title": "Ghrelin Potentiates Miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents in Supraoptic Magnocellular Neurones",
        "abstract": "Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide discovered in the stomach as a ligand of the orphan G\u2010protein coupled receptor, and participates in the regulation of growth hormone (GH) release. Previous studies have demonstrated that ghrelin suppressed water intake and stimulated the secretion of arginine vasopressin in rats. We examined the effect of ghrelin on the excitatory synaptic inputs to the magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) using whole\u2010cell patch\u2010clamp recordings in in vitro rat and mouse brain slice preparations. The application of ghrelin (10\u22127\u223c10\u22126\u2003m) caused a significant increase in the frequency of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in a dose\u2010related manner without affecting the amplitude. The increased frequency of the spontaneous EPSCs persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 \u03bcM). Des\u2010n\u2010octanoyl ghrelin (10\u22126\u2003m) did not have a significant effect on the mEPSCs. The ghrelin\u2010induced potentiation of the mEPSCs was significantly suppressed by previous exposure to the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) blocker, ruthenium red (10 \u03bcM) and GH secretagougue type 1a receptor selective antagonist, BIM28163 (10 \u03bcm). The effects of ghrelin on the supraoptic MNCs in trpv1 knockout mice were significantly attenuated compared to those in wild\u2010type mice counterparts. These results suggest that ghrelin participates in the regulation of synaptic inputs to the MNCs in the SON via interaction with the GH secretagogue type 1a receptor, and that the TRPV1 channel may be involved in ghrelin\u2010induced potentiation of mEPSCs to the MNCs in the SON.",

        "title": "Orexin activation precedes increased NPY expression, hyperphagia, and metabolic changes in response to sleep deprivation.",
        "abstract": "Several pieces of evidence support that sleep duration plays a role in body weight control. Nevertheless, it has been assumed that, after the identification of orexins (hypocretins), the molecular basis of the interaction between sleep and energy homeostasis has been provided. However, no study has verified the relationship between neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin changes during hyperphagia induced by sleep deprivation. In the current study we aimed to establish the time course of changes in metabolite, endocrine, and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression of Wistar rats sleep deprived by the platform method for a distinct period (from 24 to 96 h) or sleep restricted for 21 days (SR-21d). Despite changes in the stress hormones, we found no changes in food intake and body weight in the SR-21d group. However, sleep-deprived rats had a 25-35% increase in their food intake from 72 h accompanied by slight weight loss. Such changes were associated with increased hypothalamus mRNA levels of prepro-orexin (PPO) at 24 h followed by NPY at 48 h of sleep deprivation. Conversely, sleep recovery reduced the expression of both PPO and NPY, which rapidly brought the animals to a hypophagic condition. Our data also support that sleep deprivation rapidly increases energy expenditure and therefore leads to a negative energy balance and a reduction in liver glycogen and serum triacylglycerol levels despite the hyperphagia. Interestingly, such changes were associated with increased serum levels of glucagon, corticosterone, and norepinephrine, but no effects on leptin, insulin, or ghrelin were observed. In conclusion, orexin activation accounts for the myriad changes induced by sleep deprivation, especially the hyperphagia induced under stress and a negative energy balance.",

        "abstract": "The term sociotype has been introduced to describe the dynamic relationship of an individual with his/her social environment throughout life. The sociotype is a conceptual framework to highlight, in addition to bio-medical pathways, the psycho-social and environmental factors necessary to understand responses to life stresses and patient self-management for chronic illness. The sociotype interacts with genotype expression through mate selection and metabolic programming, and with the phenotype to determine adaptation throughout life from birth to old age. Following on the work of Antonovsky, Engel, and McEwen, and others in the life and social sciences, the sociotype details and expands the many factors generally included in the environmental influences on a person\u2019s life identified here as the domains of health, relationships, and environment. Physiological mediators for sociotypic influences include: adrenal steroids and the sympathetic nervous system (allostatic load), and oxytocin (social neuroscience). The biological pathways are multiple through nutrition (essential dietary-derived amino- and fatty acids for neurotransmitter synthesis, caloric restriction, and diet\u2013gene interactions), epigenesis, and metabolic programming. Nutrition influences growth and development, fertility and longevity, and also determines susceptibility to non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and particularly diabetes and obesity, through in-utero effects, the development of intestinal flora (microbiome), and chronic stress. Thus the sociotype and nutrition are reciprocally related in both health and disease.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate bisphenol-A (BPA) level and its relationship to sleep adequacy in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey whereby data were collected using in-person interviews, physical examination and laboratory testing. BPA level was measured in urine samples and analyzed as loge-transformed variable and in quartiles (< 0.9 ng/mL; 0.9 to < 1.9 ng/mL; 1.9 to < 3.7 ng/mL; 3.7+ ng/mL). Sleep adequacy was operationalized with three questions: \"How much sleep do you usually get at night on weekdays or workdays?\", \"Have you ever told a doctor or other health professionals that you have trouble sleeping?\" and \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have a sleep disorder?\" Sleep duration was further categorized as (< 6 h, \u2265 6 h); (< 7 h, 7-8 h, > 8 h); (< 5 h, 5-6 h, 7-8 h, \u2265 9 h). Linear, binary, and ordinal logistic regression models were constructed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLoge-transformed BPA level was inversely related to sleep duration defined, in hours, as a continuous variable, a dichotomous variable (\u2265 6, < 6), or an ordinal variable (\u2265 9, 7-8, 5-6, < 5), after adjustment for confounders. Help-seeking behavior for sleep problems and diagnosis with sleep disorders were not significantly associated with loge-transformed BPA level in fully adjusted models.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLoge-transformed BPA level may be associated with fewer hours of sleep among U.S. adults, with implications for prevention.

        "abstract": "Sleep duration and sleep quality are important predictors of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One potential link between sleep health and CVD is through lifestyle factors such as diet. To clarify the association between diet and sleep, we assessed the associations of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with current Mediterranean-style diet (aMed) and with historical changes in aMed score. Actigraphy-measured sleep duration and self-reported insomnia symptoms categorized as insomnia with short sleep (<6 hr/night), insomnia without short sleep, no insomnia with short sleep, and no insomnia or short sleep were obtained from 2068 individuals who also had dietary intake data. A 10-point aMed score, derived from a self-report food frequency questionnaire, was collected concurrently with the sleep assessment and 10 years before. Compared with individuals who currently reported a low aMed score, those with a moderate-high aMed score were more likely to sleep 6-7 vs. <6 hr/night (p < 0.01) and less likely to report insomnia symptoms occurring with short sleep (vs. no insomnia or short sleep alone; p < 0.05). An increase in aMed score over the preceding 10 years was not associated with sleep duration or insomnia symptoms. However, compared with those with decreasing aMed score, individuals with an unchanging score reported fewer insomnia symptoms (p \u2264 0.01). These results suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with adequate sleep duration, less insomnia symptoms, and less likely to have insomnia accompanied by short sleep. Further research should identify possible mediators through which diet may promote adequate sleep duration and reduce the risk of insomnia.",

We evaluated an expanded measure of CVH that includes sleep as an eighth metric in relation to CVD risk. Methods and Results The analytic sample consisted of MESA (Multi\u2010Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Sleep Study participants who had complete data on sleep characteristics from overnight polysomnography, 7\u2010day wrist actigraphy, validated questionnaires, and the outcome. We computed the LS7 score and 4 iterations of a new CVH score: score 1 included sleep duration, score 2 included sleep characteristics linked to CVD in the literature (sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea), scores 3 and 4 included sleep characteristics associated with CVD in MESA (score 3: sleep duration and efficiency, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea; score 4: score 3+sleep regularity). Multivariable\u2010adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of the LS7 and CVH scores 1 to 4 with CVD prevalence and incidence. Among 1920 participants (mean age: 69\u00b19\u2009years; 54% female), there were 95 prevalent CVD events and 93 incident cases (mean follow\u2010up, 4.4\u2009years). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of the LS7 score and CVH scores 1 to 4 had up to 80% lower odds of prevalent CVD. The LS7 score was not significantly associated with CVD incidence (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.37\u20131.04]). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of CVH score 1, which included sleep duration, and CVH score 4, which included multidimensional sleep health, had 43% and 47% lower incident CVD risk (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33\u20130.97]; and hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32\u20130.89]), respectively. Conclusions CVH scores that include sleep health predicted CVD risk in older US adults. The incorporation of sleep as a CVH metric, akin to other health behaviors, may enhance CVD primordial and primary prevention efforts.

However, the association between levels of LE8 and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is not known from a large prospective cohort. We aim to analyze the relationship between CVH, indicated by LE8, and risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Moreover, we sought to test whether the genetic susceptibility to CHD or stroke could be modified by LE8. Methods: A total of 137\u2009794 participants free of CVD from the UK Biobank were included. CVH was scored using LE8 and categorized as low, moderate, and high. Results: During a median of 10 years, 8595 CVD cases (6968 CHDs and 1948 strokes) were documented. A higher LE8 score was associated with remarkably lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). Comparing the high CVH to the low CVH, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30\u20130.38) for CHD, 0.45 (0.37\u20130.54) for stroke, and 0.36 (0.33\u20130.40) for CVD. Moreover, the model with LE8 achieved higher accuracy and outperformed the model with Life\u2019s Simple 7 for CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). The protective associations of the LE8 score with CVD outcomes were more pronounced among women (P interaction, <0.001 for CHD and 0.0013 for CVD, respectively) and among younger adults (P interaction, <0.001, 0.007, and <0.001 for CHD, stroke, and CVD, respectively). In addition, a significant interaction was found between the genetic risk of CHD and the LE8 score (P interaction, <0.001). The inverse association was stronger among those with a lower genetic risk of CHD.
