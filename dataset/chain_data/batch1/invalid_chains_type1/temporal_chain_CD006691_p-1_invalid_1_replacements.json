        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate whether, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, the addition of metformin to insulin and standard diabetes management results in 1) higher insulin sensitivity and 2) lower HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin dosage (units per kilogram per day) and BMI.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis was a randomized, placebo-controlled 3-month trial of metformin therapy in 27 adolescents with type 1 diabetes, high insulin dosage (>1 unit. kg(-1). day(-1)), and HbA1c >8%, with measurements of insulin sensitivity (by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test [FSIGT]), HbA1c, insulin dosage, and BMI at the onset and end of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt t = 0, HbA1c was 9.2 +/- 0.9%, insulin dosage was 1.2 +/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1), fasting glucose was 10.6 +/- 2.4 mmol/l, and BMI was 24.2 +/- 3.9 kg/m2 (means +/- SD), with no difference between the metformin and placebo groups. At the end of the study, HbA1c was 0.6% lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). This was achieved at lower daily insulin dosages (metformin group -0.14 +/- 0.1 vs. placebo group 0.02 +/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1); P < 0.05), with no significant change in BMI. Fasting glucose levels improved significantly in the metformin group (P < 0.05). Change in insulin sensitivity, measured by FSIGT, was not significantly different between the two groups at study end. Mild hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in the metformin-treated than in the placebo subjects (1.75 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.4 events. patient(-1). week(-1); P = 0.03). There were no differences in frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes or gastrointestinal complaints between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin treatment lowered HbA1c and decreased insulin dosage with no weight gain in teens with type 1 diabetes in poor metabolic control. Changes in insulin sensitivity were not documented in this study using the FSIGT. Long-term studies will determine whether these improvements are sustained and whether certain subgroups accrue greater benefit from this therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: A high prevalence of hyperandrogenism has been reported in women with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Metformin has been used as a therapeutic agent in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and in T1D patients without hyperandrogenism. This study sought to determine the effect of metformin on hyperandrogenism and ovarian function in adolescents with T1D. Methods: We recruited 24 girls with T1D. The participants had hyperandrogenism and displayed suboptimal metabolic control. The patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One group received metformin (850 mg bid) and the other group received a placebo. Treatment was administered for 9 months. Ovulation, steroids and gonadotropin levels were evaluated. Results: Metformin treatment was associated with decreases in testosterone, free androgen index, androstenedione, 17-OH progesterone and estradiol levels. The girls who were treated with placebo showed stable steroid, gonadotropin and sex hormone-binding globulin levels during the analysis. No differences were observed in the Ferriman-Gallwey scores, ovulation rates, HbA1c levels or daily insulin doses of the girls treated with metformin compared with the placebo group. Conclusion: Treating hyperandrogenic T1D adolescents with metformin significantly decreased the serum androgens compared to the placebo, but metformin therapy did not significantly affect clinical parameters, such as hirsutism, ovulation and metabolic control.",

        "abstract": "Context Insulin resistance has been proposed as one of the causes of poor glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear. Objective To compare the effect of metformin vs. placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and other parameters in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Hypothesis Adjunctive metformin therapy will improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Design, Setting, and Participants A 9-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of metformin and placebo in 28 subjects (13m/15f) of ages 10-20years (y), with HbA1c >8% (64 mmol/mol), BMI >85%, and T1D > 12 months was conducted at a university outpatient facility. The metformin group consisted of 15 subjects (8 m/ 7f), of age 15.0 \u00b1 2.5 y; while the control group was made up of 13 subjects (5m/ 8f), of age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1y. All participants employed a self-directed treat-to-target insulin regimen based on a titration algorithm of (-2)-0-(+2) units to adjust their long-acting insulin dose every 3rd day from -3 mo through +9 mo to maintain fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 90\u2013120 mg/dL (5.0\u20136.7 mmol/L). Pubertal maturation was determined by Tanner stage. Results Over the course of the 9 months of observation, the between-treatment differences in HbA1c of 0.4% (9.85% [8.82 to 10.88] for placebo versus 9.46% [8.47 to 10.46] for metformin) was not significant (p = 0.903). There were non-significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (189.4 mg/dL [133.2 to 245.6] for placebo versus 170.5 mg/dL [114.3 to 226.7] for metformin), (p = 0.927); total daily dose (TDD) of short-acting insulin per kg body weight/day(p = 0.936); and the TDD of long-acting insulin per kg body weight per day (1.15 units/kg/day [0.89 to 1.41] for placebo versus 0.90 units/kg/day [0.64 to 1.16] for metformin) (p = 0.221). There was no difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between the groups. Conclusions This 9-month RCT of adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight and obese youth with T1D resulted in a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group.

        "abstract": "Introduction Metformin has been demonstrated to enhance cardioprotective benefits in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Although glycemic variability (GV) is associated with increased risk of CVD in diabetes, there is a scarcity of research evaluating the effect of metformin on GV in T1DM. Objectives In the present study, the effects of adjuvant metformin therapy on GV and metabolic control in T1DM were explored. Patients and methods A total of 65 adults with T1DM were enrolled and subjected to physical examination, fasting laboratory tests, and continuous glucose monitoring, and subsequently randomized 1:1 to 3 months of 1000\u20132000 mg metformin daily add-on insulin (MET group, n = 34) or insulin (non-MET group, n\u2009=\u200931). After, baseline measurements were repeated. Results The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions was substantially reduced in MET group, compared with non-MET group (\u20131.58 (\u20133.35, 0.31) mmol/L vs 1.36 (\u20131.12, 2.24) mmol/L, P = 0.004). In parallel, the largest amplitude of glycemic excursions (\u20132.83 (\u20135.47, \u20130.06) mmol/L vs 0.45 (\u20131.29, 4.48) mmol/L, P = 0.004), the s.d. of blood glucose (\u20130.85 (\u20131.51, 0.01) mmol/L vs \u20130.14 (\u20130.68, 1.21) mmol/L, P = 0.015), and the coefficient of variation (\u20136.66 (\u201315.00, 1.50)% vs \u20131.60 (\u20136.28, 11.71)%, P = 0.012) all demonstrated improvement in the MET group, compared with the non-MET group. Significant reduction in insulin dose, BMI, and body weight was observed in patients in MET, not those in non-MET group. Conclusion Additional metformin therapy improved GV in adults with T1DM, as well as improving body composition and reducing insulin requirement. Hence, metformin as an adjunctive therapy has potential prospects in reducing the CVD risk in patients with T1DM in the long term.",
