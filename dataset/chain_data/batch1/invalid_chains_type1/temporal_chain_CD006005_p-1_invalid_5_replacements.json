        "abstract": "In the absence of preventative therapy, reinfection of allografts with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) resulted in dismal allograft and patient survival. Major advances in the management of HBV-infected recipients of OLT during the past 15 years have steadily reduced the rate of reinfection, resulting in improved outcomes. Initially, long-term use of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as a source of anti-HBs antibodies was effective in preventing or delaying reinfection. Lamivudine monotherapy made it possible to suppress HBV replication prior to OLT, markedly decreasing the risk of reinfection. Although lamivudine monotherapy used before and after OLT could prevent reinfection, its effectiveness was limited by progressive development of lamivudine-resistant mutant infections. Combination therapy with HBIG and lamivudine after OLT reduced both HBV recurrence and the risk of lamivudine resistance even in patients with active HBV replication. Introduction of adefovir provided a safe, alternative oral antiviral able to treat effectively lamivudine-resistant mutants HBV. Available strategies to prevent reinfection have resulted in OLT outcomes for HBV-infected patients comparable to those for patients transplanted for non-HBV indications. In the future, combination therapies of HBIG and both nucleoside and/or nucleotide agents will undoubtedly be optimized. Development of new drugs to treat HBV will increase opportunities to combine agents to enhance safety, efficacy and prevent emergence of HBV escape mutants. New vaccines and adjuvants may make it possible to generate anti-HBs in immunosuppressed patients, eliminating the need for HBIG.",

        "abstract": "A disintegrin\u2010like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type\u20101 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) is a metalloproteinase that specifically cleaves the multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF). Deficiency of ADAMTS13 increases the unusually large VWF multimers (UL\u2010VWFM), which leads to platelet clumping and/or thrombus formation, resulting in microcirculatory disturbance. We serially determined the activity of plasma ADAMTS13, together with VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and UL\u2010VWFM, in association with the development of early graft dysfunction in 3 liver transplant recipients and 4 patients with major hepatectomy as controls. In case 1, ADAMTS13 activity decreased markedly from 108% to less than 3% with concomitant thrombocytopenia on posttransplantation day 7, when acute rejection occurred. Simultaneously, UL\u2010VWFM were detected. During the second episode of rejection, VWF:Ag increased to 368% with the appearance of UL\u2010VWFM, while ADAMTS13 activity was as low as 18%, indicating an imbalance between a large amount of UL\u2010VWFM and low activity of ADAMTS13. Administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) together with treatment for acute rejection resulted in an improvement of ADAMTS13 activity and disappearance of the UL\u2010VWFM. In case 2, ADAMTS13 activity promptly decreased to 9% with thrombocytopenia on day 1, when ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury occurred. Subsequently, the ADAMTS13 activity increased steadily without appearance of UL\u2010VWFM, and the patient recovered uneventfully. ADAMTS13 activity decreased to 15% immediately after transplantation in case 3 as well. In contrast, ADAMTS13 activity never decreased below 20% in 4 patients with major hepatectomy as controls. In conclusion, these results indicate that the kinetics of ADAMTS13 and UL\u2010VWFM could be good indicators of adverse events after liver transplantation. Our findings not only suggest a novel mechanism for thrombocytopenia, but also provide a useful tool for diagnosis of graft dysfunction in the early stage after transplantation.

        "abstract": "The prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence is essential after liver transplantation in patients infected with HBV. We evaluated the efficacy of primary high\u2010dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy in 639 HBV\u2010infected adult patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) between February 1997 and December 2004. The overall 5\u2010year survival rate was 80.7%, and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was the most common cause of late mortality. Pretransplant HBV replication was observed in 392 (61.3%) patients. The interval of 10,000\u2010IU HBIG administration to maintain antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen > 500 IU/L was 30 days in 11.4% patients, 40 to 50 days in 72.1%, and 60 days in 16.5%. At the last follow\u2010up, 3.9% of the patients without HBV recurrence were receiving combination therapy. Overall 1\u2010year, 3\u2010year, 5\u2010year, and 10\u2010year HBV recurrence rates were 1.4%, 5.5%, 7.3%, and 8.5%, respectively. HBV recurrence occurred after a mean of 25.7 \u00b1 16.4 months after LDLT. After HBV recurrence, 5 of 9 patients died from rapidly progressive liver failure before treatment with adefovir, and only 1 of 29 patients died after treatment with adefovir. Need for frequent HBIG infusions (\u226430 days), active pretransplant HBV replication, and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence were significant risk factors for HBV recurrence and indications for combination therapy. Our posttransplant HBV prophylaxis regimen resulted in a 5\u2010year HBV recurrence rate of 7.3% and a mortality rate of 13.2% after HBV recurrence, showing the effectiveness of high\u2010dose HBIG monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy.

        "abstract": "https://jkms.org The Milan criteria (1 lesion smaller than 5 cm or up to 3 lesions, each smaller than 3 cm) have long been used to identify patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are candidates for liver transplantation (LT).1 However, these criteria may exclude some patients who would benefit from LT. Accordingly, there have been many attempts to expand the Milan criteria, such as the University of California San Francisco criteria or the up-to-Seven criteria.2 In contrast to Western countries, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) accounts for the majority of LT in Asian countries. As the social organ allocation system does not control grafts from living related donors, the wishes of the donor sometimes outweigh the recipient's overall prognosis or the risk of HCC recurrence after LT.",

        "abstract": "Background. Tenofovir therapy has been found to be efficient in treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) in nontransplant patients. However, in the setting of solid-organ transplantation, the efficacy of tenofovir has not been tested. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the clinical and biologic response and tolerance to tenofovir therapy in HBV-positive organ transplant recipients. Methods. Seven patients, three kidney, three liver, and one cardiac transplant recipients, with chronic HBV infection were partial responders to adefovir (n=7), lamivudine (n=7), or entecavir (n=5) therapy. Consequently, they were placed on tenofovir therapy (245 mg daily, which was adapted to renal function) alone (n=4) or in combination with lamivudine (n=3). Tenofovir therapy was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinitiation or at the last follow-up. Results. HBV DNA viral load (4.16 [2.03\u20135.56] log10 copies/mL at baseline) became significantly decreased to 3.15 (1.08\u20135.17), 2.88 (1.3\u20134.3), 3.53 (1.3\u20135.75), 3.33 (1.3\u20137.57), and 2.31 (1.3\u20134.81) log copies/mL at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttenofovir initiation and at last follow-up, respectively (P=0.02). Three patients were HBV DNA negative at the last follow-up. Liver enzyme levels did not change significantly throughout the follow-up period. Clinical and biologic tolerance was excellent. Conclusions. Even though HBV DNA clearance was not achieved in all patients, the results of this pilot study are encouraging and demonstrate that tenofovir therapy is safe and efficacious in treating HBV-positive organ transplant patients. However, a larger trial is needed to confirm these preliminary results.",

Aim The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NUCs prophylaxis (\u00b1HBIG) against HBV recurrence after LTx. Patients and methods This was a retrospective cohort-longitudinal study on 44 HBV-related post-LTx patients on anti-HBV prophylactic therapy. They included the entecavir (ETV)-based (n=34, 30 males) and the other NUC-based (n=10, 7 males) groups\u00b1HBIG. Results The median age was 63.5 (60\u201370) years in ETV and 62.5 (55\u201365) years in other NUCs groups. The mean follow-up duration was 6.09\u00b11.83 years in ETV-based group and 6.3\u00b11.89 years in other NUCs-based group. The mean ETV duration was 3.47\u00b13.04 years. In ETV+HBIG patients, none of them developed HBV recurrence throughout the \u00b18 years. In the 14 patients on ETV+other NUC+HBIG, four developed HBsAg positive and then transformed to HbsAb positive at the end of \u00b18 years without hepatitis or detectable HBV-DNA. Liver graft function showed nonsignificant difference for ETV-based patients, in comparison with other NUC groups (P=0.09). With subdivision, the graft function was maintained significantly better in ETV+HBIG or other NUCs+HBIG (P=0.04) groups. None of our patients reported NUCs-related complications or adverse effects. Conclusion ETV and other NUCs were effective and safe as a long-term prophylaxis of HBV recurrence after LTx, leading to a good graft function.
