        "title": "Treatment of arthritis with topical capsaicin: a double-blind trial.",
        "abstract": "The neuropeptide substance P has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation and pain in arthritis. In this double-blind randomized study, 70 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and 31 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) received capsaicin (a substance P depletor) or placebo for four weeks. The patients were instructed to apply 0.025% capsaicin cream or its vehicle (placebo) to painful knees four times daily. Pain relief was assessed using visual analog scales for pain and relief, a categorical pain scale, and physicians' global evaluations. Most of the patients continued to receive concomitant arthritis medications. Significantly more relief of pain was reported by the capsaicin-treated patients than the placebo patients throughout the study; after four weeks of capsaicin treatment, RA and OA patients demonstrated mean reductions in pain of 57% and 33%, respectively. These reductions in pain were statistically significant compared with those reported with placebo (P = 0.003 and P = 0.033, respectively). According to the global evaluations, 80% of the capsaicin-treated patients experienced a reduction in pain after two weeks of treatment. Transient burning was felt at the sites of drug application by 23 of the 52 capsaicin-treated patients; two patients withdrew from treatment because of this side effect. It is concluded that capsaicin cream is a safe and effective treatment for arthritis.",

        "title": "Published Trials of Nonmedicinal and Noninvasive Therapies for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Radiographs show osteoarthritis in many persons in the United States by the age of 40 years, and the disease causes pain or dysfunction in 20% of elderly persons [1]. Although osteoarthritis can affect any joint containing hyaline cartilage, troublesome symptoms occur most often in the weight-bearing joints of the lower extremities. No treatment can stop the osteoarthritic process [2], and thus therapeutic goals focus on reducing pain and improving function. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been the mainstay of medical management, but their use is associated with risks [3, 4], and whether their efficacy is superior to safer, pure analgesics is uncertain [5]. In addition, these drugs rarely relieve symptoms completely. In clinical trials, all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have performed similarly, with patients reporting approximately 30% reduction in pain and 15% improvement in function [6]. Surgical interventions relieve symptoms in some patients but are expensive and also associated with risk. Education and counseling, important for any patient with a chronic disease, may help patients with osteoarthritis [7]. Many nonmedicinal, nonsurgical treatments, including superficial and deep heat, cold, exercise, weight loss, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, low-energy laser, vibration, topically applied creams, pulsed electromagnetic fields, and orthotic devices, are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis. We review the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of these treatments in relieving pain and improving function in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Methods We reviewed all published trials that 1) included patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee; 2) assigned patients to a treatment group consisting of nonmedicinal, noninvasive therapy or to a concurrent control group that received either no therapy or an alternate or placebo intervention; and 3) included pain or a measure of lower extremity function as an outcome. Articles of interest were identified using MEDLINE by cross-referencing the medical therapy subheadings of osteoarthritis, including drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and rehabilitation, with clinical trials, comparative study, or trial(s) from 1966 through 1993. Of the 600 English-language articles on humans retrieved, 452 addressed medical therapy, of which 377 (63% of the total) involved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, only 31 reports dealt with nonmedicinal, noninvasive therapies. Of these, 11 met the three inclusion criteria previously listed [8-18], and bibliographies of these articles provided 3 additional studies [19-21]. The 14 articles (15 trials) are summarized in Table 1. The remaining 20 reports were studies of osteoarthritis of other anatomic sites (n = 8), were nonexperimental studies, or did not include pain or function as an outcome measure (n = 12). Table 1. Controlled Trials of Nonmedicinal, Noninvasive Therapies in Osteoarthritis of the Hip and Knee* In evaluating the quality of the trials, we used criteria developed by Sackett and colleagues [22] to analyze therapeutic efficacy, including whether assignment was random, clinically relevant outcomes were reported, patients had symptoms typical of the disease studied, clinical and statistical significance was considered, the therapeutic maneuver was subject to contamination or cointervention, and whether follow-up was complete. We also considered whether assessment was done by a blinded observer and whether the participants were blinded to treatment. For many of the treatments, blinding of the study participants was difficult (with exercise trials, for example). Sham treatments designed to create double-blinding for ultrasound, laser, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pulse electromagnetic fields consisted of similar devices that appeared to the patient to be on but did not transmit the associated therapy. For acupuncture, sham treatment consisted of placing needles at nontraditional acupuncture points. We judged the adequacy of sample size using guidelines developed by Bellamy and colleagues [23-25] for the number of participants needed to detect clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences for frequently used outcomes (when performed in a standardized manner) in osteoarthritis antirheumatic drug trials. The most common instrument for pain assessment in these trials was self-reported pain using a visual analog scale (a numeric scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10, the worst pain); the outcome measure reported was change in pain from baseline. The absolute change in score was usually divided by the entire range of the scale or the baseline value. In reporting improvement in pain in these studies, we used the former when the data were available to do so. The most common objective function measurement of the lower extremity was a timed walk; change was reported as a percentage change from baseline. Results Diathermy Diathermy (heating through or deep heat) can be delivered by high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) or electromechanical irradiation (microwave or short wave). Although sometimes prescribed for pain control alone, deep heat is typically applied before exercise involving large joints with limitations of joint motion to facilitate tendon extensibility and muscle relaxation. We identified two randomized, controlled trials of diathermy [8, 12]. Chamberlain and colleagues [12] randomly assigned 42 patients with well-defined osteoarthritis of the knee to receive short-wave diathermy applied to affected joints three times weekly by trained personnel, followed by exercises plus instructions regarding additional twice-a-day home exercise (n = 24), or similar exercise instruction only (n = 18). The exercises prescribed were designed to strengthen the knee extensors by graded resistive isotonic exercise (requires joint motion). At 4 weeks, 21 (88%) patients receiving diathermy plus exercise and 15 (83%) patients receiving exercise therapy alone were evaluated by a research assistant blinded to treatment arm. Both groups reported a reduction in pain measured on a visual analog scale and improved function based on a summated score derived from the ability to perform several activities, including walking and stair climbing. However, the only between-group difference was greater relief of pain (P < 0.05) in the exercise-only group. The data given were insufficient to determine whether the difference in pain was clinically meaningful or whether the sample size or scale used was sufficient to detect meaningful differences in pain or function. The exercise regimen was not standardized, and thus differences in exercise performed rather than the presence of diathermy could have caused the observed difference in pain relief. Falconer and colleagues [8] randomly assigned 74 patients with well-defined knee osteoarthritis associated with limited knee motion lasting for at least 6 months to receive ultrasound followed by a 30-minute exercise protocol for stretching and strengthening done 2 to 3 times a week for 4 to 6 weeks or an identical program that used sham ultrasound. When the program was completed, an experienced physical therapist blinded to treatment arm evaluated 95% and 92% of experimental and control participants, respectively. Study participants had a 20% decrease in pain (visual analog scale), a 12% increase in gait velocity (time to walk 50 feet), and a 9% increase in active knee range of motion; however, no between-group differences occurred (P > 0.05). The study was designed to detect a 5.3-degree difference in change of knee range of motion between groups and was also sufficient to detect clinically significant differences in pain and gait velocity [25]. Ultrasound is usually done before exercise, so the exercise cointervention was appropriate; in this study, the exercise was supervised and therefore should have been similar in the two groups. Exercise Exercise refers to a broad range of activities involving active or passive joint movement and muscle contraction. Many studies have documented joint motion restriction, muscle weakness, and deconditioning in patients with degenerative arthritis [26-28]. In osteoarthritis, muscle rehabilitation correlates with improved functional and psychological status [29]. Quadriceps Strengthening Two controlled trials evaluated quadriceps strengthening in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Jan and Lai [9] alternately assigned 61 women with well-defined knee osteoarthritis to receive diathermy (random assignment to receive ultrasound or short-wave diathermy) alone or diathermy plus exercise. The exercise consisted of isometric (no joint motion) knee extensor strengthening by 200 straight-leg raises daily. Diathermy was done at least 4 times per week, and the length of follow-up varied. A functional incapacity score was calculated from patient reports of pain and disability during various daily activities (modified Bandi criteria), and muscle strength was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer in an isometric testing mode. The exercise group showed a significantly greater improvement in the incapacity score compared with the nonexercise control group (30% compared with 20%; P < 0.01) and also showed greater improvement in measured muscle strength (P < 0.01). No attempt was made to determine compliance with the exercise regimen, and thus we do not know whether participants actually did the 200 leg raises daily. Also, the length of follow-up varied, was not well described, and may have varied between treatment groups. Chamberlain and colleagues [12] re-randomized participants who completed their exercise and diathermy trial (noted previously) at 6 weeks on the basis of whether they were informed about plans for assessment again at 12 weeks or not informed; 29 of 36 (81%) participants completed this second evaluation. They had been instructed to perform twice-daily hom",

In individuals with mild symptomatic OA, treatment may be limited to patient education, physical and occupational therapy and other nonpharmacologic modalities, and pharmacologic therapy including non-opioid oral and topical analgesics. In patients who are unresponsive to this treatment regimen, the use of NSAIDs in addition to nonpharmacologic therapy is appropriate unless medically contraindicated. Judicious use of intraarticular steroid injections has a role either as monotherapy or an adjunct to systemic therapy in patients with knee OA who have symptomatic effusions. The role of joint lavage and arthroscopic debridement in patients with OA of the knee who are unresponsive to conservative medical therapy needs further study, and these procedures cannot be routinely recommended for all patients at this time. Patients with severe symptomatic OA of the knee require an aggressive approach to decreasing pain, increasing mobility, and decreasing functional impairment; such patients may benefit from orthopedic consultation and evaluation for osteotomy or total joint arthroplasty.",

The 4 treatment groups consisted of 1) intraarticular placebo (1.5 ml of 0.9% normal saline), 2) intraarticular corticosteroids (3.75 mg of cortivazol in 1.5 ml), 3) joint lavage and intraarticular placebo, and 4) joint lavage and intraarticular corticosteroid.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis affects more patients than almost any other musculoskeletal disorder. The number of patients suffering joint pain and stiffness as a result of this disease will increase rapidly in the next decade. Although operative treatments of patients with osteoarthritis will continue to improve and the number of operative procedures will increase slightly in the next decade, only a small fraction of the patients with osteoarthritis will require operative procedures. The most pressing healthcare need for the majority of patients with osteoarthritis is nonoperative care that helps relieve symptoms and improve function, and in some instances slows progression. In rare instances, the symptoms of osteoarthritis improve spontaneously, but most patients need nonoperative care for decades. Orthopaedists need to improve their ability to provide nonoperative care for patients with osteoarthritis. They should be skilled in the early diagnosis of osteoarthritis and in the use of current common nonoperative treatments including patient education, activity modification, shoe modifications, braces, oral analgesics, oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, oral dietary supplements, and intraarticular injections.

        "title": "Potential mechanism of action of intra-articular hyaluronan therapy in osteoarthritis: are the effects molecular weight dependent?",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid (HA), is the major hydrodynamic nonprotein component of joint synovial fluid (SF). Its unique viscoelastic properties confer remarkable shock absorbing and lubricating abilities to SF, while its enormous macromolecular size and hydrophilicity serve to retain fluid in the joint cavity during articulation. HA restricts the entry of large plasma proteins and cells into SF but facilitates solute exchange between the synovial capillaries and cartilage and other joint tissues. In addition, HA can form a pericellular coat around cells, interact with proinflammatory mediators, and bind to cell receptors, such as cluster determinant (CD)44 and receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), where it modulates cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression. All these physicochemical and biologic properties of HA have been shown to be molecular weight (MW) dependent.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIntra-articular (IA) HA therapy has been used for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) for more than 30 years. However, the mechanisms responsible for the reported beneficial clinical effects of this form of treatment remain contentious. Furthermore, there are a variety of pharmaceutic HA preparations of different MW available for the treatment of OA, but the significance of their MWs with respect to their pharmacologic activities have not been reviewed previously. The objective of the present review is to redress this deficiency.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed in vitro and in vivo reports to identify those pharmacologic activities of HA that were considered relevant to the ability of this agent to relieve symptoms and protect joint tissues in OA. Where possible, reports were selected for inclusion when the pharmacologic effects of HA had been studied in relation to its MW. In many studies, only a single HA preparation had been investigated. In these instances, the experimental outcomes reported were compared with similar studies undertaken with HAs of different MWs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough in vitro studies have generally indicated that high MW-HA preparations were more biologically active than HAs of lower MW, this finding was not confirmed using animal models of OA. The discrepancy may be partly explained by the enhanced penetration of the lower MW HA preparation through the extracellular matrix of the synovium, thereby maximizing its concentration and facilitating its interaction with target synovial cells. However, there is accumulating experimental evidence to show that the binding of HAs to their cellular receptors is dependent on their molecular size; the smaller HA molecular species often elicits an opposite cellular response to that produced by the higher MW preparations. Studies using large animal models of OA have shown that HAs with MWs within the range of 0.5 x 10(6)-1.0 x 10(6) Da were generally more effective in reducing indices of synovial inflammation and restoring the rheological properties of SF (visco-induction) than HAs with MW > 2.3 x 10(6) Da. These experimental findings were consistent with light and electron microscopic studies of synovial membrane and cartilage biopsy specimens obtained from OA patients administered 5 weekly IA injections of HA of MW = 0.5 x 10(6)-0.73 x 10(6) Da in which evidence of partial restoration of normal joint tissue metabolism was obtained.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy mitigating the activities of proinflammatory mediators and pain producing neuropeptides released by activated synovial cells, HA may improve the symptoms of OA. In addition, HAs within the MW range of 0.5 x 10(6)-1.0 x 10(6) Da partially restore SF rheological properties and synovial fibroblast metabolism in animal models. These pharmacologic activities of HA could account for the reported long-term clinical benefits of this OA therapy. However, clinical evidence has yet to be described to support the animal studies that indicated that HAs with MW > 2.3 x 10(6) Da may be less effective in restoring SF rheology than HAs of half this size.",

The animals were subjected to 8 consecutive weekly intraarticular administrations of high molecular weight HA (the HA200 group), conventional molecular weight HA (the HA80 group), or high molecular weight HA plus L-delta dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes (the PHA group) and were killed 1 week after the final injection. The remaining transected right knees (the OA group) and randomly selected nontransected contralateral left knees (the control group) were collected simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (O.A.) is the most common type of articular disease. This is an idiopathic joint disease characterized by an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone accompanied by capsular fibrosis, osteophyte formation and variable grade of inflammation of synovial membrane.

We aimed to describe the distribution of lubricin in the other articulating structures in the human knee and hip\u2014menisci and labra\u2014and to relate this distribution to the degree of tissue degeneration. Methods: Eighteen menisci and 6 labra were obtained from patients with osteoarthritis undergoing total knee and total hip replacements, respectively. Macroscopically intact specimens were fixed in formalin and processed for H&E staining and immunohistochemical evaluation with an antilubricin monoclonal antibody. Results: Lubricin was found in all tissues as a discrete layer on the tissue surface, within the extracellular matrix, and intracellularly, indicating that it plays a role in the tribology of these tissues in human subjects, and can be synthesized by cells within the tissues. While none of the samples displayed macroscopic tears, approximately 40% of the surface of the menisci and 80% of the surface of the labra displayed microscopic fibrillations and slight fraying. There was no effect of the degenerative changes on the distribution of lubricin. Conclusions: Lubricin coats nearly the entirety of the surfaces of menisci and labra, including microfibrillations and tears, with possible implications towards the tribology of the tissues and healing of tissue damage.",

        "title": "Characterisation and in vitro simulation of the natural hip",
        "abstract": "Abnormal hip joint morphology, associated with diseases such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), is thought to be a precursor of osteoarthritis (OA) in the hip. Changes in joint morphology alter the loading pattern through the hip, which results in damage to the tribological interface, including labral tears and/or labral- cartilage separation. Evidence shows that early intervention to repair the labrum is more beneficial than labral excision; however scientific understanding of the tissue and the effect of surgical treatments are limited. It is hypothesised that an in vitro natural hip simulation system could be used in biomechanical testing of hip joint tissues as well as generating labral damage which could be used to assess current and new surgical treatment methods for the labrum. \nInitial quantitative assays revealed human and porcine labral tissue to have higher collagen content but lower water and GAG content than articular cartilage. Histological staining identified the structure of collagen within the labrum and cartilage, as well as the dispersion of GAGs, in human and porcine tissue. Slight differences were seen between the two species with the human labrum containing more connective tissue compared to the porcine labrum, which was primarily composed of fibrocartilage, and less GAGs. Mechanical tests identified little variation between the compressive properties of the human and porcine labrum however, larger differences were identified in the tissues tensile properties, where by the human labrum was stronger than the porcine labrum. Labral tissue was also found to be weaker in compression in comparison to cartilage tissue. \nAn in vitro natural hip model was successfully developed using clinically relevant conditions. The cup inclination angle was set at 45 \u00b0, a full ISO14242 gait cycle was applied to the joint with a peak load of 750 N, to account for porcine tissue. No labral or cartilage damage was observed after 10800 cycles. In vitro labral damage was also successfully developed, by increasing the acetabular cup angle to 60 \u00b0 and increasing the load by 50 %. The model was run through the full gait cycle for a minimum of 10800 cycles. Damage was classified using the Outerbridge and Lage systems. All types of labral damage outlined in the Lage classification system were identified within the model. Labral damage was found to progress from labral flattening, to radial fibrillation followed by longitudinal peripheral tears. \nThe methodology and findings within this study can be used in future studies and can be advanced to mechanically test the soft tissues of the hip in situ, as well as the effect of labral damage on the functions of the hip joint and potential labral treatments.",

        "title": "An in vitro methodology for experimental simulation on the natural hip joint",
        "abstract": "Different hip pathologies can cause geometric variation of the acetabulum and femoral head. These variations have been considered as an underlying mechanism that affects the tribology of the natural hip joint and changes the stress distribution on the articular surface, potentially leading to joint degradation. To improve understanding of the damage mechanisms and abnormal mechanics of the hip joint, a reliable in-vitro methodology that represents the in vivo mechanical environment is needed where the position of the joint, the congruency of the bones and the loading and motion conditions are clinically relevant and can be modified in a controlled environment. An in vitro simulation methodology was developed and used to assess the effect of loading on a natural hip joint. Porcine hips were dissected and mounted in a single station hip simulator and tested under different loading scenarios. The loading and motion cycle consisted of a simplified gait cycle and three peak axial loading conditions were assessed (Normal, Overload and Overload Plus). Joints were lubricated with Ringer\u2019s solution and tests were conducted for 4 hours. Photographs were taken and compared to characterise cartilage surface and labral tissue pre, during and post simulation. The results showed no evidence of damage to samples tested under normal loading conditions, whereas the samples tested under overload and overload plus conditions exhibited different severities of tears and detachment of the labrum at the antero-superior region. The location and severity of damage was consistent for samples tested under the same conditions; supporting the use of this methodology to investigate further effects of altered loading and motion on natural tissue.",

        "title": "Tribomechanical Properties of PVA/Nomex\u00ae Composite Hydrogels for Articular Cartilage Repair",
        "abstract": "Due to the increasing prevalence of articular cartilage diseases and limitations faced by current therapeutic methodologies, there is an unmet need for new materials to replace damaged cartilage. In this work, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels were reinforced with different amounts of Nomex\u00ae (known for its high mechanical toughness, flexibility, and resilience) and sterilized by gamma irradiation. Samples were studied concerning morphology, chemical structure, thermal behavior, water content, wettability, mechanical properties, and rheological and tribological behavior. Overall, it was found that the incorporation of aramid nanostructures improved the hydrogel\u2019s mechanical performance, likely due to the reinforcement\u2019s intrinsic strength and hydrogen bonding to PVA chains. Additionally, the sterilization of the materials also led to superior mechanical properties, possibly related to the increased crosslinking density through the hydrogen bonding caused by the irradiation. The water content, wettability, and tribological performance of PVA hydrogels were not compromised by either the reinforcement or the sterilization process. The best-performing composite, containing 1.5% wt. of Nomex\u00ae, did not induce cytotoxicity in human chondrocytes. Plugs of this hydrogel were inserted in porcine femoral heads and tested in an anatomical hip simulator. No significant changes were observed in the hydrogel or cartilage, demonstrating the material\u2019s potential to be used in cartilage replacement.",
