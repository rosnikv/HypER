        "abstract": "Forty-seven patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated in a 32 week, double blind, crossover trial of amitriptyline, desipramine, trazodone, and placebo. All drug regimens produced significant changes on pain measures relative to baseline, but only amitriptyline exceeded placebo. Amitriptyline was associated with a significant reduction in the number of painful/tender joints. Our study supports the efficacy of a moderate dose of amitriptyline as an adjunct drug for the treatment of pain in both depressed and nondepressed patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling techniques to examine potential interrelationships among psychological factors, immunologic activation, and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The subjects were 80 male patients with a diagnosis of classic or definite RA. Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Arthritis Helplessness Index, and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) pain score. Joint counts and immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes also were collected. Path analysis showed that percentage of HLA-DR+ cells in the peripheral blood and helplessness were related to join count. In addition, joint count had an effect upon depression. Depression had an effect upon pain, but there was no reciprocal effect of pain upon depression. This study describes a preliminary path model of interrelationships among psychological factors, immunologic activation, and disease activity in RA.",

There is evidence that depression bears a significant relationship to pain in RA, although the causal direction is not entirely clear. Likewise, there is strong evidence that depression is a major contributor to the RA disability. Therefore, prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive treatment of depression are needed to minimize the disability associated with RA.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy of an adjunctive cognitive-behavioral treatment compared with rheumatological treatment alone in unselected rheumatoid arthritis outpatients.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA prospective randomized control design was used. Change in medication during treatment was controlled by matching therapy- and control-group subjects according to this change in medication, sex, age, duration of disease, and functional class.\n\n\nSETTING\nA rheumatological outpatient clinic, University of Goettingen, Germany.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nFifty-five consecutive outpatients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (age 52.7 years, 74.5% female, duration of disease 9.4 years) finished the study.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nSubjects received routine care by the rheumatologists and routine medical treatment. Cognitive-behavioral treatment subjects (n = 19) received adjunctive standardized cognitive-behavioral group treatment with 12 weekly sessions.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nOutcome measures included disease activity variables, pain variables (pain intensity, affective pain), psychological symptoms, and coping.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects mostly demonstrated an increasing disease activity during treatment; change in medication during treatment was necessary in some patients. In the cognitive-behavioral treatment group the course of rheumatoid arthritis seemed less progressive than in the control group. The core effects of cognitive-behavioral treatment pertain more to improved coping, emotional stabilization, and reduced impairment than to reduced pain intensity. Passive, emotion-focused coping, helplessness, depression, anxiety, affective pain, and fluctuation of pain are reduced, \"Acceptance of Illness\" is improved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCognitive-behavioral therapy has proven an effective adjunct to standard treatment of rheumatoid arthritis outpatients. These effects were shown in an unselected sample with increasing disease activity and with comparable changes in medication during treatment. We recommend cognitive-behavioral treatment as an desirable adjunct to standard medical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

Objective measures of functional disability were completed by a physician\u2019s assistant after routine physical examinations at both time periods. Results revealed that a pessimistic attributional style at Time 1 significantly predicted lower self-rated disability at Time 2.

Data were collected from 72 patients at the beginning and end of their cardiac rehabilitation programs. Participants completed questionnaires assessing explanatory style, depressive symptoms, and subjective appraisals of cardiac health. Objective indicators of cardiovascular health were collected from participants' medical files. Results showed that the stable dimension of pessimistic explanatory style had a direct and negative effect on self-reported cardiac health appraisals over the course of cardiac rehabilitation. Although there was support for partial mediation cross-sectionally, findings did not support prospective mediation by depressive symptoms for the relation between pessimistic explanatory style and cardiac health appraisals.",

The present study examines other psychosocial factors, such as dispositional personality and social relationships, in order to investigate their influence on the well-being of 160 older adults with OA (80% women). Method: Older adults were recruited for self-reported knee or hip OA. Participants completed self-report measures of optimism and pessimism, social support, social strain, and life satisfaction using the computer program MediaLab. Measures were taken twice 9\u201312 months apart. Results: Results showed that, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, pessimism was related to lower social support and higher social strain. In addition, pessimism was mediated by social support in its relationship to life satisfaction. Discussion: Our models support the combined roles of pessimism and social support influencing life satisfaction over time. Future interventions may want to concentrate on improving the social relationships of people with OA to enhance psychological well-being.",

        "abstract": "Using a dyadic design, this longitudinal study with 85 couples examined whether the stress buffering effect of optimism is due to an actual higher availability of social support or to positive illusions about available social support by taking simultaneously the recipients\u2019 and the providers\u2019 perspective on social support into account. At baseline, optimism and social support from the recipients\u2019 and the providers\u2019 perspective were assessed. Perceived stress was measured at 3 months follow\u2013up. Actor\u2013Partner Interdependence Models showed that optimism was prospectively related to lower stress. Social support from the recipients\u2019, but not from the providers\u2019 perspective, partially mediated this relationship. The results suggest that optimists hold positive illusions about available support and that these illusions account at least partly for the stress buffering effect.

        "abstract": "Using the 2004 General Social Survey (N = 453), the identity stress process is investigated in terms of crises in intimate relationships and at the workplace. I discuss dispositional optimism as a psychological resource that is relatively independent of the situation and the self, making it ideal for structurally disadvantaged actors and for navigating crises that diminish self-based personal resources such as self-esteem. Consistent with this logic, dispositional optimism was associated with increases in self-esteem and self-rated health net of emotional stability; its effect on these outcomes intensified around the time of relationship crises and was stronger for women than for men. Moreover, optimism was more vital to self-rated health than self-esteem during either type of crisis, suggesting it may be a uniquely durable psychological resource in the stress process.",

        "abstract": "Background: Research has widely documented how, even in conditions of extreme poverty, deprivation, or oppression, children are competent and situated actors, capable of actively mobilizing internal, external, or social resources to protect themselves from their environments and safeguard their everyday lives. Yet, the ways in which their agency might support their well-being or instead increase their own vulnerability has remained underexplored. Aims: The present study aims to provide an assessment of all those contributions which, over the past 20 years, have focused on both the positive and negative consequences of children\u2019s actionability, revealing children\u2019s self-destructive acts alongside their self-empowering and protective ones. In the process, it highlights several major theoretical breakthroughs and findings in this area of research. Method: We provide an assessment of peer-reviewed studies that have focused on both positive and negative consequences of children\u2019s actionability, through a qualitative narrative literature review. Results: Of the 168 studies identified from online searches of the literature and the three additional sources gathered through bibliography mining, 76 qualified for full review, with 12 studies included in the final synthesis. Overall, the literature explored the different conditions in which children\u2019s agentic practices expose them to trauma symptoms and to dangerous or self-harmful situations, thereby failing to safeguard their health and overall well-being. Conclusion: The review highlights the need to focus on the dangerous effect of the agentic practices activated by children in terms of their physical and psychological health.",

The set of political, social, economic, and environmental factors that result from the occupation has a lasting direct and indirect effect on the well-being of the children exposed to systematic violence. In this study, we explored the effect of systematic violence and military oppression in a group of 22 school-aged youths (M\u2009=\u200912.2; SD\u2009=\u2009 2.69, 45.5% girls) living in the West Bank. We identified factors associated with children\u2019s maladjustment to potentially traumatic environments and survival skills following a socio-ecological lens. Data were collected through biographical participative interviews. The TCA identified six themes: the pervasiveness of the Israeli violence; the unexpected costs of the pandemic; victims and perpetrators of intra-community violence; everyday acts of happiness (or normalcy); support from families, peers, and community; subverting negative situations, and fighting back. Children emerged as continuously engaged in adjustment and readjustment to inhuman living conditions, making normal what is abnormal in their development. The study draws attention to the political antecedent and determinants of the Palestinian children\u2019s actions and reactions to violence, highlighting the impossibility of exploring children\u2019s growth while avoiding political and human rights implications.",

        "abstract": "To date, many studies have documented the devastating impact of the Israeli military occupation in Palestine, which deprives Palestinians of all basic and human rights. Yet, the interlocking oppressions that characterize the Israeli occupation\u2014as those of other colonial systems\u2014are mostly overlooked, with little attention being devoted in mainstream literature to the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality within the colonial project. With a perspective informed by intersectional feminist studies, decolonial approaches, and liberation psychology, we explored how women in Palestine resist and struggle against the colonial and patriarchal powers present in their lives and, in particular, the role of feminist critical consciousness in this process. Through 21 research-discussions with Palestinian and international but Palestine-experienced feminist activists and researchers, we explored how the concept of critical consciousness (CC) was perceived and encountered within their experiences in the Palestinian context. CC was explored in its two dimensions (critical reflection and critical action), and its liberating power was discussed. This study contributes to a growing body of literature on the relationship between CC and resistance, and their shared impacts on women's liberation and well-being within contexts of settler-colonialism. Implications for research, policies, and clinical practices are discussed.",
