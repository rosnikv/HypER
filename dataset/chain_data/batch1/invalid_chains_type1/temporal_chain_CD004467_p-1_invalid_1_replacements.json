        "title": "Foods with a low glycemic index do not improve glycemic control of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients after one month of therapy.",
        "abstract": "Twenty four diabetic patients (12 type 1 and 12 type 2) were studied to determine the influence of using foods rich in carbohydrates with either low or high glycemic indexes on the glycemic control of Diabetes Mellitus. All patients were treated with insulin. During 2 periods of 4 weeks the patients received, at lunch, 2 types of foods rich in carbohydrates as part of their usual diet. Meal A: foods with a low glycemic index and Meal B: foods with a high glycemic index. During the last 7 days of each period the patients determined, at home, their capillary glucose levels before and 1, 2, and 3 hours after lunch by means of a reflectometer. At the end of each period HbA1 levels were also determined. No differences in insulin dose or changes in body weight were found during the two periods of the study for both types of diabetic patients. Capillary glucose levels before lunch were similar on both diets and for both types of diabetic patients. Similarly, postprandial capillary glucose levels 1, 2, and 3 hours later were not different for both died A and diet B. No statistically significant differences were found either in HbA1 values for both periods of the study. These results confirm previous ones obtained in acute studies. The present findings indicate that the glycemic response of foods rich in carbohydrates is modified when included in a mixed meal by the other components of the meal. From these date it can be inferred that the use in a diet of foods with a low glycemic index does not improve the glycemic control of patients affected of Diabetes Mellitus.",

        "abstract": "To date there are 11 medium to long-term studies that have specifically used the glycemic index (GI) approach to determine the clinical gains in diabetes or lipid management. All but one study produced positive findings. On average, low-GI diets reduced glycosylated hemoglobin by 9%, fructosamine by 8%, urinary C-peptide by 20%, and day-long blood glucose by 16%. Cholesterol was reduced by an average of 6% and triglycerides by 9%. These are modest improvements but so too were the changes to the diet. Unlike high-fiber diets, low-GI diets are \"user friendly.\" As part of studies on the GI of foods, we determined the glycemic and insulin responses to 44 foods containing simple sugars. Their mean (+/- SE) GI was 62 +/- 14, which compares favorably with bread (GI = 73, glucose = 100). There was often no difference in the GI between the sweetened and unsweetened product. The time has come to reassess the value of GI in planning meals for diabetics.",

        "abstract": "KEY POINTS 1. The glycemic index (GI) of a food represents the magnitude of the increase in blood glucose that occurs after ingestion of the food. 2. GI tends to be lower for foods that have a high fructose content, exhibit high amylose/amylopectin ratios, are present in relatively large particles, are minimally processed, and are ingested along with fat and protein. 3. Consumption of lower GI foods 30-60 min prior to an endurance exercise bout tends to promote the following effects during exercise: \u2022 Minimizes the hypoglycemia that occurs at the start of exercise. \u2022 Increases the concentration of fatty acids in the blood. \u2022 Increases fat oxidation and reduces reliance on carbohydrate fuel. 4. The GI of a food consumed during exercise is probably less important than at other times because the insulin response to carbohydrate ingestion is suppressed during exercise. 5. Consumption of high GI foods soon after exercise will probably optimally promote the restoration of muscle glycogen. 6. Although manipulation of the GI of ingested foods may alter exercise metabolism, the effect of the GI on exercise performance is controversial and requires additional research.",

        "abstract": "Athletes use a variety of nutritional ergogenic aids to enhance performance. Most nutritional aids can be categorized as a potential energy source, an anabolic enhancer, a cellular component, or a recovery aid. Studies have consistently shown that carbohydrates consumed immediately before or after exercise enhance performance by increasing glycogen stores and delaying fatigue. Protein and amino acid supplementation may serve an anabolic role by optimizing body composition crucial in strength-related sports. Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E and carotenes, may prevent oxidative stress that occurs with intense exercise. Performance during high-intensity exercise, such as sprinting, may be improved with short-term creatine loading, and high effort exercise lasting 1-7 min may be improved through bicarbonate loading immediately prior to activity. Caffeine dosing before exercise delays fatigue and may enhance performance of high-intensity exercise.",

Changes in muscle soreness and indicators of muscle damage for 4 days following exercise were compared between supplement conditions using two-way ANOVA. No significant differences between conditions were evident for Experiment 1; however, plasma creatine kinase, aldolase, myoglobin, and muscle soreness were significantly lower for the amino acid versus placebo condition in Experiment 2.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute protein ingestion on the recovery of muscle function and markers of muscle damage in the 72 h post eccentric-exercise. Nine recreationally active males recorded quadriceps maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVC), peak 5 s power output (PPO), and perceived muscle soreness. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) and protein carbonyl (PC) content were measured prior to exercise. Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was induced by a 30 min downhill run (-10 degrees ) at a target intensity of 75% age-predicted heart rate maximum, immediately followed by ingestion of 100 g protein (containing 40 g essential amino acids; PRO) or placebo (CON) solution. The pre-exercise measures were re-taken in the subsequent 24, 48, and 72 h. CK, PC, and perceived muscle soreness increased significantly following exercise and with each supplement at 24 h. PC and muscle soreness remained elevated at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05), whereas CK returned to baseline values. No difference between conditions was observed for these measures. Peak MVC significantly declined in CON to -7.9% at 24 h, reaching a nadir of -10% at 48 h (p < 0.05). In the PRO group, MVC remained within pre-exercise values at all time points. PPO followed a similar trend, reaching its nadir of -8.7% at 48 h in CON (p < 0.05), but had recovered in the PRO trial. Ingestion of a single post-exercise protein mixture increases the rate of force and power restoration at 48 h, suggesting potential for protein as an ergogenic aid during the DOMS period.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that exercise-induced muscle damage may be attenuated when protein is included in a carbohydrate recovery supplement. This study was designed to examine systemic indices of muscle damage, inflammation, and recovery of muscle function, following strenuous exercise, with ingestion of either carbohydrate alone or a carbohydrate-protein mixture. Seventeen highly trained volunteers participated in 2 trials in a randomized order, separated by approximately 9 weeks. Each trial involved 90 min of intermittent shuttle-running, either with ingestion of a 9% sucrose solution during and for 4 h after (1.2 g.kg-1 body mass.h-1) or with the same solution plus 3% whey protein isolate (0.4 g.kg-1 body mass.h-1). Blood was sampled throughout and 24 h after each trial to determinate the systemic indices of muscle damage and inflammation. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to establish reliable baseline measurements of peak isometric torque for knee and hip flexors and extensors, which were then followed-up at 4-, 24-, 48-, and 168-h postexercise. The exercise protocol resulted in significantly elevated variables indicative of muscle damage and inflammation, while peak isometric torque was immediately reduced by 10%-20% relative to baseline, across all muscle groups tested. However, none of these responses varied in magnitude or time-course between the treatments, or between participants' first and second trials. The addition of whey protein isolate to a dietary carbohydrate supplement ingested during and for 4 h following strenuous exercise did not attenuate systemic indices of muscle damage or inflammation, nor did it restore muscle function more rapidly than when the carbohydrate fraction was ingested alone.",

The effects of carbohydrate and protein coingestion (CHO + Pro) have been investigated more recently, including the potential influences of chocolate milk. Some studies report that CHO + Pro beverages (including chocolate milk) enhance subsequent exercise performance versus carbohydrate beverages, although others have reported no positive effects. The putative efficacy of CHO + Pro could be due to influences on glycogen resynthesis, protein turnover, rehydration, attenuations in muscle disruption, or perhaps a combination of these factors. However, there are inconsistencies in the literature regarding the effects of CHO + Pro on these factors, and the mechanisms explaining potential influences of CHO + Pro are not defined clearly. Further research is required to address these limitations, but present evidence suggests that CHO + Pro beverages may positively influence recovery under some exercise conditions, and chocolate milk is likely a good recovery beverage for lactose-tolerant endurance athletes.",

Twelve male cyclists (VO2peak: 65 \u00b1 7 mL/kg/min) completed ~1 h of high-intensity intervals (EX1). Immediately and 120 min following EX1, subjects consumed one of three calorically-similar beverages (285\u2013300 kcal) in a cross-over design: carbohydrate-only (CHO; 75 g per beverage), high-carbohydrate/low-protein (HCLP; 45 g CHO, 25 g Pro, 0.5 g fat), or low-carbohydrate/high-protein (LCHP; 8 g CHO, 55 g Pro, 4 g fat).

Blood glucose levels (30 min after beverage ingestion) differed across all treatments (CHO > HCLP > LCHP; p < 0.05), and serum insulin was higher following CHO and HCLP ingestion versus LCHP. Peak quadriceps force, serum creatine kinase, muscle soreness, and fatigue/energy ratings measured pre- and post-exercise were not different between treatments.

Seven cyclists performed consecutive periods of normal training (NT), ICT (10 days; average training duration 220% of NT), and RVT (10 days; training duration 66% of NT). In a crossover design, subjects consumed supplemental carbohydrate (CHO) or an equal amount of carbohydrate with added protein (CP) during and following each exercise session (CP = +0.94 g/kg/day protein during ICT; +0.39 g/kg/day during RVT). A 30-kilometer time trial performance (following 120 min at 50% Wmax) was modestly impaired following ICT (+2.4 \u00b1 6.4% versus NT) and returned to baseline levels following RVT (\u22120.7 \u00b1 4.5% versus NT), with similar responses between CHO and CP. Skeletal muscle torque at 120 deg/s benefited from CP, compared to CHO, following ICT. However, this effect was no longer present at RVT. Following ICT, muscle fiber cross-sectional area was increased with CP, while there were no clear changes with CHO. Reductions in constant-load heart rates (at 50% Wmax) following RVT were likely greater with CP than CHO (\u22129 \u00b1 9 bpm).

        "abstract": "[Purpose] Milk is a commonly ingested post-exercise recovery protein source. Casein protein, found in milk, is characterized by its slow digestion and absorption. Recently, several studies have been conducted with a focus on how pre-sleep casein protein intake could affect post-exercise recovery but our knowledge of the subject remains limited. This review aimed at presenting and discussing how pre-sleep casein protein ingestion affects post-exercise recovery and the details of its potential effector mechanisms. [Methods] We systematically reviewed the topics of 1) casein nutritional characteristics, 2) pre-sleep casein protein effects on post-exercise recovery, and 3) potential effector mechanisms of pre-sleep casein protein on post-exercise recovery, based on the currently available published studies on pre-sleep casein protein ingestion. [Results] Studies have shown that pre-sleep casein protein ingestion (timing: 30 minutes before sleep, amount of casein protein ingested: 40-48 g) could help post-exercise recovery and positively affect acute protein metabolism and exercise performance. In addition, studies have suggested that repeated pre-sleep casein protein ingestion for post-exercise recovery over a long period might also result in chronic effects that optimize intramuscular physiological adaptation (muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy). The potential mechanisms of pre-sleep casein protein ingestion that contribute to these effects include the following: 1) significantly increasing plasma amino acid availability during sleep, thereby increasing protein synthesis, inhibiting protein breakdown, and achieving a positive protein balance; and 2) weakening exercise-induced muscle damage or inflammatory responses, causing reduced muscle soreness. Future studies should focus on completely elucidating these potential mechanisms. [Conclusion] In conclusion, post-exercise ingestion of at least 40 g of casein protein, approximately 30 minutes before sleep and after a bout of resistance exercise in the evening, might be an effective nutritional intervention to facilitate muscle recovery.",

Skeletal muscle makes up approximately 40% of total body weight and is essential for performing daily activities. The combination of exercise and diet is known to be a potent anabolic stimulus through stimulation of muscle protein synthesis from amino acids. Aging is strongly associated with a generalized deterioration of physiological function, including a progressive reduction in skeletal muscle mass and strength, which in turn leads to a gradual functional impairment and an increased rate of disability resulting in falls, frailty, or even death. The term sarcopenia, which is an age-related syndrome, is primarily used to describe the gradual and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass (mainly in type II muscle fibers) and function. Multimodal training is emerging as a popular training method that combines a wide range of physical dimensions. On the other hand, nutrition and especially protein intake provide amino acids, which are essential for muscle protein synthesis. According to ESPEN, protein intake in older people should be at least 1 g/kgbw/day. Essential amino acids, such as leucine, arginine, cysteine, and glutamine, are of particular importance for the regulation of muscle protein synthesis. For instance, a leucine intake of 3 g administered alongside each main meal has been suggested to prevent muscle loss in the elderly. In addition, studies have shown that vitamin D and other micronutrients can have a protective role and may modulate muscle growth; nevertheless, further research is needed to validate these claims. Resistance-based exercise combined with a higher intake of dietary protein, amino acids, and/or vitamin D are currently recognized as the most effective interventions to promote skeletal muscle growth. However, the results are quite controversial and contradictory, which could be explained by the high heterogeneity among studies. It is therefore necessary to further assess the impact of each individual exercise and nutritional approach, particularly protein and amino acids, on human muscle turnover so that more efficient strategies can be implemented for the augmentation of muscle mass in the elderly.",

        "explanation": "Although this paper is a literature review and does not directly build upon the source paper, it discusses the importance of protein intake for muscle protein synthesis, which is related to the source paper's findings on pre-sleep casein protein ingestion. However, the context and focus are different, making it not directly dependent on the source paper's findings."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to analyze the effect of whey protein (WP) supplementation on glycemic control, muscle strength, quality of life, and body composition in older adults with non-insulin-dependent diabetes undergoing a resistance training program.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study was carried out with older adults with Type 2 diabetes. Body composition, food intake, muscle strength, glycemic profile, markers of renal function, cardiopulmonary capacity, and quality of life were evaluated. Older adults were randomized into a supplementation group with 33\u00a0g of WP consumed twice a week on days of resistance training for 12\u00a0weeks supplemented group and a placebo group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 39 older adults were randomized into two groups, 19 in the supplement group and 20 in the placebo group. Both groups showed improvement in muscle strength, with the WP group failing to exceed that of the control group. WP supplementation slightly increased blood urea compared with the placebo group (p = .05), but values remained within normal limits. The group that used WP showed a small improvement in mental health, according to the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire, but without clinically important improvements.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBoth groups showed improvements in muscle strength and mass, regardless of supplementation, showing that resistance exercises performed twice a week can contribute to the nonprogression of sarcopenia in older adults with Type 2 diabetes. More studies are needed to determine the safe and effective amount of supplementation to improve muscle strength without renal impairment in older adults with diabetes.",
