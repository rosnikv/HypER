        "abstract": "dl-Propranolol, d-propranolol, and practolol were administered in increasing doses to conscious dogs before and after acute coronary artery occlusion. dl-Propranolol and practolol caused dose-dependent decreases in cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work, and maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise before and after coronary artery occlusion. These parameters were reduced 25\u201340% after the largest cumulative doses\u20141.43 mg/kg for dl-propranolol and 52 mg/kg for practolol\u2014were administered. The degree of beta-receptor blockade increased in proportion to the logarithm of plasma drug concentration. After occlusion, both drugs produced identical decreases in cardiac output at equivalent degrees of beta-receptor blockade. Neither drug affected resting heart rate before infarction, and neither drug reduced the tachycardia induced by coronary artery occlusion; this tachycrotic response probably resulted from cardiac vagal withdrawal. Mean systemic arterial blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance increased following beta-receptor blockade before infarction, most likely because of increased peripheral vascular alpha-adrenergic activity. These two effects did not occur after coronary artery occlusion, probably because vascular alpha-adrenergic activity had already been stimulated. d-Propranolol produced none of these effects. We concluded that the cardiodepressant effect of beta-receptor blocking agents in the doses administered was caused by their inhibition of endogenous sympathetic tone to the heart rather than by their quinidinelike action.",

        "abstract": "In a clinical study comparing the cardiocirculatory effects of intravenous tolamolol to those of propranolol, tolamolol, 16 mg, induced similar reduction in resting heart rate as 8 mg propranolol in 16 coronary patients. Tolamolol did not disturb cardiac pump performance and exerted less negative inotropic action than propranolol as assessed by mechanical contractility indices. Myocardial beta\u2010one chronotropic and inotropic stimulation by exogenous epinephrine was blocked equally by tolamolol and propranolol. Tolamolol exerted less systemic vascular beta\u2010two blockade than propranolol as assessed by the peripheral resistance and vasopressor responses to epinephrine irifusion. Tolamolol is a potent cardioselective beta antagonist with relatively less inotropic depressant action than propranolol and is thereby suitable for careful extension of beta blockade therapy to certain patients with pulmonary and ventricular dysfunction.",

The pressure reduction was due to a combination of reduction in cardiac index and total peripheral resistance. During hard exercise the cardiac index was almost unchanged, the pressure reduction being almost entirely due to reduction in total peripheral resistance. The heart rate was reduced significantly, but less than what is seen by \u03b2-adrenoceptor-blockers alone. \n \n5 One subject demonstrated the `first dose reaction' of prazosin with syncope. During the study tolamolol was withdrawn from clinical trials due to possible side-effects in long-term high dose studies in animals. After the haemodynamic study was completed, tolamolol was replaced by timolol without changes in the blood pressure. \n \n6 The combination of prazosin and a \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocking drug is very effective in most patients with mild and moderate essential hypertension. The blood pressure reduction is due to a combination of reduction in total peripheral resistance and in cardiac index, the latter being only slightly decreased during severe muscular exercise.",

        "abstract": "1 The anti-hypertensive effects of labetalol have been compared and contrasted with other groups of anti-hypertensive drugs in this review of the published literature. 2 The data show that the pharmacological and haemodynamic profile of labetalol in man is distinctly different from that of other specific anti-hypertensive agents; namely the properties of competitive alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor blockade leading to haemodynamic effects of reduced blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance with little accompanying changes in resting heart rate or cardiac output. 3 The anti-hypertensive effects of labetalol are dose related. In fixed dose comparative studies equivalent anti-hypertensive effects to those of labetalol have been shown for individual drugs of the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and diuretic groups. In dose titration studies, equivalent anti-hypertensive effects at given doses of labetalol have been demonstrated for drugs of the following types: beta-adrenoceptor blockers, beta-blockers plus diuretics, methyldopa, adrenergic neurone blockers and the combination of beta-blockers plus a peripheral vasodilator. 4 Comparing side-effect liabilities, it is clear that quantitatively labetalol produces no greater burden of side-effects than drugs of the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking group. Qualitative differences, however, do exist; in particular, symptomatic postural hypotension is dose related and is more likely to occur when excessive doses (greater than 2 g daily) are used.",

However, many patients are nonresponders in whom either additional drugs or different drugs are needed. the combination of an a-blocker with a b-blocker (a/b-blockade) is an attractive one, particularly for hypertension that may be resistant to an aCei/ diuretic combination. the magnitude of the antihypertensive effect is comparable to that of aCei/ diuretic combinations.1\u20134 a/b-blocker combinations lack the adverse metabolic effects and the increase in peripheral resistance associated with b-blocker monotherapy. although b-blockers resemble aCeis and arbs in that they antagonize the renin-angiotensin system (raS), combined a/b-blockade lowers blood pressure (bp) by mechanisms that differ from those of diuretics, aCeis, and arbs. thus, the combination provides a mechanistic alternative in patients whose hypertension may be resistant to aCei/diuretic and arb/diuretic combinations. Despite these advantages, this drug combination appears to be underused. the purpose of this commentary is to (1) examine why; (2) explore the forms of hypertension for which its use might be most appropriate; (3) evaluate the drugs currently available; and (4) identify areas that warrant more research.",

        "abstract": "Resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve target blood pressure despite the use of optimal or maximum doses of at least 3 agents, one of which is a diuretic, or requiring 4 or more medications to achieve blood pressure goal, is likely to affect up to 20% of all patients with hypertension. Apparent resistant hypertension may be caused by medication nonadherence, substances that either interfere with antihypertensive mediations or cause blood pressure elevation, and under- or inappropriate medication treatment. Certain patient characteristics are associated with the presence of resistant hypertension and include chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and presence of end-organ damage (microalbuminuria, retinopathy, left-ventricular hypertrophy). Secondary causes of resistant hypertension are not uncommon and include obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, and Cushing\u2019s disease. Initial medication management usually includes adding or increasing the dose of a diuretic, which is effective in lowering the blood pressure of a large number of patients with resistant hypertension. Additional management options include maximizing lifestyle modification, combination therapy of antihypertensive agents depending on individual patient characteristics, adding less-commonly used fourth- or fifth-line antihypertensive agents, and referral to a hypertension specialist.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Patients are diagnosed as having resistant hypertension when they have blood pressure readings that remain above goal despite the concomitant use of 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive agents from different classes, with 1 of the agents being a diuretic. Prior to diagnosing a patient as having resistant hypertension, it is important to document adherence and exclude white\u2013coat hypertension, inaccurate measurement of blood pressure, and secondary causes of hypertension (eg, aldosterone excess). After determining resistance, optimization of the medication regimen is essential. Combination strategies, which might include dual renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone blockade with spironolactone as 1 agent, have been proven successful. This article focuses on the safety and efficacy of spironolactone when added to an optimized 3\u2013drug regimen. Additionally, the use of spironolactone in chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea complicated by resistant hypertension is discussed. These 2 clinical entities are frequently accompanied by resistant hypertension and are indications for the use of spironolactone as well.",
