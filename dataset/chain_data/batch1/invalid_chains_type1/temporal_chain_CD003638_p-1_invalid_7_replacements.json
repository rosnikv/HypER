        "title": "Evaluation of a Pharmaceutical Care Model on Diabetes Management",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care model on the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in urban African-American patients. DESIGN: Eligible patients were randomized to either a pharmacist intervention or control group and followed over a 4-month period. Patients in the intervention group received diabetes education, medication counseling, instructions on dietary regulation, exercise, and home blood glucose monitoring, and evaluation and adjustment of their hypoglycemic regimen. Patients in the control group continued to receive standard medical care provided by their physicians. SETTING: A university-affiliated internal medicine outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: The study population consisted of urban African-American patients with NIDDM currently attending the clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations. Secondary outcome endpoints included blood pressure, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, microalbumin to creatinine ratio, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein concentrations. Quality-of-life assessments were performed in both groups at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (17 intervention, 22 control) completed the study. The intervention group consisted of 12 women and 5 men with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 59 \u00b1 12 years, total body weight (TBW) of 93 \u00b1 22 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 34 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, and duration of NIDDM 6.8 \u00b1 6.5 years. The control group consisted of 15 women and 7 men with a mean age of 65 \u00b1 12 years, TBW of 88 \u00b1 19 kg, BMI of 33 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, and a duration of NIDDM of 6.2 \u00b1 4.8 y. Significant improvement in glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.015) was achieved in the intervention group. No change in glycemia was observed in the control subjects. Statistically significant differences in the final glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.022) concentrations were noted between groups. No significant changes in blood pressure control, lipid profile, renal function parameters, weight, or quality-of-life measures were noted within or between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care in the reduction of hyperglycemia associated with NIDDM in a group of urban African-American patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of clinical pharmacists involved in direct patient care on the glycemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Eligible patients included those with type 2 diabetes who received insulin or were initiated on insulin therapy by the pharmacists and were willing to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose. The pharmacists provided diabetes education, medication counseling, monitoring, and insulin initiation and/or adjustments. All initial patient interactions with the pharmacists were face-to-face. Thereafter, patient\u2013pharmacist interactions were either face-to-face or telephone contacts. SETTING: Two primary care clinics in a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes who were referred to the pharmacists by their primary care providers for better glycemic control. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome variables were changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, and random blood glucose measurements. Secondary outcomes were the number and severity of symptomatic episodes of hypoglycemia, and the number of emergency room visits or hospitalizations related to diabetes. Twenty-three veterans aged 65 \u00b1 9.4 years completed the study. Fifteen (65%) patients were initiated on insulin by the pharmacists; 8 (35%) were already using insulin. Patients were followed for a mean \u00b1 SD of 27 \u00b1 10 weeks. Glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose concentrations, and random blood glucose concentrations significantly decreased from baseline by 2.2% (p = 0.00004), 65 mg/dL (p < 0.01), and 82 mg/dL (p = 0.00001), respectively. Symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes occurred in 35% of patients. None of these episodes required physician intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pharmacists working as members of interdisciplinary primary care teams can positively impact glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nMany clinical and logistical barriers exist in the primary care model for treating adult depression.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the feasibility and clinical effects of a telephone counseling and medication monitoring program for adults starting treatment for depression in primary care.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPilot study with a contemporaneous control group.\n\n\nSETTING\nGroup Health Cooperative, an HMO serving more than 450,000 persons in western Washington.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nTwenty-eight adult primary care patients starting antidepressant treatment (telephone counseling group) were compared with 94 patients receiving usual care (control group).\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nTelephone counseling participants received written educational materials addressing depression, followed by six weekly counseling and support sessions delivered over the telephone by a master's-level therapist. The intervention used the transtheoretical model of behavioral change and cognitive-behavioral strategies to enhance self-monitoring, self-management, and coping skills.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nTelephone interviews and computerized pharmacy and visit records.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nParticipation rate and retention, Hopkins symptom checklist depression scores, medication adherence and dose thresholds, and visits made for depression treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-three percent of telephone counseling participants contacted agreed to participate, and 92% completed the intervention. Telephone counseling patients showed significantly lower depressive symptoms than did control group patients at 3-month follow-up (0.89 vs. 1.13) and 6-month follow-up (0.79 vs. 0.95; P = 0.03). Telephone counseling patients were twice as likely to adhere to antidepressant medication with adequate dose thresholds (25% vs. 13%) and half as likely to meet criteria for major depression than were control group patients across time (8% vs. 16%), although these differences were not statistically significant. Total outpatient visits made for depression treatment between groups across time did not differ. Overall program cost per patient was estimated at about $150.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA telephone counseling and medication monitoring intervention was well accepted by adult patients starting treatment for depression in primary care. The intervention seems to significantly improve depression outcomes without affecting the number of visits for treatment of depression.",

        "abstract": "The glycemic control of patients with diabetes in a physician\u2010supervised, pharmacist\u2010managed primary care clinic was compared with that of patients receiving standard care in the same health care system. We retrospectively analyzed the glycemic control of 87 men with type 1 or type 2 diabetes whose diabetes\u2010related drug therapy was managed by clinical pharmacists compared with a control group of 85 similar patients whose care was not augmented by clinical pharmacists. Primary outcomes were differences in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels between groups. Secondary outcomes were relative risk (RR) for achieving an A1C of 7% or below, frequency of diabetes\u2010related scheduled and unscheduled clinic visits, and frequency of hypoglycemic events. The study group had 864 clinic visits and the control group had 712 between October 1997 and June 2000. No statistical differences were noted in FBG or A1C between groups. The RR of achieving an A1C of 7% or below was significantly higher in the study cohort (RR 5.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.62\u201010.26). The frequency of hypoglycemic events did not differ between groups. The mean \u00b1 SD frequency of unscheduled diabetes\u2010related clinic visits/patient/year was higher in the control group (1.33 \u00b1 3.74) than in the study group (0.11 \u00b1 0.46, p=0.003).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Clinical outcomes resulting from pharmaceutical care have been incompletely addressed in the diabetes population. We conducted a retrospective study evaluating clinical outcomes in a diabetes disease management program in which clinical pharmacists possessed collaborative practice agreements. OBJECTIVE To evaluate changes in clinical outcomes for patients enrolled in a pharmacist-coordinated diabetes management program. METHODS Medical records of 157 patients enrolled in the diabetes management program between June 2003 and April 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Data collection included baseline and follow-up values for hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and lipids as well as frequency of adherence to preventive care, including annual foot and eye examinations and daily aspirin therapy. RESULTS For patients with both baseline and follow-up data, the mean A1C reduction was 1.6% (n = 109; p < 0.001). For patients with an initial A1C of \u22658.5%, the mean reduction was 2.7% (n = 57; p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with A1C \u22647% increased from 19% at baseline to 50% at follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction observed was 16 mg/dL (n = 73; NS) and the percentage of patients with LDL values \u2264100 mg/dL increased from 30% at baseline to 56% at follow-up (p < 0.001). The frequency of microalbumin screening increased by 27% (p < 0.001), and the number of patients with annual eye and foot examinations increased by 27% (p < 0.05) and 15% (p < 0.05), respectively. The percentage of patients who had a positive microalbumin test and were taking a renal protective agent rose 19% from baseline to follow-up (NS). The percentage of patients taking daily aspirin increased from 42% at baseline to 80% at follow-up (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The pharmacist-coordinated diabetes management program was effective in improving clinical markers for enrolled patients. Significant improvements were observed in A1C and LDL values as well as the frequency of adherence to preventive care.",

        "abstract": "Background: Hypertension is a major health concern worldwide due to its deleterio us impact. Few studies have quantitatively assessed pharmacists\u2019 interventions in hypertensive patients. Objectives: To identify and quantify outcomes sensitive to pharmacists\u2019 interventions. Methods: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE were searched from inception through December 2006. Two independent reviewers identified articles; results were compared and resolved through consensus. Data extracted included intervention type, patient numbers, demographics, study characteristics, instruments used, data compared, and outcomes reported. A random effects meta-analysis was used to combine data. Study quality was assessed using the Downs\u2013Black scale. Results: Of 203 potential articles identified, 98 were selected and their abstracts were read. Nine of these were reviewed full-text and 19 more were identified from references, resulting in a total of 28 articles. Research designs included 18 randomized controlled trials, 6 single-arm clinical trials, 3 nonrandomized comparative trials, and 1 database study. Average quality score was 66% \u00b1 12% (fair). Medication management (82%) and hypertension education (68%) were the interventions most used. Thirty-nine study results (57% of all outcomes evaluated) were sensitive to pharmacists\u2019 interventions. Meta-analysis of 2246 patients in 13 studies found that pharmacists\u2019 interventions significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (10.7 \u00b1 11.6 mm Hg; p = 0.002), while controls remained unchanged (3.2 \u00b1 12.1 mm Hg; p = 0.361). Pharmacists\u2019 interventions further reduced systolic blood pressure (6.9 \u00b1 12.1 mm Hg;p = 0.047) over controls. Nonsensitive results included further reduction in diastolic blood pressure (3.6 \u00b1 3.7 mm Hg; p = 0.06), quality of life (1 of 8 significant), and adherence (5 of 13 significant). Conclusions: Systolic blood pressure is sensitive to pharmacists\u2019 interventions. Other outcomes may also be sensitive; however, more high-quality studies are needed for a comprehensive quantitative assessment",

        "abstract": "Background Pharmacists in various settings have been effective in initiating diabetes treatment. Patients with diabetes require ongoing disease management, and community pharmacists are in a strategic position to provide such extended care. Little is known, however, about the effects of community pharmacist\u2013provided interventions beyond the initial treatment period. Objective To evaluate the effect of community pharmacist\u2013provided extended diabetes care service on primary clinical outcomes, including hemoglobin A1c (A1C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood pressure, and on patients' reported self-care activities. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with diabetes. Participants had already completed at least 2 diabetes education sessions at a local diabetes education center. Nine specially trained pharmacists administered interventions during up to 4 quarterly visits per patient. Interventions included discussing medications, clinical goals, and self-care activities with patients and recommending medication changes to physicians when appropriate. The main outcome measures were 12-month changes in A1C, LDL-C, blood pressure, and self-report of self-care activities. Results Seventy-eight patients participated in the study (36 intervention, 42 control); 66 were included in the final analysis (31 intervention, 35 control). Compared with changes in the control group, patients who received interventions significantly increased the number of days per week that they engaged in a set of diet and diabetes self-care activities (1.25 and 0.73 more days/wk, respectively). The mean 12-month changes for A1C, LDL-C, and blood pressure were not significantly different between the 2 study groups. Conclusions Although pharmacist-provided interventions did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes over the study period, study results did show that pharmacists were effective at increasing the number of days that patients spent engaging in healthy diet and diabetes self-care activities. Addressing lifestyle and self-care behaviors can be a beneficial component of a pharmacist-provided extended diabetes care service.",

        "title": "Pharmacist Recommendations to Improve the Quality of Diabetes Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus continues to result in substantial morbidity and mortality despite receiving much attention from health care providers. Automated clinician reminder systems have been developed to improve adherence to diabetes care guidelines, but these reminder systems do not always provide actionable information and may be unable to detect relevant, subjective patient information that affects clinical decision making. Face-to-face visits with pharmacists, who have knowledge of care guidelines and medication management strategies, may assist in improving diabetes care. It is unknown if the combination of pharmacist chart review and clinician reminders could improve diabetes care without requiring face-to-face visits. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a comprehensive, pharmacist delivered, primary care, physician-focused intervention in a large hospital-based primary care practice to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes including rates of semiannual hemoglobin A1c testing and other biomarker and process measures. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study conducted in a hospital-based, primary care practice, composed of 37 faculty primary care physicians (PCPs) and 95 internal medicine residents. The initial sample included 346 patients with diabetes and 72 PCPs caring for them. PCPs were randomized to receive either a personalized letter from a practicing pharmacist containing treatment recommendations for patients with upcoming primary care visits (intervention, n = 33) or to usual care without the letters (control, n = 39). The letter included patient-specific recommendations regarding overdue testing as well as drug therapy to achieve diabetes-related treatment targets. The intervention included addition of the letter to the electronic medical record (EMR) and presentation of the letter to the PCP at the time of the index primary care visit that occurred between November 2003 and August 2004. Follow-up chart review was performed after the primary care visit to determine changes in 5 process and 3 biomarker outcome measures of diabetes care within 30 days of the index visit. The primary study outcome was a process measure, change in rates of semiannual A1c testing from baseline to 30-day follow-up. Baseline differences were tested for statistical significance using Pearson chisquare. The statistical significance of the intervention's effect was tested using logistic regression models predicting achievement of each study outcome, with randomization status (intervention vs. control) as the predictor variable of interest, controlling for baseline performance for each measure. RESULTS: 171 patients were in the 4 medical clinic suites with 33 PCPs who received the intervention, and 175 patients were in the 4 suites with 39 PCPs in usual care. 30-day outcomes were analyzed for 301 patients (87.0%) who attended their scheduled index primary care visit. Of these 301 patients, 44.5% were black, 65.8% were female, and the mean age was 63 years. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the intervention group (n = 150) and the usual care (control) group (n = 151) in the 3 biomarker measures (proportion with A1c less than 7%, proportion with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] less than 100 milligrams per deciliter [mg per dL], or blood pressure less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mm Hg]). There were no significant baseline differences in 4 of the 5 process measures; however, the rate of annual LDL-C testing was significantly higher for the intervention than for the control group at baseline (86.0% vs. 74.8%, respectively, P = 0.015). In logistic regression analysis, rates of semiannual A1c testing were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups, increasing from baseline to follow-up by 16% in the intervention group and 9% in the control group (P = 0.146). The proportion of patients with A1c less than 7% at follow-up was 43.3% in the intervention group versus 37.7% in the control group (intervention effect P = 0.099). The only statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the 8 outcome measures was a higher proportion with an annual eye exam at follow-up in the intervention group (60.0%) versus the usual care group (50.3%, intervention effect P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-generated recommendations delivered by letter to PCPs in an academic medical practice were not associated with statistically significant improvements in most quality measures for diabetes care assessed at 30 days following the intervention. Further research is needed with more patients and a longer follow-up time to determine how best to improve the quality of care of patients with diabetes using focused recommendations for therapy changes and reminder notices to clinicians.",

After screening titles and abstracts, full-text versions of articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Included articles were abstracted to evidence tables by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed for seven domains in which sufficient studies with common outcomes were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 15,176 articles, from which 323 articles describing 311 unique studies including 160 reports on 148 randomized control trials (RCTs) were selected for inclusion. RCTs comprised 47.5 percent of the comparative studies on CDSSs/KMSs. Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs effectively improved health care process measures related to performing preventive services (n = 25; OR 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.58), ordering clinical studies (n = 20; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.00), and prescribing therapies (n = 46; OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.82). Fourteen CDSS/KMS features were assessed for correlation with success of CDSSs/KMSs across all endpoints. Meta-analyses identified six new success features: Integration with charting or order entry system. Promotion of action rather than inaction. No need for additional clinician data entry. Justification of decision support via research evidence. Local user involvement. Provision of decision support results to patients as well as providers. Three previously identified success features were confirmed: Automatic provision of decision support as part of clinician workflow. Provision of decision support at time and location of decisionmaking. Provision of a recommendation, not just an assessment. Only 29 (19.6%) RCTs assessed the impact of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, 22 (14.9%) assessed costs, and 3 assessed KMSs on any outcomes. The primary source of knowledge used in CDSSs was derived from structured care protocols.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nStrong evidence shows that CDSSs/KMSs are effective in improving health care process measures across diverse settings using both commercially and locally developed systems. Evidence for the effectiveness of CDSSs on clinical outcomes and costs and KMSs on any outcomes is minimal. Nine features of CDSSs/KMSs that correlate with a successful impact of clinical decision support have been newly identified or confirmed.",

A potential opportunity for enabling such scalable CDS is to leverage vendor-supported, Web-based CDS development platforms along with vendor-supported application programming interfaces (APIs). Here, we propose a potential staged approach for enabling such scalable CDS, starting with the use of custom EHR APIs and moving towards standardized EHR APIs to facilitate interoperability. We analyzed three commercial EHR systems for their capabilities to support the proposed approach, and we implemented prototypes in all three systems. Based on these analyses and prototype implementations, we conclude that the approach proposed is feasible, already supported by several major commercial EHR vendors, and potentially capable of enabling cross-platform CDS at scale.",

Results: By 1992, hardware had become more affordable, powerful, and compact and the use of personal computers, local area networks, and the Internet provided faster and easier access to medical information. EHRs were initially developed and used at academic medical facilities but since most have been replaced by large vendor EHRs. While EHR use has increased and clinicians are being prepared to practice in an EHR-mediated world, technical issues have been overshadowed by procedural, professional, social, political, and especially ethical issues as well as the need for compliance with standards and information security. There have been enormous advancements that have taken place, but many of the early expectations for EHRs have not been realized and current EHRs still do not meet the needs of today\u2019s rapidly changing healthcare environment. Conclusion: The current use of EHRs initiated by new technology would have been hard to foresee. Current and new EHR technology will help to provide international standards for interoperable applications that use health, social, economic, behavioral, and environmental data to communicate, interpret, and act intelligently upon complex healthcare information to foster precision medicine and a learning health system.",

        "title": "Inclusion of Unstructured Clinical Text Improves Early Prediction of Death or Prolonged ICU Stay*",
        "abstract": "Objectives: Early prediction of undesired outcomes among newly hospitalized patients could improve patient triage and prompt conversations about patients\u2019 goals of care. We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, and elastic net regression models, with and without unstructured clinical text data, to predict a binary composite outcome of in-hospital death or ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days using data from the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Design: Retrospective cohort study with split sampling for model training and testing. Setting: A single urban academic hospital. Patients: All hospitalized patients who required ICU care at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, from 2001 to 2012. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Among eligible 25,947 hospital admissions, we observed 5,504 (21.2%) in which patients died or had ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 7 days. The gradient boosting machine model had the highest discrimination without (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81\u20130.84) and with (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88\u20130.90) text-derived variables. Both gradient boosting machines and random forests outperformed logistic regression without text data (p < 0.001), whereas all models outperformed logistic regression with text data (p < 0.02). The inclusion of text data increased the discrimination of all four model types (p < 0.001). Among those models using text data, the increasing presence of terms \u201cintubated\u201d and \u201cpoor prognosis\u201d were positively associated with mortality and ICU length of stay, whereas the term \u201cextubated\u201d was inversely associated with them. Conclusions: Variables extracted from unstructured clinical text from the first 48 hours of hospital admission using natural language processing techniques significantly improved the abilities of logistic regression and other machine learning models to predict which patients died or had long ICU stays. Learning health systems may adapt such models using open-source approaches to capture local variation in care patterns.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGraves' disease (GD) is a typical organ-specific autoimmune disease. Intestinal flora plays pivotal roles in immune homeostasis and autoimmune disease development. However, the association and mechanism between intestinal flora and GD remain elusive.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the association and mechanism between intestinal flora and GD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 58 initially untreated GD patients and 63 healthy individuals in the study. The composition and metabolic characteristics of the intestinal flora in GD patients and the causal relationship between intestinal flora and GD pathogenesis were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, targeted/untargeted metabolomics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe composition, metabolism and inter-relationships of the intestinal flora were also changed, particularly the significantly reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria and SCFAs. YCH46 strain of Bacteroides fragilis could produce propionic acid and increase Treg cell numbers while decrease Th17 cell numbers. Transplanting the intestinal flora of GD patients significantly increased GD incidence in GD mouse model. Additionally, three intestinal bacteria genera (Bacteroides, Alistipes, Prevotella) could distinguish GD patients from healthy individuals with 85% accuracy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGut dysbiosis contributes to Treg/Th17 imbalance through the pathway regulated by propionic acid and promotes the occurrence of GD together with other pathogenic factors. Bacteroides, Alistipes and Prevotella have great potential to serve as adjunct markers for GD diagnosis. This study provided valuable clues for improving immune dysfunction of GD patients using B. fragilis and illuminated the prospects of microecological therapy for GD as an adjunct treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: Discharge date prediction plays a crucial role in healthcare management, enabling efficient resource allocation and patient care planning. Accurate estimation of the discharge date can optimize hospital operations and facilitate better patient outcomes. Materials and Methods: In this study, we employed a systematic approach to develop a discharge date prediction model. We collaborated closely with clinical experts to identify relevant data elements that contribute to the prediction accuracy. Feature engineering was used to extract predictive features from both structured and unstructured data sources. XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, was employed for the prediction task. Furthermore, the developed model was seamlessly integrated into a widely used Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, ensuring practical usability. Results: The model achieved a performance surpassing baseline estimates by up to 35.68% in the F1-score. Post-deployment, the model demonstrated operational value by aligning with MS GMLOS and contributing to an 18.96% reduction in excess hospital days. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the effectiveness and potential value of the developed discharge date prediction model in clinical practice. By improving the accuracy of discharge date estimations, the model has the potential to enhance healthcare resource management and patient care planning. Additional research endeavors should prioritize the evaluation of the model's long-term applicability across diverse scenarios and the comprehensive analysis of its influence on patient outcomes.
