        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor peptide derived from the endothelium. We evaluated the contribution of endothelin to blood-pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension by studying the effect of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 293 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute reduction of 5.7 mm Hg at each dose), which was similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to elevated blood pressure in such patients. The favorable effect of treatment with bosentan on blood pressure occurred without reflexive neurohormonal activation.",

        "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that endothelin-1 plays an important role in vascular pathophysiology. Our objective was to examine whether molecular variations at the endothelin-1 locus were involved in susceptibility to myocardial infarction and variation in blood pressure. The entire coding sequence and 1.4 kb of the 5' flanking region were screened. Five polymorphisms were detected, which were genotyped in the ECTIM (Etude Cas-T\u00e9moin de l'Infarctus du Myocarde) Study, a multicenter study comparing 648 male patients who had survived a myocardial infarction and 760 population-based controls. The polymorphisms were not associated with myocardial infarction, nor did they contribute to blood pressure levels in the population at large. However, a G/T polymorphism predicting an Lys/Asn change (ET1/C198) strongly interacted (P<0.001) with body mass index in the determination of blood pressure levels. There was a steeper increase of blood pressure with body mass index in carriers of the T allele than in GG homozygotes. As a consequence, the T allele was associated with an increase of blood pressure in overweight subjects (body mass index >/=26 kg/m2), while no significant effect was observed in lean subjects (body mass index <26 kg/m2). To determine whether this finding could be replicated, the ET1/C198 was genotyped in the Glasgow Heart Scan Study, a population-based study including 619 men and 663 women. Subjects homozygous for the T allele had higher resting blood pressure levels than others (P<0.05). A similar interaction between the T allele and body mass index was observed on the maximum blood pressure achieved during a treadmill exercise test (P<0.001). In conclusion, results from 2 independent studies suggest that the ET1/C198 polymorphism is associated with blood pressure levels in overweight people.",

        "abstract": "Molecular medicine has led to rapid advances in the characterization of hepatobiliary transport systems that determine the uptake and excretion of bile salts and other biliary constituents in the liver and extrahepatic tissues. The bile salt pool undergoes an enterohepatic circulation that is regulated by distinct bile salt transport proteins, including the canalicular bile salt export pump BSEP (ABCB11), the ileal Na(+)-dependent bile salt transporter ISBT (SLC10A2), and the hepatic sinusoidal Na(+)- taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide NTCP (SLC10A1). Other bile salt transporters include the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATPs (SLC21A) and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2 and 3 MRP2,3 (ABCC2,3). Bile salt transporters are also present in cholangiocytes, the renal proximal tubule, and the placenta. Expression of these transport proteins is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, with the former involving nuclear hormone receptors where bile salts function as specific ligands. During bile secretory failure (cholestasis), bile salt transport proteins undergo adaptive responses that serve to protect the liver from bile salt retention and which facilitate extrahepatic routes of bile salt excretion. This review is a comprehensive summary of current knowledge of the molecular characterization, function, and regulation of bile salt transporters in normal physiology and in cholestatic liver disease and liver regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Induction of hepatic phase I/II detoxification enzymes and alternative excretory pumps may limit hepatocellular accumulation of toxic biliary compounds in cholestasis. Because the nuclear xenobiotic receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulate involved enzymes and transporters, we aimed to induce adaptive alternative pathways with different CAR and PXR agonists in vivo. Mice were treated with the CAR agonists phenobarbital and 1,4\u2010bis\u2010[2\u2010(3,5\u2010dichlorpyridyloxy)]benzene, as well as the PXR agonists atorvastatin and pregnenolone\u201016\u03b1\u2010carbonitrile. Hepatic bile acid and bilirubin\u2010metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, Ugt1a1, Sult2a1), their regulatory nuclear receptors (CAR, PXR, farnesoid X receptor), and bile acid/organic anion and lipid transporters (Ntcp, Oatp1,2,4, Bsep, Mrp2\u20104, Mdr2, Abcg5/8, Asbt) in the liver and kidney were analyzed via reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Potential functional relevance was tested in common bile duct ligation (CBDL). CAR agonists induced Mrp2\u20104 and Oatp2; PXR agonists induced only Mrp3 and Oatp2. Both PXR and CAR agonists profoundly stimulated bile acid\u2013hydroxylating/detoxifying enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10. In addition, CAR agonists upregulated bile acid\u2013sulfating Sult2a1 and bilirubin\u2010glucuronidating Ugt1a1. These changes were accompanied by reduced serum levels of bilirubin and bile acids in healthy and CBDL mice and by increased levels of polyhydroxylated bile acids in serum and urine of cholestatic mice. Atorvastatin significantly increased Oatp2, Mdr2, and Asbt, while other transporters and enzymes were moderately affected. In conclusion, administration of specific CAR or PXR ligands results in coordinated stimulation of major hepatic bile acid/bilirubin metabolizing and detoxifying enzymes and hepatic key alternative efflux systems, effects that are predicted to counteract cholestasis.

        "abstract": "Cryopreserved rat hepatocytes entrapped within an alginate matrix, commercially available as Liverbeads, were evaluated for their relevance as a screening tool for gene induction in vitro, using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. They were treated with the reference compounds \u03b2-naphthoflavone (BNF), phenobarbital (PB), pregnenolone 16\u03b1-carbonitrile (PCN), and clofibric acid (CLO) and analyzed for mRNA levels of Cyp1a1, Cyp2b1, Cyp3a1, Cyp4a1, Ugt1a6, and Ugt2b1. In addition, for PB and PCN, the results were compared with those obtained in rat liver in vivo. For each inducer, the gene induction profiles obtained with the Liverbeads in vitro model were time- and dose-dependent. The in vitro gene expression profiles confirmed the corresponding known P450 and UGT induction by each reference compound. In particular, the most strongly induced genes were Cyp1a1 by BNF, Cyp2b1 by PB, Cyp3a1 and Ugt2b1 by PCN, and Cyp4a1 and Cyp2b1 by CLO. Other genes investigated were also induced by the reference compounds, but the expression levels were lower, and increases were seen only after prolonged treatment. In particular, Ugt1a6 and Cyp2b1 were increased by BNF, Cyp1a1, Cyp3a1, and Ugt2b1 by PB, and Cyp3a1 and Ugt2b1 by CLO. All of these results correlated well with published in vitro data and our in vivo data. In conclusion, our results suggest that Liverbeads is a relevant and useful in vitro screening tool for determining gene induction profiles of new molecules. In addition, because Liverbeads from different species are available, this tool offers the possibility to conduct interspecies comparisons.",

        "abstract": "Two Vav isoforms could be targeted to prevent breast tumors from metastasizing to the lung. Metastatic Route to the Lung Many individuals with cancer die from secondary tumors or metastases that spread through blood or lymph vessels to other tissues from the primary tumor site. The members of the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) promote tumor growth and metastasis and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rho GEFs are attractive pharmacological targets because they have potentially druggable catalytic activities and more restricted distribution patterns than Rho proteins. Citterio et al. found that the mRNA abundance of the GEFs Vav2 and Vav3 was increased in certain breast cancer subtypes in patient samples. Mice implanted with breast cancer cells in which Vav2 and Vav3 had been silenced developed slowly growing breast tumors and did not develop lung metastases. Vav2- and Vav3-deficient breast cancer cells showed an altered transcriptional profile, leading the authors to further analyze the role of select target genes encoding proteins that could be pharmacologically inhibited, such as the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. When implanted into mice, breast cancer cells with deficiencies in individual Vav target genes showed defects in proliferation, angiogenesis, the ability to enter or exit blood vessels during metastasis, and the ability to colonize the lung. When applied to human breast cancer data sets, the changes in the abundance of a subset of mRNAs from the Vav transcriptome generated a gene signature that accurately predicted if patients survived and were free of detectable lung metastasis. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and preventing secondary lung metastases and provide a potential prognostic tool for clinicians. The guanosine triphosphatases of the Rho and Rac subfamilies regulate protumorigenic pathways and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs), which could be potential targets for anticancer therapies. We report that two Rho GEFs, Vav2 and Vav3, play synergistic roles in breast cancer by sustaining tumor growth, neoangiogenesis, and many of the steps involved in lung-specific metastasis. The involvement of Vav proteins in these processes did not correlate with Rac1 and RhoA activity or cell migration, implying the presence of additional biological programs. Microarray analyses revealed that Vav2 and Vav3 controlled a vast transcriptional program in breast cancer cells through mechanisms that were shared between the two proteins, isoform-specific or synergistic. Furthermore, the abundance of Vav-regulated transcripts was modulated by Rac1-dependent and Rac1-independent pathways. This transcriptome encoded therapeutically targetable proteins that played nonredundant roles in primary tumorigenesis and lung-specific metastasis, such as integrin-linked kinase (Ilk), the transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 family ligand inhibin \u03b2A, cyclooxygenase-2, and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule Tacstd2. It also contained gene signatures that predicted disease outcome in breast cancer patients. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and lung metastases and provide a potential diagnostic tool for clinical use.",

However, the effect of statins on spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of statin-mediated tumor growth and metastasis inhibition in an in vivo model. We found that statins significantly inhibited spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth. Statins inhibited the mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo and also suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of very late antigens (VLAs). Moreover, statins inhibited the prenylation of Rho as well as the phosphorylation of LIM kinase, serum response factor (SRF), and c-Fos downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. In addition, statins enhanced p53, p21, and p27 expression and reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase and expression of cyclin D1 and E2. These results indicate that statins suppress Rho signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis and growth. Furthermore, statins markedly improved the survival rate in a metastasis model, suggesting that statins have potential clinical applications for the treatment of metastatic cancers.",

In contrast, further research is needed to study the clinical significance and the detailed mechanism of action of lncRNA-CYTOR in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CYTOR in CRC prognosis and identify the relevant potential signaling pathways and underlying mechanism of competing endogenous RNA. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) indicated that the expression of CYTOR was significantly elevated in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines. Aberrant expression of CYTOR was significantly related to TNM stage, T stage, N stage, and perineural and venous invasions. Survival analysis indicated that high-CYTOR expression was associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0057), and multivariate analysis showed that high-CYTOR expression was an independent prognostic factor, which led to poor OS. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed that there were 18 microRNAs (miRNAs) interacted with CYTOR, and one of them, miR-3679-5p might collaborate with metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1), which was selected for further analysis. Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of CYTOR and MACC1.

        "abstract": "Background This study aimed to investigate the potential of a NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature as a reliable prognostic biomarker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods Transcriptome profiles and clinical data of AML patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. NAD+ metabolism-related genes (NMRGs) were identified from the KEGG and Reactome databases. Coexpression analysis was used to screen NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNAs. The NAD+ metabolismrelated lncRNA signature was constructed using univariate analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate analysis. High- and low-risk groups were compared for survival, tumor mutation burden, immune cell infiltration, and response to immunotherapy. Enrichment analysis explored the biological functions. Results LINC01679, AC079922.2, TRAF3IP2-AS1, and LINC02465 were identified to construct the risk model. The model exhibited good predictive power and outperformed age and gender as an independent prognostic marker. High-risk patients showed poorer survival, distinct TP53 mutations, and altered immune cell infiltration compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, low-risk patients exhibited greater sensitivity to immunotherapy. Enriched biological functions included leukocyte migration and positive regulation of cytokine production. Conclusions The NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature shows promise in predicting clinical outcomes for AML patients.",

        "explanation": "This paper identifies TRAF3IP2-AS1 as one of the lncRNAs in the NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature for predicting the prognosis and immune landscape of acute myeloid leukemia. The source paper also identified TRAF3IP2-AS1 as one of the ferroptosis-related lncRNAs with prognostic value in pancreatic cancer. The current paper uses the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis, exploring the role of TRAF3IP2-AS1 in a different context."
