Similarly, significantly more irritable bowel syndrome patients said they would consult an alternative medicine practitioner (41%) if conventional treatment failed. Current usage of alternative medicine remedies was significantly greater in the irritable bowel syndrome patients (11%) than in patients with Crohn's disease (4%) and tended to be greater than in patients with organic upper gastrointestinal disorders (6%). This study has shown that the use of alternative medicine is common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and this does not appear to be explicable in terms of the nature, chronicity or refractoriness to treatment of symptoms.",

        "abstract": "We carried out a study to determine the proportion of patients attending a university-based gastroenterology outpatient clinic who sought alternative medical care for the same health problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. After the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire, the gastroenterologist gave a diagnosis and assigned a functional rating. Of the 395 patients 287 (73%) had not used alternative medicine, and 36 (9%) had sought alternative medical care for the problem that had prompted them to see a gastroenterologist. There were no significant differences between alternative medicine users and nonusers in sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services or general health status. Patients with a functional disease were more likely to seek alternative medical care than those with organic disease (33% v. 7%) (p less than 0.0001). Fewer alternative medicine users (54%) than nonusers (85%) were satisfied with conventional medicine (p less than 0.001), and more alternative medicine users (49%) than nonusers (13%) were very sceptical of conventional medicine (p less than 0.0001).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany people use unconventional therapies for health problems, but the extent of this use and the costs are not known. We conducted a national survey to determine the prevalence, costs, and patterns of use of unconventional therapies, such as acupuncture and chiropractic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe limited the therapies studied to 16 commonly used interventions neither taught widely in U.S. medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals. We completed telephone interviews with 1539 adults (response rate, 67 percent) in a national sample of adults 18 years of age or older in 1990. We asked respondents to report any serious or bothersome medical conditions and details of their use of conventional medical services; we then inquired about their use of unconventional therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne in three respondents (34 percent) reported using at least one unconventional therapy in the past year, and a third of these saw providers for unconventional therapy. The latter group had made an average of 19 visits to such providers during the preceding year, with an average charge per visit of $27.60. The frequency of use of unconventional therapy varied somewhat among socio-demographic groups, with the highest use reported by nonblack persons from 25 to 49 years of age who had relatively more education and higher incomes. The majority used unconventional therapy for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, medical conditions. Among those who used unconventional therapy for serious medical conditions, the vast majority (83 percent) also sought treatment for the same condition from a medical doctor; however, 72 percent of the respondents who used unconventional therapy did not inform their medical doctor that they had done so. Extrapolation to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy. This number exceeds the number of visits to all U.S. primary care physicians (388 million). Expenditures associated with use of unconventional therapy in 1990 amounted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 billion) was paid out of pocket. This figure is comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe frequency of use of unconventional therapy in the United States is far higher than previously reported. Medical doctors should ask about their patients' use of unconventional therapy whenever they obtain a medical history.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate national utilization and expenditures on chiropractic care between 1997 and 2006.\n\n\nDATA SOURCE\nThe nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWe performed descriptive analyses and generated national estimates from data obtained from U.S. adult (>or=18 years) MEPS respondents who reported having visited a chiropractor (annual sample size between 789 and 1,082). For each year, we examined the estimated total national expenditure, the total number of U.S. adults who received chiropractic care, the total number of ambulatory visits to U.S. chiropractors, and the inflation-adjusted charges and expenditures per U.S. adult chiropractic patient.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nThe total number of U.S. adults who visited a chiropractor increased 57 percent from 7.7 million in 2000 to 12.1 million in 2003. From 1997 to 2006, the inflation-adjusted national expenditures on chiropractic care increased 56 percent from U.S.$3.8 billion to U.S.$5.9 billion. Inflation-adjusted total mean expenditures per patient and expenditures per office visit remained unchanged.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe large increase in U.S. adult expenditures on chiropractic care between 1997 and 2006 was due to a 57 percent increase in the total number of U.S. adult chiropractic patients that occurred from 2000 to 2003.

        "abstract": "Study Design. A retrospective cohort. Objective. To describe physical therapy utilization following primary care consultation for low back pain (LBP) and evaluate associations between the timing and content of physical therapy and subsequent health care utilization and costs. Summary of Background Data. Primary care management of LBP is highly variable and the implications for subsequent costs are not well understood. The importance of referring patients from primary care to physical therapy has been debated, and information on how the timing and content of physical therapy impact subsequent costs and utilization is needed. Methods. Data were extracted from a national database of employer-sponsored health plans. A total of 32,070 patients with a new primary care LBP consultation were identified and categorized on the basis of the use of physical therapy within 90 days. Patients utilizing physical therapy were further categorized based on timing (early [within 14 d] or delayed)] and content (guideline adherent or nonadherent). LBP-related health care costs and utilization in the 18-months following primary care consultation were examined. Results. Physical therapy utilization was 7.0% with significant geographic variability. Early physical therapy timing was associated with decreased risk of advanced imaging (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 0.41), additional physician visits (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.32), surgery (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), injections (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64), and opioid medications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) compared with delayed physical therapy. Total medical costs for LBP were $2736.23 lower (95% CI: 1810.67, 3661.78) for patients receiving early physical therapy. Physical therapy content showed weaker associations with subsequent care. Conclusion. Early physical therapy following a new primary care consultation was associated with reduced risk of subsequent health care compared with delayed physical therapy. Further research is needed to clarify exactly which patients with LBP should be referred to physical therapy; however, if referral is to be made, delaying the initiation of physical therapy may increase risk for additional health care consumption and costs.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: It has been difficult to monitor the pelvic position during actual daily life. However, recent developments in wearable device technologies, such as the LUMOback device, provide the possibility to evaluate habitual pelvic posture and time spent sitting during daily life. The current study aimed (1) to investigate test\u2013retest reliability for habitual pelvic posture and time spent sitting with the LUMOback in individuals with prolonged low back pain (low back pain group) and without low back pain (control group), and (2) to preliminarily investigate differences in those measures between groups. Methods: Fifteen individuals in each group wore the LUMOback daily for 2\u2009weeks. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated in each group by comparing the mean from the first week with the mean from the second week: (1) for the posture score, which is a proportion of time with neutral posture, and (2) for time spent sitting. The two measures for the first week were compared between the low back pain and control groups. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for the posture score were .82 in the low back pain group and .91 in the control group. The intraclass correlation coefficients for time spent sitting were .75 in the low back pain group and .85 in the control group. The posture score in the low back pain group (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 37.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3%) was less than that in the control group (49.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0%; p\u2009<\u2009.001), but there was no difference in time spent sitting between the groups (p\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions: The current study found (1) acceptable test\u2013retest reliability for the posture score and time spent sitting evaluated by the LUMOback device, and (2) preliminary evidence of a difference in the posture score, indicating a more slouched lumbopelvic posture in individuals with prolonged low back pain than those without low back pain.",

For modeling knee pain reduction at the 1-month follow-up, 3 MDT provisional or concluding classifications (Spinal Derangement, Knee Derangement, and Non-Derangement) and the following variables were included: 1) gender, 2) symptom duration, 3) presence of low back pain (LBP), 4) the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure, 5) average pain intensity at the initial session using a 0\u201310 numerical rating scale, and 6) the Kellgren\u2013Lawrence grade.Results: Data from 101 patients were extracted. The percentage of patients with the concluding classification of Spinal Derangement was 44.6%. This was greater in those patient\u2019s reporting concomitant LBP (p = .002) and without radiographic findings of knee osteoarthritis (p < .001). A concluding classification was determined by the fourth session in 80% of patients. Multiple regression modeling demonstrated that only the concluding classification significantly predicted the knee pain reduction at the 1-month follow-up.Discussion: These findings suggest the importance of careful screening assessments of the lumbar spine and the importance of detecting Derangements throughout the follow-up sessions for patients with a primary complaint of knee pain.",

        "title": "Upper extremity special issue",
        "abstract": "Physiotherapists commonly treat upper limb pain and disability, with about 70% of the population reporting pain in the upper quadrant at some point in their lives [1,2]. In this special issue, we present a series of articles related to interventions used to treat patients with upper extremity disorders and an article on examination of scapular dyskinesis. Upper extremity functional impairments can have many causes and contributing factors, thus resulting in diversity among intervention approaches. In some cases, the spine may be a contributing factor to extremity pain or impairment [3]; therefore, the spine becomes a target of intervention. In other cases, an approach directed specifically to the symptomatic region may be most appropriate. Clinical guidelines exist for some diagnoses and can be considered in intervention planning [4,5], while it has also been proposed that individual patient clinical presentation is the best strategy to guide intervention [6]. Articles featured in this special issue present a variety of approaches to patient management that include manual therapy directed toward the spine for patients with upper extremity disorders, directed toward the shoulder for shoulder pain and directed toward the wrist and lymphatic system following distal radius fracture, neurodynamic intervention, and examination of scapular motor control [7\u201311]. The issue contains three systematic reviews with meta-analyses, a narrative review, and a reliability study. The first article in this special issue is a systematic review with meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of manual physical therapy for the treatment of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. Specifically, authors evaluated the effects of cervicothoracic and thoracic spine thrust or non-thrust manipulation [11]. These authors included 14 articles and concluded that cervicothoracic and thoracic manual therapy as a component of management for upper extremity pain conditions has limited evidence for reducing pain or improving function. Although there is some support for short-term effectiveness, there is little evidence for longterm effectiveness when compared to control/sham or other treatments. The authors of the second systematic review with meta-analysis specifically investigated the effects of mobilization with movement (MWM) in patients with shoulder pain conditions [10]. This review provides the most updated data on the effects of MWM and includes 21 clinical trials. The results show that the addition of MWM is effective for improving pain, range of motion, and related disability in individuals with frozen shoulder, shoulder pain, and movement dysfunction; however, the heterogeneity of the included studies should lead readers to use caution with interpretation of this conclusion. The third and last systematic review with metaanalysis of this special issue covered the effects of manual therapy in patients with post-traumatic distal radius fracture [8]. This review included eight trials and reported that adding MWM and manual lymphatic drainage showed positive effects on wrist range of motion and upper limb function; however, again the evidence was low. Results differed based on type of manual therapy. Authors concluded that there was a need for high-quality randomized clinical trials to determine the best approach. Clinicians can conclude from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this special issue that the inclusion of manual therapy for the management of upper extremity conditions is still limited, but it seems that the inclusion of these interventions is more effective, at least at shortand mid-term than their non-inclusion. The fourth article is a narrative review providing the most updated evidence-informed data on the effects of optimal tensile loading on peripheral nerve tissues and the use of tensioning (neurodynamics) interventions [7]. This paper reviews in vivo, in vitro, animal and human evidence supporting the need for obtaining a tensile loading force on nerve tissue in order to obtain clinical effects on healthy or pathologic nerve tissue. Authors claimed that proper tensile loading force applied to the nerve tissue could be responsible for the positive effects observed in clinical practice [12,13]. The final study of this special issue is an original paper investigating the reliability of identifying scapular dyskinesis by video training [8]. The results showed that using video training for identifying scapular motor control is an effective approach that permits proper identification. This is an interesting topic since the COVID-19 situation has increased the necessity of remote assessment and telerehabilitation by physical therapists.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The current standard to evaluate the presence of somatosensory dysfunctions is quantitative sensory testing, but its clinical utility remains limited. Low\u2010cost and time\u2010efficient clinical sensory testing (CST) batteries have thus been developed. Recent studies show moderate to substantial reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability of people with spine\u2010related leg and arm pain, representing mixed pain mechanisms. Methods Fifty\u2010three patients with spine\u2010related leg (n\u2009=\u200941) and arm pain (n\u2009=\u200912) attended three CST sessions. The CST battery consisted of eleven tests, determining loss and gain of sensory nerve function. CST was performed by the same investigator twice and by an additional investigator to determine inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability. Fleiss' (inter\u2010tester) and Cohen's (intra\u2010tester) kappa were calculated for dichotomized and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous outcomes. Results Fleiss' kappa varied among modalities from fair to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.23\u20130.66). Cold, warm, and vibration detection thresholds and cold and pressure pain thresholds reached kappa >0.4 (moderate to substantial reliability). Cohen's kappa ranged from moderate to substantial (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.45\u20130.66). The reliability of the windup ratio was poor (ICC <0.18). Conclusion CST modalities with moderate to substantial inter\u2010tester reliability could be of benefit as a screening tool. The moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability for all sensory modalities (except windup ratio) supports their potential use in clinical practice and research to monitor somatosensory changes over time in patients with spine\u2010related limb pain of mixed pain mechanisms. Significance We already know that most modalities of clinical sensory test (CST) batteries achieve moderate to substantial inter\u2010 and intra\u2010tester reliability in populations with neuropathic pain. This study evaluates the reliability of a CST battery in populations with mixed pain mechanisms. We found inter\u2010tester reliability varied from poor to substantial for sensory modalities, questioning the value of some CST modalities. The CST battery showed moderate to substantial intra\u2010tester reliability, suggesting its usefulness to monitor sensory changes over time in this cohort.",
