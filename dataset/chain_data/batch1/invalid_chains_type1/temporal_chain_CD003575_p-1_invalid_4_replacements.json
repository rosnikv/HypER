        "title": "Budesonide in collagenous colitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with histologic follow-up.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nCollagenous colitis (CC) is a well-described entity causing chronic diarrhea and characteristic histologic findings. Several treatment options have been suggested, but no controlled data are available. We conducted a placebo-controlled trial to show the clinical and histologic effects of budesonide in CC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 14) or budesonide 9 mg daily (n = 14) for 8 weeks. Patients were evaluated clinically, and blinded biopsy specimens were analyzed from fixed locations at weeks 0 and 8. Clinical response was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in the disease activity score (number of bowel movements in the last 7 days). At week 8, nonresponders received open-label budesonide for the next 8-week period; responders discontinued treatment and were followed up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree patients discontinued the study prematurely. Intention-to-treat analysis showed clinical response in 8 of 14 patients in the budesonide group compared with 3 of 14 responders for placebo (P = 0.05) after 8 weeks of blinded therapy, together with improved stool consistency. Histologically, there was no change in the mean thickness of the collagen band but a significant decrease of the lamina propria infiltrate in the budesonide group (P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is efficacious in inducing short-term clinical response in CC with significant reduction of the histologic infiltrate in the lamina propria.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMicroscopic colitis is a disease of unknown aetiology characterized by chronic watery diarrhoea and diarrhoea can be eliminated by budesonide but frequently recurs when budesonide is stopped. We studied whether prednisolone could induce remission in patients with disabling, chronic diarrhoea due to microscopic colitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA double-blind, randomized (3:1) trial of oral prednisolone 50 mg daily or placebo for 2 weeks. Remission was defined as stool weight < or = 200 g/day or frequency < or = 2/day; effect was defined as > 50% reduction of either stool frequency or weight. Six centres screened 31 consecutive patients and included 11 with collagenous colitis and 1 with lymphocytic colitis. Median duration of diarrhoea was 9 months. Patients had a normal colonoscopy, and no evidence of coeliac disease, bile acid or lactose malabsorption. Patients with gastrointestinal infection, previous gastrointestinal surgery, abnormal biochemical screening or recent treatment with immunosuppressive agents were excluded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStool weight (grams) declined in 7 of 9 patients given prednisolone and in 1 of 3 receiving placebo; changes in median weight were from 430 to 278 and from 825 to 489, respectively. Stool frequency (per day) declined from 6 to 3 and from 8 to 5. Remission was obtained in 2 and 0, and effect in 5 and 0, respectively (NS; Fisher exact test).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrednisolone 50 mg daily for 2 weeks induces incomplete remission in patients with chronic diarrhoea due to collagenous colitis.",

        "abstract": "A typical symptom of microscopic colitis (MC) is chronic watery diarrhea with normal endoscopic findings and characteristic inflammatory changes in histopathology. Treatment of the disease is mainly empiric. MC has two main subtypes: lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. There are also untypical histopathological forms of MC: MC with giant cells, MC not otherwise specified (NOS) and cryptal lymphocytic coloproctitis. Some other histopathological changes in MC have been observed, especially Paneth cell hyperplasia or epithelial degeneration. Eosinophilic colitis, acute colitis, amyloidosis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease should be taken into consideration in differential diagnosis. The most reliable biopsy material for histopathological examination are samples obtained from transverse colon. Some studies proved that treatment of MC makes it possible to reduce not only clinical, but also histopathological, manifestations.",

        "abstract": "Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.",

        "title": "Expression of 15-PGDH is downregulated by COX-2 in gastric cancer.",
        "abstract": "To explore the proteins regulated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in gastric cancer, the expression plasmid of COX-2siRNA was constructed and transfected into gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. Then, two-dimensional electrophoresis and the PDQuest software analysis were applied to discover the differentially expressed proteins. The differential protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Fourteen differentially expressed proteins between the two cell lines were identified. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] (15-PGDH), a key enzyme in prostaglandin degradation, was identified as an upregulated protein in SGC7901 cells transfected with the COX-2siRNA plasmid. To further explore whether the 15-PGDH is regulated by COX-2, western blotting and immunocytochemical assay were performed to detect the expression of 15-PGDH in different cell lines with different expression level of COX-2. The results showed that the expression of 15-PGDH was upregulated (128.57%) as COX-2 was suppressed by small interfering RNA and downregulated (51.72%) as COX-2 was enhanced by COX-2 cDNA transfection in gastric cancer cells. In tissue specimens with gastric cancer, there was a decreased expression of 15-PGDH and an increased expression of COX-2 simultaneously. A significantly negative correlation of 15-PGDH expression was found to COX-2 level, tumor differentiation, tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) staging and lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer. All the results suggest that 15-PGDH is downregulated by COX-2 in human gastric cancer and may contribute to the carcinogenesis and development of human gastric cancer in combination with COX-2.",

        "abstract": "Following an application from Yakult Europe B.V., submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of the Netherlands, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and including a request for the protection of proprietary data related to Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (Lc S) and maintenance of the upper respiratory tract defence against pathogens by maintaining immune defences. The food constituent, Lc S, which is the subject of the health claim, is sufficiently characterised. The Panel considers that maintenance of the upper respiratory tract defence against pathogens by maintaining immune defences is a beneficial physiological effect. The applicant identified a total of 12 references as being pertinent to the health claim. These included nine human intervention trials and three animal studies. In weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that there was no human study from which conclusions could be drawn for an effect of Lc S consumption on upper respiratory tract infections, that one human study did not support an effect of Lc S consumption on the immune response to influenza vaccination, and that there was a lack of evidence for an effect of Lc S consumption on the immune system that could relate to the defence of the upper respiratory tract against pathogens. The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of Lc S and maintenance of the upper respiratory tract defence against pathogens by maintaining immune defences.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate dendritic cell processing of the microbiota promotes intestinal homeostasis and protects against aberrant inflammatory responses. Mucosal CD103+ dendritic cells are able to produce retinoic acid from retinal, however their role in vivo and how they are influenced by specific microbial species has been poorly described. Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (B. infantis) feeding to mice resulted in increased numbers of CD103+retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH)+ dendritic cells within the lamina propria (LP). Foxp3+ lymphocytes were also increased in the LP, while TH1 and TH17 subsets were decreased. 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (citral) treatment of mice blocked the increase in CD103+RALDH+ dendritic cells and the decrease in TH1 and TH17 lymphocytes, but not the increase in Foxp3+ lymphocytes. B. infantis reduced the severity of DSS-induced colitis, associated with decreased TH1 and TH17 cells within the LP. Citral treatment confirmed that these effects were RALDH mediated. RALDH+ dendritic cells decreased within the LP of control inflamed animals, while RALDH+ dendritic cells numbers were maintained in the LP of B. infantis-fed mice. Thus, CD103+RALDH+ LP dendritic cells are important cellular targets for microbiota-associated effects on mucosal immunoregulation.",

Colitis was induced by administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. Before colitis induction, mice were fed high dose B. infantis for 3 wk. Cytokine profiles in MLNs and histological changes of colonic tissue were examined 6 d after colitis induction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant change in cytokine profiles was observed in normal mice fed low dose B. infantis. However, Th1-related cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p40), Th17-related transcription factor and cytokines (ROR\u03b3t, IL-21, IL-23), regulatory T cell (Treg)-related transcription factor and cytokines (Foxp3, IL-10) were increased in normal mice fed high dose B. infantis. Furthermore, flow cytometry assay showed B. infantis increased the numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs and Th17 cells in MLNs. Colitis was successfully induced by TNBS in mice, characterized by colonic inflammation and aberrant Th1 and Th17 responses. Feeding high dose B. infantis for 3 wk before colitis induction decreased the inflammatory cell infiltration and goblet cell depletion and restored the intestinal epithelium. In addition, B. infantis feeding reduced Th1-related cytokines (T-bet, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) and Th17-related cytokines (IL-12p40, ROR\u03b3t, IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-23), and increased Treg-related molecules (Foxp3, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2) in colitis mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nB. infantis effectively attenuates TNBS-induced colitis by decreasing Th1 and Th17 responses and increasing Foxp3(+) Treg response in the colonic mucosa.",

        "abstract": "Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play important role in regulation of immune responses to self-antigens. Alterations in frequency and function of Tregs have been reported in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) subjects. Tregs have the potential to prevent destruction of pancreatic beta cells by targeting effector T-cells (Teff) and other immune cells causing inflammation. Therefore, strategies to increase Treg cell numbers and function are being explored as potential immunotherapeutic approaches in treating T1D. Today, several groups are involved in exploring different Treg cell types, sources, induction procedures and experimental systems in pursuit of generation of highly efficacious and stable Tregs for their clinical applications. Various protocols have been developed for the induction and expansion of islet antigen specific Tregs and polyclonal Tregs. Studies have shown that antigen specific Tregs are required at less number and are more efficient than polyclonal Tregs in suppressing autoimmune diabetes and they do not cause generalized immune suppression. Alternatively, generation of colonic Tregs (cTregs) has also gathered attention in recent years as an approach to limit pancreatic inflammation via gut induced tolerance. With a definitive treatment for T1D still elusive, application of Tregs as a part of combination therapy seems promising in treatment of T1D.",
