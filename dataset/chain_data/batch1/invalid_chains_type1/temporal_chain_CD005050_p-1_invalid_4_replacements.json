        "abstract": "AIMS\nTo evaluate the effect of influenza vaccination on the coronary events in patients with confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. We included 658 optimally treated CAD patients; 477 men, mean age 59.9+/-10.3 years. Three hundred and twenty-five patients received the influenza vaccine, and 333 patients placebo. Median follow-up was 298 (interquartile range 263-317) days. Primary endpoint was the cardiovascular death. Its estimated 12-month cumulative event rate was 0.63% in the vaccine vs. 0.76% in controls (HR 1.06 95% CI: 0.15-7.56, P = 0.95). There were two secondary composite endpoints: (i) the MACE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization) tended to occur less frequently in the vaccine group vs. placebo with the event rate 3.00 and 5.87%, respectively (HR 0.54;95% CI: 0.24-1.21, P = 0.13). (ii) Coronary ischaemic event (MACE or hospitalization for myocardial ischaemia) estimated 12-month event rate was significantly lower in the vaccine group 6.02 vs. 9.97% in controls (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.29-0.99, P = 0.047).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn optimally treated CAD patients influenza vaccination improves the clinical course of CAD and reduces the frequency of coronary ischaemic events. Large-scale studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular mortality. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 00371098).",

        "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the acceptance of pandemic influenza A 2009 vaccination in our high risk children with chronic renal diseases. . A total of 64 children/parents of pediatric nephrology department were approached to fill in a standardised questionnaire on influenza immunization profile. The H1N1 vaccination rates were 57.1% for transplant recipients, 61.5% for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), 36.4% for patients with various stages of chronic renal disease (CRD) and 26.7% for patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) on immunosuppressive therapy. Children on renal transplantation or PD had a fourfold higher rate of being vaccinated than children with GN (p=0.04). Causes of denying vaccination included fear of adverse effects (48.9%), lack of sufficient data on the new vaccine (31.9%) and others (19.2%). Patients being vaccinated were all urged by their pediatric nephrologist (100%), while patients not vaccinated were negatively influenced by media (41.4%), friends (24.1%), pediatrician (20.7%) and others (13.8%). Regarding parents education, higher level was associated with increased rate of children vaccination (p=0.04). It seems that patients with severe renal disease had better compliance with vaccination. The pediatric nephrologists had the most significant positive influence in contrast to the media which had the most negative influence.",

        "title": "Influenza vaccination in patients with end-stage renal disease",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are considered at higher risk of influenza-related complications and are listed worldwide among the subjects for whom yearly influenza vaccination is strongly recommended. However, influenza vaccination coverage of patients with ESRD is significantly lower than desired. Areas covered: This paper explores why compliance with official recommendations for influenza vaccination is poor in patients with ESRD and analyzes the true risk of infection as well as the immunogenicity, the effectiveness and the safety of influenza vaccination in these patients. Expert opinion: Epidemiological and clinical data support the importance of influenza in conditioning clinical deterioration of patients with ESRD, particularly in relation to their level of immunosuppression. However, the variable levels of immunodeficiency detected in patients with ESRD may reduce the immune response to influenza vaccination, which appears to be lower than that usually found in healthy subjects. However, few studies are available, and they are difficult to compare for several reasons. Additionally, limited data have been collected on influenza vaccine effectiveness, although the available studies support positive results of vaccination on outcomes of severe disease. Despite such limitations, it is important to highlight that all the available studies have confirmed the good safety and tolerability of inactivated influenza vaccines. These findings, together with the risks associated with influenza in these patients, support annual influenza vaccination in patients with ESRD as well as vaccination of their close contacts and should be presented in educational programs organized for nephrologists and patient associations.",

        "abstract": "A broad T cell receptor (TCR-) repertoire is required for an effective immune response. TCR-repertoire diversity declines with age. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have a prematurely aged T cell system which is associated with defective T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we showed that ESRD may significantly skew the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire. Here, we assessed the impact of ESRD on the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire within different T cell subsets using a multiparameter flow-cytometry-based assay, controlling for effects of aging and CMV latency. Percentages of 24 different TCR V\u03b2-families were tested in circulating naive and memory T cell subsets of 10 ESRD patients and 10 age- and CMV-serostatus-matched healthy individuals (HI). The Gini-index, a parameter used in economics to describe the distribution of income, was calculated to determine the extent of skewing at the subset level taking into account frequencies of all 24 TCR V\u03b2-families. In addition, using HI as reference population, the differential impact of ESRD was assessed on clonal expansion at the level of an individual TCR V\u03b2-family. CD8+, but not CD4+, T cell differentiation was associated with higher Gini-TCR indices. Gini-TCR indices were already significantly higher for different CD8+ memory T cell subsets of younger ESRD patients compared to their age-matched HI. ESRD induced expansions of not one TCR V\u03b2-family in particular and expansions were predominantly observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment. All ESRD patients had expanded TCR V\u03b2-families within total CD8+ T cells and the median (IQ range) number of expanded TCR V\u03b2-families/patient amounted to 2 (1\u20134). Interestingly, ESRD also induced clonal expansions of TCR V\u03b2-families within naive CD8+ T cells as 8 out of 10 patients had expanded TCR V\u03b2-families. The median (IQ range) number of expanded families/patient amounted to 1 (1\u20131) within naive CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, loss of renal function skews the TCR V\u03b2-repertoire already in younger patients by inducing expansions of different TCR V\u03b2-families within the various T cell subsets, primarily affecting the CD8+ T cell compartment. This skewed TCR V\u03b2-repertoire may be associated with a less broad and diverse T cell-mediated immunity.",

        "abstract": "Regardless of the primary disease responsible for kidney failure, patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) have in common multiple impairments of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, the pathophysiology of which has long remained enigmatic. CKD-associated immune dysfunction includes chronic low-grade activation of monocytes and neutrophils, which induces endothelial damage and increases cardiovascular risk. Although innate immune effectors are activated during CKD, their anti-bacterial capacity is impaired, leading to increased susceptibility to extracellular bacterial infections. Finally, CKD patients are also characterized by profound alterations of cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses, which account for an increased risk for malignancies and viral infections. This review summarizes the recent emerging data that link the pathophysiology of CKD-associated immune dysfunctions with the accumulation of microbiota-derived metabolites, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, the two best characterized protein-bound uremic retention solutes.",

        "abstract": "One year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it has become clear that some groups of individuals are at particular high risk of a complicated course of infection resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Two specific risk factors are most prominent, old age and the presence of co-morbidity. Recent studies have shown that patients with compromised renal function, especially those treated with renal replacement therapy or having received a kidney transplant are at a much higher risk for severe COVID infection and increased mortality. This may be in part due to the increased prevalence of co-morbid conditions in these patients but specific alterations in their immune system, reflecting premature immunological aging, may be equally important. In this review the different aspects, in particular thymus function and memory T cell expansion, of uremia-associated immunological aging are reviewed with respect to COVID 19 infection. In essence, the decreased generation of na\u00efve T cells may be instrumental in suboptimal anti-viral immune responses while the relatively uncontrolled expansion of effector T cells may facilitate the feared phase of the COVID-19 infection with excessive and live-threatening inflammation of the lung parenchyma.",

        "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes with potent antitumor functions and, consequently, several NK cell-based strategies have been developed for cancer immunotherapy. A remarkable therapeutic approach is the adoptive transfer of NK cells stimulated with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18. This cytokine stimulation endows NK cells with properties that resemble immunological memory and, for this reason, they are known as cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells. Very promising results have been reported in clinical trials and yet, there are still unknown aspects of CIML NK cells. Here, we have conducted a preliminary study of their mitochondrial dynamics. Our results show that upon IL-12/15/18 stimulation the viability of NK cells decreased and an increment in mitochondrial superoxide levels was observed. In addition, we found that mitochondria appeared slightly elongated and their cristae density decreased following IL-12/15/18 stimulation, possibly in a process mediated by the low levels of optic atrophy type 1 (OPA1) protein. Interestingly, although mitophagy was slightly impaired, an increase in autophagic flux was observed, which might explain the reduced viability and the accumulation of unfit mitochondria. Our findings could be of relevance in order to design new strategies intended to improve the mitochondrial fitness of IL-12/15/18-stimulated NK cells with the aim of improving their therapeutic efficacy.",
