        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

Synovial hyperplasia was compared in SEB-injected V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA), anti-V beta 8 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, and in V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after injection of a non-V beta 8-reactive superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt day 30, increased synovial cells were observed in all SEB-treated mice, but the increase was greatest in the V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nType B fibroblastic synoviocytes are abundant in inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and can secrete cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether cell lines derived from RA type B synoviocytes could also serve as accessory cells for T lymphocyte activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCells from RA synoviocyte lines, with or without preculture in interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), were cultured with purified peripheral blood T cells, in the presence or absence of superantigens or other accessory cell-dependent T cell mitogens. T cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation, and synoviocyte surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA type B synoviocyte lines were potent accessory cells for T cell responses to bacterial superantigens or lectins, and direct cell-cell contact was required. Preculture in IFN gamma augmented synoviocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and of ligands for some T cell costimulatory receptors, but synoviocyte accessory cell function was evident even in the absence of IFN gamma. Blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies supported the notion of a role CD2, CD11a/CD18 and MHC class II molecules in synoviocyte-dependent T cell activation. Monoclonal antibodies against IFN gamma, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha failed to block the T cell proliferative responses, but anti-IL-2 was strongly inhibitory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCultured RA and type B synoviocytes can perform some of the functions of professional antigen-presenting cells. If such cells have similar properties in vivo, they may be important participants in activation of immune responses, in addition to their previously described synthetic and proinflammatory roles. If RA synovial tissue T cells, like normal peripheral blood T cells, can respond to superantigens presented by synoviocytes, this interaction could be important in the pathogenesis of RA.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

It were constructed that M1-RNA with guide sequences (GS) recognizing the 452, 3408 site of CIITA by PCR from pTK117 plasmid, then were cloned into the EcoRI/Bg/II or EcoR//SalIsite of vector psNAV (osNAV-M1-452-GS, psNAV-M1-3408-GS) respectively. The target mould plate (3176-3560) of CIITA was obtained from Raji cell by RT-PCR, and then inserted into the XhoI/EcoRIof pGEM-7zf(+) plasmid (pGEM-3176). These recombinant plasmids were screened out by sequence analysis. psNAV-M 1-452-GS, psNAV-M1-3408-GS and its target RNA pGEM-3176 were transcribed and then mixed up and incubated in vitro. It showed that M1-3408-GS could exclusively cleave target RNA that formed a base pair with the GS. Stable transfectants of hepatocyte cell line with psNAVl-M1-3408-GS were tested for expression of class \u2161 MHC through FCM, for mRNA abundance of MHCII, Ii and CIITA by RTPCR., for the level of IL-2 mRNA on T cell by mixed lymphocyte reaction.RESULTS: When induced with recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), the expression of HLA-DR, -DP,-DQ on psNAV-M1-3408-GS+ hepatocyte was reduced 83.27 %, 88.93 %, 58.82 % respectively, the mRNA contents of CIITA, HLA-DR, -DP, -DQ and Ii decreased significantly.While T cell expressed less IL-2 mRNA in the case of psNAV-M1-3408-GS+ hepatocyte.CONCLUSION: The Ribonuclease P against CIITA-M1-3408-GS could effectively induce antigen-specific tolerance through cleaving CIITA. These results provided insight into the future application of M1-3408-GS as a new nucleic acid drug against allo-transplantation rejection and autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins are important for the initiation of immune responses and are essential for specific recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system. Regulation of class II MHC expression primarily occurs at the transcriptional level. The class II transactivator protein is the master regulator that is essential for both constitutive and interferon-gamma-inducible class II MHC expression. Estrogen [17beta-estradiol (17beta-E2)] has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we show that 17beta-E2 down-regulates interferon-gamma inducible class II MHC protein levels on brain endothelial cells, as well as other cell types (astrocytes, fibrosacroma cells, macrophages). The inhibitory effects of 17beta-E2 on class II MHC expression are not due to changes in class II transactivator mRNA or protein levels, rather, 17beta-E2 mediates inhibition at the level of class II MHC gene expression. We demonstrate that 17beta-E2 attenuates H3 and H4 histone acetylation and cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein association with the class II MHC promoter, suggesting that 17beta-E2 inhibits class II MHC expression by a novel mechanism involving modification of the histone acetylation status of the class II MHC promoter.",

        "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

        "abstract": "Down-regulation of the KAI1 (CD82) metastasis suppressor is common in advanced human cancer, but underlying mechanism(s) regulating KAI1 expression are only now being elucidated. Recent data provide evidence that low levels of KAI1 mRNA in LNCaP cells are caused by binding of beta-catenin/Reptin complexes to a specific motif in the proximal promoter, which prevents binding of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to the same motif, thus inhibiting transcription. Here, we explored a pathway by which phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) up-regulates KAI1 transcription in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Pretreatment with specific inhibitors showed that induction of KAI1 by PMA uses classic isoforms of protein kinase C (cPKC), is independent of Ras and Raf, and requires activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but does not involve p38MAPK. Induction of KAI1 transcription by PMA was associated with enhanced overall acetylation of histones H3 and H4, but only acetylation of H3 was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that PMA induces recruitment of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to NFkappaB-p50 motifs in the proximal promoter, and this was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. These changes were not associated with differences in overall levels of Tip60, Pontin, beta-catenin, or Reptin protein expression but with PMA-induced nuclear translocation of Tip60.",

        "abstract": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are found to be accompanied with innate immunity dysregulation including abnormally macrophage activation. But the functional polarization of the activated macrophages and its underlying molecular mechanism during the pathogenesis of SLE remains unknown. As an important local cellular interaction mechanism responsible for cell fate determination, Notch signaling is reported to exert crucial functions in the development and differentiation of various immunocytes, whereas its role in macrophage polarization is not fully understood. In this study, in the SLE murine model generated by immunization with activated lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA), infiltrated macrophages in the nephritic tissues were found to exhibit activation and M2b functional polarization. Notch1 signaling activity was significantly upregulated in the ALD-DNA\u2013induced M2b macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ALD-DNA\u2013induced M2b polarization was found to be dependent on enhanced Notch1 signaling through accelerating NF-\u03baB p50 translocation into the nucleus mediated by PI3K and MAPK pathways. Moreover, blockade of Notch1 signaling with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor treatment before or after the disease initiation could ameliorate murine lupus through impeding macrophage M2b polarization. Our results implied that Notch1 signaling-dependent macrophage M2b polarization might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE, which could provide Notch1 signaling blockade as a potential therapeutic approach for SLE disease.",

        "title": "Macrophage Differentiation and Polarization via Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/Akt\u2013ERK Signaling Pathway Conferred by Serum Amyloid P Component",
        "abstract": "Macrophage differentiation and polarization is influenced by, and act on, many processes associated with autoimmunity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage polarization in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remain largely debated. We previously demonstrated that macrophage M2b polarization conferred by activated lymphocyte-derived (ALD)-DNA immunization could initiate and propagate murine lupus nephritis. Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a conserved acute-phase protein in mice, has been reported to bind to DNA and modulate immune responses. In this study, murine SAP was shown to promote macrophage-mediated ALD-DNA uptake through binding to ALD-DNA (SAP/ALD-DNA). Moreover, macrophage phenotypic switch from a proinflammatory M2b phenotype induced by ALD-DNA alone to an anti-inflammatory M2a phenotype stimulated with SAP/ALD-DNA were found because of PI3K/Akt\u2013ERK signaling activation. Both in vivo SAP supplements and adoptive transfer of ex vivo programmed M2a macrophages induced by SAP/ALD-DNA into SLE mice could efficiently alleviate lupus nephritis. Importantly, increased IL-10 secretion, accompanied by anti-inflammatory effect exerted by M2a macrophages, was found to predominantly impede macrophage M2b polarization. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-10 notably reduced the suppressive effect of M2a macrophages. Our results demonstrate that binding of SAP to ALD-DNA could switch macrophage phenotypic polarization from proinflammatory M2b to anti-inflammatory M2a via PI3K/Akt\u2013ERK signaling activation, thus exerting protective and therapeutic interventions on murine lupus nephritis. These data provide a possible molecular mechanism responsible for modulation of macrophage polarization in the context of lupus nephritis and open a new potential therapeutic avenue for SLE.",

        "abstract": "Background: Macrophage M2b polarization conferred by self-DNA immunization initiates and propagates lupus nephritis. Results: Knockdown of DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) ameliorates SLE syndrome via blunting macrophage M2b polarization. Conclusion: DAI functions as a DNA sensor in self-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization and lupus nephritis. Significance: We disclose the mechanism by which self-DNA induces macrophage M2b polarization and lupus nephritis. DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) functions as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that activates the innate immune system. We previously found that activated lymphocyte-derived self-apoptotic DNA (ALD-DNA) immunization led to pathological macrophage activation and M2b polarization, which could initiate and propagate murine lupus nephritis. However, the specific DNA sensor(s) as well as underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease remains unknown. In this study, we reported that DAI expression was significantly increased in SLE patients as well as in lupus mice. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that DAI was involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage activation and M2b polarization. Moreover, ALD-DNA notably induced dimerization/oligomerization of DAI and consequently activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathways via calcium signaling, resulting in macrophage activation and M2b polarization. More importantly, blockade of DAI in vivo or selective knockdown of DAI in macrophages could ameliorate SLE syndrome via blunting macrophage M2b polarization and inhibiting inflammatory response in lupus mice. Our results suggest that DAI could function as a DNA sensor and a regulator in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization and lupus nephritis, providing the possible molecular mechanisms involved in ALD-DNA-induced macrophage M2b polarization in SLE disease and making DAI as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SLE.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondria present a unique set of key intracellular functions such as ATP synthesis, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ buffering. Mitochondria both encode and decode Ca2+ signals and these interrelated functions have a direct impact on cell signaling and metabolism. High proliferative potential is a key energy-demanding feature shared by cancer cells and activated T lymphocytes. Switch of a metabolic state mediated by alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis plays a fundamental role in maintenance of the proliferative state. Recent studies show that tumor suppressors have the ability to affect mitochondrial homeostasis controlling both cancer and autoimmunity. Herein, we discuss established and putative mechanisms of calcium\u2013dependent regulation of both T cell and tumor cell activities. We use the mitochondrial protein Fus1 as a case of tumor suppressor that controls immune response and tumor growth via maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. We focus on the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling as a key function of Fus1 and highlight the mechanisms of a crosstalk between Ca2+ accumulation and mitochondrial homeostasis. Given the important role of Ca2+ signaling, mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and ROS production in the activation of NFAT and NF-\u03baB transcription factors, we outline the importance of Fus1 activities in this context.",

        "abstract": "A healthy immune system results from a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that allow effective responses to acute insults, without descending into chronic inflammation. Failed homeostasis is characteristic of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Although HMGB1 induces proinflammatory M1-like macrophage differentiation, we describe a mechanism by which C1q modulates this activity and collaborates with HMGB1 to induce the differentiation of monocytes to anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages. These anti-inflammatory macrophages are unresponsive to dendritic cell induction factors, effectively removing them from participation in an adaptive immune response. This pathway is mediated through a complex with RAGE and LAIR-1 and depends on relative levels of C1q and HMGB1. Importantly, these data provide insight into a homeostatic mechanism in which C1q and HMGB1 can cooperate to terminate inflammation, and which may be impaired in C1q-deficient patients with autoimmune disease.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that promotes inflammation when released extracellularly after cellular activation, stress, damage or death. HMGB1 operates as one of the most intriguing molecules in inflammatory disorders via recently elucidated signal and molecular transport mechanisms. Treatments based on antagonists specifically targeting extracellular HMGB1 have generated encouraging results in a wide number of experimental models of infectious and sterile inflammation. Clinical studies are still to come. Areas covered: We here summarize recent advances regarding pathways for extracellular HMGB1 release, receptor usage, and functional consequences of post-translational modifications. The review also addresses results of preclinical HMGB1-targeted therapy studies in multiple inflammatory conditions and outlines the current status of emerging clinical HMGB1-specific antagonists. Expert opinion: Blocking excessive amounts of extracellular HMGB1, particularly the disulfide isoform, offers an attractive clinical opportunity to ameliorate systemic inflammatory diseases. Therapeutic interventions to regulate intracellular HMGB1 biology must still await a deeper understanding of intracellular HMGB1 functions. Future work is needed to create more robust assays to evaluate functional bioactivity of HMGB1 antagonists. Forthcoming clinical studies would also greatly benefit from a development of antibody-based assays to quantify HMGB1 redox isoforms, presently assessed by mass spectrometry methods.",

        "abstract": "Key Points ApoE was found in complex with C4d in RA patient SF. Deposited ApoE activates complement whereas ApoE in solution is inhibitory. Posttranslational modifications alter ApoE's capacity to bind FH and C4BP. We identified apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as one of the proteins that are found in complex with complement component C4d in pooled synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Immobilized human ApoE activated both the classical and the alternative complement pathways. In contrast, ApoE in solution demonstrated an isoform-dependent inhibition of hemolysis and complement deposition at the level of sC5b-9. Using electron microscopy imaging, we confirmed that ApoE interacts differently with C1q depending on its context; surface-bound ApoE predominantly bound C1q globular heads, whereas ApoE in a solution favored the hinge/stalk region of C1q. As a model for the lipidated state of ApoE in lipoprotein particles, we incorporated ApoE into phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes and found that the presence of ApoE on liposomes increased deposition of C1q and C4b from serum when analyzed using flow cytometry. In addition, posttranslational modifications associated with RA, such as citrullination and oxidation, reduced C4b deposition, whereas carbamylation enhanced C4b deposition on immobilized ApoE. Posttranslational modification of ApoE did not alter C1q interaction but affected binding of complement inhibitors factor H and C4b-binding protein. This suggests that changed ability of C4b to deposit on modified ApoE may play an important role. Our data show that posttranslational modifications of ApoE alter its interactions with complement. Moreover, ApoE may play different roles in the body depending on its solubility, and in diseased states such as RA, deposited ApoE may induce local complement activation rather than exert its typical role of inhibition.",

Yet, the verdict is still out on the definitive role of P. copri in human health, and on the effect of different diets on its relative abundance in the gut microbiome. The puzzling discrepancies among P. copri studies have only recently been attributed to the diversity of its strains, which substantially differ in their encoded metabolic patterns from the commonly used reference strain. However, such strain differences cannot be resolved by common 16S rRNA amplicon profiling methods. Here, we scrutinize P. copri, its versatile metabolic potential, and the hypotheses behind the conflicting observations on its association with diet and human health.
