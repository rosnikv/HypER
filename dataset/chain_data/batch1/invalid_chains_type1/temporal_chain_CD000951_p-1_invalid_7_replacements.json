        "title": "Supplementation with Folic Acid during Methotrexate Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "The folic acid antagonist methotrexate (n-10-methyl-aminopterin) is useful in low doses (2.5 to 20 mg/wk) for treating chronic inflammatory diseases [1-7]. Many trials have established the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis [7-13]. Compared with other disease-modifying drugs, methotrexate has the highest probability of drug continuation at 10 years. Dose response-related toxic effects have been reported in 30% to 90% of patients given methotrexate [13]. Toxic effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic abnormalities, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity [14-22]. Some side effects of methotrexate administration, such as gastrointestinal intolerance, mimic complicated folate deficiency [23]. Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; further, folate stores are decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate, suggesting that impaired folate status is related to toxicity [24-26]. Folic acid supplementation has been reported anecdotally to lessen toxicity in patients receiving methotrexate treatment [27, 28]. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7 mg of folic acid weekly (1 mg/d or 2265 nmol/d) decreased methotrexate toxicity without affecting efficacy [29]. This was confirmed by Stewart and colleagues [30] in a retrospective chart review. Folinic acid (leucovorin, citrovorum factor) is a one-carbon-substituted, fully reduced folate that has also been administered during methotrexate therapy [31-36]. Low doses of the vitamin (1 to 7 mg/wk) have decreased methotrexate toxicity [35, 36]. Higher doses negate efficacy and lessen toxicity [31, 32]. Thus, the folinic acid dose may critically affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The influence of the folic acid dose on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy remains controversial, and the effects of different doses of folic acid are not known [37, 38]. Some investigators argue that if toxic effects occur, the most rational approach is to reduce the dose of methotrexate rather than to provide folic acid supplements [37]. We designed a larger and longer study to evaluate different doses of folic acid, assuming that toxicity could be reduced without changing the efficacy of methotrexate. Methods Participants Patients aged 19 to 78 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology's revised criteria for rheumatoid arthritis consented to participate in the trial [39]. Enrollment criteria included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed more than 6 months previously, onset after the age of 16 years, and at least three of the following signs or symptoms: 3 or more swollen joints, 6 or more tender joints, at least 45 minutes of morning stiffness, and a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h. Referring rheumatologists and the principal investigator did the screening. Exclusion criteria included serious concomitant medical illnesses, liver enzyme levels twice the upper limit of normal, leukocyte counts less than 3.5 109/L or platelet counts less than 150 109/L, and use of methotrexate within the past 6 months. Gold salts were stopped for at least 10 days before the trial. This short washout period mirrors actual rheumatology practice. Patients remained under the care of their rheumatologists, abstained from alcohol use, did not become pregnant, and received stable doses of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If prednisone was taken at entry, the dose could not exceed 10 mg/d. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was allowed during the study. Study Design Figure 1 shows the trial design. To maintain the double-blind status of the trial, the statistician carried out the randomization using a computer program in which the algorithm was transparent and a coded vial number represented the treatment assignment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups by a sequential treatment assignment process designed to balance the sample with respect to baseline features, including age, sex, folate-containing vitamin use, rheumatoid factor status, and prednisone use [40]. Patients agreed to discontinue therapy with folate-containing vitamins during the trial. Rheumatoid factor was considered positive if the level was more than 30 IU/mL or if the titer was more than 1:160. Patients received either visually identical placebo or 5 mg (low-dose folic acid group) or 27.5 mg folic acid (high-dose folic acid group) each week, prepared by the Hospital Investigational Drug Service. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the mean SD folic acid content was 1 0.15 mg (2.3 0.3 mol) and 5.5 0.3 mg (12.5 0.7 mol) per capsule in the low-dose and high-dose folic acid groups, respectively. Lederle Laboratories provided the methotrexate (Rheumatrex; Pearl River, New York), which was started in a median oral dose of 16.5 mol (7.5 mg) per week and increased in 5.5-mol (2.5 mg) increments at the rheumatologist's discretion. Methotrexate was taken either in an undivided or a divided dose (that is, every 12 hours for three doses). The methotrexate dosing regimens were identical among the study groups. Folic acid supplements were given 5 days per week when methotrexate was not ingested. Compliance with the regimen was reinforced using a digital reminder cap (Counter Cap; Senetics, Boulder, Colorado). All participants and investigators were blinded to vitamin capsule content until the study was complete. Figure 1. Study design for the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical Assessment Patients were evaluated immediately before methotrexate initiation at a mean of 13, 26, 39, and 53 weeks (Figure 1). Each patient was assessed by the same physician-nutritionist (SLM). Two research assistants (JSA or WHV) did the joint evaluations. In most cases, patients were examined by the same observer throughout the study. The joint counts for tenderness and swelling were not significantly different between the two observers (P = 0.6 for tenderness; P = 0.9 for swelling). The following variables were evaluated at each visit: 1) number of the 58 diarthrodial joints with swelling; 2) number of the 60 joints with tenderness on pressure or with pain on passive motion (or both); 3) joint swelling and tenderness indices, expressed as a sum, with each joint graded for swelling as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 [severe]; 4) mean grip strength (three measurements) for both hands expressed in mm Hg; 5) duration of morning stiffness expressed in hours; 6) patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity graded as 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (very severe); 7) current medications and doses; 8) a 1-day dietary recall using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software, Food Database version 6A, Nutrient Database version F21 [41]; 9) eight activities of daily living assessed and averaged at baseline and at 12 months using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and scored on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) [42]; and 10) presence, duration, intensity, and severity of toxic effects at every follow-up visit and every 3 weeks by telephone interview (done by SLM). Laboratory Assessments At the initial visit, complete blood cell count, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzyme (aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase), rheumatoid factor by nephelometry, and serum creatinine values were obtained. The complete blood cell count, creatinine, and liver function tests were repeated at all visits. If laboratory values were obtained more frequently than stipulated in the protocol, they were recorded and became part of the toxicity score. Blood for plasma and erythrocyte folate levels, using a methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay, was drawn at all visits [43]. At baseline, blood was drawn for a vitamin panel (plasma and erythrocyte folate, vitamins B12, A, C, and E, carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, pyridoxine) [44-51]. If patients had abnormal values for any of the vitamins, other than folate, the abnormality was treated with single vitamin supplements. Radiographic Assessment Hand and wrist radiographs taken within 6 months of entering the trial were assessed by one of the rheumatologists (GSA) without knowledge of study status. Joint erosions and space narrowing were determined by the modified method of Sharp [52]. Results were expressed as the mean raw scores for joint erosion and joint space narrowing. Toxicity: Frequency and Severity Toxic effects and discontinuation of therapy with study medications due to toxicity were considered primary outcomes. We determined a toxicity score, modified from the one previously used, for each patient at each visit or until methotrexate therapy was discontinued [29] (Appendix). Efficacy We determined patient response to treatment using a modification of the criteria used in our previous folic acid supplementation trial and by others [8, 29, 53]. We defined marked improvement in the joint swelling index and the joint tenderness and pain index as a net decrease of 50% or more in value at any follow-up visit compared with visit 1. We defined moderate improvement as a 30% to 49% net decrease in the index, and no change as the index value remaining within 30% of the original value. We defined worsening as an increase in the index value of 30% or more. We examined the effects of folic acid supplementation on changes in physician and patient global assessments, grip strength, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, findings of the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, complete blood cell counts, blood folate levels, and dietary folate and vitamin B12 intake.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Methotrexate is currently used as a treatment for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. This study sought to evaluate the hepatic effects of long-term methotrexate therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to determine whether the established guidelines for monitoring methotrexate-related hepatotoxicity with surveillance liver biopsy in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis are applicable to these patients.METHODS:Thirty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving cumulative methotrexate doses of \u22651500 mg were studied. Liver chemistry tests were obtained before and during therapy. Twenty patients underwent liver biopsies as recommended for methotrexate-treated patients with psoriasis; the biopsies were reviewed and graded according to Roenigk's criteria for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity (a grading system for methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis patients) by a liver pathologist blinded to the methotrexate dose.RESULTS:In patients who had liver biopsies, the mean cumulative methotrexate dose was 2633 mg (range, 1500\u20135410 mg), given for a mean of 131.7 wk (range, 66\u2013281 wk). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had mild histological abnormalities (Roenigk's grade I and II), and one patient had hepatic fibrosis (Roenigk's grade IIIB). Abnormal liver chemistry tests, present in 6 of 20 (30%) patients, did not identify the patient with Roenigk's grade IIIB hepatotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS:Cumulative methotrexate doses up to 5410 mg given up to 281 wk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are associated with little hepatotoxicity. Surveillance liver biopsies based on cumulative methotrexate doses are not warranted in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review This review will outline the current management of Crohn disease and highlight the knowledge gained from published studies and abstracts in the year 2003. Recent findings The year 2003 was highlighted by further knowledge on the use of biologic therapy in Crohn disease. Important lessons were learned from the expanding clinical experience with infliximab. Several other studies of agents targeting tumor necrosis factor-&agr; revealed mixed and sometimes disappointing results. However, this was balanced by encouraging results of several studies of biologic agents that inhibit lymphocyte trafficking. Other studies evaluated a variety of small molecules, including tacrolimus, leflutamide, and mycophenolate. Finally, controversy was raised with published studies looking at the efficacy and safety of 6-thiogunaine. Summary There appears to be an expanding array of treatment options that will become available to clinicians for the treatment of Crohn disease. New treatment paradigms have emerged for managing mild to moderate disease. Small molecules may provide alternatives for immunomodulation other than the purine antimetabolites and methotrexate. Increased understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of Crohn disease has allowed the development of novel therapeutics directed at specific molecular targets. However, as the treatment options expand, questions regarding optimal combination treatment strategies will need to be answered.",

        "abstract": "One of the promises of the human genome project is individualised pharmacological therapy. An individual\u2019s genetic type would be determined, and the resulting diseases which the person was susceptible to would be determined. In addition, the drugs to which an individual would respond well would be enumerated, and the drugs which were more likely to be toxic could be established. At present we are just beginning to determine those associations which would help us tailor an individual\u2019s pharmacological therapy so as to maximise efficacy and minimise toxicity. In this report we review the considerations involved in determining the pharmacogenetic profile of any given drug and to review the current level of understanding of the association between genetic polymorphisms and drug toxicity/efficacy in rheumatology.\n\nEstablishing an association between genetic types and toxicity is perhaps an easier task to accomplish than understanding the association between a given genetic type and drug efficacy. Drug toxicities are generally discrete events and a specific toxicity can often be traced to the agent in question. Thus, it is fairly easy to study a given population and define those with a specific drug toxicity. Nonetheless, a sufficiently large population must be studied to establish an association. Although this restates the obvious, most drugs for chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are toxic to only a modest proportion of the patients taking them otherwise they would have long ago been pulled off the market. To establish a relative risk association for a toxicity that occurs in only 5\u201310% of patients taking a given drug might require hundreds or even thousands of patients if the observed increase in risk of toxicity is modest.\n\nThere are many reasons why any given drug may fail in any given individual.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo develop a clinical pharmacogenetic model to predict the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred five patients with newly diagnosed RA and active disease were treated with MTX (initiated at a dosage of 7.5 mg/week and increased to 15 mg/week after 4 weeks) and folic acid (1 mg/day). If the Disease Activity Score (DAS) was >2.4 at 3 months, the dosage of MTX was increased up to 25 mg/week. Twenty-four baseline variables possibly influencing disease state and drug response were selected. In addition, 17 polymorphisms in 13 genes related to the MTX mechanism of action, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, were determined. Factors were compared between responders (defined as patients with a DAS < or = 2.4 at 6 months) and nonresponders. In case of differences, a stepwise selection procedure identified the predictors for response. A clinical score was designed by simplifying regression coefficients of the independent variables. Cutoff levels were chosen based on the clinical score, and positive and negative response rates were calculated. An evaluation of the model was performed in a second group of patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe model for MTX efficacy consisted of sex, rheumatoid factor and smoking status, the DAS, and 4 polymorphisms in the AMPD1, ATIC, ITPA, and MTHFD1 genes. This prediction model was transformed into a scoring system ranging from 0 to 11.5. Scores of < or = 3.5 had a true positive response rate of 95%. Scores of > or = 6 had a true negative response rate of 86%. Sixty percent of the patients were categorized as either responders or nonresponders, whereas 32% of the patients were categorized using a nongenetic model. Evaluation of the model in 38 additional patients with RA supported the results.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study established a model for predicting the efficacy of MTX in patients with RA. This pharmacogenetic model may lead to better-tailored initial treatment decisions in patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "The importance of membrane transporters for drug pharmacokinetics has been increasingly recognized during the last decade. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a genetically polymorphic influx transporter expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes, and it mediates the hepatic uptake of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Recent studies have demonstrated that OATP1B1 plays a major, clinically important role in the hepatic uptake of many drugs. A common single-nucleotide variation (coding DNA c.521T>C, protein p.V174A, rs4149056) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 decreases the transporting activity of OATP1B1, resulting in markedly increased plasma concentrations of, for example, many statins, particularly of active simvastatin acid. The variant thereby enhances the risk of statin-induced myopathy and decreases the therapeutic indexes of statins. However, the effect of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C variant is different on different statins. The same variant also markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of several other drugs. Furthermore, certain SLCO1B1 variants associated with an enhanced clearance of methotrexate increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity by methotrexate in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) potently inhibit OATP1B1, causing clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, OATP1B1 plays a major role in the hepatic uptake of drugs, and genetic variants and drug interactions affecting OATP1B1 activity are important determinants of individual drug responses. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the expression, function, substrate characteristics, and pharmacogenetics of OATP1B1 as well as its role in drug interactions, in parts comparing with those of other hepatocyte-expressed organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1.",

We then used MTA to predict the effects of a subset of inhibitors on atorvastatin uptake in vivo. Using a data set of 225 drug-like compounds, 91 OATP inhibitors were identified. In silico models indicated that lipophilicity and polar surface area are key molecular features of OATP inhibition.

        "title": "The Role of Organic Anion Transporters in Diagnosing Liver Diseases by Magnetic Resonance Imaging",
        "abstract": "The expression and transport functions of organic anion transporters are modified in liver diseases, and therefore the vascular clearances of endogenous and exogenous organic anions that are taken up by these transporters have been used to assess liver diseases in patients. More recently, liver imaging with hepatobiliary contrast agents, tracers, and dyes that cross hepatocytes through the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs)\u2013multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) pathway were developed to detect and characterize focal lesions and to assess the severity of diffuse liver diseases. This review focuses mainly on magnetic resonance imaging and highlights the growing interest in imaging the OATPs\u2013MRP2 pathway to better understand liver diseases. Imaging provides noninvasive measurements of tissue concentrations that result from the interplay between influx and efflux membrane transport systems in normal or injured hepatocytes. Imaging with magnetic resonance hepatobiliary contrast agents improves the detection and the characterization of hepatic focal lesions. New developments of imaging to assess liver function and understand the hepatocellular concentrations of contrast agents are discussed.",

        "title": "Interspecies Variability in Expression of Hepatobiliary Transporters across Human, Dog, Monkey, and Rat as Determined by Quantitative Proteomics",
        "abstract": "We quantified, by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, transporter protein expression of BSEP, MATE1, MRP3, MRP4, NTCP, and OCT1 in our human liver bank (n = 55) and determined the relationship between protein expression and sex, age and genotype. These data complement our previous work in the same liver bank where we quantified the protein expression of OATPs, BCRP, MDR1, and MRP2. In addition, we quantified and compared the interspecies differences in expression of the hepatobiliary transporters, corresponding to the above human transporters, in liver tissue and hepatocytes of male beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, Sprague-Dawley rats, and Wistar rats. In all the species, the sinusoidal OATPs/Oatps were the most abundant hepatic transporters. However, there were notable interspecies differences in the relative abundance of the remaining transporters. For example, the next most abundant transporter in humans and monkeys was OCT1/Oct1, whereas it was Mrp2 and Ntcp in dogs/Wistar rats and Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. In contrast, the protein expression of the efflux transporters BCRP/Bcrp, MDR1/Mdr1, MRP3/Mrp3, MRP4/Mrp4, and MATE1/Mate1 was much lower across all the species. For most transporters, the expression in the liver tissues was comparable to that in the unplated cryopreserved hepatocytes. These data on human liver transporter protein expression complete the picture of the expression of major human hepatobiliary transporters important in drug disposition and toxicity. In addition, the data on expression of the corresponding hepatobiliary transporters in preclinical species will be helpful in interpreting and extrapolating pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and toxicological results from preclinical studies to humans.",

        "title": "Quantification of Flavin-containing Monooxygenases 1, 3, and 5 in Human Liver Microsomes by UPLC-MRM-Based Targeted Quantitative Proteomics and Its Application to the Study of Ontogeny",
        "abstract": "Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) have a significant role in the metabolism of small molecule pharmaceuticals. Among the five human FMOs, FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5 are the most relevant to hepatic drug metabolism. Although age-dependent hepatic protein expression, based on immunoquantification, has been reported previously for FMO1 and FMO3, there is very little information on hepatic FMO5 protein expression. To overcome the limitations of immunoquantification, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based targeted quantitative proteomic method was developed and optimized for the quantification of FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5 in human liver microsomes (HLM). A post-in silico product ion screening process was incorporated to verify LC-MRM detection of potential signature peptides before their synthesis. The developed method was validated by correlating marker substrate activity and protein expression in a panel of adult individual donor HLM (age 39\u201367 years). The mean (range) protein expression of FMO3 and FMO5 was 46 (26\u201365) pmol/mg HLM protein and 27 (11.5\u201349) pmol/mg HLM protein, respectively. To demonstrate quantification of FMO1, a panel of fetal individual donor HLM (gestational age 14\u201320 weeks) was analyzed. The mean (range) FMO1 protein expression was 7.0 (4.9\u20139.7) pmol/mg HLM protein. Furthermore, the ontogenetic protein expression of FMO5 was evaluated in fetal, pediatric, and adult HLM. The quantification of FMO proteins also was compared using two different calibration standards, recombinant proteins versus synthetic signature peptides, to assess the ratio between holoprotein versus total protein. In conclusion, a UPLC-MRM-based targeted quantitative proteomic method has been developed for the quantification of FMO enzymes in HLM.",

        "abstract": "Drug transporters play an essential role in disposition and effects of multiple drugs. Plasma concentrations of the victim drug can be modified by drug\u2013drug interactions occurring in enterocytes (e.g., P\u2010glycoprotein), hepatocytes (e.g., organic anion\u2010transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1)), and/or renal proximal tubular cells (e.g., organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2)/multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 and 2\u2010K (MATE1/MATE2\u2010K)). In addition, transporter\u2010mediated drug\u2013drug interactions can cause altered local tissue concentrations and possibly altered effects/toxicity (e.g., in liver and kidneys). During drug development, there is now an intensive in vitro screening of new molecular entities as transporter substrates and inhibitors, followed if necessary by drug\u2013drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, there are still unresolved issues, which will also be discussed in this review article (e.g., the clinical significance of transporter\u2010mediated drug\u2013drug interactions of particular relevance to the elderly who are prescribed multiple drugs, with additional impaired liver or kidney function, and the extent to which medication safety in real life could be improved by a reduction of those interactions).",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is a multifactorial process. Dysbiosis and the overexpression of COX-2 and LDHA are important effectors in the initiation and development of the disease through chromosomal instability, PGE2 biosynthesis, and induction of the Warburg effect, respectively. Herein, we report the in vitro testing of some new quinoxalinone and quinazolinone Schiff\u2019s bases as: antibacterial, COX-2 and LDHA inhibitors, and anticolorectal agents on HCT-116 and LoVo cells. Moreover, molecular docking and SAR analyses were performed to identify the structural features contributing to the biological activities. Among the synthesized molecules, the most active cytotoxic agent, (6d) was also a COX-2 inhibitor. In silico ADMET studies predicted that (6d) would have high Caco-2 permeability, and %HIA (99.58%), with low BBB permeability, zero hepatotoxicity, and zero risk of sudden cardiac arrest, or mutagenicity. Further, (6d) is not a potential P-gp substrate, instead, it is a possible P-gpI and II inhibitor, therefore, it can prevent or reverse the multidrug resistance of the anticancer drugs. Collectively, (6d) can be considered as a promising lead suitable for further optimization to develop anti-CRC agents or glycoproteins inhibitors.",

        "title": "Permeability of Metformin across an In Vitro Blood\u2013Brain Barrier Model during Normoxia and Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation Conditions: Role of Organic Cation Transporters (Octs)",
        "abstract": "Our lab previously established that metformin, a first-line type two diabetes treatment, activates the Nrf2 pathway and improves post-stroke recovery. Metformin\u2019s brain permeability value and potential interaction with blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) uptake and efflux transporters are currently unknown. Metformin has been shown to be a substrate of organic cationic transporters (Octs) in the liver and kidneys. Brain endothelial cells at the BBB have been shown to express Octs; thus, we hypothesize that metformin uses Octs for its transport across the BBB. We used a co-culture model of brain endothelial cells and primary astrocytes as an in vitro BBB model to conduct permeability studies during normoxia and hypoxia using oxygen\u2013glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. Metformin was quantified using a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method. We further checked Octs protein expression using Western blot analysis. Lastly, we completed a plasma glycoprotein (P-GP) efflux assay. Our results showed that metformin is a highly permeable molecule, uses Oct1 for its transport, and does not interact with P-GP. During OGD, we found alterations in Oct1 expression and increased permeability for metformin. Additionally, we showed that selective transport is a key determinant of metformin\u2019s permeability during OGD, thus, providing a novel target for improving ischemic drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Successful neuropharmacology requires optimization of CNS drug delivery and, by extension, free drug concentrations at brain molecular targets. Detailed assessment of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) physiological characteristics is necessary to achieve this goal. The \u2018next frontier\u2019 in CNS drug delivery is targeting BBB uptake transporters, an approach that requires evaluation of brain endothelial cell transport processes so that effective drug accumulation and improved therapeutic efficacy can occur. Areas covered BBB permeability of drugs is governed by tight junction protein complexes (i.e., physical barrier) and transporters/enzymes (i.e., biochemical barrier). For most therapeutics, a component of blood-to-brain transport involves passive transcellular diffusion. Small molecule drugs that do not possess acceptable physicochemical characteristics for passive permeability may utilize putative membrane transporters for CNS uptake. While both uptake and efflux transport mechanisms are expressed at the brain microvascular endothelium, uptake transporters can be targeted for optimization of brain drug delivery and improved treatment of neurological disease states. Expert opinion Uptake transporters represent a unique opportunity to optimize brain drug delivery by leveraging the endogenous biology of the BBB. A rigorous understanding of these transporters is required to improve translation from the bench to clinical trials and stimulate the development of new treatment paradigms for neurological diseases.",
