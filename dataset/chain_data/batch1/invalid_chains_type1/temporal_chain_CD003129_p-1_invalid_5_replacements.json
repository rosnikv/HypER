        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe antimetabolite methotrexate has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be effective in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate may also be effective in children with resistant juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but the supporting data are from uncontrolled trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCenters in the United States and the Soviet Union participated in this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of orally administered methotrexate. Patients received one of the following treatments each week for six months: 10 mg of methotrexate per square meter of body-surface area (low dose), 5 mg of methotrexate per square meter (very low dose), or placebo. The use of prednisone (less than or equal to 10 mg per day) and two nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was also allowed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 127 children (mean age, 10.1 years) had a mean duration of disease of 5.1 years; 114 qualified for the analysis of efficacy. According to a composite index of several response variables, 63 percent of the children who received low-dose methotrexate improved, as compared with 32 percent of those in the very-low-dose group and 36 percent of those in the placebo group (P = 0.013). As compared with the placebo group, the low-dose group also had significantly larger mean reductions from base line in the number of joints with pain on motion (-11.0 vs. -7.1), the pain-severity score (-19 vs. -11.5), the number of joints with limited motion (-5.4 vs. -0.7), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (-19.0 vs. -6 mm per hour). In the methotrexate groups only three children had the drug discontinued because of mild-to-moderate side effects; none had severe toxicity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate given weekly in low doses is an effective treatment for children with resistant juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and at least in the short term this regimen is safe.",

        "title": "Accumulation of 5\u2010methyltetrahydrofolic acid and folylpolyglutamate synthetase expression by mitogen stimulated human lymphocytes",
        "abstract": "Summary. The accumulation of 5\u2010methyl[3H]tetrahydrofolic acid (5CH3[3H]FH4) by phytohaemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes (PHA\u2010L) cultured in folate free media was investigated to determine the mechanism of uptake of 5CH3FH4 and the requirement of the cells for this vitamin as assessed by monitoring de novo thymidine synthesis. When grown in 20 nm 5CH3[3H]FH4 PHA\u2010L accumulate radiolabel at a rate of 0\u00b704 pmol/h/106 cells. This doubles the endogenous folate pool of unstimulated cells (0\u00b76\u00b10\u00b716 pmol/106 cells) in about 15 h. Uptake proceeded via a saturable process, independent of a high affinity folate receptor as assessed by ligand binding and by Northern and Western blot analysis. However, transport was blocked by probenecid, which is consistent with an anion carrier mechanism. Unstimulated cells lacked folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity and did not express significant amounts of FPGS mRNA. After 48 h of mitogen stimulation there was a 4\u201310\u2010fold increase in FPGS mRNA and folylpolyglutamate formation (Glu\u22655) was essentially simultaneous with 5CH3[3H]FH4 transport. Increasing extracellular folate to 2\u03bcm only increased intracellular folate 8\u2010fold, but the length of the folylpolyglutamates decreased. The increased folate did not increase de novo thymidine synthesis compared to cells grown in physiological folate. We conclude that mitogen stimulation activates the process(es) for folate accumulation, especially FPGS, and that physiological uptake (0\u00b704 pmol/h/106 cells) is adequate for meeting the cells' need for the vitamin.",

        "title": "Effect of methotrexate on the temporomandibular joint and facial morphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients.",
        "abstract": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation in one or more joints; it affects children and adolescents up to 18 years of age. This disease may cause significant skeletal joint destruction, and the temporomandibular joint, like other joints, may become severely affected resulting in aberrant mandibular growth, abnormal dentofacial development, and/or altered orofacial muscle function. Methotrexate is the most common remittive agent used in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis to modify the course of inflammatory destruction of peripheral joints. The purpose of this study was: (1) to evaluate the effect of methotrexate therapy on the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and aberration in craniofacial development in children afflicted with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; (2) to further examine the relationship between the temporomandibular joint/cephalometric findings and rheumatologic data (ie, age at onset, duration of disease); and (3) to evaluate further pauciarticular- and polyarticular-onset disease in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and facial dysmorphology. The following information was obtained from 45 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: (1) routine rheumatologic clinical examination data; (2) anamnestic temporomandibular joint evaluation data; (3) clinical temporomandibular joint examination data; (4) lateral cephalometric measurement data; (5) posteroanterior cephalometric measurement data; and (6) individually corrected axial tomographic data. The results demonstrated the following: (1) radiographic evidence of condylar degeneration was apparent in 63% of all patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pauciarticular patients showing less temporomandibular involvement than polyarticular patients; (2) polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving methotrexate showed less severe temporomandibular joint involvement than the polyarticular patients not receiving methotrexate; (3) the craniofacial structure was affected to a greater extent in the polyarticular form of the disease; (4) the craniomandibular index scores were significantly greater in the polyarticular group; (5) vertical height asymmetry and chin deviation were noted in more than 50% of the patients; and (6) there was a correlation between the severity of condylar lesions and cephalometric findings (ie, mandibular retroposition, posterior rotation, smaller ramus and mandibular dimensions) and the onset and duration of the disease. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, methotrexate therapy was effective in minimizing temporomandibular joint destruction and craniofacial dysmorphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients with the polyarticular form of the disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effects of computed tomography (CT)-guided injection of corticosteroid into the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of TMJ inflammation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-three children ages 4-16 years with JIA and MRI evidence of TMJ inflammation received CT-guided TMJ injections of corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide [n = 16] or triamcinolone hexacetonide [n = 7]). Jaw pain or dysfunction and maximal incisal opening (MIO) distance were assessed before and after injection. Fourteen patients had followup MRI studies of the TMJ 6-12 months after injection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 13 patients with symptoms of jaw pain prior to corticosteroid treatment, 10 (77%) had complete resolution of pain (P < 0.05). Prior to corticosteroid injection, MIO in all 23 patients was below age-matched normal values. After injection, the MIO was improved by at least 0.5 cm in 10 patients (43%) (P = 0.0017). Patients under 6 years of age at the time of injection showed the best response, with a postinjection MIO similar to that in age-matched controls (P = 0.2267). There was involvement of 23 TMJs in the 14 patients who had followup MRI studies; resolution of effusions was observed in 11 (48%) of the TMJs. Other than short-term facial swelling in 2 patients, there were no side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe majority of children with symptomatic TMJ arthritis improved after intraarticular corticosteroid injection. Approximately half the patients experienced significant improvement in MIO and TMJ effusion. These data suggest that corticosteroid injection may be a useful procedure for the prevention and treatment of morbidities associated with TMJ arthritis in JIA.",

The management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis has improved in recent decades, and morbidity due to the disease is significantly decreased. In particular, the use of more effective drugs and their combination has changed the course of the disease in many patients. The increasing knowledge of inflammation mechanisms has lead to the development of new agents that target specific cytokines interfering with the inflammatory cascade.

        "abstract": "Objectives. To study the validity of both rheumatological and orthodontic examinations and ultrasound (US) as screening methods for early diagnosis of TMJ arthritis against the gold standard MRI. Methods. Thirty consecutive juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients were included in this pilot study. Rheumatological and orthodontic examinations as well as US were performed within 1 month of the MRI in a blinded fashion. Joint effusion and/or increased contrast enhancement of synovium or bone were considered signs of active arthritis on MRI. Results. A total of 19/30 (63%) patients and 33/60 (55%) joints had signs of TMJ involvement on MRI. This was associated with condylar deformity in 9/19 (47%) patients and 15/33 (45%) joints. Rheumatological, orthodontic and US examinations correctly diagnosed 11 (58%), 9 (47%) and 6 (33%) patients, respectively, with active TMJ arthritis, but misdiagnosed 8 (42%), 10 (53%) and 12 (67%) patients, respectively, as having no signs of inflammation. The best predictor for active arthritis on MRI was a reduced maximum mouth opening. Conclusion. None of the methods tested was able to reliably predict the presence or absence of MRI-proven inflammation in the TMJ in our cohort of JIA patients. US was the least useful of all methods tested to exclude active TMJ arthritis.",

Twenty patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and 10 healthy control subjects underwent measurement of S100A12 serum concentrations by sandwich ELISA. Temporomandibular Joints (TMJs); clinical and post contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations were performed. MRI findings were scored. Results showed that TMJ arthritis was detected in 80% of JIA patients using MRI. Serum S100A12 levels were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. Serum concentrations of S100A12 and total MRI scores were significantly higher in JIA patients with active disease compared to those without activity. Systemic and polyarticular JIA patients showed significant increase in S100A12 levels and total MRI scores compared to those with oligoarticular JIA. The MRI TMJ abnormalities revealed significant association with clinical signs of TMJ inflammation but not with symptoms. A significant correlation was found between serum S100A12 concentrations and MRI score as well as between each of them and different clinical, laboratory disease parameters. Serum S100A12 levels showed significant positive correlation with synovial enhancement score. To conclude TMJ arthritis could be detected in most cases of JIA patients using contrast enhanced MRI. Increased S100A12 levels may point to synovial inflammation. Clinical signs of TMJ arthritis may be used as filter for MRI examination. Further studies on larger scale of JIA patients are needed for monitoring TMJ inflammation and S100A12 may be a potential target of future anti-inflammatory therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background The sequencing of the human genome has opened doors for global gene expression profiling, and the immense amount of data will lay an important ground for future studies of normal and diseased tissues. The Human Protein Atlas project aims to systematically map the human gene and protein expression landscape in a multitude of normal healthy tissues as well as cancers, enabling the characterization of both housekeeping genes and genes that display a tissue-specific expression pattern. This article focuses on identifying and describing genes with an elevated expression in four lymphohematopoietic tissue types (bone marrow, lymph node, spleen and appendix), based on the Human Protein Atlas-strategy that combines high throughput transcriptomics with affinity-based proteomics. Results An enriched or enhanced expression in one or more of the lymphohematopoietic tissues, compared to other tissue-types, was seen for 693 out of 20,050 genes, and the highest levels of expression were found in bone marrow for neutrophilic and erythrocytic genes. A majority of these genes were found to constitute well-characterized genes with known functions in lymphatic or hematopoietic cells, while others are not previously studied, as exemplified by C19ORF59. Conclusions In this paper we present a strategy of combining next generation RNA-sequencing with in situ affinity-based proteomics in order to identify and describe new gene targets for further research on lymphatic or hematopoietic cells and tissues.

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Plaque formation starts with the inflammation in fatty streaks and progresses through atheroma, atheromatous plaque, and fibroatheroma leading to development of stable plaque. Hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia are the risk factors for atherosclerosis. Inflammation, infection with viruses and bacteria, and dysregulation in the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells leads to advanced plaque formation. Death of the cells in the intima due to inflammation results in secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), alarmins (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and oxidized low-density lipoproteins), and infection with pathogens leads to secretion of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acids, and peptidoglycans. DAMPs and PAMPs further activate the inflammatory surface receptors such as TREM-1 and toll-like receptors and downstream signaling kinases and transcription factors leading to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and interferon-\u03b3 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These mediators and cytokines along with MMPs render the plaque vulnerable for rupture leading to ischemic events.

Material/Methods A total of 303 patients were enrolled in this study, with 110 having acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 110 having coronary heart disease (CHD), and 83 subjects served as healthy blood donors. The concentrations of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and S100A8/A9 protein were determined in the sera of the participants and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a rat carotid artery thrombosis model and in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and the TLR-4 blocker CLI-095 were used to investigate the role of the TLR-4-MAPK-COX2 signaling axis in thrombosis. Results The levels of COX-2, TLR-4, and S100A8/A9 in the sera of patients with ACS and CHD were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P<0.05). S100A8/A9 expression was significantly correlated with TLR-4 and COX-2 in the ACS group and with TLR-4 in the CHD group. In the rat carotid thrombosis model, the expressions of TLR-4, COX-2, and p-p38 MAPK significantly increased until 14 days after thrombosis induction, whereas S100A8/A9 expression increased until day 7, but then decreased. Administration of SB203580 to rats reduced COX-2 expression in PBMCs after thrombosis induction, and incubation of HAECs with CLI-095 reduced their p-p38 MAPK and COX-2 response to S100A8/A9 stimulation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between microRNA-146b-3p (miR-146b-3p) and inflammatory factors in thrombosis. Method THP-1 cells were cultured in vitro, Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of COX-2 and p38MAPK in the cells, and real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of miRNA-146b-3p and COX-2. A lentiviral expression vector of miRNA-146b-3p and its inhibitor were constructed to transfect THP-1 cells. COX-2 and p38MAPK expression in transfected cells was detected by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Results Ang II and TNF-\u03b1 could elevate the expression of COX-2 in monocytes. The expression of COX-2 was upregulated by p38MAPK, which could be phosphorylated by Ang II, while there was an increasing tendency of p38MAPK phosphorylation after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. In addition, COX-2 expression and P38MAPK phosphorylation could be downregulated by miRNA-146b-3p and upregulated by the miRNA-146b-3p inhibitor. Ang II could increase miR-146b-3p expression, although there was no significant difference; however, the expression of miR-146b-3p was enhanced significantly by TNF-\u03b1.

We report that the reduction of miR-146b-3p expression was induced by PDGF-BB in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). The overexpression of miR-146b-3p counteracted the effects of PDGF-BB on the proliferation and migration of VSMCs and increased the expressions of differentiation markers (P < 0.05). Additionally, PIK3CG expression was negatively regulated by miR-146b-3p, and the restoration of PIK3CG partly eliminated the effects of miR-146b-3p on VSMCs (P < 0.05). In summary, miR-146b-3p represses the proliferation, migration, and phenotype switch of VSMCs induced by PDGF-BB via targeting PIK3CG. Therefore, miR-146b-3p/PIK3CG may be a potential target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Circular RNAs, a class of circularly closed non-coding RNAs, play essential roles in the formation of atherosclerosis, which is a frequent cause of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although many circular RNAs are found to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis, more circular RNA regulators still need to be identified, to improve the understanding of the regulatory networks of atherosclerosis. Here, we found that hsa_circ_0008896 was significantly up-regulated in both in vitro and in vivo atherosclerosis models, indicating hsa_circ_0008896 was involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Further functional analyses confirmed that knockdown of hsa_circ_0008896 decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs. In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and found that hsa-miR-633 could directly bind to hsa_circ_0008896, which was confirmed by RNA immune-precipitation (RIP) assays. Results of proliferation, migration, and invasion assays showed that hsa-miR-633 inhibitor reversed the si-circ_0008896 phenotypes, indicating that hsa_circ_0008896 functionally bound to hsa-miR-633. At last, combining bioinformatics and experimental analyses, we found the protein target of hsa_circ_0008896/hsa-miR-633, CDC20B (cell division cycle 20B). The expression level of CDC20B was regulated by hsa-miR-633, and knockdown of CDC20B decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs. Taken together, hsa_circ_0008896 regulated the expression of CDC20B by sponging hsa-miR-633, and then enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of VSMCs to promote the progression of atherosclerosis.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background As one of the essential hypertension (EH)-mediated target organ damage, carotid plaque is a crucial subclinical precursor for cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is vital to identify the risk factors and pathogenesis for EH with carotid plaque. Methods Based on our previous microarray analysis, we selected four circRNAs as the candidate circRNAs and detected their expression levels in blood of 192 subjects (64 healthy controls, 64 EH patients, and 64 EH patients with carotid plaque) by qRT-PCR analysis. The regulatory mechanism of circRNAs involved in carotid plaque was predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Results The level of hsa_circ_0124782 increased significantly and the levels of hsa_circ_0131618 and hsa_circ_0127342 decreased significantly in the EH group and EH with carotid plaque group compared with the control group (P < .05). Functional enrichment analysis showed that three circRNAs might be implicated in pathogenesis for carotid plaque. Conclusion Our study revealed the relationship between three circRNAs and carotid plaque, suggesting that they may serve as potential biomarkers for EH with carotid plaque.",
