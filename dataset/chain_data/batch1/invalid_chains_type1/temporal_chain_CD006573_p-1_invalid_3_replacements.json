        "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for recurrent hepatitis C after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We therefore performed two randomized, controlled trials\u2014a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial\u2014to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a in patients who had undergone OLT. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 54 patients within 3 weeks after OLT, and the treatment trial enrolled 67 patients 6 to 60 months after OLT. In each trial, patients were randomized to treatment with once weekly injections of 180 \u03bcg peginterferon alfa\u20102a or no antiviral treatment for 48 weeks and were followed up for 24 weeks thereafter. Peginterferon alfa\u20102a treated patients had significantly lower hepatitis C virus RNA levels and more favorable changes in hepatic histological features compared with untreated controls. However, only 2 treated patients in the prophylaxis trial (8%) and 3 in the treatment trial (12%) achieved a sustained virological response. In the prophylaxis trial, 8 patients (31%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 9 (32%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely; whereas in the treatment trial, 10 patients (30%) in the peginterferon alfa\u20102a group and 6 (19%) in the untreated group were withdrawn prematurely. The incidence of acute rejection was similar in the treated and untreated groups in both the prophylaxis (12% vs. 21%; P = .5) and treatment (12% vs. 0%; P = .1) trials. In conclusion, peginterferon alfa\u20102a treatment for 48 weeks is safe and tolerable and offers some efficacy in the post\u2010OLT setting. Randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients who have undergone OLT. (HEPATOLOGY 2005;41:289\u2013298.)",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThe complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease are the main indications for liver transplantation. As most patients have either never been treated, failed to respond or been unable to tolerate antiviral agents, HCV RNA is typically present pretransplantation and recurrent infection is the rule. In the medium to long term, the consequences of HCV re-infection lead to impaired survival. There is, hence, a need to develop strategies that improve outcome. This review will address the problem of recurrent HCV, emphasizing approaches to prevent/slow disease progression. Recent findingsNo prophylactic measures exist that prevent recurrence. Efforts have focused on determining which factors influence recurrent HCV to avoid those that facilitate fibrosis progression, and establish the benefits/risks of antiviral agents. Recent studies have demonstrated that the major factors implicated in disease progression are the quality of the donor and immunosuppression. In fact, in one study, outcome was improved by modifying the immunosuppression. In addition, results of antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon + ribavirin have been promising but there are still many questions unanswered regarding the \u2018who, when and with what to treat\u2019. SummaryMore rational management of immunosuppression together with improvements in antiviral therapy will likely prolong patient survival in HCV liver transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nRecurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a relevant problem of liver transplantation programs. We evaluated the effect of antiviral therapy on disease progression in 81 HCV-infected liver transplantation recipients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with mild hepatitis C recurrence (fibrosis stage F0 to F2, n = 54) were randomized to no treatment (group A, n = 27) or peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin for 48 weeks (group B, n = 27). Patients with severe recurrence (F3 to F4, cholestatic hepatitis) were treated (group C, n = 27). All patients (n = 81) underwent a liver biopsy at baseline and after follow-up; paired hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements were available in 51 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen (48%) patients of group B and 5 (18.5%) of group C achieved sustained virological response. Liver fibrosis progressed > or =1 stage in 40 (49%) of 81 patients: 19 (70%) of group A versus 7 (26%) of group B (P = .001) and in 14 (54%) of group C. HVPG increased (6.5 to 13 mm Hg, P < .01) in patients in whom fibrosis worsened, whereas it decreased (5 to 3.5 mm Hg, P = .017) or remained unchanged in those with fibrosis improvement or stabilization, respectively. The only variable independently associated with fibrosis improvement/stabilization was treatment (odds ratio [OR] =3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 10, P = .009). Among treated patients, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization and viral clearance were independently associated with histological or hemodynamic improvement/stabilization (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 18, P < .01; OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 38, P = .01; respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data demonstrate that in liver transplantation recipients, antiviral therapy slows disease progression (particularly in sustained virological responders), as shown by its effects on liver histology and on HVPG.",

        "abstract": "Pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin eradicates hepatitis C virus (HCV) in one third of liver recipients with recurrent disease. Side effects are frequent and potentially life threatening. Our aim was to define the long\u2010term benefits of antiviral therapy in recurrent HCV. Eighty\u2010nine (89) recipients (genotype 1: 86.5%) were treated with IFN (n = 31) or pegIFN (n = 58) plus ribavirin and 75 untreated contemporaneous disease\u2010matched controls. The major end point was survival from transplantation. Survival, progression to cirrhosis and clinical decompensation since start of therapy were compared between sustained virologic responders (SVRs) and nonresponders (NRs). Results revealed 44 patients died during the follow\u2010up (20% treated vs. 35% controls; p = 0.05). Patient survival was higher in treated compared to controls (7 years: 74% vs. 62%; p = 0.04). Among treated patients, an SVR was achieved in 37% (IFN 16% vs. peg\u2010IFN 48%; p = 0.03). About 2/33 SVRs and 16/56 NRs died (p = 0.01) due to HCV\u2010disease (56%), IFN\u2010induced rejection (11%), both causes (11%) or others (22%). Five\u2010year survival was greater in SVRs than in NRs (93% vs. 69%, p = 0.032). In patients without baseline cirrhosis, progression to cirrhosis occurred more frequently in NRs (27/42 vs. 6/16; p = 0.06). The 5\u2010year risk of graft decompensation was higher in NRs (33% vs. 16%; p = 0.04). Antiviral therapy is associated with improved long\u2010term outcome in recurrent HCV.",

        "abstract": "Within 5\u201310 years, 20\u201340% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010infected liver transplant recipients can be expected to develop cirrhosis. Here, cost\u2010effectiveness of antiviral therapy was assessed. A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression and calculate outcome and costs of treatment. In the baseline analysis, Peg\u2010IFN/RBV treatment prevented organ loss/death, gained quality\u2010adjusted life\u2010years (QALYs) and undercut the limit of cost\u2010effectiveness of \u20ac50 000/QALY with an incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio of approximately \u20ac40 400/QALY and \u20ac21 000/QALY for HCV genotype 1 and 2/3 patients, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis testing modified model parameters according to extreme data described in the literature confirmed cost\u2010effectiveness for a lower or higher rate of fibrosis progression, increased non\u2010HCV\u2010related mortality, lower limits of utilities, a time horizon of 30 years, and additional costs in the year of death. On the other hand, cost\u2010effectiveness was lost for patients with genotype 1 in case of doubled antiviral or life\u2010time costs or an increased discount rate of 7%. New treatment strategies for HCV genotype 1 infected patients remained on the same level cost\u2010effective, if additional costs did not exceed \u20ac10 774 per 10% sustained virologic response gain. We conclude that Peg\u2010IFN/RBV treatment is cost\u2010effective post transplant. This may support treatment decision in individual cases.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the most common indication for liver transplantation (LT). Aggressive treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection before cirrhosis development or decompensation may reduce LT need and risk of HCV recurrence post-LT. Factors associated with increased HCV risk or severity of recurrence include older age, immunosuppression, HCV genotype 1 and high viral load at LT. HCV recurrence post-LT leads to accelerated liver disease and cirrhosis development with reduced graft and patient survival. Currently, interferon (IFN)-based regimens can be used in dual-agent regimens with ribavirin, in triple-agent antiviral strategies with direct-acting antivirals (e.g., protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir), or before transplant in compensated patients to reduce HCV viral load to prevent or reduce the risk of post-LT recurrence and complications; they cannot be used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. IFN-based regimens are used in less than half of HCV-infected patients waiting for LT due to extremely low efficacy and poor tolerability. However, antiviral therapy is indicated after LT in patients with histologically confirmed CHC despite tolerability issues. Improvements in side effect management have increased survival in patients achieving therapeutic targets. HCV treatment pre- and post-LT results in significant health care costs especially when lack of efficacy leads to disease worsening, although studies have shown sofosbuvir treatment before LT vs conventional post-LT dual antiviral is cost effective. The suboptimal efficacy and tolerability of IFN-based therapies, plus the significant economic burden, means the need for effective and well tolerated IFN-free anti-HCV therapy for pre- and post-LT remains high.",

        "abstract": "The advent of oral direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has dramatically improved the hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment landscape in the last 4\u2009years, providing cure rates over 95% with a shorter duration of treatment and a very good safety profile. This has enabled access to treatment in nearly all HCV infected patients. The launch of two pangenotypic fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in 2017 made a new step forward in HCV treatment by slightly increasing efficacy and more importantly allowing the treatment of patients without HCV genotyping, and in some cases without fibrosis assessment. However, retreatment of the few DAA failure patients was still an issue for some HCV genotypes. The launch of the triple regimen FDC, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, solves this issue by providing a cure rate over 96% regardless of HCV genotype. In this review, we describe the current HCV treatment landscape and focus on the development of this triple FDC either in treatment-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced patients with previous failure on a DAA regimen.",

We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks\u2019 retreatment with either combination of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/simeprevir plus ribavirin (SOF/DCV/SMV/RBV, n = 45) or sofosbuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin (SOF/OBV/PTV/r/RBV, n = 163) in patients who had previously failed NS5A inhibitors\u2010based regimens. The primary end point was SVR 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Safety follow\u2010up data were recorded for 60 weeks after the end of treatment. Two hundred\u2010eight patients were included in the study. Of them, 53.4% of patients were females and 40.4% had liver cirrhosis. The most common prior drug combinations were sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (n = 94) and sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus ribavirin (n = 109). The overall SVR12 rates were 98.1%. In SOF/DCV/SMV/RBV group, 95.6% achieved SVR12, while in SOF/OBV/PTV/r/RBV group, the SVR12 rates were 98.8%. SVR12 was higher in cirrhotic patients (84/84) than noncirrhotic (120/124), P value = .0149. Regarding the safety outcomes, anaemia and fatigue were significantly higher in SOF/OBV/PTV/r/RBV group. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was reported in eight (3.8%) patients (four in each group). Of them, death was confirmed in four patients.
