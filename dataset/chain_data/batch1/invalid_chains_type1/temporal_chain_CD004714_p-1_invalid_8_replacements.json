        "abstract": "Periodontal disease is a common infection-induced inflammatory disease among individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of treatment of periodontal disease on the level of metabolic control of diabetes. A total of 113 Native Americans (81 females and 32 males) suffering from periodontal disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were randomized into 5 treatment groups. Periodontal treatment included ultrasonic scaling and curettage combined with one of the following antimicrobial regimens: 1) topical water and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 2) topical 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 3) topical povidone-iodine and systemic doxycycline, 100 mg for 2 weeks; 4) topical 0.12% CHX and placebo; and 5) topical water and placebo (control group). Assessments were performed prior to and at 3 and 6 months after treatment and included probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque and determination of serum glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). After treatment all study groups showed clinical and microbial improvement. The doxycycline-treated groups showed the greatest reduction in probing depth and subgingival Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to the control group. In addition, all 3 groups receiving systemic doxycycline showed, at 3 months, significant reductions (P < or = 0.04) in mean HbA1c reaching nearly 10% from the pretreatment value. Effective treatment of periodontal infection and reduction of periodontal inflammation is associated with a reduction in level of glycated hemoglobin. Control of periodontal infections should thus be an important part of the overall management of diabetes mellitus patients.",

        "abstract": "This prospective split-mouth study was designed to compare the clinical and radiographic healing results in intrabony periodontal defects 12 months after GTR therapy with 2 different bioresorbable barriers. The study comprised 25 healthy patients with one pair of contralaterally located intrabony defects with a probing pocket depth of > or = 6 mm and radiographic evidence of angular bone loss of > or = 4 mm. The 2 defects of each patient were randomized for treatment either with polylactic acid (PLA) membranes or with polyglactin-910 (PG-910) membranes. The patients received systemic doxycycline (100 mg/d) for 11 days postoperatively. One blinded examiner recorded the following clinical parameters using a pressure calibrated probe at baseline and after 12 months: papillary bleeding index (PBI), gingival recession (REC), probing pocket depth (PPD), and probing attachment level (PAL). The vertical relative attachment gain (V-rAG) was calculated as a % of the PAL gain related to the maximum possible attachment gain (expressed by the intraoperatively measured depth of the osseous defect). Geometrically standardized intraoral radiographs were quantitatively evaluated for bone changes (density, area) in the defect region using digital subtraction radiography (DSR). Clinical and radiographic data were statistically analyzed using the Wilcoxon-signed-rank test (alpha=0.05). Postoperative membrane exposures occurred in 9 PLA and 13 PG-910 treated sites. After 12 months of healing, both barrier types provided significant PPD reductions and PAL gain [median (25/75 percentile)]: deltaPPD [PLA: 3.0 (2.0/4.0) mm; PG-910: 3.0 (2.0/4.5) mm]; deltaPAL [PLA: 3.0 (2.5/4.0) mm; PG-910: 2.0 (1.0/4.0) mm]. V-rAG amounted to 60% in PLA sites and 54% in PG-910 sites. DSR revealed significant bone density gain after 12 months. 58.3% of the initial defect area in PLA sites and 54.0% of the initial defect area in PG-910 sites showed bone density gain. Neither clinical nor radiographic data revealed any significant difference between the 2 barrier types after 12 months. In conclusion, this 12-month study demonstrated that PLA and PG-910 membranes provided similar favorable regeneration results in deep intrabony periodontal defects.",

        "abstract": "The lifespan of the US population is increasing, with the elderly desiring successful aging. This goal is jeopardized as multiple systemic conditions and their treatments become more prevalent with age, causing impaired systemic and oral health and influencing an older person's quality of life. To obtain successful aging, a compression of morbidity must be obtained through prevention and management of disease. This paper describes the most common systemic diseases causing morbidity and mortality in persons aged 65+ years: diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, influenza, diabetes mellitus, trauma, Alzheimer's disease, renal diseases, septicemia, and liver diseases. Disease prevalence and the impact of medications and other therapeutic measures used to treat these conditions are discussed. Oral sequelae are reviewed with guidelines for early detection of these deleterious consequences, considerations for oral treatment, and patient management. An understanding of the impact of systemic diseases and treatment on oral health is imperative for dental practitioners to appropriately treat and manage older patients with these conditions. With a focus on early detection and prevention, oral health care providers can improve the quality of life of this population and aid in the attainment of successful aging.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis has been linked to clinical cardiovascular disease but not to subclinical atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether periodontitis is associated with carotid artery intima-media wall thickness (IMT). Cross-sectional data on 6017 persons aged 52 to 75 years were obtained from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study 1996 to 1998 examination. The dependent variable was carotid IMT \u22651 mm. Periodontitis was defined by extent of attachment loss \u22653 mm: none/mild (<10%), moderate (10% to <30%), or severe (\u226530%). Covariates included age, sex, diabetes, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, smoking, waist-hip ratio, education, and race/study center. Odds of IMT \u22651 mm were higher for severe periodontitis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.53) and moderate periodontitis (OR 1.40, CI 1.17 to 1.67) compared with no periodontitis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, severe periodontitis (OR 1.31, CI 1.03 to 1.66) was associated with IMT \u22651 mm, while adjusting for the other factors in the model. These results provide the first indication that periodontitis may play a role in the pathogenesis of atheroma formation, as well as in cardiovascular events.",

Searches were made for papers published from 1966 through March 2002.\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nPublished randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), longitudinal, cohort, and case-control studies were included. Study participants included those with atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or PVD. Oral conditions included periodontal disease.\n\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\nOnly studies on humans were included.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nBecause the studies used different oral assessment measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the data reported. Weighted mean differences, relative risks, or odds ratios were compared for cohort studies.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\n1. Of the initial 1,526 studies identified, 31 (including 8 case-control and 18 cross-sectional reports) were included in the analysis. Taken together, most of the literature supports a modest association between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis. However, data reported in several studies do not show this association. 2. The absence of a standard definition and measures for periodontal disease complicates interpretation of results, as do potential confounding risk factors common to both conditions.\n\n\nREVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS\n1. Periodontal disease may be modestly associated with atherosclerosis, MI, and CVD. 2. Additional large-scale longitudinal epidemiologic and intervention studies are necessary to validate this association and to determine causality.",

Methods and Results\u2014The population comprised 1023 men (aged 46 to 64 years) in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study. The subjects with CHD at baseline (n=113) were more often seropositive for Porphyromonas gingivalis IgA (38.9% versus 28.5%, P=0.021) and IgG (60.2% versus 46.7%, P=0.007) than those without CHD. During the 10-year follow-up, 109 men free from CHD at baseline experienced an acute myocardial infarction or CHD death. The men with an end point were more often seropositive for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans IgA (15.5% versus 10.2%, P=0.019) than those who remained healthy. In the highest tertile of A. actinomycetemcomitans IgA-antibodies compared with the lowest one, the relative risk (RR) for an end point adjusted for CHD risk factors was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.3). In the Porphyromonas gingivalis IgA-antibody tertiles, the highest RR of 2.1 (1.3 to 3.4) was observed in the second tertile. All antibody levels correlated positively with the carotid artery intima-media thickness.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Periodontitis patients are known to suffer from endotoxemia, which may be among the major risk factors for atherosclerosis. In health, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mainly carried with high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Shift of LPS toward lipoproteins with lower densities may result in less effective endotoxin scavenging. Our aim was to determine plasma LPS activity and lipoprotein-distribution before and after treatment in periodontitis patients. Patients and Methods: Very low and intermediate density (VLDL-IDL), low density (LDL), HDL 2, HDL3, and lipoprotein-deficient plasma (LPDP) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Patients included 34 subjects aged 53.5 \u00b1 8.3 years, before and 6 months after periodontal treatment. Results: The mean LPS distribution decreased among lipoprotein classes as follows: VLDL-IDL 41.3 \u00b1 12.1%, LPDP 25.0 \u00b1 7.0%, HDL3 13.1 \u00b1 5.2%, LDL 11.5 \u00b1 3.7%, and HDL2 9.2 \u00b1 2.8%. Plasma and VLDL-IDL-associated LPS correlated positively, and LDL- and HDL-associated LPS negatively with clinical periodontal parameters and plasma cytokine concentrations. Mean plasma LPS activity increased after periodontal treatment from 44.0 \u00b1 17.0 to 55.7 \u00b1 24.2 EU/ml (P = 0.006). No significant changes were found in LPS lipoprotein distribution and lipoprotein compositions after the treatment. Conclusions: Endotoxemia increases with severity of periodontitis. In periodontitis, LPS associates preferentially with the pro-atherogenic VLDL-IDL fraction. Periodontal treatment has only minor effects on plasma LPS activity or distribution, which reflects persistence of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is an important determinant of inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions. It has also been documented that certain chronic infectious diseases, such as periodontitis and chlamydial infection, exacerbate clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. In addition, low-level but persistent metabolic endotoxemia is often found in diabetic and obese subjects and is induced in mice fed a high-fat diet. Objective: In this study, we examined cooperative macrophage activation by low levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by minimally oxidized LDL (mmLDL), as a model for subclinical endotoxemia-complicated atherosclerosis. Methods and Results: We found that both in vitro and in vivo, mmLDL and LPS (Kdo2-LipidA) cooperatively activated macrophages to express proinflammatory cytokines Cxcl2 (MIP-2), Ccl3 (MIP-1&agr;), and Ccl4 (MIP-1&bgr;). Importantly, the mmLDL and LPS cooperative effects were evident at a threshold LPS concentration (1 ng/mL) at which LPS alone induced only a limited macrophage response. Analyzing microarray data with a de novo motif discovery algorithm, we found that genes transcribed by promoters containing an activator protein (AP)-1 binding site were significantly upregulated by costimulation with mmLDL and LPS. In a nuclear factor\u2013DNA binding assay, the cooperative effect of mmLDL and LPS costimulation on c-Jun and c-Fos DNA binding, but not on p65 or p50, was dependent on mmLDL-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In addition, mmLDL induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent derepression of AP-1 by removing nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) from the chemokine promoters. Conclusions: The cooperative engagement of AP-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-&kgr;B by mmLDL and LPS may constitute a mechanism of increased transcription of inflammatory cytokines within atherosclerotic lesions.",

Dysregulation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) metabolism is common in CKD patients and drives vascular calcification. In this article, we review the physiological regulatory mechanisms for Ca and P homeostasis and the basis for their dysregulation in CKD. In addition, we highlight recent findings indicating that elevated Ca and P have direct effects on VSMCs that promote vascular calcification, including stimulation of osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation, vesicle release, apoptosis, loss of inhibitors, and extracellular matrix degradation. These studies suggest a major role for elevated P in promoting osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation of VSMC, whereas elevated Ca has a predominant role in promoting VSMC apoptosis and vesicle release. Furthermore, the effects of elevated Ca and P are synergistic, providing a major stimulus for vascular calcification in CKD. Unraveling the complex regulatory pathways that mediate the effects of both Ca and P on VSMCs will ultimately provide novel targets and therapies to limit the destructive effects of vascular calcification in CKD patients.

        "title": "The Tyrosine Kinase Syk Differentially Regulates Toll-like Receptor Signaling Downstream of the Adaptor Molecules TRAF6 and TRAF3",
        "abstract": "The kinase Syk maintains a balanced immune response to pathogens detected by the receptor TLR4. Syk Tunes TRAF Signaling Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern recognition receptor that binds to the microbial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activates two signaling pathways involving protein ubiquitination that have opposing outcomes for the immune response. When at the plasma membrane, LPS-stimulated TLR4 associates with the adaptor MyD88 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 to stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines. When internalized and localized in endosomes, TLR4 associates with the adaptor TRIF and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 to stimulate production of immunomodulatory type I interferons. Lin et al. found that, although the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk was recruited to both TRAF6- and TRAF3-containing signaling complexes, it led to differential regulation of TRAF ubiquitination such that TRAF6-dependent proinflammatory signaling was inhibited and TRAF3-dependent IFN production was enhanced. Experiments in Syk-deficient mouse macrophages showed that Syk had similar effects on TRAF6 and TRAF3 signaling downstream of other TLRs. Together, these data suggest that Syk can fine-tune innate immune responses to dampen inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major family of pattern recognition receptors, and they play a crucial role in innate immune responses. Activation of TLR4 signaling at the plasma membrane by its ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates a proinflammatory pathway dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated factor 6) and the kinase TAK1 (transforming growth factor \u03b2\u2013activated kinase 1), whereas TLR4 signaling at endosomes stimulates the production of type I interferons (IFNs) through a pathway that depends on TRAF3 and the kinase TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase-1). We found that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk partially mediated the endocytosis of TLR4, but it also played a dual role in TLR4-mediated signaling. LPS-dependent stimulation of TLR4 in Syk-deficient macrophages led to enhanced activation of TAK1 and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines compared to that in wild-type macrophages. In contrast, Syk-deficient macrophages exhibited decreased TLR4-dependent activation of TBK1 signaling and production of type I IFNs. We found that Syk was present in both TRAF6- and TRAF3-containing signaling complexes; however, the LPS-dependent, lysine 63\u2013linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 and TRAF3 was oppositely regulated by Syk. We identified the domains of Syk that interacted with TRAF3, TRAF6, TAK1, and TBK1, factors activated by multiple TLRs, which suggests that Syk may act as a common regulator of various TLR responses. Together, our results demonstrate the opposing regulatory roles of Syk in TLR-mediated TRAF6 and TRAF3 signaling pathways, which suggests that Syk may fine-tune the innate immune response to lessen inflammation.",

        "title": "Editorial: Flexible Syk: turning on and off the inflammasome as needed",
        "abstract": "The detection of microbial products is key to activation of the innate and adaptive immune system and ultimately, to survival of the host. In the innate immune system, microbial products are recognized by PRRs. These receptors make up a family of signaling receptors that recognize PAMPs, which are conserved structures found almost exclusively on microbes. Within the family of PRRs is the NLR family, which is composed of cytosolic receptors that recognize intracellular microbes and danger signals. Several members of the NLR family activate inflammatory caspases via the formation of inflammasomes: a multiprotein complex composed of an NLR family member, the adaptor protein ASC, and the cysteine protease procaspase 1 [1]. Formation of the inflammasome results in cleavage and activation of caspase 1, which is important for host defense by proteolytically activating IL-1b and IL-18, and induction of an inflammatory cell death process called pyroptosis. Activated caspase 1 has other substrates, such as cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes, of the glycolytic pathway that suggest that it may play important roles in a wider spectrum of cell functions [2]. Members of the NLR family that are involved in the formation of inflammasomes include NLRC4, NLRP1, and NLRP3. Of these, only NLRP3 is activated by a diverse group of stimuli that includes PAMPs and DAMPs, such as extracellular ATP, MSU, and silica. Because these stimuli are structurally and chemically diverse, it is unlikely that they all activate NLRP3 by directly binding to it; rather, they may converge on a common molecule/pathway that leads to NLRP3 activation and subsequently, formation of the inflammasome. There are several common terminal pathways that have been hypothesized to activate NLRP3, including lysosomal disruption, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, and K efflux. Activation of NLRP3 results in its interaction with ASC via the pyrin domain, resulting in selfoligomerization of ASC into macromolecular structures, termed ASC specks, which recruit procaspase 1 via interactions with their respective CARDs, resulting in autocleavage and activation of caspase 1. Activated caspase 1 cleaves pro-IL-1b or pro-IL-18, resulting in the secretion of mature IL-1b and IL-18 [3]. The importance of tight regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been demonstrated by its pathophysiologic role in many inflammatory disorders. Naturally occurring mutations in the nlrp3 gene result in a collection of autoinflammatory syndromes termed cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome. The gain-of-function mutations result in a constitutively active NLRP3 inflammasome and increased IL-1b production, which is linked to pathogenesis [4]. Aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation has also been linked to other inflammatory disorders, including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, gout, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Therefore, it is critical that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is tightly regulated to prevent damage to the host. There are 2 steps required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages: a priming step to increase expression of NLRP3 (and pro-IL-1b) and a 2nd step to activate NLRP3 and induce formation of the inflammasome. Each step is regulated by multiple mechanisms; for instance, during the priming step, PRR stimulation of the NF-kB pathway results in an increase in NLRP3 gene transcription. PRR stimulation also results in post-translational regulation of NLRP3 protein via deubiquitylation of NLRP3, generating an increase in intracellular levels of the protein (reviewed in ref. [5]). However, it is clear that there are additional signaling molecules and pathways that regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Recent studies have suggested that kinases play a role; however, there is a lack of information on the mechanisms by which specific kinases directly regulate inflammasome activation. The identification of these regulatory pathways is critical for the development of therapeutics to treat the numerous inflammatory disorders that are associated with excess IL-1b. SYK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that interacts with ITAM-containing proteins and receptors. SYK is activated following stimulation of several PRRs, in particular,",

        "title": "Inflammasome activation and assembly at a glance",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that typically comprise a sensor, an adaptor and the zymogen procaspase-1. An inflammasome assembles in response to a diverse range of pathogen-associated or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs). The inflammasome platform leads to activation of caspase-1 through proximity-induced self-cleavage, which further induces maturation of interleukins 1\u03b2 and 18 (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18) through proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18. Activated caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin D, which leads to a particular form of cell death called pyroptosis. Mutations in genes that encode inflammasome components are associated with many inflammatory disorders, and studies in the past decade have highlighted the importance of appropriate activation of the inflammasome in homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Therefore, much attention is being paid to uncover the modulators and regulators of inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis. This Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster outlines the concepts in the activation of inflammasome sensors and assembly of the inflammasome platform. We also discuss recent insights into the mechanisms of regulation of inflammasome activity and the induction of cell death by pyroptosis. Summary: This article and accompanying poster provides an outline of the concepts in the assembly of inflammasomes and cell death by pyroptosis.",

        "abstract": "A shift in our understanding of macrophage biology has come about as a result of recent discoveries in the area of metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. The NLRP3 inflammasome drives the activation of caspase\u20101, leading to the production of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u201018, and a type of cell death termed pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to sense metabolites such as palmitate, uric acid, and cholesterol crystals and is inhibited by ketone bodies produced during metabolic flux. The NLRP3 inflammasome has also been shown to be regulated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and components of glycolysis, such as Hexokinase. Here, we review these findings and discuss their importance for inflammation and furthermore discuss potential therapeutic benefits of targeting NLRP3.",

        "title": "Punicalagin Protects Diabetic Nephropathy by Inhibiting Pyroptosis Based on TXNIP/NLRP3 Pathway",
        "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy is a diabetic complication caused by chronic inflammation. As the primary polyphenol in pomegranate, punicalagin is believed to have significant anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we established a mice model for diabetes induced by high-fat diet (HFD)/ streptozotocin (STZ) to verify the protective effect of punicalagin in vivo. The results show that the blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (CREA), and the urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) were significantly decreased in diabetic mice after punicalagin intervention, and the symptoms of glomerular interstitial hyperplasia and glomerular hypertrophy were alleviated. Pyroptosis is an essential manner of programmed cell death in the inflammatory response; the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins such as interleukin-1 (IL-1\u03b2), cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-1 (caspase-1), gasdermin D (GSDMD), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) was decreased in our study, which proved that the administration of punicalagin for eight weeks can significantly inhibit pyroptosis in mice. In addition, punicalagin reduced high glucose-mediated protein expressions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (NOX4) and alleviated mitochondria damage. Low expression of NOX4 inhibits the dissociation of thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. To summarize, our study provided evidence that punicalagin can alleviate diabetic nephropathy, and the effect is associated with downregulating the expression of NOX4, inhibiting TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway-mediated pyroptosis, suggesting its therapeutic implications for complications of diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Lung ischemia reperfusion injury (LIRI) is a complex pathophysiological process with high morbidity and mortality. An important pathophysiological characteristic of LIRI is endothelial barrier dysfunction, although the mechanism involved in this process remains unclear. VX765, a specific caspase-1 inhibitor, has been shown to have a protective effect against several diseases including sepsis, atherosclerosis, and glial inflammatory disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether VX765 had a protective effect in LIRI. The results showed that lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and oxygen/glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced endothelial pyroptosis and barrier dysfunction characterized by an inflammatory response. Treatment with VX765 successfully alleviated I/R- and OGD/R-induced endothelial pyroptosis and barrier dysfunction by inhibiting caspase-1 in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, these findings showed that VX765 provided effective protection against lung I/R-induced endothelial pyroptosis and barrier dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "The previous meta\u2010analysis showed an advantageous effect of berberine supplementation on interleukin 6 (IL\u20106), tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), and serum C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) concentrations; however, it is unknown the dosage that this component influences inflammatory biomarkers. A comprehensive search was done in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science until September 2022 to find randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed the effects of berberine/barberry on IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and CRP in adults but not trials without a control group. Studies bias was assessed using RoB 2. A random\u2010effects model was performed to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD). A dose\u2010dependent effect was calculated. Eighteen clinical trials with 1600 participants were included in the current meta\u2010analysis. These interventions significantly mitigate IL\u20106 levels (\u22121.18\u2009pg/mL), TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (\u22123.72\u2009pg/mL), and CRP levels (\u22121.33\u2009mg/L). In addition, the non\u2010linear analysis showed a significant lowering effect of berberine/barberry on IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels in doses <1000\u2009mg/day and less than 5\u2009weeks of intervention. There are limitations to our findings, including low\u2010quality studies and significant heterogeneity. These interventions might be considered adjunct therapy to managing inflammation status. However, more investigation and high\u2010quality evidence must be conducted to obtain more comprehensive and generalizable results.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes and the main cause of end-stage renal disease around the world. Mitochondria are the main organelles responsible for producing energy in cells and are closely involved in maintaining normal organ function. Studies have found that a high-sugar environment can damage glomeruli and tubules and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. Meanwhile, animal experiments have shown that DKD symptoms are alleviated when mitochondrial damage is targeted, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is inextricably linked to the development of DKD. This article describes the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and the progression and onset of DKD. The relationship between DKD and mitochondrial dysfunction is discussed. At the same time, the progress of DKD treatment targeting mitochondrial dysfunction is summarized. We hope to provide new insights into the progress and treatment of DKD.",
