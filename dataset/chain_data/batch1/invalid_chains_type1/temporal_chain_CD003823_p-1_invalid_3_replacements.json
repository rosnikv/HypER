        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor peptide derived from the endothelium. We evaluated the contribution of endothelin to blood-pressure regulation in patients with essential hypertension by studying the effect of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 293 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of four to six weeks, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four oral doses of bosentan (100, 500, or 1000 mg once daily or 1000 mg twice daily), placebo, or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs compared with placebo, bosentan resulted in a significant reduction in diastolic pressure with a daily dose of 500 or 2000 mg (an absolute reduction of 5.7 mm Hg at each dose), which was similar to the reduction with enalapril (5.8 mm Hg). There were no significant changes in heart rate. Bosentan did not result in activation of the sympathetic nervous system (as determined by measurement of the plasma norepinephrine level) or the renin-angiotensin system (as determined by measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn endothelin-receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that endothelin may contribute to elevated blood pressure in such patients. The favorable effect of treatment with bosentan on blood pressure occurred without reflexive neurohormonal activation.",

        "abstract": "The absorption, excretion, and metabolism of the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was investigated in healthy male subjects by administration of 14C-labeled compound. Four subjects received a single oral dose of 500 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq), and four other subjects received a single i.v. dose of 250 mg of bosentan (3.7 MBq). Radioactivity and concentrations of bosentan and its metabolites were measured in plasma, urine, and feces samples. More than 97% of drug-related material was recovered on average within 3.5 days after oral dosing and within 5 days after i.v. dosing. More than 90% of radioactivity was found in feces after both oral and i.v. dosing. Most of the radioactivity in urine and feces represented bosentan and three metabolites. Ro 48-5033, the major metabolite in plasma, urine, and feces, is the result of hydroxylation at the t-butyl group of bosentan. The two other metabolites Ro 47-8634 and Ro 64-1056 represent minor metabolite species. Ro 47-8634 is the product of O-demethylation of the phenolic methyl ester, and Ro 64-1056 is generated by both demethylation and hydroxylation. The radioactivity in plasma could almost entirely be attributed to bosentan and the two metabolites Ro 48-5033 and Ro 47-8634, whereby both metabolites exhibited much lower plasma levels than bosentan. Hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion of the metabolites apparently represents the major pathway of elimination for bosentan in humans.",

        "abstract": "Molecular medicine has led to rapid advances in the characterization of hepatobiliary transport systems that determine the uptake and excretion of bile salts and other biliary constituents in the liver and extrahepatic tissues. The bile salt pool undergoes an enterohepatic circulation that is regulated by distinct bile salt transport proteins, including the canalicular bile salt export pump BSEP (ABCB11), the ileal Na(+)-dependent bile salt transporter ISBT (SLC10A2), and the hepatic sinusoidal Na(+)- taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide NTCP (SLC10A1). Other bile salt transporters include the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATPs (SLC21A) and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2 and 3 MRP2,3 (ABCC2,3). Bile salt transporters are also present in cholangiocytes, the renal proximal tubule, and the placenta. Expression of these transport proteins is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, with the former involving nuclear hormone receptors where bile salts function as specific ligands. During bile secretory failure (cholestasis), bile salt transport proteins undergo adaptive responses that serve to protect the liver from bile salt retention and which facilitate extrahepatic routes of bile salt excretion. This review is a comprehensive summary of current knowledge of the molecular characterization, function, and regulation of bile salt transporters in normal physiology and in cholestatic liver disease and liver regeneration.",

Because the nuclear xenobiotic receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulate involved enzymes and transporters, we aimed to induce adaptive alternative pathways with different CAR and PXR agonists in vivo. Mice were treated with the CAR agonists phenobarbital and 1,4\u2010bis\u2010[2\u2010(3,5\u2010dichlorpyridyloxy)]benzene, as well as the PXR agonists atorvastatin and pregnenolone\u201016\u03b1\u2010carbonitrile. Hepatic bile acid and bilirubin\u2010metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, Ugt1a1, Sult2a1), their regulatory nuclear receptors (CAR, PXR, farnesoid X receptor), and bile acid/organic anion and lipid transporters (Ntcp, Oatp1,2,4, Bsep, Mrp2\u20104, Mdr2, Abcg5/8, Asbt) in the liver and kidney were analyzed via reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Potential functional relevance was tested in common bile duct ligation (CBDL). CAR agonists induced Mrp2\u20104 and Oatp2; PXR agonists induced only Mrp3 and Oatp2. Both PXR and CAR agonists profoundly stimulated bile acid\u2013hydroxylating/detoxifying enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10. In addition, CAR agonists upregulated bile acid\u2013sulfating Sult2a1 and bilirubin\u2010glucuronidating Ugt1a1. These changes were accompanied by reduced serum levels of bilirubin and bile acids in healthy and CBDL mice and by increased levels of polyhydroxylated bile acids in serum and urine of cholestatic mice. Atorvastatin significantly increased Oatp2, Mdr2, and Asbt, while other transporters and enzymes were moderately affected. In conclusion, administration of specific CAR or PXR ligands results in coordinated stimulation of major hepatic bile acid/bilirubin metabolizing and detoxifying enzymes and hepatic key alternative efflux systems, effects that are predicted to counteract cholestasis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates protection against bile acid-induced liver injury in cholestatic animal models. Ursodeoxycholic acid and rifampicin are known ligands. We investigated whether functional polymorphisms of the SXR gene influence disease susceptibility or disease progression in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPolymorphisms at 8 loci across the SXR gene were genotyped in 327 Scandinavian PSC patients and 275 healthy controls. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regressions were performed to estimate effects from genotypes on patient survival, defined as time from diagnostic cholangiography to death or liver transplantation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSusceptibility to PSC was not associated with any of the SXR polymorphisms studied. Median survival was significantly reduced in patients homozygous for the minor allele as compared with patients carrying at least 1 major allele of the neighboring polymorphisms rs6785049 (10.8 vs 14.0 years, respectively, P = .01), rs1054190 (3.6 vs 13.6 years, respectively, P = .004), and rs3814058 (3.5 vs 13.3 years, respectively, P = .01). The increased risk of death or liver transplantation was confirmed in univariate Cox regressions (relative risk [RR](rs6785049) = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.6; RR(rs1054190) = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.4-7.1; and RR(rs3814058) = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.2 for the 3 polymorphisms, respectively). In multiple Cox regressions including age at PSC onset, rs1054190 remained an independent risk factor.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFunctional SXR gene variants appear to modify disease course in PSC. Further investigations of polymorphisms in the SXR gene may provide insight into the prognostic importance of SXR-regulated pathways in this disease, perhaps even in a therapeutic perspective.",

        "title": "Rapid Clinical Induction of Hepatic Cytochrome P4502B6 Activity by Ritonavir",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Ritonavir is the most potent and efficacious inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A), and it is used accordingly for the pharmacoenhancement of other antiretrovirals. Paradoxically, ritonavir induces the clinical metabolism and clearance of many drugs. The mechanism by which ritonavir inhibits and induces clinical drug metabolism is unknown. Ritonavir induces CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes. This investigation tested the hypothesis that ritonavir induces human CYP2B6 in vivo. Thirteen healthy human immunodeficiency virus-negative volunteers underwent a three-way sequential crossover protocol, receiving racemic bupropion after nothing (control), 3 days of treatment with ritonavir, and 2.5 weeks of treatment with ritonavir (400 mg twice a day). Stereoselective bupropion hydroxylation was used as an in vivo probe for CYP2B6 activity. Plasma and urine (R)- and (S)-bupropion and (R,R)- and (S,S)-hydroxybupropion concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Racemic, (R)-, and (S)-bupropion plasma ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-\u221e) (ritonavir/control) were significantly reduced to 0.84, 0.86, and 0.80, respectively, after 3 days of ritonavir treatment and to 0.67, 0.69, and 0.60 after steady-state ritonavir treatment. Apparent oral clearances for racemic, (R)-, and (S)-bupropion all were significantly increased by 1.2-fold after 3 days of ritonavir treatment and by 1.4-, 1.7-, and 1.5-fold after steady-state ritonavir treatment. The plasma (S,S)-hydroxybupropion/(S)-bupropion AUC0-72 ratio was significantly increased by ritonavir. Formation clearances of both (R,R)- and (S,S)-hydroxybupropion were increased 1.8-fold after 3 days of ritonavir treatment and 2.1-fold after steady-state ritonavir treatment. These results show that ritonavir induces human CYP2B6 activity. Induction is rapid, occurring after only 3 days of ritonavir, and is sustained for at least 2 weeks. The ritonavir induction of CYP2B6 activity may have significant implications for drug interactions and clarify previously unexplained interactions.",

        "abstract": "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is a transcriptional factor involved in detoxification responses to pollutants and in intrinsic biological processes of multicellular organisms. We recently described that Vav3, an activator of Rho/Rac GTPases, is an Ahr transcriptional target in embryonic fibroblasts. These results prompted us to compare the Ahr\u2212/\u2212 and Vav3\u2212/\u2212 mouse phenotypes to investigate the implications of this functional interaction in vivo. Here, we show that Ahr is important for Vav3 expression in kidney, lung, heart, liver, and brainstem regions. This process is not affected by the administration of potent Ahr ligands such as benzo[a]pyrene. We also report that Ahr- and Vav3-deficient mice display hypertension, tachypnea, and sympathoexcitation. The Ahr gene deficiency also induces the GABAergic transmission defects present in the Vav3\u2212/\u2212 ventrolateral medulla, a main cardiorespiratory brainstem center. However, Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice, unlike Vav3-deficient animals, display additional defects in fertility, perinatal growth, liver size and function, closure, spleen size, and peripheral lymphocytes. These results demonstrate that Vav3 is a bona fide Ahr target that is in charge of a limited subset of the developmental and physiological functions controlled by this transcriptional factor. Our data also reveal the presence of sympathoexcitation and new cardiorespiratory defects in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

        "abstract": "Two Vav isoforms could be targeted to prevent breast tumors from metastasizing to the lung. Metastatic Route to the Lung Many individuals with cancer die from secondary tumors or metastases that spread through blood or lymph vessels to other tissues from the primary tumor site. The members of the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) promote tumor growth and metastasis and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rho GEFs are attractive pharmacological targets because they have potentially druggable catalytic activities and more restricted distribution patterns than Rho proteins. Citterio et al. found that the mRNA abundance of the GEFs Vav2 and Vav3 was increased in certain breast cancer subtypes in patient samples. Mice implanted with breast cancer cells in which Vav2 and Vav3 had been silenced developed slowly growing breast tumors and did not develop lung metastases. Vav2- and Vav3-deficient breast cancer cells showed an altered transcriptional profile, leading the authors to further analyze the role of select target genes encoding proteins that could be pharmacologically inhibited, such as the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. When implanted into mice, breast cancer cells with deficiencies in individual Vav target genes showed defects in proliferation, angiogenesis, the ability to enter or exit blood vessels during metastasis, and the ability to colonize the lung. When applied to human breast cancer data sets, the changes in the abundance of a subset of mRNAs from the Vav transcriptome generated a gene signature that accurately predicted if patients survived and were free of detectable lung metastasis. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and preventing secondary lung metastases and provide a potential prognostic tool for clinicians. The guanosine triphosphatases of the Rho and Rac subfamilies regulate protumorigenic pathways and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs), which could be potential targets for anticancer therapies. We report that two Rho GEFs, Vav2 and Vav3, play synergistic roles in breast cancer by sustaining tumor growth, neoangiogenesis, and many of the steps involved in lung-specific metastasis. The involvement of Vav proteins in these processes did not correlate with Rac1 and RhoA activity or cell migration, implying the presence of additional biological programs. Microarray analyses revealed that Vav2 and Vav3 controlled a vast transcriptional program in breast cancer cells through mechanisms that were shared between the two proteins, isoform-specific or synergistic. Furthermore, the abundance of Vav-regulated transcripts was modulated by Rac1-dependent and Rac1-independent pathways. This transcriptome encoded therapeutically targetable proteins that played nonredundant roles in primary tumorigenesis and lung-specific metastasis, such as integrin-linked kinase (Ilk), the transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 family ligand inhibin \u03b2A, cyclooxygenase-2, and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule Tacstd2. It also contained gene signatures that predicted disease outcome in breast cancer patients. These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and lung metastases and provide a potential diagnostic tool for clinical use.",

In contrast, further research is needed to study the clinical significance and the detailed mechanism of action of lncRNA-CYTOR in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CYTOR in CRC prognosis and identify the relevant potential signaling pathways and underlying mechanism of competing endogenous RNA. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) indicated that the expression of CYTOR was significantly elevated in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines. Aberrant expression of CYTOR was significantly related to TNM stage, T stage, N stage, and perineural and venous invasions. Survival analysis indicated that high-CYTOR expression was associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0057), and multivariate analysis showed that high-CYTOR expression was an independent prognostic factor, which led to poor OS. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed that there were 18 microRNAs (miRNAs) interacted with CYTOR, and one of them, miR-3679-5p might collaborate with metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1), which was selected for further analysis. Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of CYTOR and MACC1.

This study identified potential prognostic epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition related lncRNAs (ERLs) by the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and bioinformatics. The differential expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was obtained by analyzing the lncRNA data of 370 HCC samples in TCGA. Then, Pearson correlation analysis was carried out with EMT related genes (ERGs) from molecular signatures database. Combined with the univariate Cox expression analysis of the total survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, the prognostic ERLs were obtained. Then use \u201cstep\u201d function to select the optimal combination of constructing multivariate Cox expression model. The expression levels of ERLs in HCC samples were verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, we identified 5 prognostic ERLs (AC023157.3, AC099850.3, AL031985.3, AL365203.2, CYTOR). The model showed that these prognostic markers were reliable independent predictors of risk factors (P value <.0001, hazard ratio [HR]\u200a=\u200a2.400, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u200a=\u200a1.667\u20133.454 for OS). In the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis, this prognostic marker is a good predictor of HCC survival (area under the curve of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years are 0.754, 0.720, 0.704, and 0.662 respectively). We analyzed the correlation of clinical characteristics of these prognostic markers, and the results show that this prognostic marker is an independent factor that can predict the prognosis of HCC more accurately. In addition, by matching with the Molecular Signatures Database, we obtained 18 ERLs, and then constructed the HCC prognosis model and clinical feature correlation analysis using 5 prognostic ERLs. The results show that these prognostic markers have reliable independent predictive value. Bioinformatics analysis showed that these prognostic markers were involved in the regulation of EMT and related functions of tumor occurrence and migration. Five prognostic types of ERLs identified in this study can be used as potential biomarkers to predict the prognosis of HCC.",

        "title": "Prognostication of Pancreatic Cancer Using The Cancer Genome Atlas Based Ferroptosis-Related Long Non-Coding RNAs",
        "abstract": "Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of pancreatic cancer development and are involved in ferroptosis regulation. LncRNA transcript levels serve as a prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, identifying ferroptosis-related lncRNAs (FRLs) with prognostic value in pancreatic cancer is critical. Methods: In this study, FRLs were identified by combining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and FerrDb databases. For training cohort, univariate Cox, Lasso, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to identify prognosis FRLs and then construct a prognostic FRLs signature. Testing cohort and entire cohort were applied to validate the prognostic signature. Moreover, the nomogram was performed to predict prognosis at different clinicopathological stages and risk scores. A co-expression network with 76 lncRNA-mRNA targets was constructed. Results: Univariate Cox analysis was performed to analyze the prognostic value of 193 lncRNAs. Furthermore, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and the multivariate Cox analysis were used to assess the prognostic value of these ferroptosis-related lncRNAs. A prognostic risk model, of six lncRNAs, including LINC01705, AC068620.2, TRAF3IP2-AS1, AC092171.2, AC099850.3, and MIR193BHG was constructed. The Kaplan Meier (KM) and time-related receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to calculate overall survival and compare high- and low-risk groups. There was also a significant difference in survival time between the high-risk and low-risk groups for the testing cohort and the entire cohort, with AUCs of .723, .753, respectively. Combined with clinicopathological characteristics, the risk model was validated as a new independent prognostic factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma through univariate and multivariate Cox regression. Moreover, a nomogram showed good prediction. Conclusion: The signature of six FRLs had significant prognostic value for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They may be a promising therapeutic target in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Background This study aimed to investigate the potential of a NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature as a reliable prognostic biomarker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods Transcriptome profiles and clinical data of AML patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. NAD+ metabolism-related genes (NMRGs) were identified from the KEGG and Reactome databases. Coexpression analysis was used to screen NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNAs. The NAD+ metabolismrelated lncRNA signature was constructed using univariate analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate analysis. High- and low-risk groups were compared for survival, tumor mutation burden, immune cell infiltration, and response to immunotherapy. Enrichment analysis explored the biological functions. Results LINC01679, AC079922.2, TRAF3IP2-AS1, and LINC02465 were identified to construct the risk model. The model exhibited good predictive power and outperformed age and gender as an independent prognostic marker. High-risk patients showed poorer survival, distinct TP53 mutations, and altered immune cell infiltration compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, low-risk patients exhibited greater sensitivity to immunotherapy. Enriched biological functions included leukocyte migration and positive regulation of cytokine production. Conclusions The NAD+ metabolism-related lncRNA signature shows promise in predicting clinical outcomes for AML patients.",
