Therefore, a prospective randomized trial comparing primary stenting with balloon angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction was conducted.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to undergo either primary stenting (n=112) or balloon angioplasty (n=115). The clinical end points were death, recurrent infarction, subsequent bypass surgery, or repeat angioplasty of the infarct-related vessel. The overall mortality rate at 6 months was 2%. Recurrent infarction occurred in 8 patients (7%) after balloon angioplasty and in 1 (1%) after stenting (P=0.036). Subsequent target-vessel revascularization was necessary in 19 (17%) and 4 (4%) patients, respectively (P=0.0016). The cardiac event-free survival rate in the stent group was significantly higher than in the balloon angioplasty group (95% versus 80%; P=0.012).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn selected patients with acute myocardial infarction, primary stenting can be applied safely and effectively, resulting in a lower incidence of recurrent infarction and a significant reduction in the need for subsequent target-vessel revascularization compared with balloon angioplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe recent recognition that coronary-artery stenting has improved the short- and long-term outcomes of patients treated with angioplasty has made it necessary to reevaluate the relative benefits of bypass surgery and percutaneous interventions in patients with multivessel disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 1205 patients were randomly assigned to undergo stent implantation or bypass surgery when a cardiac surgeon and an interventional cardiologist agreed that the same extent of revascularization could be achieved by either technique. The primary clinical end point was freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at one year. The costs of hospital resources used were also determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt one year, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the rates of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Among patients who survived without a stroke or a myocardial infarction, 16.8 percent of those in the stenting group underwent a second revascularization, as compared with 3.5 percent of those in the surgery group. The rate of event-free survival at one year was 73.8 percent among the patients who received stents and 87.8 percent among those who underwent bypass surgery (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The costs for the initial procedure were $4,212 less for patients assigned to stenting than for those assigned to bypass surgery, but this difference was reduced during follow-up because of the increased need for repeated revascularization; after one year, the net difference in favor of stenting was estimated to be $2,973 per patient.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs measured one year after the procedure, coronary stenting for multivessel disease is less expensive than bypass surgery and offers the same degree of protection against death, stroke, and myocardial infarction.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLate stent thrombosis related to delayed neointimal growth is a major concern after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. The time course of neointimal growth and risk factors of uncovered stent struts after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) was studied using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe 60 patients were enrolled and classified into G1 (follow-up period <9 months, n=27), G2 (9-24 months, n=18), and G3 (>25 months, n=15). The time elapsed since SES implantation was associated with a significant increase in mean neointimal area and neointimal thickness, and also with a significant decrease in the number of uncovered stent struts (G1: 14.8%, G2: 11.7%, and G3: 4.1%, P<0.001). However, only 17.6% of implanted SES was completely covered by neointima, even in the G3 period. Small-diameter SES, complex coronary lesions with lipid and calcium content adjacent to stent struts, and diabetes predicted delayed neointimal coverage of SES struts in G1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeointima inside SES progressively increases after the routine follow-up period, but only a few SES were completely covered at 3 years after implantation. OCT is a useful modality for assessing neointimal formation after SES implantation, and may give important information about the strategy of antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIt has been suggested that sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) provoke a more sustained inflammatory response (IR) in neointimal hyperplasia (NIH). The purpose of this study was to compare morphological vessel characteristics, including post-stent IR in NIH, between patients with SES and bare metal stents (BMS) using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThirty-seven patients underwent OCT at their post-stent follow-up. OCT signal-intensity deviation (normalized standard-deviation; OCT-NSD) values in NIH were compared between the 2 groups. In addition, the serum concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured. Stent-malapposition rate (1.78% vs. 0.7%; P = 0.016), uncovered stent-strut rate (16% vs. 3.7%; P = 0.0002), peri-stent ulcer like appearance (PSUA; 50% vs. 0%; P = 0.006) were all significantly higher in the SES group than in the BMS group, respectively. The OCT-NSD value was also significantly higher in the SES group than in the BMS group (0.213 \u00b1 0.005 vs. 0.198 \u00b1 0.005; P < 0.001), as was the hs-CRP level (2.54 \u00b1 1.89 vs. 0.64 \u00b1 0.3 mg/L; P = 0.0006). In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between hs-CRP and OCT-NSD (r = 0.471; P = 0.0025).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPSUA-morphology was specific in the SES group, and higher levels of OCT-NSD and hs-CRP after SES implantation suggest sustained IR in NIH compared with following BMS implantation. These different characteristics may be some of the background that promotes thrombus formation as a late-stage post-stent complication of SES.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nRestenosis of drug-eluting stents (DESs) might be different from that of bare metal stent restenosis in diverse ways including mechanisms and time course; however, these have not been fully examined. To gain insight into the mechanisms and time course of DES restenosis, we evaluated the characteristics of restenotic lesions of first generation DES using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe compared the morphological characteristics of early in-stent restenosis (<1 year: E-ISR, n = 43), late ISR (1-3 years: L-ISR, n = 22), and very late ISR (>3 years: VL-ISR, n = 21). OCT qualitative restenotic tissue analysis included the assessment of tissue structure [homogeneous or four types of heterogeneous intima (thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA)-like, layered, patchy or speckled pattern)], the presence of the peri-strut low intensity area (PLIA), microvessels, disruption with cavity, and intraluminal material and was performed at every 1 mm slice of the entire stent length. In addition to a greater trend for heterogeneous intima at the later phase, TCFA-like pattern image, intra-intima microvessels were increased from the early to the very late phase. On the other hand, the speckled pattern image was decreased from the early to the very late phase.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe OCT morphological characteristics of DES restenotic tissue varied at different time-points. OCT images in early DES ISR might be associated with delayed arterial healing, and neoatherosclerosis might contribute to late catch-up phenomenon (L-ISR and VL-ISR) after DES implantation.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The impacts of different time courses and the degree of neointimal growth on neointimal morphology have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the morphological features of neointimal tissue after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Materials and Methods The morphological features of neointimal tissue in stented segments with a maximal percentage of cross-sectional area (CSA) stenosis of neointima were evaluated in 507 DES-treated lesions with >100 \u00b5m mean neointimal thickness on follow-up OCT. Neointimal tissue was categorized as homogeneous, heterogeneous, layered, or neoatherosclerotic. Results In lesions with <50% of neointimal CSA stenosis, homogeneous neointima (68.2%) was predominant, followed by heterogeneous neointima (14.1%) and layered neointima (14.1%). In lesions with \u226550% of neointimal CSA stenosis, layered neointima was most frequently observed (68.3%), followed by neoatherosclerotic neointima (25.2%). In subgroup analysis of lesions with \u226550% of neointimal CSA stenosis, 89.5% of the lesions with a stent age <30 months were layered neointima, while 62.3% of the lesions with a stent age \u226530 months were neoatherosclerotic neointima.

        "title": "Formation and Transformation of Neointima after Drug-eluting Stent Implantation: Insights from Optical Coherence Tomographic Studies",
        "abstract": "After coronary stent implantation, neointima formation resembles the wound healing process as it involves the sequential processes of inflammation, granulation, and remodeling. Because antiproliferative drugs and polymers of drug-eluting stents (DESs) delay vascular healing compared with bare metal stents, fibrin deposition can remain long after stent implantation, or inflammation can be excessive. Delayed vascular healing can be associated with adverse clinical outcomes including DES thrombosis or restenosis, and poor endothelization of DES neointima can accelerate neoatherosclerotic change inside the neointima, further contributing to luminal restenosis or neointimal instability. Despite the lack of correlation between pathologic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings, OCT assessments of neointima under various circumstances can reveal vascular responses to stent therapy. Homogeneous, heterogeneous, and layered neointima patterns can be recognized by OCT and can change with time. Homogeneous neointima might be associated with better clinical outcomes after DES implantation, whereas non-homogeneous neointima or neoatherosclerotic change can be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. However, limited data are currently available, and further studies are required to comprehensively address these questions.",

This study investigated long-term clinical outcomes according to timing of in-stent restenosis (ISR) and neointimal characteristics in patients with drug-eluting stent (DES) ISR after DCB angioplasty. Methods\u2004and\u2004Results: In all, 122 patients (122 ISR lesions), treated with DCB under optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination before and after DCB, were categorized as early ISR (<12 months; E-ISR; n=21) and late ISR (\u226512 months; L-ISR; n=101). Associations between OCT-based neointima characteristics and period of ISR, as well as clinical outcomes after DCB were evaluated. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were a composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization (TLR). Quantitative parameters of the neointima were similar, but qualitative characteristics showed significant differences between the E-ISR and L-ISR groups. The incidence of MACE (33.3% vs. 20.8%; P=0.069) and TLR (33.3% vs. 18.5%; P=0.040) was higher in the E-ISR group. In addition, the incidence of MACE was significantly higher for heterogeneous than non-heterogeneous neointima (43.7% vs. 19.6%; P=0.018), but was not significantly associated with neoatherosclerosis (33.4% vs. 18.4%; P=0.168).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDCB angioplasty is less effective for heterogeneous neointima in DES ISR.

Whether there are different outcomes among those patients being irrespective of their repeated treatments remain a knowledge gap. Methods: A total of 250 patients who underwent initial stent implantation in our hospital, and then were readmitted to receive treatment for the reason of recurrent significant DES-ISR in 2016 were involved. The patients were categorized as early ISR (<12 months; E-ISR; n\u200a=\u200a32) and late ISR (\u226512 months; L-ISR; n\u200a=\u200a218). Associations between patient characteristics and clinical performance, as well as clinical outcomes after a repeated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were evaluated. Primary composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) included cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or target lesion revascularization (TLR). Results: Most baseline characteristics are similar in both groups, except for the period of ISR, initial pre-procedure thrombolysis in myocardial infarction, and some serum biochemical indicators. The incidence of MACE (37.5% vs. 5.5%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and TLR (37.5% vs. 5.0%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001) is higher in the E-ISR group.
