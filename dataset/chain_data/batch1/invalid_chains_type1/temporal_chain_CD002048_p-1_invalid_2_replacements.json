        "abstract": "A cross sectional analysis of the correlation between clinical, laboratory, and radiological markers of disease activity in 98 patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reported. The median age was 38 years, the median age at onset of disease 29 years, and the median duration of disease seven years. The Keitel function test (KFT) showed good correlation with the Ritchie articular index (RAI) (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.5) and the disability questionnaire (DQ) (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.6). The RAI and DQ correlated weakly with laboratory variables, while the KFT showed significant correlation with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and plasma viscosity (PV) (p less than 0.001; r = 0.4; 0.3; 0.4). Only the KFT showed significant correlations with bone mass measurements (p less than 0.01; r = -0.3; -0.4), and the Larsen index at the right wrist (p less than 0.0001; r = 0.4). Consensus analysis suggested that the KFT is a useful single clinical test of disease activity in RA. The hand functional index (HFI), a component of the KFT, showed significant correlation with the total KFT (r = 0.9). Prospective drug trials are needed to establish the value of the HFI in the monitoring of patients with RA.",

A second goal was to explore the extent to which pain pressure thresholds, age, and depression explain the variance in spindle incidence.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cross-sectional descriptive study.\n\n\nSETTING\nA university-based sleep research laboratory and a referral clinic for chronic fatigue and pain.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nThirty-seven medication-free women with FM (mean age, 44.9 +/- 8 years) and 30 women with self-reported good sleep and no pain (mean age, 44.1 +/- 7.7 years) completed a psychiatric interview and the Beck Depression Inventory prior to 2 consecutive nights of polysomnography, with pain measures obtained in the morning. Time domain analysis of spindle incidence and spectral analysis of spindle frequency activity were conducted on night 2 of polysomnography recordings.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nNA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen with FM had fewer mean spindles per minute of NREM stage 2 sleep and lower mean spindle time per epoch of NREM stage 2 sleep (both P values < .02), but mean spindle duration, although slightly shorter, was not statistically significantly different (P < .06) compared to control women. Women with FM had a lower mean pressure pain threshold, a higher average number of positive tender points, and higher skinfold tenderness compared to control women (all P values < .001). Group differences in spindle frequency activity were found after controlling for age, depression, and psychiatric diagnosis in a general linear model (P < .02). One-way analysis of variance revealed significantly lower spindle activity in the 3 frequency bins (12-12.5 Hz, 13-13.5 Hz, 14-14.5 Hz) at C3 (all P values < .04), Fz (all P values < .02), and Cz (all P values < .02). Finally, after controlling for age and depression, pain pressure threshold significantly predicted spindles per minute and spindle time per epoch of NREM stage 2 sleep (r2 = .26; P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWomen with FM and pain have fewer sleep spindles and reduced electroencephalogram power in spindle frequency activity compared to control women of similar age. These data imply that some aspect of thalamocortical mechanisms of spindle generation might be impaired in FM.",

Summary of Background Data. The clinical syndrome of spinal stenosis is common and disabling, but not clearly related to anatomic measures. Prognosis not well studied. Methods. Persons 55 to 80 years of age with and without stenosis on preliminary review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and asymptomatic volunteers underwent screening, questionnaires, physical examination, ambulation testing, masked electromyogram (EMG), and masked MRI scans; these were repeated at >18 months. Results. Twenty-three asymptomatic, 28 back pain, and 32 clinically diagnosed stenosis subjects underwent follow-up. Although initial and follow-up diagnosis tended to agree (kappa = 0.394, P < 001), there were substantial shifts between the three groups. Among persons with clinically diagnosed stenosis, every measure trended for improvement, including significant changes in pain, ambulation, and EMG. Ambulation velocity and Pain Disability Index at follow-up were predicted by initial disability measures. Pain was predicted by initial sleep difficulty but not initial pain. EMG and MRI did not predict function or pain. Conclusion. Clinically recognized spinal stenosis is fluctuating and largely improving, and in continuum with back pain and no symptoms. Since anatomic and neurologic deficits do not predict future function, they should not be weighed heavily in surgical risk-benefit discussions.",

        "abstract": "Objectives. Poor sleep is associated with chronic widespread pain (CWP). Conversely, good-quality sleep may play a role in the resolution of pain symptoms. Sleep is a multidimensional construct, comprising a number of diverse components. The aims of the current study were to examine the hypotheses that: (i) good sleep quality would predict the resolution of CWP, (ii) restorative sleep would predict the resolution of CWP and (iii) that these relationships would be independent of confounding psychological factors. Methods. Subjects in a population-based prospective study completed a pain questionnaire at baseline from which subjects with CWP were identified. Baseline sleep was measured using the Estimation of Sleep Problems Scale which measures sleep onset, maintenance, early wakening and restorative sleep. The questionnaire also contained scales examining psychosocial status. Subjects were followed up 15 months later and pain status was assessed. Results. A total of 1061 subjects reported CWP at baseline of whom 679 (75% of eligible subjects) responded at follow-up. Of those, a total of 300 (44%) no longer satisfied criteria for CWP. Univariate analysis revealed that three of the four sleep components were associated with the resolution of CWP: rapid sleep onset, odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.5; absence of early wakening, OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.4; and restorative sleep, OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.5, 4.8. After adjusting for the effect of psychosocial factors, which may have confounded the relationship, only restorative sleep (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.02, 3.8) was associated. Conclusions. Self-reported restorative sleep was independently associated with the resolution of CWP and return to musculoskeletal health.",

Eighteen other chronic conditions were assessed with medical/pharmacy claims records and validated self-report scales. Insomnia had a significant odds ratio with workplace accidents and/or errors controlled for other chronic conditions (1.4). The odds ratio did not vary significantly with respondent age, sex, educational level, or comorbidity. The average costs of insomnia-related accidents and errors ($32 062) were significantly higher than those of other accidents and errors ($21 914). Simulations estimated that insomnia was associated with 7.2% of all costly workplace accidents and errors and 23.7% of all the costs of these incidents. These proportions are higher than for any other chronic condition, with annualized US population projections of 274 000 costly insomnia-related workplace accidents and errors having a combined value of US $31.1 billion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEffectiveness trials are needed to determine whether expanded screening, outreach, and treatment of workers with insomnia would yield a positive return on investment for employers.",

Primary care physicians administered a questionnaire that included assessment of sociodemographic characteristics, sleep disturbance and accidents (motor vehicle, work and home) related to sleep problems to each subject. Insomnia was defined using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD\u201010) criteria. A total of 5293 subjects were included in the study, of whom 20.9% reported having had at least one home accident within the past 12 months, 10.1% at least one work accident, 9% reported having fallen asleep while driving at least once and 4.1% reported having had at least one car accident related to their sleepiness. All types of accident were reported more commonly by subjects living in urban compared to other residential areas. Car accidents were reported more commonly by employed subjects, whereas home injuries were reported more frequently by the unemployed. Car accidents were reported more frequently by males than by females, whereas home accidents were reported more commonly by females. Patients with insomnia have high rates of home accidents, car accidents and work accidents related to sleep disturbances independently of any adverse effects of hypnotic treatments. Reduced total sleep time may be one factor explaining the high risk of accidents in individuals who complain of insomnia.",

        "abstract": "Significance Insomnia is a common symptom representing an important health burden. Widely prescribed hypnotic agents enhance the function of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. The ability to arouse and respond to unexpected stimuli is a feature of normal sleep, and one of the concerns of this class of hypnotic agents is that patients may become physically and/or cognitively impaired while the drug is in effect. As a new approach for the treatment of insomnia, orexin receptor antagonists have been recently approved, which specifically inhibit the orexin-mediated wake-promoting system, supposedly without affecting the whole brain. We found that, compared with the GABA receptor agonist brotizolam, the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant induced less impairment in body balance after taking the medicine. The majority of patients with insomnia are treated with hypnotic agents. In the present study, we evaluated the side-effect profile of an orexin receptor antagonist and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor agonist on physical/cognitive functions upon forced awakening. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted on 30 healthy male subjects. Fifteen minutes before bedtime, the subjects took a pill of suvorexant (20 mg), brotizolam (0.25 mg), or placebo and were forced awake 90 min thereafter. Physical- and cognitive-function tests were performed before taking the pill, after forced awakening, and the next morning. Polysomnographic recordings revealed that the efficacies of the hypnotic agents in prolonging total sleep time (\u223c30 min) and increasing sleep efficiency (\u223c6%) were comparable. When the subjects were allowed to go back to sleep after the forced awakening, the sleep latency was shorter under the influence of hypnotic agents (\u223c2 min) compared to the placebo trial (24 min), and the rapid eye movement latency was significantly shorter under suvorexant (98.8, 81.7, and 48.8 min for placebo, brotizolam, and suvorexant, respectively). Although brotizolam significantly impaired the overall physical/cognitive performance (sum of z score) compared with placebo upon forced awakening, there was no significant difference in the total z score of performance between suvorexant and placebo. Notably, the score for static balance with the eyes open was higher under suvorexant compared to brotizolam administration. The energy expenditure was lower under suvorexant and brotizolam compared with the placebo. The effect size of brotizolam (d = 0.24) to reduce the energy expenditure was larger than that of suvorexant (d < 0.01).",

        "title": "Associations of sleep disorders with all-cause MCI/dementia and different types of dementia \u2013 clinical evidence, potential pathomechanisms and treatment options: A narrative review",
        "abstract": "Due to worldwide demographic change, the number of older persons in the population is increasing. Aging is accompanied by changes of sleep structure, deposition of beta-amyloid (A\u00df) and tau proteins and vascular changes and can turn into mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as dementia. Sleep disorders are discussed both as a risk factor for and as a consequence of MCI/dementia. Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based as well as case\u2013control studies revealed sleep disorders, especially sleep-disorderded breathing (SDB) and excessive or insufficient sleep durations, as risk factors for all-cause MCI/dementia. Regarding different dementia types, SDB was especially associated with vascular dementia while insomnia/insufficient sleep was related to an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Scarce and still inconsistent evidence suggests that therapy of sleep disorders, especially continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in SDB, can improve cognition in patients with sleep disorders with and without comorbid dementia and delay onset of MCI/dementia in patients with sleep disorders without previous cognitive impairment. Regarding potential pathomechanisms via which sleep disorders lead to MCI/dementia, disturbed sleep, chronic sleep deficit and SDB can impair glymphatic clearance of beta-amyloid (A\u00df) and tau which lead to amyloid deposition and tau aggregation resulting in changes of brain structures responsible for cognition. Orexins are discussed to modulate sleep and A\u00df pathology. Their diurnal fluctuation is suppressed by sleep fragmentation and the expression suppressed at the point of hippocampal atrophy, contributing to the progression of dementia. Additionally, sleep disorders can lead to an increased vascular risk profile and vascular changes such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis which can foster neurodegenerative pathology. There is ample evidence indicating that changes of sleep structure in aging persons can lead to dementia and also evidence that therapy of sleep disorder can improve cognition. Therefore, sleep disorders should be identified and treated early.",

        "explanation": "This paper reviews the relationship between sleep disorders and dementia, and discusses the potential pathomechanisms underlying this relationship. It mentions orexins as a potential modulator of sleep and A\u03b2 pathology, which is related to the topic of the source paper. However, it does not directly build on the source paper's findings or hypotheses."
