        "title": "Tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 production induced in T lymphocytes through the AIM/CD69 activation pathway",
        "abstract": "Human activation inducer molecule (AIM/CD69), a dimeric glycoprotein of 33 and 27 kDa, is the earliest inducible cell surface antigen expressed during lymphocyte activation, which has been also involved in lymphocyte proliferation. Although AIM is absent from peripheral blood resting lymphocytes, it is expressed by in vivo activated lymphocytes infiltrating sites of chronic inflammation in several pathologies, as well as by lymphocytes after in vitro activation with different stimuli. We have investigated the possibility that tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) gene expression and protein secretion could be induced in peripheral blood T cells through the AIM/CD69 molecule. Anti\u2010AIM monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were able to induce TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion in T cells when protein kinase C (PKC) was simultaneously activated by treatment with phorbol esters. TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion was detected at 24 h and peaked at day 3 upon T lymphocyte activation with anti\u2010AIM mAb. Immunoprecipitation studies with an anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b1 mAb from surface iodinated T cells activated through AIM, demonstrated that TNF\u2010\u03b1 first appeared as a cell surface molecular form of 26 kDa, which is subsequently released to the extracellular medium as the 17\u2010kDa molecular form of TNF\u2010\u03b1. AIM stimulation dramatically increased TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA levels, and this mRNA induction and subsequent TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion were virtually abrogated by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. Taken together these results indicate that AIM constitutes a novel molecular pathway in T lymphocytes for induction of TNF\u2010\u03b1, and suggest a relevant pathologic role for AIM+ lymphocytes located at sites of tissue injury in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder. The patients have repeated exacerbations and remissions of the symptoms. This disease may produce a wide variety of symptoms. In mild cases, mucocutaneous lesions are only the symptoms during the whole clinical course, whereas ocular lesions, which occur in about 70% of the patients, can cause blindness. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, CNS and large vessels is less frequent, but sometimes life-threatening. Colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are employed for the treatment of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease with therapies tailored to individual patients depending on clinical manifestations. Cyclosporin A is the most effective drug for ocular lesions at the present, but its neurotoxicity, which occurs in 20 - 30% of patients receiving cyclosporin A, restricts usage of the agent. Many patients are still suffering from a severe form of uveitis and serious neurological symptoms, which are resistant to any conventional therapies. New drugs have been investigated for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. IFN-\u03b1 therapy has shown significant efficacy for common symptoms including ocular lesions without any serious adverse effects. Thalidomide and its analogues also appear to be applicable to this disease. Monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 is now in clinical trials. These novel therapeutic approaches may provide much needed treatment options for patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.",

        "title": "Mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses of thalidomide.",
        "abstract": "Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of Contergan in 1956, as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, advocated to ensure a good nights sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from the market since 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies exposed to thalidomide in utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history, thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. Subsequently, thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.",

        "abstract": "Thalidomide (Thd), a potent teratogen, was shown to have therapeutic potential in cancer, primarily in multiple myeloma (MM), yet its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. It was recently suggested that its teratogenicity is derived from interference in expression of genes regulated by GC-rich promoters by blocking the binding of SP1 transcription factor to its motif. We explored the validation of the proposed model by focusing on potential molecular targets associated with MM pathogenesis. Cell lines RPMI 8226, U266, and ARH-77 were exposed for 24 h to racemic Thd and analyzed for apoptosis, membranal expression of CD29 and CD63, transcript level of hTERT, CD63, and IGFI-R (characterized by GC-rich motifs) and telomerase activity. Analysis of an hTERT core promoter reporter gene expression [enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)] in transiently transfected RPMI 8226 incubated with racemic and steric (+/-)-enantiomers of Thd was performed. A consistent reduction ( approximately 10-40%) in transcript levels of all three assayed genes in all three cell lines was demonstrated in the presence of racemic Thd. Significant reduction of EGFP was demonstrated in cells transfected with hTERT reporter gene and treated with racemic and (S)-Thd. Our results show that Thd's antimyeloma activity can be ascribed to the same mechanism responsible for its teratogenic effect and that the inhibition of GC-rich promoter genes is mostly attributed to the S-racemate. Indeed, this selectivity delineates GC-rich promoter genes as a unique group eligible for specific drug targeting.",

        "abstract": "Telomeres are specialized chromosomal end structures composed of repeat TTAGGG sequences in humans. They shorten with each cell division and thus serve as the \"mitotic clock\" of the cell. One of their main functions is the maintenance of chromosomal integrity and their excessive shortening is associated with DNA instability. Telomerase, a unique reverse transcriptase, is inactive in most somatic human cells and is up-regulated in most cancer cells. Recently, the biology of the telomere/telomerase system has attracted much attention because of its possible role in carcinogenesis and aging. In this article we review the biology of this system and its relevance to normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. The biological, diagnostic and prognostic value of telomere/telomerase biology is discussed, as well as its potential future applications in cancer therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to investigate the binding of 13 alkaloids to two GC-rich DNA duplexes which are critical sequences in human survivin promoter. Negative ion ESI-MS was first applied to screen the binding of the alkaloids to the duplexes. Six alkaloids (including berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine) show complexation with the target DNA sequences. Relative binding affinities were estimated from the negative ion ESI data, and the alkaloids show a binding preference to the duplex with higher GC content. Positive ion ESI mass spectra of the complexes were also recorded and compared with those obtained in negative ion mode. Only the 1 : 1 complex with berbamine was observed with lower abundance in the positive ion mass spectrum while complexes with the other alkaloids were absolutely absent. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments indicate that the complexes with the protoberberine alkaloids (berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine) dissociate via base loss and covalent cleavage. In contrast, product ion spectra of the complexes with the alkaloids reserpine, berbamine, and tetrandrine show the predominant loss of a neutral alkaloid molecule, accompanied by base loss and covalent cleavage to a lesser extent. A comparison of the gas-phase behaviors of complexes with the alkaloids to those with the traditional DNA binders has suggested an intercalative binding mode of these alkaloids to the target DNA duplexes.",

        "abstract": "Chromatin has been successfully used as a tool for the study of genome function in cancers. Vincristine as a vinca alkaloid anticancer drug exerts its action by binding to tubulins. In this study the effect of vincristine on DNA and chromatin was investigated employing various spectroscopy techniques as well as thermal denaturation, equilibrium dialysis and DNA-cellulose affinity. The results showed that the binding of vincristine to DNA and chromatin reduced absorbance at both 260 and 210 nm with different extent. Chromopheres of chromatin quenched with the drug and fluorescence emission intensity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin exhibited higher emission intensity changes compared to DNA. Upon addition of vincristine, Tm of DNA and chromatin exhibited hypochromicity without any shift in Tm. The binding of the drug induced structural changes in both positive and negative extremes of circular dichroism spectra and exhibited a cooperative binding pattern as illustrated by a positive slope observed in low r values of the binding isotherm. Vincristine showed higher binding affinity to double stranded DNA compared to single stranded one. The results suggest that vincristine binds with higher affinity to chromatin compared to DNA. The interaction is through intercalation along with binding to phosphate sugar backbone and histone proteins play fundamental role in this process. The binding of the drug to chromatin opens a new insight into vincristine action in the cell nucleus.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The thiopurine drugs azathioprine and mercaptopurine are effective in the treatment of disorders of immune regulation and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Although developed in the 1950s, thiopurines remained relevant in the anti-tumour necrosis factor biologic era, finding widespread use as a co-immunomodulator. Step changes in the management of patients treated with thiopurines have reduced the incidence of severe, sometimes life-threatening toxicity. Testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency directs a safe initial dose for therapy. The introduction of red cell thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) monitoring provides a basis for dose adjustment and the identification of patients with high levels of red cell methylmercaptopurine (MMP) and an increase in the MMP:TGN ratio. These patients are at risk for hepatotoxicity and where TGN levels are sub-therapeutic, non-response to therapy. Switching thiopurine hypermethylators to low-dose thiopurine and allopurinol combination therapy resolves hepatoxicity and increases sub-therapeutic TGN levels to regain clinical response. NUDT15 variants are a common cause of severe myelotoxicity in Asian populations where the frequency of TPMT deficiency is low. There is increasing evidence that testing for NUDT15 and TPMT deficiency in all populations prior to the start of thiopurine therapy is clinically useful and should be the first step in personalising thiopurine therapy.",

Our results show that 4-acetyloxybenzyl- and cycloSaligenyl-derivatized 6sGMP prodrugs are effective antiproliferative compounds in cells that are resistant to thiopurines.
