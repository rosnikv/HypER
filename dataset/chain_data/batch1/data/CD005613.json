The insulin dose was titrated by using a predefined regimen to achieve fasting blood glucose levels of 5.56 mmol\/L or lower (< or =100 mg\/dL).\n                Hemoglobin A(1c) values, blood glucose levels, insulin dose, and body weight.\n                Hemoglobin A(1c) levels improved by -1.24% (two-sided 90% CI, -1.10% to -1.38%) with morning insulin glargine, by -0.96% (CI, -0.81% to -1.10%) with bedtime insulin glargine, and by -0.84% (CI, -0.69% to -0.98%) with bedtime NPH insulin. Hemoglobin A(1c) improvement was more pronounced with morning insulin glargine than with NPH insulin (0.40% [CI, 0.23% to 0.58%]; P = 0.001) or bedtime insulin glargine (0.28% [CI, 0.11% to 0.46%]; P = 0.008). Baseline to end-point fasting blood glucose levels improved similarly in all three groups. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was less frequent with morning (39 of 236 patients [17%]) and bedtime insulin glargine (52 of 227 patients [23%]) than with bedtime NPH insulin (89 of 232 patients [38%]) (P < 0.001).\n                The risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia was lower with glimepiride in combination with morning and bedtime insulin glargine than with glimepiride in combination with bedtime NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Morning insulin glargine provided better glycemic control than did bedtime insulin glargine or bedtime NPH insulin.",

        "Abstract":"Basal insulin is frequently administered once daily. This subgroup analysis of a multicenter, randomized, parallel study compared insulin glargine (Lantus Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes, evaluating only patients treated previously with once-daily NPH insulin.\n                Patients received bedtime insulin glargine or NPH insulin, with preprandial regular insulin. One hundred patients (mean age, 57.9 years; mean glycohemoglobin, 8.4%; mean fasting blood glucose, 167 mg\/dL) were treated for up to 28 weeks.\n                Patients treated with insulin glargine (n = 52) and NPH insulin (n = 48) achieved similar reductions from baseline in glycohemoglobin (-0.41% versus -0.46%) and fasting blood glucose (-22 mg\/dL versus -22 mg\/dL) at week 28. The proportion of patients reaching target fasting blood glucose (<120 mg\/dL) at 28 weeks was 34.2% with insulin glargine and 24.4% with NPH insulin. Similar proportions of patients achieved glycohemoglobin less than 7% and less than 8% in both groups. Baseline and week-28 mean daily doses of insulin glargine (27.3 IU versus 36.4 IU) were similar to NPH insulin doses (25.5 IU versus 30.2 IU). However, significantly fewer patients reported one or more episodes of hypoglycemia with insulin glargine (46.2%) versus NPH insulin (60.4%; P < 0.05). Significantly fewer patients also reported one or more symptomatic episodes confirmed by blood glucose less than 50 mg\/dL with insulin glargine (17.3%) versus NPH insulin (31.3%; P < 0.005).\n                Bedtime insulin glargine is as effective as bedtime NPH insulin in improving glycemic control, with significantly less hypoglycemia.",

Patients, randomized 2:1 to insulin detemir or NPH insulin, received basal insulin either once or twice daily according to their pretrial insulin treatment and insulin aspart at mealtimes.\n                After 26 weeks of treatment, significant reductions in HbA(1c) were observed for insulin detemir (0.2%-points, p = 0.004) and NPH insulin (0.4%-points; p = 0.0001); HbA(1c) levels were comparable at study end (insulin detemir, 7.6%; NPH insulin, 7.5%). The number of basal insulin injections administered per day had no effect on HbA(1c) levels (p = 0.50). Nine-point self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) profiles were similar for the two treatment groups (p = 0.58), as were reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (insulin detemir, 0.5 mmol\/l; NPH insulin, 0.6 mmol\/l). At study end, FPG concentrations were similar for the two treatment groups (p = 0.66). By contrast, within-subject day-to-day variation in fasting SMBG was significantly lower with insulin detemir (p = 0.021). Moreover, patients receiving insulin detemir gained significantly less body weight than those who were administered NPH insulin (1.0 and 1.8 kg, respectively, p = 0.017). The frequency of adverse events and the risk of hypoglycaemia were comparable for the two treatment groups.\n                Patients with type 2 diabetes, treated for 26 weeks with insulin detemir plus insulin aspart at mealtimes, experienced comparable glycaemic control but significantly lower within-subject variability and less weight gain compared to patients treated with NPH insulin and insulin aspart.

        "Abstract":"In normal subjects, approximately half of the daily insulin requirement constitutes basal insulin. We investigated whether increasing the dose of insulin glargine up to half of the total insulin requirement could lead to better glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients who were treated on basal-prandial insulin therapy. A total of 62 patients with type 2 diabetes on mealtime rapid-acting insulin analogue and bedtime NPH were randomized to either continuation of bedtime NPH (n=31) or morning glargine (n=31) for 6 months while continuing the aspart\/lispro at each meal. The two groups were matched for age, sex, diabetes duration, BMI, HbA(1C), endogenous insulin secretion, and proportion of numbers using aspart\/lispro and using oral hypoglycemic agents. The dose of insulin glargine was increased by 2-4 units to meet the target fasting blood glucose, whereas the dose of NPH was principally unchanged as a control group. Mean HbA(1C) at baseline was similar between patients with glargine and NPH (7.2% versus 6.9%). The percentage of glargine dose increased significantly (31% at baseline to 48% at 6 months) without any significant changes in total insulin dose. Mean HbA(1C) at 3 months was 6.6% with glargine and 7.0% with NPH (P<0.0001, adjusted mean change between-treatment difference 0.6% [95% CI 0.3-0.9]), and the values at 6 months were 6.6% and 6.9%, respectively (P=0.007). Frequency of hypoglycemia did not differ between the groups. Increasing the dose of glargine without changing the total daily insulin dose resulted in significantly better glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients on basal-prandial insulin therapy. Conversion from bedtime NPH to morning glargine appears efficacious with no increase in frequency of hypoglycemia.",

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients often fail to achieve adequate glycemic control with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Insulin has been shown to improve glycemic control in these patients but with increased risk of hypoglycemia. This study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine and NPH insulin, both in combination with a once-daily fixed dose of glimepiride, in terms of glycemic control and incidence of hypoglycemia.\n                In this open-label, 24-week randomized trial in ten Latin American countries, T2DM patients poorly controlled on OADs (HbA1c > or = 7.5 and < or = 10.5%) received glimepiride plus insulin glargine (n = 231) or NPH insulin (n = 250) using a forced titration algorithm. The primary endpoint was the equivalence of 24-week mean changes in HbA1c.\n                Insulin glargine and NPH insulin achieved similar HbA1c reductions (adjusted mean difference -0.047; 90% CI -0.232, 0.138; per-protocol analysis). Confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower with insulin glargine vs. NPH insulin (16.9 vs. 30.0%; p <0.01; safety analysis). Patients receiving insulin glargine were significantly more likely to achieve HbA1c levels < 7.0% without hypoglycemia (27 vs. 17%; p = 0.014; per-protocol analysis). There was a more pronounced treatment satisfaction improvement with insulin glargine vs. NPH insulin (p <0.02; full analysis). The proportion of patients who lost time from work or normal activities due to diabetes was lower with insulin glargine vs. NPH (1.8 vs. 3.3%; full analysis).\n                In patients with T2DM, inadequately controlled on OADs, once-daily insulin glargine plus glimepiride is effective in improving metabolic control with a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin.",

The primary focus was changes in HbA(1c); secondary focus was diurnal glucose profiles and symptomatic hypoglycaemia.\n                In this investigator-initiated open, parallel-group clinical trial involving seven centres, 110 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) >or=8.0%) on oral hypoglycaemic agents (90% using sulfonylurea plus metformin) were randomised to receive bedtime insulin glargine with metformin (G+MET) or bedtime NPH with metformin (NPH+MET) for 36 weeks. The patients were taught how to self-adjust their insulin dose and use a modem to send the results of home glucose monitoring to treatment centres. The goal was to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol\/l in both groups.\n                During the last 12 weeks, FPGs averaged 5.75+\/-0.02 and 5.96+\/-0.03 mmol\/l (p<0.001) and insulin doses were 68+\/-5 and 70+\/-6 IU\/day (0.69+\/-0.05 and 0.66+\/-0.04 IU kg(-1) day(-1), NS) in the G+MET and NPH+MET groups, respectively. At 36 weeks, mean HbA(1c) was 7.14+\/-0.12 and 7.16+\/-0.14%, respectively (NS). Symptomatic, but not confirmed symptomatic, hypoglycaemia was significantly lower during the first 12 weeks in the G+MET group (4.1+\/-0.8 episodes\/patient-year) than in the NPH+MET group (9.0+\/-2.3 episodes\/patient-year, p<0.05), but not significantly different thereafter. Glucose levels before dinner were higher in the NPH+MET group (10.1+\/-0.3 mmol\/l) than in the G+MET group (8.6+\/-0.3 mmol\/l, p=0.002) throughout the 36-week study. With regard to baseline characteristics such as initial glycaemia or C-peptide, there was no difference between patients who achieved good glycaemic control (HbA(1c) <7.0%) and those who did not. Differences were seen in the following: between study centres, weight gain during the run-in period and insulin therapy, and FPG during the last 12 weeks (5.7+\/-0.2 vs 6.7+\/-0.3 mmol\/l for patients reaching vs those not reaching target, p<0.01).\n                Good glycaemic control can be achieved with both G+MET and NPH+MET. Use of G+MET reduces symptomatic hypoglycaemia during the first 12 weeks and dinner time hyperglycaemia compared with NPH+MET.",
