        "Title": "Sirolimus-eluting stents for treatment of patients with long atherosclerotic lesions in small coronary arteries: double-blind, randomised controlled trial (E-SIRIUS).",
        "Abstract": "Sirolimus-eluting stents have been developed to prevent restenosis in the treatment of coronary artery disease. We investigated the risk of restenosis with use of sirolimus-eluting stents compared with bare-metal stents to assess possible differences.\n                We enrolled 352 patients in whom one coronary artery required treatment, with diameter 2.5-3.0 mm and lesion length 15-32 mm. We randomly assigned patients sirolimus-eluting stents (n=175) or bare-metal stents (control, n=177). At 8 months we assessed differences in minimum lumen diameter and binary restenosis within the lesion (restenosis of > or =50% diameter, including 5 mm vessel segments proximal and distal to stented segment). Patients were also followed up for 9 months for major adverse cardiac events. Analysis was by intention to treat.\n                Stent implantation was successful in 100% of sirolimus-stent patients and 99.4% of controls. The mean diameter of treated coronary arteries was 2.55 mm (SD 0.37) and mean lesion length was 15.0 mm (6.0). Multiple stents were implanted in 170 (48%) patients. At 8 months, minimum lumen diameter was significantly higher with sirolimus-eluting stents than with control stents (2.22 vs 1.33 mm, p<0.0001). The rate of binary restenosis was significantly reduced with sirolimus-eluting stents compared with control stents (5.9 vs 42.3%, p=0.0001). Significantly fewer patients with sirolimus-eluting stents had major adverse cardiac events at 9 months than did controls (8.0 vs 22.6%, p=0.0002), due mainly to a lower need for target-lesion revascularisations (4.0 vs 20.9%, p<0.0001).\n                Sirolimus-eluting stents are better than bare-metal stents for treatment of single long atherosclerotic lesions in a coronary vessel smaller than 3 mm in diameter.",

        "Abstract": "Early clinical studies demonstrated the feasibility of local paclitaxel delivery in reducing restenosis after treatment of de novo coronary lesions in small patient populations.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of 536 patients at 38 medical centers evaluating slow-release (SR) and moderate-release (MR) formulations of a polymer-based paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS) for revascularization of single, primary lesions in native coronary arteries. Cohort I compared TAXUS-SR with control stents, and Cohort II compared TAXUS-MR with a second control group. The primary end point was 6-month percent in-stent net volume obstruction measured by intravascular ultrasound. Secondary end points were 6-month angiographic restenosis and 6- and 12-month incidence of major adverse cardiac events, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization. At 6 months, percent net volume obstruction within the stent was significantly lower for TAXUS stents (7.9% SR and 7.8% MR) than for respective controls (23.2% and 20.5%; P<0.0001 for both). This corresponded with a reduction in angiographic restenosis from 17.9% to 2.3% in the SR cohort (P<0.0001) and from 20.2% to 4.7% in the MR cohort (P=0.0002). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events at 12 months was significantly lower (P=0.0192) in the TAXUS-SR (10.9%) and TAXUS-MR (9.9%) groups than in controls (22.0% and 21.4%, respectively), predominantly because of a significant reduction in repeat revascularization of the target lesion in TAXUS-treated patients.\n                Compared with a bare metal stent, paclitaxel-eluting stents reduced in-stent neointimal formation and restenosis and improved 12-month clinical outcome of patients with single de novo coronary lesions.",

        "Abstract": "We assessed the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in treating single de novo long lesions in small native coronary arteries compared to an identical bare metal stent (BMS).\n                The SES was previously demonstrated to reduce restenosis significantly. However, patients with long lesions in small vessels have not been well studied and may define a group at very high risk.\n                The Canadian Study of the Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in the Treatment of Patients With Long De Novo Lesions in Small Native Coronary Arteries (C-SIRIUS) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing SES versus identical BMS. The primary end point was in-stent minimal lumen diameter (MLD) at eight months. Secondary end points included angiographic restenosis at 8 months, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 270 days.\n                A total of 100 patients were enrolled at eight Canadian sites. The in-stent MLD at eight months was 2.46 +/- 0.37 mm in the SES compared with 1.49 +/- 0.75 mm in the BMS (a 65% increase, p < 0.001). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 1 of 44 SES patients (2.3%, with no in-stent restenosis) and in 23 of 44 BMS patients (52.3%, p < 0.001). At 270 days, there were two clinically driven TLRs in the SES (4%) and nine in the BMS (18%, p = 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from MACE at 270 days was 96.0% for SES patients and 81.7% for BMS patients (p = 0.029).\n                Patients with long lesions in small vessels are at very high risk of restenosis. In these patients, the SES dramatically reduces the risk of restenosis at eight months, translating into an excellent clinical outcome at nine months.",

Quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound were performed post procedure and at six-month follow-up.\n                In the QuaDDS group, early stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction (MI) rates were significantly higher, leading to premature cessation of enrollment. For the QuaDDS group, the stent thrombosis rate increased from 3.2% to 10.3% between 1 and 12 months, associated with increased non-Q-wave MI and death rates. The angiographic restenosis rate at six months was reduced from 32.7% (control) to 7.4% (p < 0.0001).

        "Abstract": "ABT-578 is a new synthetic analog of rapamycin, designed to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation-a key contributor to restenosis-by blocking the function of the mTOR cell cycle regulatory protein. Given these pharmacodynamics, ABT-578 was considered beneficial for intracoronary delivery to arrest the process responsible for neointimal hyperplasia after angioplasty and stenting. Consequently, the ABT-578-eluting ENDEAVOR stent system has been created, representing a potential new alternative for treating patients with coronary heart disease. In order to evaluate safety, feasibility and efficacy of this stent design, the ENDEAVOR clinical program has been started, including three randomized clinical trials. ENDEAVOR I is the first-in-man trial including 100 patients with native de novo coronary lesions. The 4-month follow-up data, recently presented, demonstrated safety and feasibility of this new drug-eluting stent (DES) concept with a 4-month MACE (major adverse cardiac events) rate of 2.0%. In order to evaluate this stent system in a larger patient population as well as more complex lesion subsets, the multicenter study ENDEAVOR II has been started including a total of 1,200 patients. The enrollment of this study was completed in January 2004. The aim of the US multicenter study ENDEAVOR III is a head-to-head comparison of the ENDEAVOR ABT-578-eluting stent system with the already approved sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent in 369 patients. If the results of both pivotal studies ENDEAVOR II and III confirm the efficacy of the ENDEAVOR stent design observed so far, the ENDEAVOR stent will be established as a new and promising contender in the field of DES.",

        "Abstract": "The use of a stent to deliver a drug may reduce in-stent restenosis. Paclitaxel interrupts the smooth muscle cell cycle by stabilizing microtubules, thereby arresting mitosis.\n                On the basis of prior animal studies, the European evaLUation of the pacliTaxel Eluting Stent (ELUTES) pilot clinical trial (n=190) investigated the safety and efficacy of V-Flex Plus coronary stents (Cook Inc) coated with escalating doses of paclitaxel (0.2, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.7 microg/mm2 stent surface area) applied directly to the abluminal surface of the stent in de novo lesions compared with bare stent alone. The primary efficacy end point was angiographic percent diameter stenosis at 6 months. At angiographic follow-up, percent diameter stenosis was 33.9+/-26.7% in controls (n=34) and 14.2+/-16.6% in the 2.7-microg/mm2 group (n=31; P=0.006). Late loss decreased from 0.73+/-0.73 to 0.11+/-0.50 mm (P=0.002). Binary restenosis (> or =50% at follow-up) decreased from 20.6% to 3.2% (P=0.056), with no significant benefit from intermediate paclitaxel doses. Freedom from major adverse cardiac events in the highest (effective) dose group was 92%, 89%, and 86% at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively (P=NS versus control). No late stent thromboses were seen in any treated group despite clopidogrel treatment for 3 months only.\n                Paclitaxel applied directly to the abluminal surface of a bare metal coronary stent, at a dose density of 2.7 microg/mm2, reduced angiographic indicators of in-stent restenosis without short- or medium-term side effects.",

        "Abstract": "Restenosis after coronary stenting necessitates repeated percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedures. The delivery of paclitaxel to the site of vascular injury may reduce the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis.\n                At 73 U.S. centers, we enrolled 1314 patients who were receiving a stent in a single, previously untreated coronary-artery stenosis (vessel diameter, 2.5 to 3.75 mm; lesion length, 10 to 28 mm) in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A total of 652 patients were randomly assigned to receive a bare-metal stent, and 662 to receive an identical-appearing, slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent. Angiographic follow-up was prespecified at nine months in 732 patients.\n                In terms of base-line characteristics, the two groups were well matched. Diabetes mellitus was present in 24.2 percent of patients; the mean reference-vessel diameter was 2.75 mm, and the mean lesion length was 13.4 mm. A mean of 1.08 stents (length, 21.8 mm) were implanted per patient. The rate of ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization at nine months was reduced from 12.0 percent with the implantation of a bare-metal stent to 4.7 percent with the implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent (relative risk, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.59; P<0.001). Target-lesion revascularization was required in 3.0 percent of the group that received a paclitaxel-eluting stent, as compared with 11.3 percent of the group that received a bare-metal stent (relative risk, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.43; P<0.001).

Procedural success and in-hospital outcomes were excellent and did not differ between the 2 groups. At 9 months, clinical restenosis, defined as target-lesion revascularization, was 4.1% in the sirolimus limb versus 16.6% in the control limb (P<0.001). At 12 months, the absolute difference in target-lesion revascularization continued to increase and was 4.9% versus 20% (P<0.001). There were no differences in death or myocardial infarction rates. In high-risk patient subsets, defined by vessel size, lesion length, and presence of diabetes mellitus, there was a 70% to 80% reduction in clinical restenosis at 1 year.\n                Placement of the sirolimus-eluting stent results in continued clinical improvement at 1 year after initial implantation, with significant reduction in clinical restenosis as defined by target-lesion revascularization.

        "Abstract": "Objectives: The STEALTH (STent Eluting A9 BioLimus Trial in Humans) trial was the first-in-man study to assess the safety and efficacy of the bioabsorbable-polymer-coated Biolimus A9-eluting BioMATRIX-Stent, as compared to a bare metal stent control (S-Stent). Methods: One hundred twenty patients were enrolled in a prospective, 2:1 randomised, double-blind, multi-center clinical study. Patients with single de novo coronary lesions received either a Biolimus-eluting stent (n=80 patients with 82 lesions) or bare metal control stent (n=40 patients with 40 lesions). The primary study endpoint was in-lesion late lumen loss at 6 month follow-up. Results: The six month in-lesion late loss was significantly reduced in the Biolimus-eluting stent group (0.14 +/- 0.45mm) as compared to the control (0.40 +/- 0.41mm) (p=0.004). The in-stent late loss was 0.26 +/- 0.43mm in the Biolimus-eluting stent group vs. 0.74 +/- 0.45mm in the control (p<0.001). The secondary study endpoint of event-free survival at 6-months was similar in both groups (96.3% Biolimus group vs. 97.5% control; p=0.72). There was no significant difference in target lesion revascularizations due to the low binary restenosis rates in both groups (3.9% in Biolimus group vs. 7.7% in control; p=ns). Conclusions: In this first-in-man feasibility trial, the bioabsorbable-polymer-coated Biolimus A9-eluting stent demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing 6-month in-stent and in-lesion late loss and percent diameter stenosis, with clinical safety similar to bare metal control stents.",

        "Abstract": "Intracoronary polymer-based stent delivery of paclitaxel has been shown to be effective in reducing restenosis in simple coronary lesions, but the evidence base for contemporary use in longer, more complex coronary stenoses is lacking.\n                TAXUS VI is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial assessing clinical and angiographic outcomes of the TAXUS Moderate Release paclitaxel-eluting stent in the treatment of long, complex coronary artery lesions. Four hundred forty-eight patients at 44 sites were randomized (1:1) between a drug-eluting TAXUS Express2 and an uncoated Express2 control stent. Per protocol, the 9-month follow-up included an angiographic reevaluation in all patients. The primary end point was the rate of target-vessel revascularization 9 months after the study procedure; secondary end points included the rate of target-lesion revascularization and binary restenosis at follow-up. Mean lesion length in the study was 20.6 mm, with a mean stent-covered length of 33.4 mm. Of all lesions, 55.6% were classified as complex lesions (type C of the AHA/ACC classification). At 9 months, target-vessel revascularization was 9.1% in the TAXUS group and 19.4% in the control group (P=0.0027; relative reduction, 53%). Target-lesion revascularization was reduced from 18.9% to 6.8%, respectively (P=0.0001). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events was similar in the 2 groups, 16.4% and 22.5% in TAXUS and control, respectively (P=0.12), including comparable rates for acute myocardial infarction. Binary restenosis in the stented area was reduced from 32.9% in the control group to 9.1% in the TAXUS patients (P<0.0001).\n                The finding that the TAXUS Moderate Release stent system is safe and effective in the treatment of long, complex coronary artery lesions provides the evidence base for the more widespread use of drug-eluting stents in contemporary clinical practice.",

The utility of drug-eluting stents has not been evaluated in more difficult stenoses.\n                To investigate the safety and efficacy of the polymer-based, slow-release paclitaxel-eluting stent in a patient population with more complex lesions than previously studied.\n                Prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter randomized trial conducted from February 2003 to March 2004 at 66 academic and community-based institutions with 1156 patients who underwent stent implantation in a single coronary artery stenosis (vessel diameter, 2.25-4.0 mm; lesion length, 10-46 mm), including 664 patients (57.4%) with complex or previously unstudied lesions (requiring 2.25-mm, 4.0-mm, and/or multiple stents) and 9-month clinical and angiographic follow-up.\n                Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 or more bare metal stents (n = 579) or identical-appearing paclitaxel-eluting stents (n = 577).\n                Ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization at 9 months.\n                Baseline characteristics were well matched. Diabetes was present in 31% of patients. The mean (SD) reference vessel diameter was 2.69 (0.57) mm, the reference lesion length was 17.2 (9.2) mm, and 78% of lesions were type B2/C. A mean (SD) of 1.38 (0.58) stents (total mean [SD] length, 28.4 [13.1] mm) were implanted per lesion; 33% of lesions required multiple stents. Stents that were 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm in diameter were used in 18% and 17% of lesions, respectively. Compared with bare metal stents, paclitaxel-eluting stents reduced the 9-month rate of target lesion revascularization from 15.7% to 8.6% (P<.001) and target vessel revascularization from 17.3% to 12.1% (P = .02). Similar rates were observed for cardiac death or myocardial infarction (5.5% for bare metal stent group vs 5.7% for paclitaxel-eluting stent group) and stent thrombosis (0.7% in both groups). Angiographic restenosis was reduced from 33.9% to 18.9% in the entire study cohort (P<.001), including among patients receiving 2.25-mm stents (49.4% vs 31.2%; P = .01), 4.0-mm stents (14.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02), and multiple stents (57.8% vs 27.2%; P<.001).\n                Compared with a bare metal stent, implantation of the paclitaxel-eluting stent in a patient population with complex lesions effectively reduces clinical and angiographic restenosis.",

Patients were randomised to one of two DES (Cypher, n=264; Taxus, n=281) or to a cobalt-chromium-based BMS (Vision, n=281) and followed up for 6 months for occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and costs. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was cost-effectiveness after 6 months, with effectiveness defined as reduction of major adverse cardiac events.\n                Cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularisation occurred in 39 of 544 (7.2%) patients with DES and 34 of 280 (12.1%) with BMS (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.91; p=0.02), without significant differences between the two DES. Total costs at 6 months were higher with DES (mean 10,544, SD 6849) than with BMS (9639, 9067; p<0.0001); higher stent costs of DES were not compensated for by lower follow-up costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DES compared with BMS to avoid one major event was 18,311, and costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were more than 50 000. Subgroup analyses showed that DES were more cost-effective for elderly patients in specific high-risk groups.\n                In a real-world setting, use of DES in all patients is less cost effective than in studies with selected patients. Use of these stents could be restricted to patients in high-risk groups.",

This trial compared the performance of tacrolimus-eluting stents (TES) with that of equivalent carbon-coated stents (CCS).Methods and results: The JUPITER II trial enrolled 332 patients (mean age = 64 years, 75% men) with de novo coronary stenoses.

Stent graft implanted in native coronary arteries appears to be safe and efficient in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but a significant reduction in in-stent restenosis was not achieved.",

Previously, this had been analyzed only in substudies of larger trials or in clinical investigations enrolling a small number of patients.\n                Drug-eluting stents are highly effective in reducing the rate of in-stent restenosis.\n                Two hundred patients with diabetes and de novo coronary artery lesions were enrolled in 16 centers: 98 were randomly assigned to sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and 102 received bare-metal stents (BMS). The primary end point was in-segment late luminal loss. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rate was analyzed at 30 days and 8 and 12 months.\n                The extent of in-segment late luminal loss in the SES group was 0.18 mm compared with 0.74 mm in the BMS group. In-segment restenosis was identified on follow-up angiography in 8.8% of the patients in SES and in 42.1% in BMS (p < 0.0001). Target lesion revascularization was performed in 5.3% of the patients in SES and in 21.1% of the patients in BMS (p = 0.002). The SES was effective in the treatment group with oral diabetic medication as well as in the insulin-dependent treatment group (3.6% SES vs. 38.8% BMS). There was no subacute stent thrombosis in the SES group up to 1 year. The MACE rate was not significantly different at 30 days. At 12 months, MACE rate was 14.7% in SES versus 35.8% in BMS.\n                The SES is safe and highly effective in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease and associated with a significant decrease in the extent of late luminal loss.",

        "Abstract": "We sought to investigate whether the previously reported midterm clinical benefit of planned sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was maintained over a 24-month time period. Moreover, the distribution of clinical events in relation to thienopyridine discontinuation was thoroughly investigated.\n                No randomized data are currently available on the safety/benefit profile of SES in this subset of patients beyond 12 months.\n                Between March 2003 and April 2004, 175 patients with STEMI were randomly allocated to tirofiban infusion followed by SES or abciximab plus bare-metal stent (BMS). Complete follow-up information up to 720 days was available for all patients.\n                The cumulative incidence of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization (TVR) remained lower in the tirofiban-SES compared with the abciximab-BMS group at 2 years (24.2% vs. 38.6%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.98]; p = 0.038). The composite of death/MI was similar in the tirofiban-SES (16.1%) and the abciximab-BMS groups (20.5%, HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.38 to 1.55]; p = 0.43) while the need for TVR was markedly reduced (9.8% vs. 25.5%, respectively; HR 0.34 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.77]; p = 0.01) in the tirofiban-SES arm. The rate of confirmed, probable, or possible stent thrombosis did not differ in the 2 groups, nor the incidence of death/MI after thienopyridine discontinuation.\n                The midterm clinical benefit of planned SES implantation assisted by tirofiban infusion in STEMI patients was mainly carried over after 2 years with no overall excess of late adverse events after thienopyridine discontinuation.",

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) when compared with the bare metal stent (BMS) in patients included in the DIABETES (DIABETes and sirolimus Eluting Stent) trial.\n                The prospective multicentre DIABETES trial randomized 160 diabetic patients with one or more significant coronary stenoses in one, two, or three vessels to either SES or BMS implantation. One-year dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) was routinely prescribed. Clinical follow-up was scheduled at 1, 9, 12, and 13 months and 2 years. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were comparable between groups. At 2 years, the rate of target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the SES group compared with the BMS group (7.7 vs. 35.0%, P < 0.001). However, the total revascularization rate at 2 years increased in both groups due to progression of atherosclerosis in coronary segments remote from the target lesion (rate of atherosclerosis progression: 7.7% in SES group vs. 10% in BMS group; P = 0.7). During dual antiplatelet treatment (1 year), there was no stent thrombosis in the SES group, whereas two patients presented it in the BMS group. However, after clopidogrel withdrawal, three patients allocated to the SES group presented stent thromboses vs. none in the BMS group.\n                SES implantation in diabetic patients remains effective at 2-year follow-up.

AMI was present in 37% of patients with Janus and 36% with Tecnic Carbostent. At an average of 246-day follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6% with the Janus stent and 15% with the Tecnic Carbostent (P = 0.038). Primary events included 1 cardiac death, 1 myocardial infarction (MI) due to subacute stent thrombosis and 13 target lesion revascularizations (TLR) due to restenosis in patients with Tecnic Carbostent and 6 TLR due to restenosis in patients with Janus stent. Although all patients had discontinued clopidogrel for an average of 126 days, there was no additional thrombotic event in the two groups.\n                Janus stent is efficient in reducing MACE compared with Tecnic Carbostent at an average of 8-month follow-up. Discontinuation of clopidogrel at 4 months after PCI is safe for patients with Janus stent, including AMI patients. Long-term efficacy of Janus stent in reducing restenosis requires further study.",

        "Abstract": "Few studies directly compared drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents (BMSs) in diabetic patients. DESSERT was an Italian multicenter randomized trial to show the efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) compared with BMSs in de novo lesions of diabetic patients treated with insulin and/or oral antidiabetics for > or =3 months on top of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The primary end point was in-stent late lumen loss, assessed using centralized quantitative coronary angiography at 8-month follow-up. Centrally adjudicated composite major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and target-vessel failure (TVF; death, treated vessel-related acute myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization) at 30 days and 9 and 12 months were secondary end points. Seventy-five patients were randomly assigned to an SES (109 lesions), and 75 (109 lesions), to a BMS. The 2 groups were well balanced for clinical, anatomic, and procedural characteristics. In-stent late lumen loss decreased from 0.96 +/- 0.61 mm for BMSs to 0.14 +/- 0.33 for SESs (p <0.001), and in-segment binary restenosis was 38.8% versus 3.6%, respectively (p <0.001). Twelve-month clinical events were significantly lower in the sirolimus group: MACEs 22.1% versus 40% (p = 0.023), target-lesion revascularization 5.9% versus 30% (p <0.001), and TVF 14.7% versus 34.3% (p = 0.008). At multivariate analysis, stent type was confirmed as an independent predictor of in-segment late loss (p <0.001), binary restenosis (p <0.001), 12-month TVF (p = 0.010), and 12-month MACEs (p = 0.037). In conclusion, the randomized DESSERT showed SESs to be safe and effective in decreasing both angiographic parameters of restenosis and incidence of MACEs compared with BMSs in diabetic patients with de novo 1- or 2-vessel coronary stenoses.",
