        "Title": "Acute effect of diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil) in patients with chronic diarrhea and fecal incontinence.",
        "Abstract": "Fifteen patients with chronic diarrhea and fecal incontinence were admitted to a clinical research center and treated for 3 days with either placebo or diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil). The patients were then crossed over to the alternate medication. Lomotil had no effect on rectal or anal sphincter pressure or on continence for saline that had been infused into the rectum. However, Lomotil therapy reduced average stool frequency (from 4.9 to 2.6 times/day) and average stool weight (from 460 to 256 g/day). These results suggest that temporary or intermittent therapy with Lomotil and related drugs might benefit patients with chronic diarrhea and fecal incontinence. They should do this by virtue of a reduction in stool frequency and stool volume, without a deleterious effect on the defense mechanisms against incontinence.",

        "Title": "Double-blind cross-over study comparing loperamide, codeine and diphenoxylate in the treatment of chronic diarrhea.",
        "Abstract": "As no adequate comparison of these widely used drugs has been made, we have performed a double-blind cross-over trial in 30 individuals with chronic diarrhea. Each underwent three randomized treatment periods of 4 wk duration. Patients were instructed to increase the daily dose gradually until control was achieved or side effects became intolerable. Stool frequency, consistency, urgency, and incontinence were then compared when a stable dose was reached. Though 2.3 capsules (4.6 mg) of loperamide, 2.3 capsules (103.5 mg) of codeine and 2.5 capsulses (12.5 mg) of diphenoxylate all reduced stool frequency to the same extent, diphenoxylate was significantly less effective in producing a solid stool. Before treatment 95% of patients experienced urgency, sometimes associated with fecal incontinence, often as their major diability. Loperamide and codeine were more effective in relieving this than was diphenoxylate. Side effects, particularly central nervous effects, were greatest with diphenoxylate and least with loperamide. Approximately equal numbers discontinued each preparation; poor control and central-nervous-system side effects were the usual reasons for stopping diphenoxylate and codeine, and abdominal pain and constipation for stopping loperamide. We conclude that both loperamide and codeine phosphate are superior to diphenoxylate in the symptomatic treatment of chronic diarrhea.",

        "Abstract": "We have investigated the effect of loperamide (4 mg tds) on the continence to a standard volume of rectally infused saline and anorectal manometry in 26 patients complaining of chronic diarrhea complicated by fecal incontinence and severe urgency. Each patient was treated for one week with loperamide (4 mg tds) and for one week with an identical placebo in a double-blind cross-over trial. Our results showed that as well as its established effects of improving stool consistency and reducing stool weight, frequency and episodes of incontinence and severe urgency, loperamide also significantly improved continence to a standard volume of rectally infused saline. This action was associated with an increase in the maximum basal sphincter pressure, an increase in the rectal volume required to abolish recovery of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, and a reduction in rectal compliance. These results suggest that loperamide may have a specific action on the anal sphincter, which may aid continence in patients who complain of diarrhea and fecal incontinence.",

We used this drug in order to improve continence after ileoanal anastomosis. Seventeen patients (eight with ulcerative colitis and nine with adenomatosis coli) were tested after receiving ileoanal anastomosis. The placebo showed no effect, but valproate sodium could ameliorate frequent defecation and soiling and the resulting perianal skin complications. Increasing anal resting pressure was also observed during valproate sodium administration without the amplitude, frequency of peristaltic wave, or voluntary squeeze pressure being affected. These results suggest that the subchronic administration of valproate sodium may be useful in the treatment of minor incontinence after ileoanal anastomosis.",

Sixteen patients operated with endoanal mucosectomy and a handsewn ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and 14 patients operated with abdominal proctocolectomy and stapling of the pouch to the top of the anal canal were studied. While loperamide treatment increased resting anal pressure in both groups of patients by approximately 20% (P < 0.05), squeeze pressure was not affected. Loperamide did not affect pouch volume or contractility. Sensory thresholds and the recto/pouch-anal inhibitory reflex were not influenced by loperamide treatment. Clinical function was improved, with a reduced bowel frequency and an improved nighttime continence, with less soiling (P < 0.05) as well as need to wear a protective pad.",

The alpha1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine raises resting anal sphincter pressure in healthy volunteers and may be of value in these patients.\n                Twelve patients (7 female), median age 44 (range, 29-67) years were studied. All had fecal incontinence despite a noninflamed pouch of normal size and ultrasonographically structurally normal anal sphincter muscles. Patients were treated with topical 10 percent phenylephrine and placebo gels, allocated in random order in a double-blind, crossover study for two four-week periods. Before and during treatment, maximum resting anal sphincter pressure and anodermal blood flow were measured, a symptom questionnaire was completed, and incontinence score was determined using a validated scale.\n                Six of 12 (50 percent) patients improved subjectively after phenylephrine compared with one on placebo (P = 0.07). Four patients had complete cessation of incontinence with active treatment. Phenylephrine significantly reduced the incontinence score (P = 0.015). It also resulted in a significant rise in mean maximum resting anal sphincter pressure when compared with placebo (P = 0.012).

        "Abstract": "The effect of the anti-diarrhoeal drug, loperamide hydrochloride, on bowel function in patients with an ileo-anal pouch was studied by means of a blinded, three-tailed, case-controlled and randomized crossover trial, using a daily dose of 12 mg in either oral (4 mg t.d.s.) or suppository (6 mg b.d.) form.\n                Daily stool frequency was recorded in a diary and an objective measure of pouch motor function was obtained at the end of each treatment phase. Ten subjects (seven males, three females) aged 23-50 years (median 38 years) were studied 9-48 months (median 27 months) after ileostomy closure. Eight pouches had been constructed for ulcerative colitis and two for familial adenomatous polyposis (9J, 1W).\n                Mean daily stool frequency during the oral loperamide phase was lower than during both the placebo (P=0.05) and suppository (P < 0.02) phases. Stool frequency did not differ significantly between placebo and suppository phases. There was a strong inverse correlation between mean daily stool frequency and pouch capacity (r=-0.82 after both oral and suppository phases). Large isolated pouch contractions were evident in five of eight subjects studied; suppression was observed in two of the five after oral loperamide and in three of the five after loperamide suppositories. Rhythmic pouch contractions were seen in four subjects and suppression was evident after loperamide suppositories (but not after oral loperamide) in three. A daily oral dose of 12 mg loperamide significantly lowered stool frequency in pouch patients and modified some aspects of pouch contraction. Loperamide suppositories produced more prominent suppression of pouch contractions but did not lower stool frequency.\n                This suggests that the beneficial effect of oral loperamide is primarily due to its action on intestine proximal to the pouch itself.",

Use of an adrenergic agonist may therefore have a role in treating patients with faecal incontinence.\n                Ten patients (seven females, median age 66 years) with passive faecal incontinence related to weak internal anal sphincter were studied. All patients had intact anal sphincters as assessed by endoanal ultrasound. Phenylephrine gel was applied in a double blind manner in concentrations of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% (Slaco Pharma (UK) Ltd, Watford, UK) on separate days.

This was sustained at two hours. There was a clear dose-response relationship at one hour. Higher concentrations raised median MRP to within the normal range (> 60 cm H(2)O). At two hours, all concentrations greater than 20% increased the pressure to a similar degree, suggesting that the exact concentration may be important for the initial effect but given a certain threshold is less important after a period of time. Toxicity was rare. Two patients experienced transient perianal burning which settled within a few minutes. There was no significant effect on anodermal blood flow, blood pressure, or pulse rate.\n                This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using topical phenylephrine to raise resting anal tone in patients with faecal incontinence.
