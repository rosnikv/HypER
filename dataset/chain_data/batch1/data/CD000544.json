        "Abstract": "One hundred sixty patients intolerant of or allergic to sulfasalazine (Salazopyrin, Azulfidine) participated in an open tolerance study of azodisal sodium (Dipentum). More than 4 of every 5 patients tolerated azodisal sodium well, but 12.5% of patients stopped medication because of diarrhea. Even after 7 patients who had also experienced diarrhea when taking sulfasalazine were excluded, there still remained a group of patients (9.8%) who had to discontinue azodisal sodium because of diarrhea. Apart from this, only minor side effects occurred. No serious drug-related changes were seen in hematologic or biochemical parameters. Male fertility appeared to be unaffected. One hundred two patients, who were in clinical and sigmoidoscopic remission, took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance trial. Of these, 23.1% of the patients treated with azodisal sodium and 44.9% of the patients treated with placebo had a clinical and sigmoidoscopic relapse during a 6-mo trial period (p = 0.02). Azodisal sodium appears to be an effective agent for the maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis.",

        "Abstract": "To assess the safety and efficacy of delayed-release mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) as maintenance treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis, 100 patients with quiescent colitis were randomly grouped to receive either delayed-release mesalazine or an equivalent dose of enteric-coated sulfasalazine in a 48-wk trial. Groups were comparable for age, sex, and duration and extent of disease. Relapse rates at 48 wk were as follows: sulfasalazine 38.6% (95% confidence limits, 24%-54%) and mesalazine 37.5% (95% confidence limits, 24%-53%), chi 2 = 0.01, p greater than 0.90. Mean time to relapse, cumulative relapse rate, and relapse severity were similar in the two groups. Headaches and upper gastrointestinal symptoms--common at trial entry--improved to a greater extent in patients receiving mesalazine. Delayed-release mesalazine is an effective treatment for maintaining ulcerative colitis remission and is associated with fewer side effects than equivalent doses of enteric-coated sulfasalazine.",

        "Abstract": "The results of a clinical trial comparing slow-release 5-aminosalicylic acid tablets (Pentasa) and enteric-coated sulfasalazine tablets (Salazopyrin) with regard to the efficacy of maintaining ulcerative colitis patients in remission for 12 mo and with regard to safety of treatment are reported. Seventy-five patients with ulcerative colitis in remission for between 1 mo and 5 yr were included for analysis. Forty-nine men and 26 women, aged between 18 and 79 yr, received either Pentasa t.i.d. (1500 mg) plus Salazopyrin placebo or Salazopyrin t.i.d. (3 g) plus Pentasa placebo daily. Patients were assessed clinically, endoscopically, and histologically before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after the start of treatment. Life-table analysis showed ongoing remission after 6 and 12 mo for Pentasa to be 63% (26 of 41) and 54% (22 of 41) and for Salazopyrin 72% (22 of 31) and 46% (14 of 31). These differences were not statistically significant. Three patients treated with Salazopyrin were withdrawn because of severe erythrodermia, anxiety and backache, and pregnancy, respectively. One patient on Salazopyrin experienced transient rises in serum urea, creatinine, and lactic dehydrogenase and another patient in this group reported slight reversible loss of hair. In the Pentasa group no side effects were recorded. We conclude that Pentasa is a well-tolerated drug, equally effective as Salazopyrin in maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Balsalazide (BSZ) is a pro-drug which releases 5-aminosalicylic acid (5ASA) and 4-aminobenzoyl-beta-alanine (an inert carrier) in the colon of various species including man. BSZ was compared with sulphasalazine (SASP) (both 1 g b.d. orally) in the maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Seventy-nine patients (53 male, 26 female), mean age 49 years (range 19-79 years), with UC were randomly allocated to either treatment (41 BSZ, 38 SASP) for 6 months. The groups were similar in respect of age, sex, duration and extent of disease. Seven patients defaulted (3 BSZ, 4 SASP) leaving 38 on BSZ and 34 on SASP. Two male patients, both receiving SASP, were withdrawn because of severe side-effects. One of these patients, with an exfoliative rash, was maintained satisfactorily on open BSZ. Remission rates at 6 months (51% BSZ, 63% SASP) were not significantly different (life-table analysis P less than 0.1). Twelve patients (15%) reported troublesome side-effects (2 BSZ 5%, 10 SASP 26%, P = 0.017 Fisher Exact Test). Mean haemoglobin concentrations, similar on entry, increased after 6 months with BSZ (0.2 g/dl) but decreased with SASP (0.5 g/dl) (P less than 0.0002). BSZ was not significantly different from SASP in maintaining remission in patients with UC but had fewer side-effects.",

        "Abstract": "The safety and efficacy of Claversal (coated, oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) 0.75 g/day) and sulphasalazine 1.5-2.0 g/day were compared for the maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis in a 1-year double-blind trial. Three hundred and thirty-four patients, whose disease was controlled on a stable dose of sulphasalazine (1.5-2.0 g/day) for a 1-month pre-trial, entered the study. On entry, patients were assigned in a random manner to continue sulphasalazine or to switch to coated 5-ASA. One hundred and thirty-one patients in the coated 5-ASA group and 142 on sulphasalazine were analysed for efficacy. No significant difference was observed between treatments with respect to the cumulative rate of relapse. Over the 12 months, 30 (28%) of the coated 5-ASA patients versus 29 (23%) of those treated with sulphasalazine had an exacerbation of their disease (log rank test P = 0.7011). The incidence of drug-related adverse events and subsequent withdrawals was similar. The high incidence of side-effects usually associated with sulphasalazine was not observed, probably due to the fact that this population was tolerant of sulphasalazine pre-trial. Of the 37 patients who reported adverse events with previous sulphasalazine therapy, however, only two (8%) of the 24 experienced those events when randomized to coated 5-ASA while five (38%) of the 13 who continued on sulphasalazine reported those same events. Coated 5-ASA is a safe, effective therapy for maintaining ulcerative colitis in remission.",

        "Title": "Randomised comparison of olsalazine and mesalazine in prevention of relapses in ulcerative colitis.",
        "Abstract": "Sulphasalazine extends remissions and lessens disease activity during relapses of ulcerative colitis, but it also causes many adverse side-effects. The adverse reactions are mostly attributable to the sulphapyridine carrier moiety rather than the active principle 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), so agents to deliver 5-ASA to the colon by other means have been designed. We have compared the efficacy and tolerability of two such agents, olsalazine and mesalazine, in maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis. 100 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission were recruited at one centre and assigned randomly to treatment with olsalazine (Dipentum; 1.0 g daily) or mesalazine (Asacol, with Eudragit-S coating; 1.2 g daily). Compliance, biochemical and haematological variables, and clinical evidence of disease activity were assessed every 3 months for 12 months by observers unaware of treatment allocation. In intention-to-treat analysis, which included as treatment failures patients withdrawn for protocol violations, adverse reactions, intercurrent illness, or non-compliance as well as those with relapses of ulcerative colitis, the olsalazine group had a significantly lower rate of treatment failure than the mesalazine group (12/49 [24%] vs 23/50 [46%]; p = 0.025). Analysis restricted to 64 patients still in remission at 1 year and 18 with relapses also showed a significant difference in relapse rate (olsalazine 5/42 [12%] vs mesalazine 13/40 [33%]; p = 0.024). Both drugs were well tolerated; only 9 patients reported substantial side-effects. Olsalazine was clearly superior to mesalazine in prevention of relapses in ulcerative colitis, especially in patients with left-sided disease.",

Four patients on sulfasalazine and six patients on olsalazine experienced minor adverse effects. One patient on sulfasalazine had mild leukopenia, and four patients on sulfasalazine and one patient on olsalazine had decreased levels of haptoglobin.

        "Abstract": "In a four-centre prospective double-blind trial, 108 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission were randomized to receive balsalazide in doses of 3 g or 6 g/day for 12 months. The patients were assessed at 3-monthly intervals clinically, sigmoidoscopically and with routine haematology and biochemistry.

Intolerance reactions leading to withdrawal from the study occurred in only 9 patients (8%), all occurring in the first 7 weeks of the study. Balsalazide is therefore both highly effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and well tolerated in both conventional and high dosage (the latter equivalent to 5.5 g/day of sulphasalazine). In this study no distinct advantage in maintenance of remission has been found for the higher dose of balsalazide.",

        "Title": "Is maintenance therapy always necessary for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission?",
        "Abstract": "The efficacy of sulphasalazine and mesalazine in preventing relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis is well known. It is less clear how long such maintenance should be continued, and if the duration of disease remission is a factor that affects the risk of recurrence.\n                To determine whether the duration of disease remission affects the relapse rate, by comparing the efficacy of a delayed-release mesalazine (Asacol, Bracco S.p.A., Milan, Italy) against placebo in patients with ulcerative colitis with short- and long-duration of disease remission.\n                112 patients (66 male, 46 female, mean age 35 years), with intermittent chronic ulcerative colitis in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission with sulphasalazine or mesalazine for at least 1 year, were included in the study. Assuming that a lower duration of remission might be associated with a higher relapse rate, the patients were stratified according to the length of their disease remission, prior to randomization into Group A (Asacol 26, placebo 35) in remission from 1 to 2 years, or Group B (Asacol 28, placebo 23) in remission for over 2 years, median 4 years. Patients were treated daily with oral Asacol 1.2 g vs. placebo, for a follow-up period of 1 year.\n                We employed an intention-to-treat analysis. In Group A, whilst no difference was found between the two treatments after 6 months, mesalazine was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at 12 months [Asacol 6/26 (23%), placebo 17/35 (49%), P = 0.035, 95% Cl: 48-2.3%]. In contrast, in Group B no statistically significant difference was observed between the two treatments, either at 6 or 12 months [Asacol 5/28 (18%), placebo 6/23 (26%), P = 0.35, 95% Cl: 31-14%] of follow-up. Patients in group B were older, and had the disease and remission duration for longer, than those in Group A.\n                Mesalazine prophylaxis is necessary for the prevention of relapse by patients with ulcerative colitis in remission for less than 2 years, but this study casts doubt over whether continuous maintenance treatment is necessary in patients with prolonged clinical, endoscopic and histological remission, who are at very low risk of relapse.",

Efficacy assessments were clinical activity index (CAI) and endoscopic score according to Rachmilewitz, and a histological score. In addition, laboratory tests were performed and urinary excretion of 5-ASA and its metabolite N-Ac-5-ASA was analysed. The study lasted for 26 weeks.\n                Balsalazide 3.0 g twice daily resulted in a significantly higher clinical remission rate (77.5%) than balsalazide 1.5 g twice daily (43.8%) and mesalazine 0.5 g three times daily (56.8%) (p=0.006). The respective times to relapse were 161 days, 131 days (p=0.003), and 144 days (NS). Accordingly, pairwise contrasts of the final endoscopic score demonstrated a significant difference (p=0.005) between the two balsalazide treatment groups while differences between either of these two groups and mesalazine were not statistically significant. Patients treated with balsalazide excreted less 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA than patients receiving mesalazine but these differences were not statistically significant. Discontinuation of the trial because of adverse effects occurred in nine patients: three in the balsalazide 1.5 g twice daily group, two in the balsalazide 3.0 g twice daily group, and four in the mesalazine 0.5 g three times daily group. No clinically important new drug safety related findings were identified in this study.\n                High dose balsalazide (3.0 g twice daily) was superior in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis compared with a low dose (1.5 g twice daily) or a standard dose of mesalazine (0.5 g three times daily).

        "Abstract": "Mesalamine has been used as the first-line medication for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We directly compared the efficacy and safety of two different mesalamine formulations in the maintenance of remission in patients with UC.\n                In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, 131 patients with quiescent UC were assigned to two groups: 65 to receive a pH-dependent release formulation of mesalamine at 2.4 g/day (pH-2.4 g) and 66 to receive a time-dependent release formulation of mesalamine at 2.25 g/day (Time-2.25 g). Both formulations were administered three times daily for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without bloody stools.\n                In the full analysis set (n = 130), the proportion of patients without bloody stools was 76.9% in the pH-2.4 g and 69.2% in the Time-2.25 g, demonstrating the noninferiority of pH-2.4 g to Time-2.25 g. No statistically significant difference in time to bloody stools was found between the two formulations (P = 0.27, log-rank test), but the time to bloody stools tended to be longer in pH-2.4 g compared to Time-2.25 g, and a similar trend was observed with regard to the time to relapse. No differences were observed between the safety profiles of the two formulations.\n                The pH- and time-dependent release of mesalamine formulations were similarly safe and effective. Interestingly, the remission phase tended to be longer in the group that received the pH-dependent formulation compared to the group that received the time-dependent formulation (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, no. C000000289).",

        "Abstract": "Treatment with mesalamine to maintain endoscopic remission (mucosal healing) of ulcerative colitis (UC) has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse and is the recommended first-line maintenance therapy. To improve treatment adherence, a mesalamine formulation that can be administered once-daily, MMX(\u00ae) mesalamine (Lialda; Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC, Wayne, PA), was developed. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of once-daily MMX mesalamine compared with twice-daily delayed-release mesalamine (Asacol; Warner Chilcott, Dublin, Ireland) for maintaining endoscopic remission in patients with UC.\n                A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 6-month, active-control trial was conducted to assess the non-inferiority of once-daily MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day compared with twice-daily delayed-release mesalamine at a total daily dose of 1.6 g/day in patients with UC in endoscopic remission. The primary end point was maintenance of endoscopic remission at month 6 in the per-protocol (PP) population.\n                Overall, 826 patients were randomized and dosed. The primary objective (non-inferiority) was met. At month 6, 83.7 and 77.8% of patients receiving MMX mesalamine in the PP and intent-to-treat (ITT) populations, respectively, had maintained endoscopic remission compared with 81.5% (PP) and 76.9% (ITT) of patients receiving delayed-release mesalamine (95% confidence interval for difference: -3.9%, 8.1% (PP); -5.0%, 6.9% (ITT)). Time to relapse was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (log-rank test, P=0.5116 (PP); P=0.5455 (ITT)). The proportion of patients with adverse events was 37.1 and 36.0% in patients receiving MMX mesalamine and delayed-release mesalamine, respectively.\n                Once-daily dosing of MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day was shown to be well tolerated and non-inferior to twice-daily dosing with delayed-release mesalamine 1.6 g/day for maintenance of endoscopic remission in patients with UC.",

        "Title": "Olsalazine in maintenance of clinical remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.",
        "Abstract": "Frequent minor side effects are associated with sulfasalazine. The realization that it is the 5-aminosalicylic acid moiety that is the active component of sulfasalazine and that the side effects are probably due to the sulfapyridine has prompted the search for a similar but safer compound. Olsalazine, consisting of two molecules of 5-ASA without sulfasalazine may avoid the problems due to sulfasalazine. One hundred one patients were entered into a double-blind placebo-controlled study of the use of olsalazine (2 g daily) in preventing relapse in patients who had recently recovered from an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. Patients were treated for 12 months. Forty-nine were randomized to olsalazine (39 with limited and 10 with extensive disease) and 52 to placebo (42 with limited and 10 with extensive disease). Life-table analysis showed that the median time to relapse in patients on olsalazine was 342 days, which was significantly longer than the 100 days in the placebo group (P = 0.024). The most important side effect experienced with olsalazine that necessitated withdrawal from the study was \"drug-induced diarrhea\" in 16% (8/49). There was a similar incidence of minor side effects reported in the two groups, and in no patients were major or dangerous side effects reported. In patients who did not develop diarrhea, olsalazine was well tolerated and successfully prevented rapid relapse in the recently ill patients entered into this study.",
