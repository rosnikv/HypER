        "Title": "Role of opticare eye drop delivery system in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "Abstract": "To investigate the prevalence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca in 340 patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing outpatient followup, and to assess their ability to use artificial tears, and the role of an aid to dispensing drops, the Opticare.\n                Initial questionnaire given to 340 patients based on preliminary criteria for classification of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Thirty symptomatic patients were invited to undergo objective and subjective assessment of the ability to instill artificial tears with and without the Opticare.\n                One hundred twenty-seven (37%) patients had had symptoms lasting at least 3 months at some time, and 85 (25%) were currently symptomatic. Many patients found difficulty using artificial tears due to problems aiming and squeezing the bottles as a result of impaired upper limb function. The Opticare statistically significantly improved the ability to squeeze out drops and get them in the eye.\n                The Opticare device allows patients with functional impairment of the upper limb to instill artificial tears, resulting in less wastage of tears and increased independence and compliance.",
