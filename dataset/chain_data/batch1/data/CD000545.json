        "Abstract": "The response of active and quiescent Crohn's disease to prednisone, sulfasalazine, or azathioprine has been studied in 569 patients in a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter cooperative trial. The response of active symptomatic disease to prednisone or sulfasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. Response to azathioprine was better than to placebo, but the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Patients with colonic involvement were especially responsive to sulfasalazine, and those with small bowel involvement were especially responsive to prednisone. Patients' drug therapy immediately before entry to the study significantly affected subsequent response. For patients with quiescent disease, none of the drugs was superior to placebo in prophylaxis against flare-up or recurrence. There is less than a 5% risk that a clinically significant prophylactic effect of any of the drug regimens was missed.",

        "Abstract": "To test the effectiveness of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in the treatment of Crohn's disease, we entered 83 chronically ill patients into a two-year double-blind study comparing 6-MP with placebo. Crossover data showed that improvement occurred in 26 of 39 courses of 6-MP (67%) as compared with three of 39 courses of placebo (8%) (P less than 0.001). Non-crossover data likewise confirmed the superiority of 6-MP. The drug was more effective than placebo in closing fistulas (31 vs 6%) and in permitting discontinuation or reduction of steroid dosage (75 vs. 36%) (P less than 0.001). The onset of response to 6-MP was often delayed, with 32% of patients taking longer than three months to respond, and 19% taking longer than four months. Adverse side effects to 6-MP occurred in 10% of patients and were uniformly reversible. We conclude that 6-MP is an effective and useful agent in the management of Crohn's disease.",

        "Abstract": "The role of azathioprine (AZA) in the treatment of active Crohn's disease (CD) is still controversial. This study examined whether AZA combined with standard prednisolone therapy improved the therapeutic outcome compared with monotherapy with prednisolone.\n                Forty-two patients with a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of > 150 were randomized into two groups. Both received 60 mg of prednisolone daily in a tapering regimen to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. In addition, group 1 received 2.5 mg AZA/kg body wt and group 2 received a placebo over the whole study period of 4 months.\n                At the end of the trial, 16 of 21 patients (76%) in group 1 were in remission (CDAI < 150), compared with 8 of 21 (38%) in group 2 (P = 0.03). The CDAI in group 1 dropped from 290 +/- 97 (SD) to 72 +/- 84 and from 285 +/- 110 to 155 +/- 105 in group 2. The differences between activity indices in groups 1 and 2 became statistically significant after 8 weeks. The average prednisolone dose per day was 20.9 mg in group 1 and 26.7 mg in group 2 (P = 0.02). No major side effects were observed in this study.\n                The combination of prednisolone and AZA was superior to the treatment with prednisolone alone in active CD. Patients receiving AZA showed remission more frequently, more quickly, and with lower doses of prednisolone.",

        "Title": "A controlled double blind study of azathioprine in the management of Crohn's disease.",
        "Abstract": "While immunosuppressive agents are used widely in the management of Crohn's disease, their efficacy has not been well established in randomised controlled trials. This study was designed to examine whether azathioprine increases remission rate when used in conjunction with a diminishing dose regimen of prednisolone over a period of 12 weeks. It further examined whether azathioprine offers any therapeutic advantage over placebo in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease over a period of 15 months. Sixty three patients with active Crohn's disease were treated with a 12 weeks diminishing dose of prednisolone and at the same time entered into a randomised, double blind 15 month trial of either azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Remission rates between the two groups were compared at 12 weeks and at 15 months. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who had achieved and maintained remission by week 12 but at 15 months there was a highly significant difference in the proportion of patients in remission (42% receiving azathioprine v 7% receiving placebo), p = 0.001. Using life tables this beneficial effect was reflected as the difference in the median number of days on the trial (p = 0.02). There were significantly greater decreases over the trial period in the median erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, and leucocyte count in the azathioprine group. There were no cases of severe bone marrow suppression or clinical pancreatitis. In conclusion, azathioprine offers a therapeutic advantage over placebo in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.",

The proportion of patients entering first remission as well as the proportions of patients relapsing after first remission were not significantly different between the groups. The mean Harvey-Bradshaw index and the mean monthly steroid dose were also similar. However, when each patient was evaluated as his or her own control, the reduction in steroid dose, the general well being, and the reduction in abdominal pain were significantly better in the methotrexate treated patients.\n                Methotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg was found to be moderately better than 6-mercaptopurine and placebo in patients with chronic active CD.",

        "Abstract": "As treatment of steroid-dependent patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial, we analysed the efficacy and tolerance of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX) added to prednisone in increasing and maintaining the disease remission rate.\n                Seventy-two steroid-dependent IBD patients, 34 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 38 with Crohn's disease (CD), receiving treatment with prednisone were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to additionally receive, orally, over a period of 30 weeks 1.5 mg/kg/day of 6-MP (group A) or 15 mg/week of MTX (group B), or 3 g/day of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) (group C). All patients who achieved remission were included in a maintaining remission study for 76 weeks. Remission was defined after stopping prednisone as a CD activity index of <150 and normal serum orosomucoid concentration for CD patients and a Mayo Clinic score <7 for UC patients.\n                With regard to achieved remission, a significantly higher (P< 0.05) rate existed for UC patients in group A (78.6%) than in group C (25%), with no statistical differences in group B (58.3%) versus C. For CD patients, the rates were significantly higher (P< 0.001 and 0.01, respectively) in groups A (93.7%) and B (80%) versus C (14%). With regard to maintaining remission, UC patients in group A (63.6%) presented significantly higher rates (P < 0.0015 and P < 0.001, respectively) versus 14.3% in group B and none in group C. For CD patients, statistical differences (P < 0.001) existed when comparing rates in groups A (53.3%) and B (66.6%) versus none in group C. Noticeable side effects appeared in 13.3% of patients from group A and 11.5% from group B.\n                These results suggest that 6-MP or MTX added to prednisone could be effective in steroid sparing, as well as in achieving and maintaining remission in steroid-dependent IBD patients. MTX was less effective in maintaining remission in UC patients.",

        "Abstract": "The efficacy of azathioprine in the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease is well established. However, this drug has a long onset of action. Methotrexate has also been shown to be effective in chronic active Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in comparison with azathioprine, and to establish whether methotrexate has a shorter onset of action in this setting.\n                Patients with chronic active Crohn's disease were admitted to this investigator-blind study. Chronicity was defined as the need for steroid therapy of > or = 10 mg/day for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months, with at least one attempt to discontinue treatment. The disease had to be clinically active at entry, with a Crohn's Disease Activity Index of > or = 200. Six patients treated with azathioprine and methotrexate, respectively, were found to have enterocutaneous and perianal fistulas. At entry, all patients received prednisolone (40 mg once a day) which was tapered over a period of 12 weeks unless their clinical condition deteriorated. All patients were randomised to receive i.v. methotrexate 25 mg/week, or oral azathioprine 2 mg/kg per day, for a 6-month follow-up period. After the first 3 months, methotrexate was switched to oral administration maintaining the same dose. The primary efficacy outcome considered was the proportion of patients entering first remission after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Clinical remission was defined as the lack of need for steroid treatment and a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of < or = 150 points at each scheduled visit.\n                In the 54 patients (26 F, 28 M, mean age 34 years, range 18-60) randomly assigned to methotrexate (n=27) or azathioprine (n=27), no statistically significant difference was found between the two treatment regimens with respect to remission rate after 3 (methotrexate 44%, azathioprine 33%, p=0.28, (95% CI, 0.369-0.147), and 6 months (methotrexate 56%, azathioprine 63%, p=0.39, 95% CI, 0.187-0.335), respectively. Six patients withdrew from therapy due to adverse events: 3/27 (11%) in methotrexate and 3/27 (11%) in azathioprine. Drug-related adverse events (asthenia, nausea and vomiting) that did not require withdrawal from therapy were more frequent in the methotrexate group (azathioprine: 2/27 (7%); methotrexate: 12/27 (44%), p=0.00009). The frequency of these adverse events was comparable during the intravenous or oral administration of the drug.\n                This study confirms that methotrexate is effective in inducing remission in patients with chronic active Crohn's disease, therapeutic efficacy being comparable, but not faster, than that of azathioprine.",

        "Abstract": "A prospective study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of everolimus versus azathioprine or placebo in maintaining steroid-induced remission in active Crohn's disease (CD) and assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of everolimus.\n                This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study in adults with moderate-to-severe active CD. The patients received oral steroids for a rapid induction of remission plus everolimus 6 mg/day, azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day, or placebo as maintenance treatment. The main outcome measure was the treatment success, defined as a steroid-free remission by the end of month 3 and maintained until study cutoff without the use of prohibited efficacy treatments.\n                Following an interim analysis, the study was terminated before enrollment was completed due to the lack of efficacy. The full intent-to-treat population comprised 138 patients. Only 96 patients who entered the study > or =7 months prior to data cutoff were included in the primary efficacy population. The treatment success was achieved in 13 of 38 everolimus patients, 22 of 36 azathioprine patients, and 8 of 22 placebo patients. Using the Kaplan-Meier estimates at month 7, the incidence of treatment success was 22.0% with everolimus group (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-37.3%, P= 0.610 vs placebo), 38.3% with azathioprine group (95% CI 20.6-55.9%, P= 0.500 vs placebo), and 28.8% with placebo group (95% CI 7.7-49.9%). The type and incidence of adverse events in the everolimus cohort were similar to those reported in the approved transplantation indications.\n                The safety and tolerability of everolimus (6 mg/day) in patients with active CD were comparable to azathioprine. At this dose, everolimus is not more efficacious in achieving a steroid-free remission in active CD than the comparators.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram of body weight at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks plus daily oral placebo capsules; 2.5 mg of oral azathioprine per kilogram daily plus a placebo infusion on the standard schedule; or combination therapy with the two drugs. Patients received study medication through week 30 and could continue in a blinded study extension through week 50.\n                Of the 169 patients receiving combination therapy, 96 (56.8%) were in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 (the primary end point), as compared with 75 of 169 patients (44.4%) receiving infliximab alone (P=0.02) and 51 of 170 patients (30.0%) receiving azathioprine alone (P<0.001 for the comparison with combination therapy and P=0.006 for the comparison with infliximab). Similar numerical trends were found at week 50. At week 26, mucosal healing had occurred in 47 of 107 patients (43.9%) receiving combination therapy, as compared with 28 of 93 patients (30.1%) receiving infliximab (P=0.06) and 18 of 109 patients (16.5%) receiving azathioprine (P<0.001 for the comparison with combination therapy and P=0.02 for the comparison with infliximab).
