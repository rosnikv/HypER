        "Title": "Effect of computer-based learning on diabetes knowledge and control.",
        "Abstract": "Two interactive computer-based systems have been evaluated: a teaching program with text and animated graphics and a multiple-choice knowledge-assessment program (KAP) with optional prescriptive feedback. One hundred seventy-four routine-attending insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients were allocated to active and control groups to determine the effect of these programs on knowledge and control after a 4- to 6-mo follow-up period. Interactive computer teaching (ICT) resulted in a significant knowledge increment in both IDDM and NIDDM patients (P less than .05), together with a mean fall of 0.8 and 0.7%, respectively, in HbA1c (P less than .05 and P greater than .1), but no changes were observed in respective control groups. The KAP with feedback also produced a significant knowledge increment in both IDDM and NIDDM patients (P less than .05), of similar magnitude to the ICT program, and a mean fall in HbA1c of 1.2 and 1.3%, respectively (P less than .05), with no changes in the corresponding control groups. Even when KAP was used without prescriptive feedback, smaller but significant mean falls in HbA1c of 0.7 and 0.8% (P less than .05) were seen in IDDM and NIDDM patients, respectively, suggesting a motivational effect resulting from program participation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Title": "The development and evaluation of a computer-aided diabetes education program.",
        "Abstract": "This paper describes the development and evaluation of a computer-aided learning (CAL) program. The program was tested in a trial that involved 36 people with diabetes; 20 received CAL lessons in diabetes management and 16 attended conventional diabetes classes conducted by diabetes educators. When measurements taken before and three months after the education were compared, both groups showed significant improvement in their knowledge; the blood glucose levels of the CAL group were significantly lower but those of the conventional education group were higher. This means that the CAL program was as effective as conventional education in imparting knowledge but it was more likely to motivate people to control their glucose levels. The CAL program allows diabetes educators to spend less time on education in basic knowledge and to concentrate more on motivational and social factors that are important determinants of patient compliance. It can also benefit people with diabetes whose access to health professionals and/or conventional diabetes education is restricted.",

The aims were to (1) test the effects of the computer intervention in providing support, information, and education on selected outcomes, and (2) evaluate the women's attitudes toward and satisfaction with the intervention and the support provided.\n                Thirty women were randomized into computer and noncomputer groups and participated for 10 months. For 5 months, one group participated in a self-help support and educational group via the computer; the other group continued to use their usual modes of support and communication. Psychosocial well-being scales were administered and attitudes were surveyed.\n                Improving health and higher educational levels positively influenced measures of social support and quality of life. Women who were married or who reported greater support had higher scores on the Personal Resource Questionnaire. The women expressed positive effects of the computer-based support group on their lives.\n                The intervention was enthusiastically accepted, and could be conducted effectively in isolated rural areas.",

This follow-up report is one of the few experimental studies to provide such information on Internet-based health education.\n                We present follow-up data 10 months following randomization on the \"Diabetes Network (D-Net)\" Internet-based self-management project, a randomized trial evaluating the incremental effects of adding (1) tailored self-management training or (2) peer support components to a basic Internet-based, information-focused comparison intervention. Participants were 320 adult type 2 diabetes patients from participating primary care offices, mean age 59 (SD = 9.2), who were relatively novice Internet users.\n                All intervention components were consistently implemented by staff, but participant website usage decreased over time. All conditions were significantly improved from baseline on behavioral, psychosocial, and some biological outcomes; and there were few differences between conditions. Results were robust across on-line coaches, patient characteristics, and participating clinics.\n                The basic D-Net intervention was implemented well and improvements were observed across a variety of patients, interventionists, and clinics. There were, however, difficulties in maintaining usage over time and additions of tailored self-management and peer support components generally did not significantly improve results.",

While providing a convenient way for patients and providers to communicate, this system can support automated recording and ready retrieval of these real-time interactions.",

This report presents 12-month follow-up results from a computer-assisted, patient-centered intervention to improve the level of recommended services patients received from a variety of primary care settings.\n                A total of 886 patients with type 2 diabetes under the care of 52 primary care physicians participated in the Diabetes Priority Program. Physicians were stratified and randomized to intervention or control conditions and evaluated on two primary outcomes: number of recommended laboratory screenings and recommended patient-centered care activities completed from the National Committee on Quality Assurance/American Diabetes Association Provider Recognition Program (PRP). Secondary outcomes were evaluated using the Problem Areas in Diabetes 2 quality of life scale, lipid and HbA1c levels, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression scale.\n                The program was well implemented and significantly improved both the number of laboratory assays and patient-centered aspects of diabetes care patients received compared with those in the control condition. There was overall improvement on secondary outcomes of lipids, HbA1c, quality of life, and depression scores; between-condition differences were not significant.\n                Staff in small, mixed-payer primary care offices can consistently implement a patient-centered intervention to improve PRP measures of quality of diabetes care. Alternative explanations for why these process improvements did not lead to improved outcomes, and suggested directions for future research are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "There is a need for practical, efficient and broad-reaching diabetes self-management interventions that can produce changes in lifestyle behaviours such as healthy eating and weight loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate such a computer-assisted intervention.\n                Type 2 diabetes primary care patients (n=335) from fee-for-service and health maintenance organization settings were randomized to social cognitive theory-based tailored self-management (TSM) or computer-aided enhanced usual care (UC). Intervention consisted of computer-assisted self-management assessment and feedback, tailored goal-setting, barrier identification, and problem-solving, followed by health counsellor interaction and follow-up calls. Outcomes were changes in dietary behaviours (fat and fruit/vegetable intake), haemoglobin Alc (HbA1c), lipids, weight, quality of life, and depression.\n                TSM patients reduced dietary fat intake and weight significantly more than UC patients at the 2-month follow-up. Among patients having elevated levels of HbA1c, lipids or depression at baseline, there were consistent directional trends favouring intervention, but these differences did not reach significance. The intervention proved feasible and was implemented successfully by a variety of staff.\n                This relatively low-intensity intervention appealed to a large, generally representative sample of patients, was well implemented, and produced improvement in targeted behaviours.

The primary study aim was to assess the impact on A1c of a cell phone-based diabetes management software system used with web-based data analytics and therapy optimization tools. Secondary aims examined health care provider (HCP) adherence to prescribing guidelines and assessed HCPs' adoption of the technology.\n                Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from three community physician practices for a 3-month study and evenly randomized. The intervention group received cell phone-based software designed by endocrinologists and CDEs (WellDoc Communications, Inc., Baltimore, MD). The software provided real-time feedback on patients' blood glucose levels, displayed patients' medication regimens, incorporated hypo- and hyperglycemia treatment algorithms, and requested additional data needed to evaluate diabetes management. Patient data captured and transferred to secure servers were analyzed by proprietary statistical algorithms. The system sent computer-generated logbooks (with suggested treatment plans) to intervention patients' HCPs.\n                The average decrease in A1c for intervention patients was 2.03%, compared to 0.68% (P < 0.02, one-tailed) for control patients.

This study evaluated minimal and moderate support versions of an Internet-based diabetes self-management program, compared to an enhanced usual care condition.\n                A three-arm practical randomized trial was conducted to evaluate minimal contact and moderate contact versions of an Internet-based diabetes self-management program, offered in English and Spanish, compared to enhanced usual care. A heterogeneous sample of 463 type 2 patients was randomized and 82.5% completed a 4-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were behavior changes in healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. Secondary outcomes included hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, lipids, and blood pressure.\n                The Internet-based intervention produced significantly greater improvements than the enhanced usual care condition on three of four behavioral outcomes (effect sizes [d] for healthy eating = 0.32; fat intake = 0.28; physical activity= 0.19) in both intent-to-treat and complete-cases analyses. These changes did not translate into differential improvements in biological outcomes during the 4-month study period. Added contact did not further enhance outcomes beyond the minimal contact intervention.\n                The Internet intervention meets several of the RE-AIM criteria for potential public health impact, including reaching a large number of persons, and being practical, feasible, and engaging for participants, but with mixed effectiveness in improving outcomes, and consistent results across different subgroups.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive routine care (control, n = 48), to the self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG, n = 47) group, or to the u-healthcare group (n = 49). The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving A1C <7% without hypoglycemia at 6 months. U-healthcare system refers to an individualized medical service in which medical instructions are given through the patient's mobile phone. Patients receive a glucometer with a public switched telephone network-connected cradle that automatically transfers test results to a hospital-based server. Once the data are transferred to the server, an automated system, the CDSS rule engine, generates and sends patient-specific messages by mobile phone.\n                After 6 months of follow-up, the mean A1C level was significantly decreased from 7.8 \u00b1 1.3% to 7.4 \u00b1 1.0% (P < 0.001) in the u-healthcare group and from 7.9 \u00b1 1.0% to 7.7 \u00b1 1.0% (P = 0.020) in the SMBG group, compared with 7.9 \u00b1 0.8% to 7.8 \u00b1 1.0% (P = 0.274) in the control group. The proportion of patients with A1C <7% without hypoglycemia was 30.6% in the u-healthcare group, 23.4% in the SMBG group (23.4%), and 14.0% in the control group (P < 0.05).\n                The CDSS-based u-healthcare service achieved better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia than SMBG and routine care and may provide effective and safe diabetes management in the elderly diabetic patients.",
