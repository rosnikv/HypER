        "Abstract":"This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of conducting a double-blind clinical trial for the prevention of lung cancer with selenium (Se) in Yunnan Tin Corporation, the People's Republic of China, where the incidence rates of lung cancer are extraordinarily high among the miners. Forty healthy miners were randomized to either 300 micrograms of Se in high Se malt cakes or an identical placebo of malt cakes daily for one year. Subjects consumed their usual daily diet. The low Se concentrations in plasma (0.05 +\/- 0.008 microgram\/mL) and hair (0.442 +\/- 0.085 microgram\/g) reflected their low dietary Se intake in the control subjects. In Se-supplemented group, the Se status was increased by 178% for serum and 194.8% for hair. The serum GSHpx activity was increased by 155.7%, whereas the lipid peroxide level was reduced by 74.5% compared to the placebo. The results of UDS assay indicated that the lymphocyte DNA damage induced by ultraviolet irradiation and carcinogen 3,4-benzpyrene could be protected by Se supplementation. Se-supplementation did not affect the liver function test (SGPT), as well as the concentrations of hemoglobin, albumin, and cholesterol. Thus, daily intake of 300 micrograms Se in form of Se-malt as a chemopreventive measure is safe and effective to humans with low Se status.",

        "Title":"Does dietary arsenic and mercury affect cutaneous bleeding time and blood lipids in humans?",
        "Abstract":"Fish species may contain considerable amounts of trace elements, such as selenium (Se), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg). The present study investigated the relationships between dietary intake of these elements and cutaneous bleeding time and blood lipids in 32 healthy volunteers. For 6 wk, one group (n = 11) consumed approx 250 g Se-rich fish daily, providing them with an average Se intake of 115 +\/- 31 micrograms Se\/d, Hg intake of 18 +\/- 8 micrograms\/d, and As intake of 806 +\/- 405 micrograms\/d, all values analyzed in 4-d duplicate food collections. To study the effect of Se alone, one group (n = 11) included Se-rich bread in their normal diet, giving them a Se intake (135 +\/- 25 micrograms\/d) that was comparable to the fish group. A control group (n = 10) ate their normal diet, providing 77 +\/- 25 micrograms Se\/d, 3.1 +\/- 2.5 micrograms Hg\/d, and 101 +\/- 33 micrograms As\/d. The dietary As load strongly correlated both with bleeding times and changes in bleeding times (r = 0.48, p < 0.01 and r = 0.54, p < 0.002, respectively). Dietary Hg showed a positive correlation with LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.55, p < 0.01), whereas dietary Hg in the fish group showed a strong negative relationship with HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.76, p < 0.01). Selenium seemed to have only a modest effect on bleeding time. Our results suggest that mercury and arsenic from fish may be factors contributing to or modifying some of the known effects of fish ingestion.",

Groups 1 and 2 ingested 5.4 g n-3 PUFA daily (as ethyl esters), whereas groups 3 and 4 received placebo capsules.

In group 1, plasma-conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) rose by 130% (p < 0.005) and 126% (p < 0.005), respectively. Two-way ANOVA showed significant interaction effects of Se and n-3 PUFA on changes in conjugated dienes (p = 0.03) and TBARS (p = 0.015), Se treatment apparently modifying the peroxidative effects of n-3 PUFA. In subjects receiving n-3 PUFA, changes in conjugated dienes and TBARS were negatively correlated with changes in serum Se. In summary, n-3 PUFA modified the effect of Se supplementation, whereas Se seemed to modify the peroxidative effects of n-3 PUFA.",

        "Abstract":"Increased Se intakes have been associated with decreased risk of cancer and CVD. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including antioxidant effects through selenoproteins, induction of carcinogen metabolism and effects on the blood lipid profile. In a 4 x 1 week randomised, double-blind cross-over study, healthy young men supplemented their usual diet with selenate, Se-enriched yeast, Se-enriched milk or placebo (Se dose was 300 microg\/d for selenate and Se-enriched yeast, and about 480 microg\/d for Se-enriched milk) followed by 8-week washout periods. All Se sources increased serum Se levels after supplementation for 1 week. The effect of the organic forms did not differ significantly and both increased serum Se more than selenate. Conversely, thrombocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX) was increased in the periods where subjects were supplemented with selenate but not in those where they were given Se-enriched yeast or Se-enriched milk. We found no effect on plasma lipid resistance to oxidation, total cholesterol, TAG, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, GPX, glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities measured in erythrocytes, GPX and GR activities determined in plasma, or GR and GST activities in thrombocytes. Leucocyte expression of genes encoding selenoproteins (GPX1, TrR1 and SelP), and of electrophile response element-regulated genes (GCLC, Fra1 and NQO1) were likewise unaffected at all time points following intervention. We conclude that thrombocyte GPX is specifically increased by short-term selenate supplementation, but not by short-term supplementation with organic Se. Short-term Se supplementation does not seem to affect blood lipid markers or expression and activity of selected enzymes and a transcription factor involved in glutathione-mediated detoxification and antioxidation.",

        "Abstract":"Increased intake of selenium (Se) may reduce the risk of degenerative diseases including cancer but excessive intake may be toxic. Wheat is a major source of dietary Se in humans. However, the effect of Se from wheat that is agronomically biofortified with Se on biomarkers of human health status is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether improving Se status, by increased dietary intake of Se-biofortified wheat, affects biomarkers of cancer risk, cardiovascular disease risk, oxidative stress, and immune function in healthy South Australian men. A 24-week placebo-controlled double-blind intervention was performed in healthy older men (n = 62), with increased dose of Se intake every 8 weeks. Wheat was provided as 1, 2, and 3 puffed wheat biscuits, during weeks 1-8, 9-16, and 17-24, respectively. Blood was collected to measure a wide range of disease risk biomarkers. Consumption of Se-biofortified wheat was found to increase plasma Se concentration from a baseline level of 122 to 192 microg\/L following intake of three biscuits\/day, which provided 267 microg Se. Platelet glutathione peroxidase, chromosome aberrations, and DNA damage in lymphocytes measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay and with the Comet assay, plasma F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, plasma C-reactive protein, and leukocyte number were unaffected by the improved Se status. Improvement of Se status by consumption of Se-biofortified wheat did not substantially modify the selected biomarkers of degenerative disease risk and health status in this apparently selenium-replete cohort of healthy older men in South Australia.\n                Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

        "Abstract":"Selenium is an essential trace nutrient required for the synthesis of selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, the major forms of selenium in the endothelium that have important functions relevant to inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Selenium deficiency is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death in animals, and a low selenium status is associated with cardiovascular disease in humans. Endothelial dysfunction, measured as the impaired flow-mediated vasorelaxation of the brachial artery, is a reliable indicator of future cardiovascular disease risk in healthy individuals. To test whether selenium supplementation affects endothelial function, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in healthy men who were administered 300 microg of selenium a day as high-selenium yeast for 48 wk. Brachial artery responsiveness to transient occlusion was assessed at baseline and after 24 and 48 wk of supplementation. The supplementation increased the selenium concentration by more than half in blood plasma and erythrocytes. However, there was no effect of selenium on arterial diameter or blood flow rate before or after transient occlusion or on the maximum dilated diameter after the administration of nitroglycerin. This study indicates that selenium supplementation is not likely to improve endothelial function or peripheral arterial responsiveness in healthy North American men receiving adequate selenium from their diets.",
