        "Title": "Reduction in sudden deaths by a multifactorial intervention programme after acute myocardial infarction.",
        "Abstract": "375 consecutive patients below 65 years who had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) took part in a randomised rehabilitation and secondary prevention trial (part of a W.H.O.-coordinated project) designed to study the effects of a multifactorial intervention programme on morbidity, mortality, return to work, &c. After three years' follow-up the cumulative coronary mortality was significantly smaller in the intervention group than in the controls (18.6% versus 29.4%, p = 0.02). This difference was mainly due to a reduction of sudden deaths in the intervention group (5.8% versus 14.4%, p less than 0.01). The reduction was greatest during the first six months after AMI. 18.1% in the intervention group and 11.2% in the controls (p less than 0.10) presented with non-fatal reinfarctions. The number of patients with new Q-QS findings at the end of the three years was, however, almost the same in both groups. The results suggest that organised aftercare during the first six months after AMI with special emphasis on optimum medical control and health education contributes significantly to a reduction in the number of sudden deaths.",

The subjects, aged to 30 to 64 years, were screened for eligibility 2 to 36 months after their qualifying myocardial infarction. The men in the exercise group pursued intensive exercise in the laboratory for 8 weeks and then in a gymnasium for 34 months. The experience of the exercise group was more favorable than that of the control group in most of the comparisons made. The cumulative 3 year total mortality rate was 7.3 percent for the control group and 4.6 percent for the exercise group; the 3 year rate for recurrent myocardial infarction was 7.0 and 5.3 percent, respectively. Mortality rates in the two groups did not differ significantly, but the data were consistent with an assumption of substantial benefit from exercise. Adjustment for small differences in baseline variables by multivariate methods did not materially alter the estimate of effect of exercise. Certain subgroups showed a greater benefit from exercise.",

Eight per cent of the exercise group died during the period of follow-up, compared with 14 per cent of the control group; this difference is not significant. There was an apparent improvement in mortality in those with inferior MI who completed the exercise course, which was not seen in those with MI in other sites. For many patients after MI progressive exercise is safe, improves physical fitness and may reduce mortality for those after inferior MI.",

        "Abstract": "Prognosis during 5 years of follow-up after first myocardial infarction (MI) in a group of men (aged 40 to 55 years) was related to risk factors determined at the time of MI. Progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) was measured by the occurrence of severe angina pectoris, recurrent myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. Only smoking and serum cholesterol level influenced prognosis. It was possible to identify a subgroup (patients smoking less than 20 cigarettes/day and having a cholesterol level of less than 7.0 mmoles/L) with low risk for progression of CAD. A randomly applied 6-week rehabilitation program shortly after MI was associated with a 50% decrease in progressive CAD when compared to the control group. Since only a slight decrease in cholesterol levels was found in the rehabilitation group, a direct effect of the rehabilitation program could thus not be excluded because the second important risk factor, smoking, did not show differences between the two groups. The smoking habits at the time of MI determined the continuation of cigarette smoking and rehabilitation did not influence smoking habits.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of exercise training for increasing functional capacity in the 6 months after clinically uncomplicated myocardial infarction, 198 men 52 +/- 9 years of age participated in a training study. They were randomly assigned to one of four exercise protocols: 8 to 26 weeks of training at home (group 1, n = 66) or in a group program (group 2, n = 61) following treadmill testing performed 3 weeks after infarction, treadmill testing at 3 weeks without subsequent training (group 3, n = 34), and treadmill testing for the first time at 26 weeks (control, n = 37). At 26 weeks functional capacity was significantly higher in patients training at home or in a group program than that in patients without training or in control patients: 8.1 +/- 1.5, 8.5 +/- 1.3, 7.5 +/- 1.8, and 7.0 +/- 1.7 METs, respectively (p less than .05 and p less than .001). No significant differences in functional capacity were noted between patients training at home and those in a group program. No training-related complications occurred. Home and group training are equally effective in increasing functional capacity of low-risk patients after myocardial infarction.",

        "Abstract": "This investigation was designed to determine the impact of a brief period of cardiac rehabilitation, initiated within 6 weeks of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), on both disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, exercise tolerance and return to work after AMI. With a stratified, parallel group design, 201 low-risk patients with evidence of depression or anxiety, or both, after AMI, were randomized to either an 8-week program of exercise conditioning and behavioral counseling or to conventional care. Although the differences were small, significantly greater improvement was seen in rehabilitation group patients at 8 weeks in the emotions dimension of a new disease-specific, health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire, in their state of anxiety and in exercise tolerance. All measures of health-related quality of life in both groups improved significantly over the 12-month follow-up period. However, the 95% confidence intervals around differences between groups at the 12-month follow-up effectively excluded sustained, clinically important benefits of rehabilitation in disease-specific (limitations, -2.70, 1.40; emotions, -4.86, 1.10, where negative values favor conventional care and positive values favor rehabilitation) and generic health-related quality of life (time trade-off, -0.062, 0.052; quality of well-being, -0.042, 0.035) or in exercise tolerance (-38.5, 52.1 kpm/min); also, return to work was similar in the 2 groups (relative risk, 0.93; confidence interval, 0.71, 1.64).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Randomly chosen MI-patients participated, either in a six-month rehabilitation programme (intervention group = 53) or in routine cardiac follow-ups (control group = 63). Subjective and objective instruments were used for measuring their health recovery. Biophysical improvements were showed as an increased physical capacity (p less than 0.001) using a submaximal exercise test six months after MI, and less reinfarctions (p less than 0.024) twelve months after MI, to the intervention patients' advantage. Psychological improvements were demonstrated in a higher life satisfaction (p less than 0.001) six months and (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) twelve months after MI to the intervention patients' advantage. Social improvements were indicated as a better leisure situation (p less than 0.004) six months after MI, and as a better partner situation (p less than 0.010), including a less influenced sex life (p less than 0.017), twelve months after MI to the intervention patients' advantage. As to the overall view, the caring rehabilitation programme appeared to be required for the MI-patients' health recovery. In order to be able to reach an optimal state of human health, an even more individualised programme seems to be necessary.",

Patients were assessed at entry to the study and at intervals thereafter. Assessment was by questionnaire and objective tests consisting of a 12-minute walking test and weekly outpatient pedometry. In the rehabilitation group patients were able to walk further and faster, return to work earlier, undertake more housework, and resume normal sexual activity; they were less short of breath and did not experience more angina. However, the rehabilitation course brought little benefit to the patients' perception of well-being and their anxiety about health or their outlook on life. Exercise and advice are important components of a rehabilitation programme, but more attention needs to be given to the psychological aspects of recovery from a heart attack.",

        "Abstract": "Significant regression of coronary and femoral atherosclerotic lesions has been documented by angiographic studies using aggressive lipid-lowering treatment. This study tested the applicability and effects of intensive physical exercise and low-fat diet on coronary morphology and myocardial perfusion in nonselected patients with stable angina pectoris.\n                Patients were recruited after routine coronary angiography for stable angina pectoris; they were randomized to an intervention group (n = 56) and a control group on \"usual care\" (n = 57). Treatment comprised intensive physical exercise in group training sessions (minimum, 2 hr/wk), daily home exercise periods (20 min/d), and low-fat, low-cholesterol diet (American Heart Association recommendation, phase 3). No lipid-lowering agents were prescribed. After 12 months of participation, repeat coronary angiography was performed; relative and minimal diameter reductions of coronary lesions were measured by digital image processing. Change in myocardial perfusion was assessed by 201Tl scintigraphy. In patients participating in the intervention group, body weight decreased by 5% (p less than 0.001), total cholesterol by 10% (p less than 0.001), and triglycerides by 24% (p less than 0.001); high density lipoproteins increased by 3% (p = NS). Physical work capacity improved by 23% (p less than 0.0001), and myocardial oxygen consumption, as estimated from maximal rate-pressure product, by 10% (p less than 0.05). Stress-induced myocardial ischemia decreased concurrently, indicating improvement of myocardial perfusion. Based on minimal lesion diameter, progression of coronary lesions was noted in nine patients (23%), no change in 18 patients (45%), and regression in 13 patients (32%). In the control group, metabolic and hemodynamic variables remained essentially unchanged, whereas progression of coronary lesions was noted in 25 patients (48%), no change in 18 patients (35%), and regression in nine patients (17%).

        "Abstract": "Recent clinical trials have shown that modification of plasma lipoprotein concentrations can favorably alter progression of coronary atherosclerosis, but no data exist on the effects of a comprehensive program of risk reduction involving both changes in lifestyle and medications. This study tested the hypothesis that intensive multiple risk factor reduction over 4 years would significantly reduce the rate of progression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries of men and women compared with subjects randomly assigned to the usual care of their physician.\n                Three hundred men (n = 259) and women (n = 41) (mean age, 56 +/- 7.4 years) with angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis were randomly assigned to usual care (n = 155) or multifactor risk reduction (n = 145). Patients assigned to risk reduction were provided individualized programs involving a low-fat and -cholesterol diet, exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, and medications to favorably alter lipoprotein profiles. Computer-assisted quantitative coronary arteriography was performed at baseline and after 4 years. The main angiographic outcome was the rate of change in the minimal diameter of diseased segments. All subjects underwent medical and risk factor evaluations at baseline and yearly for 4 years, and reasons for all hospitalizations and deaths were documented. Of the 300 subjects randomized, 274 (91.3%) completed a follow-up arteriogram, and 246 (82%) had comparative measurements of segments with visible disease at baseline and follow-up. Intensive risk reduction resulted in highly significant improvements in various risk factors, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (both, 22%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+12%), plasma triglycerides (-20%), body weight (-4%), exercise capacity (+20%), and intake of dietary fat (-24%) and cholesterol (-40%) compared with relatively small changes in the usual-care group. No change was observed in lipoprotein(a) in either group. The risk-reduction group showed a rate of narrowing of diseased coronary artery segments that was 47% less than that for subjects in the usual-care group (change in minimal diameter, -0.024 +/- 0.066 mm/y versus -0.045 +/- 0.073 mm/y; P < .02, two-tailed). Three deaths occurred in each group. There were 25 hospitalizations in the risk-reduction group initiated by clinical cardiac events compared with 44 in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 0.61; P = .05; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.9).\n                Intensive multifactor risk reduction conducted over 4 years favorably altered the rate of luminal narrowing in coronary arteries of men and women with coronary artery disease and decreased hospitalizations for clinical cardiac events.",

        "Abstract": "A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and a concurrent physical disability evaluated the effects of a home exercise training program on cardiovascular function and blood lipids. Eighty-eight men between the ages of 42 and 72 years (mean 62) with documented CAD and a physical disability with functional use of > or = 2 extremities including 1 arm were randomized to either a 6-month home exercise training program using wheelchair ergometry or to a control group that received usual and customary care. Both groups received dietary instructions and were requested to follow a fat-controlled diet. Exercise test variables with echocardiography and blood lipids were measured at baseline and at 6 months. The home exercise training group significantly improved both peak exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.007) and fractional shortening (p = 0.01) between baseline to 6 months, whereas the control group showed no significant changes. Exercise training effects of decreased resting heart rate (p = 0.03) and decreased peak rate pressure product (p = 0.03) were also found in the treatment group. No exercise-related cardiac complications occurred. Both groups significantly (p < or = 0.01) increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. These results indicate that physically disabled men with CAD can safely participate in a home exercise training program which may result in intrinsic cardiac benefits. The metabolic cost of activities of daily living imposed on this disabled population may also have a positive effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",

        "Abstract": "This study evaluated long-term effects of 12 weeks of supervised training, of at least 45 minutes duration with two sessions per week, on physical performance and psychological well-being after myocardial infarction (MI). Sixty-nine patients were randomized to either an exercise or a nonexercise group. Maximum exercise capacity 6 weeks post-MI was inversely related to the acute peak aspartate aminotransferase values in serum, as an index of infarct size. One year post-MI, the increase in level of fitness (10%) in the training group did not significantly exceed (p = .10) that of the controls (2%). No intergroup differences were registered in self-rated psychological well-being and physical scores or in the return to work rate. In the training group, but not in the controls, the change in perceived dyspnoea at leisure-time activities was positively related to the objectively measured peak exercise capacity. We conclude that after MI only marginal improvements in physical performance are achieved 6 months after training is finished, with no long-term psychological benefits apparent versus a usual care program. The adaptive implications of supervised conventional exercise programs post-MI are therefore questioned.",

        "Title": "Interaction between exercise training and ejection fraction in predicting prognosis after a first myocardial infarction.",
        "Abstract": "Although recent meta-analysis trials have shown that exercise training may improve survival after myocardial infarction, the mechanism of this beneficial effect is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to detect possible interactions between exercise training and predictors of prognosis after a first myocardial infarction.\n                Patients with uneventful clinical courses after a first myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to a 4-week training period (125 patients, group 1) or to a control group (131 patients, group 2). Before randomization, all patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test (28 +/- 2 days after myocardial infarction), 24-hour Holter monitoring, and coronary arteriography (31 +/- 3 days after the acute episode). After a mean follow-up period of 34.5 months, 18 patients had cardiac deaths (5 in group 1 and 13 in group 2). Multivariate analysis by Cox regression model showed that ejection fraction was the only independent prognostic indicator (P = .03). Evidence existed of an interaction between ejection fraction and exercise training, showing an effect of physical training on survival that depended on the patient's ejection fraction. Among patients with ejection fractions < 41%, the relative risk for an untrained patient was 8.63 times higher than for a trained patient (P = .04), whereas for ejection fractions > 40%, the estimated risks for trained and untrained patients were similar.\n                These data show that exercise training may prolong survival in post-myocardial infarction patients with depressed left ventricular function. A randomized trial in such patients seems warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Coronary artery diseases (CAD) are main causes of morbidity and hospitalisation in western countries and CAD patients are at considerable risk of suffering further cardiac events. The development and evaluation of secondary prevention programmes therefore an important task. This thesis includes investigations on CAD patients admitted to a secondary prevention programme at Malm\u00f6 University Hospital, Malm\u00f6, Sweden. Four weeks after discharge from the hospital, consecutive male and female patients aged 50-70 years with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomised to a hospital organised preventive intervention or to usual follow-up at their general practitioners. In the three studies using this randomised design, 87 (study II), 90 (study IV), and 106 (study V) intervention patients were available for evaluation. In addition, without randomisation, lipid levels at four weeks after the event was compared with levels estimated within 24 hours after onset of symptoms in 141 AMI patients (study I), and quality of life (QL) were estimated by questionnaire at one month and at one year after the event in 266 AMI, 94 CABG, and 16 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) patients (study III). The prevention programme was effective in improving food habits but showed no impact on smoking habits or physical exercise in AMI patients (study II). The intervention also did not show any significant improvement in working capacity in AMI and CABG patients. However, working capacity improved in both intervention and reference CABG patients, most probably due to improved coronary circulation from the surgery (study IV). Cholesterol levels decreased significantly in AMI and CABG intervention patients as compared to the corresponding reference patients. This difference most likely was due to a higher frequency of lipid lowering drugs used in the intervention patients (study V). The prevention programme also decreased body mass index significantly in AMI but not in CABG patients (study V). In AMI patients receiving thrombolysis, cholesterol levels estimated within 24 hours after onset of symptoms and at four weeks after the event were virtually equal. In AMI patients not receiving thrombolysis, the lipid estimates from four weeks after the event were slightly, but significantly, above the within 24 hours from onset of symptoms estimates (study I). One month after the event, both somatic and psychological aspects of QL were negatively affected in AMI and CABG patients compared to population controls. One year after the event, patients differed from controls mainly in somatic symptoms (study III). Thus, the intervention programme was most successful in affecting lipid levels and food habits in AMI patients. QL was considerably affected in patients following an cardiac event, especially during the initial recovery phase. In addition, in patients receiving thrombolysis, cholesterol levels estimated four weeks after an AMI are reasonably valid estimates of baseline values and may be used to decide about lipid lowering interventions.",

However, elderly patients frequently are not encouraged to participate in such programmes. This study evaluates the physiological effects and self-reported quality of life after an aerobic outpatient group-training programme in subjects above the age of 65 years.\n                A consecutive series of 101 patients (males 80%) aged 65-84 (mean 71) years recovering from an acute coronary event were randomized to either a supervised out patient group-training programme (n=50) or to a control group (n=51). The two groups were well balanced as regards clinical characteristics. The compliance in the training group was 87%. Exercise tolerance increased in the trained group from 104 to 122 and 111 W after 3 and 12 months respectively. The corresponding values were 102, 105 and 105 W among controls.

Risk factor and psychosocial evaluations were conducted at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Repeated measures analyses of covariance revealed that the dietary, stress management, and physical activity changes made by intervention women were dramatic and lasting. There were significantly greater improvements in the Prime Time condition compared to the usual care control group on body mass, angina symptoms, and quality of life, and a tendency for a greater reduction in blood pressure-lowering medications. Similar patterns were seen in lipids, blood pressure, and lipid-lowering medications, but did not reach significance. These results demonstrate that postmenopausal CHD women can make lasting lifestyle changes, and that these changes may reduce the need for cardiac medications and improve CHD risk factors and quality of life.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the rational expectation for a survival benefit produced by exercise training among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients, direct evidence remains elusive. Clinically, changes in autonomic balance toward lower vagal activity have consistently been associated with increased mortality risk; conversely, among both control and post-MI dogs, exercise training improved vagal reflexes and prevented sudden death. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that exercise training, if accompanied by a shift toward increased vagal activity of an autonomic marker such as baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), could reduce mortality in post-MI patients.\n                Ninety-five consecutive male patients surviving a first uncomplicated MI were randomly assigned to a 4-week endurance training period or to no training. Age (51+/-8 versus 52+/-8 years), site of MI (anterior 41% versus 43%), left ventricular ejection fraction (52+/-13 versus 51+/-14%), and BRS (7.9+/-5.4 versus 7.9+/-3.4 ms/mm Hg) did not differ between the two groups. After 4 weeks, BRS improved by 26% (P=0.04) in trained patients, whereas it did not change in nontrained patients. During a 10-year follow-up, cardiac mortality among the 16 trained patients who had an exercise-induced increase in BRS >or = 3 ms/mm Hg (responders) was strikingly lower compared with that of the trained patients without such a BRS increase (nonresponders) and that of the nontrained patients (0 of 16 versus 18 of 79 [23%], P=0.04). Cardiac mortality was also lower among responders irrespective of training (4% versus 24%, P=0.04).\n                Post-MI exercise training can favorably modify long-term survival, provided that it is associated with a clear shift of the autonomic balance toward an increase in vagal activity.",

TWC and HRQL were determined with cycle ergometry and Sickness Impact Profile at baseline, after CR, and 6 and 12 months later. Within each age group, TWC improved with Hosp-CR and Home-CR and was unchanged with no CR. The improvement was similar in middle-aged and old persons but smaller, although still significant, in very old patients. TWC reverted toward baseline by 12 months with Hosp-CR but not with Home-CR. HRQL improved in middle-aged and old CR and control patients but only with CR in very old patients. Complications were similar across treatment and age groups. Costs were lower for Home-CR than for Hosp-CR.\n                Post-MI Hosp-CR and Home-CR are similarly effective in the short term and improve TWC and HRQL in each age group.

        "Abstract": "Lifestyle measures of coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention have been overshadowed by the efficacy of drug treatments. This is particularly the case in the setting of secondary prevention where the benefits of lipid lowering, anti-platelet and anti-hypertensive drugs have been emphasised in numerous trials. Lifestyle measures address several CHD risk factors at once and are generally free of serious side effects.\n                The objective of the present study was to determine whether a comprehensive programme of lifestyle modification could favourably influence dietary and exercise habits in addition to smoking cessation over two years. In addition, an attempt was made to evaluate if this programme could favourably influence the five-year CHD-risk in the male population included in the study.\n                A total of 197 patients with proven coronary heart disease were included and randomised to a lifestyle intervention programme or to usual care. Follow-up was after a period of two years.\n                Intervention comprised a low fat diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, psychosocial support and education, delivered by nurses on the rationale for pharmacological and lifestyle measures. Usual care comprised follow-up in the routine outpatient clinic. Both groups were given the same comprehensive medication according to recent guidelines.\n                Patients in the lifestyle intervention group reduced the intake of saturated fat, sugar and cholesterol (P<0.001), increased their exercise level (P<0.01) and stopped smoking (P<0.05) when compared with the usual care group. A sub-analysis of the influence of five-year CHD calculated risk in males resulted in a relative risk reduction of 22% (95% confidence intervals 9-35). Although significant, this result must be interpreted with caution due to poor statistical power and reproducibility of the method.\n                In the presence of modern drug treatments for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention it remains possible through a favourable diet, exercise and smoking cessation to show an additional reduction in the five-year risk for CHD in males.",

At baseline, scores of SF-36 except for general health, STAI and SDS were not different in either group. After 6 months, in the intervention group, scores of bodily pain, general health, vitality and mental health of SF-36 improved significantly compared with baseline. State anxiety scores also improved significantly (p<0.01), but SDS depression scores were not improved. In the control group, none of the parameters significantly changed.

        "Abstract": "To evaluate the long-term effect of a cardiac rehabilitation and prevention program (CRPP) on quality of life (QOL) and its cost effectiveness.\n                Prospective, randomized controlled trial.\n                University-affiliated outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and prevention center.\n                A total of 269 patients (76% men; mean age, 64+/-11 y) with recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI; n=193) or after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; n=76) were randomized in a ratio of 2 to 1.\n                Patients received either CRPP (an 8-wk exercise and education class in phase 2) or conventional therapy without exercise program (control group). They were followed until they had completed all 4 phases of the program (ie, 2 y).\n                QOL assessments, by using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Symptoms Questionnaire, were performed at the end of each phase. Direct health care cost was calculated, whereas cost utility was estimated as money spent (in US dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.\n                In the CRPP group, 6 of the 8 SF-36 dimensions improved significantly by phase 2 and were maintained throughout the study period. Patients were less anxious and depressed, and felt more relaxed and contented. In the control group, none of the SF-36 dimensions were improved by phase 2, and bodily pain was increased. In phase 4, only 4 dimensions were improved. Symptoms were unchanged except for increased hostility score. There was a significant gain in net time trade-off in the CRPP group after phase 2. The direct health care expenses in the CRPP and control groups were 15,292 dollars and 15,707 dollars per patient, respectively. Therefore, the cost utility calculated was 640 dollars saved per QALY gained. Savings attributable to CRPP were primarily explained by the lower rate (13% vs 26% of patients, chi2 test=3.9, P <.05) and cost of subsequent PCI (P =.01).\n                In an era of managing patients with coronary heart disease, a short-course CRPP was highly cost effective in providing better QOL to patients with recent AMI or after elective PCI. In addition, the improvement of QOL was quick and sustained for at least 2 years after CRPP.",

        "Title": "Return to full normal activities including work at two weeks after acute myocardial infarction.",
        "Abstract": "Patients are generally advised to return to full normal activities, including work, 6 to 8 weeks after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We assessed the outcomes of early return to normal activities, including work at 2 weeks, after AMI in patients who were stratified to be at a low risk for future cardiac events. Patients were considered for randomization before discharge if they had no angina, had left ventricular ejection fraction >40%, a negative result from a symptom-limited exercise stress test for ischemia (<2 mm ST depression) at 1 week, and achieved >7 METs. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% were included only if they did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia at electrophysiologic studies. Seventy-two patients were randomized to return to normal activities at 2 weeks and 70 patients to undergo standard cardiac rehabilitation and return to normal activities at 6 weeks after AMI. There were no deaths or heart failure in either group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of reinfarction, revascularization, left ventricular function, lipids, body mass index, smoking, or exercise test results at 6 months. In conclusion, return to full normal activities, including work at 2 weeks, after AMI appears to be safe in patients who are stratified to a low-risk group. This should have significant medical and socioeconomic implications.",

        "Abstract": "Limited data are available regarding the effects of phase III cardiac rehabilitation on the physical status and risk factors in elderly patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\n                Thirty-four male CAD patients (>65 years old) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=18) or a control group (n=16). The intervention group participated in a phase III cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of exercise training, diet therapy, and weekly counseling for 6 months. In the control group, usual outpatient care was provided. In the intervention group, body mass index, waist size and fat weight significantly decreased; peak VO2 and anaerobic threshold VO2 were maintained; isokinetic peak torques of knee extensor and flexor muscles significantly increased; anterior trunk flexibility was significantly improved. In the control group, all parameters were unchanged except for peak VO2, which significantly decreased. In the intervention group, serum total cholesterol levels significantly decreased after cardiac rehabilitation. However, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apoA-I levels also decreased. In the control group, no significant change in lipid profile was observed.\n                The results suggest that phase III cardiac rehabilitation could be beneficial for elderly patients with CAD.",

        "Title": "Hospital-based comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation versus usual care among patients with congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or high risk of ischemic heart disease: 12-month results of a randomized clinical trial.",
        "Abstract": "Current guidelines broadly recommend comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR), although evidence for this is still limited. We investigated the 12-month effect of hospital-based CCR versus usual care (UC) for a broadly defined group of cardiac patients within the modern therapeutic era of cardiology.\n                We conducted a centrally randomized single-center clinical trial with blinded assessment of the primary outcome: registry-based composite of total mortality, myocardial infarction, or acute first-time readmission due to heart disease. Other outcomes were hospitalization, risk profile, and quality of life. The trial included 770 participants (20-94 years) with congestive heart failure (12%), ischemic heart disease (58%), or high risk of ischemic heart disease (30%). Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation is composed of 6 weeks of intensive intervention and systematic follow-up for 10.5 months.\n                We randomized 380 patients to CCR versus 390 to UC. Randomization was well balanced. The primary outcome occurred in 31% of both groups (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.26). Compared with the UC group, CCR significantly reduced length of stay by 15% (95% confidence interval 1.1%-27.1%, P = .04), mean number of cardiac risk factors above target (4.5 vs 4.1, P = .01), patients with systolic blood pressure below target (P = .003), physically inactivity (P = .01), and unhealthy dietary habits (P = .0003). Short-Form-36 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale did not differ significantly.\n                At 12 months, the CCR and UC groups did not differ regarding the primary composite outcome. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation significantly reduced length of hospital stay and improved cardiac risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of high frequency exercise for patients before and after an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with special reference to maximal aerobic capacity, muscle function, health related quality of life (HRQoL), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and restenosis.\n                A randomised, controlled study was performed in Sweden between 2004 and 2006 in thirty-seven patients (five women) with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), age 63.6+/-6.9 years, randomised to either high frequency exercise or control group. The patients in the training group performed three endurance resistance exercises and trained on a cycle ergometer 30 min, 5 times a week for 8 months at 70% of VO(2max).\n                Patients in the training group significantly improved their maximal aerobic capacity (15 (9-46) vs. 8 (0-18)% p<or=0.05), shoulder flexion (p<or=0.01), shoulder abduction (p<or=0.01) and heel-lift (p<or=0.05) compared to the control group. There were no significant differences between the groups in HRQoL, WHR and restenosis.\n                High frequency exercise in patients treated with PCI seems to improve maximal aerobic capacity and muscle function, which may reduce the risks of further progression of atherosclerosis. However, further larger studies are needed to fully investigate the effects of exercise in patients with PCI.",

The prevalence of angina pectoris fell by 10% in the treatment group but rose by 60% in the control group. The perceived energy level rose by significantly more in the treatment group than in the controls. The rise in predicted maximum oxygen uptake was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group as was the reduction in the double product (a reflection of myocardial workload) at peak exercise.

        "Abstract": "The effects of an exercise program started early after myocardial infraction and the added effects of an outpatient teaching-counseling program were studied. At random, 84 patients were allocated to a control group (A), 88 patients to an exercise group (B1) and 86 patients to an exercise and teaching-counseling group (B2). The same exercise program was prescribed for patients in groups B1 and B2 and was started about 4.5 days after myocardial infarction and continued for 3 months. The outpatient teaching-counseling program consisted of eight group sessions pertaining to risk factor reduction and psychosocial adjustment to myocardial infraction. A low-level treadmill test and an exercise test were performed at 3 months and the exercise test was repeated at 6 months. The clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic responses to these tests were not different among the three groups. However, by the end of 3 months, patients in group B1 and B2 reported walking greater distances than patients in group A. The incidence of morbidity and mortality was not different between the groups. No deleterious or beneficial physiologic effects of an exercise program either by itself or combined with a teaching-counseling program were demonstrated. Routine medical care and our interventions were equally effective in permitting the spontaneous hemodynamics improvements after myocardial infraction. More than 3 months after myocardial infarction, the group as a whole manifested spontaneous recovery in the form of a significant decrease in resting heart rate (p less than 0.001) and a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and with submaximal exercise (p less than 0.001). No further improvements were observed between 3 and 6 months.",
