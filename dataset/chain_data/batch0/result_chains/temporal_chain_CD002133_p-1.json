        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAntithrombotic drugs are used after coronary-artery stenting to prevent stent thrombosis. We compared the efficacy and safety of three antithrombotic-drug regimens - aspirin alone, aspirin and warfarin, and aspirin and ticlopidine - after coronary stenting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 1965 patients who underwent coronary stenting at 50 centers, 1653 (84.1 percent) met angiographic criteria for successful placement of the stent and were randomly assigned to one of three regimens: aspirin alone (557 patients), aspirin and warfarin (550 patients), or aspirin and ticlopidine (546 patients). All clinical events reflecting stent thrombosis were included in the prespecified primary end point: death, revascularization of the target lesion, angiographically evident thrombosis, or myocardial infarction within 30 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point was observed in 38 patients: 20 (3.6 percent) assigned to receive aspirin alone, 15 (2.7 percent) assigned to receive aspirin and warfarin, and 3 (0.5 percent) assigned to receive aspirin and ticlopidine (P=0.001 for the comparison of all three groups). Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 10 patients (1.8 percent) who received aspirin alone, 34 (6.2 percent) who received aspirin and warfarin, and 30 (5.5 percent) who received aspirin and ticlopidine (P<0.001 for the comparison of all three groups); the incidence of vascular surgical complications was 0.4 percent (2 patients), 2.0 percent (11 patients), and 2.0 percent (11 patients), respectively (P=0.01). There were no significant differences in the incidence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (overall incidence, 0.3 percent) among the three treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with aspirin alone and a combination of aspirin and warfarin, treatment with aspirin and ticlopidine resulted in a lower rate of stent thrombosis, although there were more hemorrhagic complications than with aspirin alone. After coronary stenting, aspirin and ticlopidine should be considered for the prevention of the serious complication of stent thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "In response to physiological stimuli (eg, wound healing), normally quiescent smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the vessel wall can be activated to migrate and proliferate to produce new blood vessels. In addition to this physiological response, pathological migration and proliferation within the vessel wall can occur in disease states. Examples of such disease states include tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, accelerated arteriopathy after cardiac transplantation, and neointimal proliferation after balloon angioplasty (PTCA) and stent placement. An important limitation of PTCA is restenosis, which is due in large part to luminal narrowing; restenosis occurs in 20% to 40% of patients within the first few months after a successful intervention.1,2 The percentage of patients that develop early restenosis after PTCA can be reduced by stent implantation. However, stents actually increase the amount of late luminal narrowing due to intimal hyperplasia,3 and the overall rate of stent restenosis remains unacceptably high (\u224830%).\n\nNumerous pharmacological agents, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors, and cytotoxic agents, have failed to adequately reduce restenosis after PTCA and stenting. Novel therapeutic approaches based on understanding the molecular mechanisms that cause intimal hyperplasia are needed to reduce the high incidence of stent restenosis. Arterial injury is associated with SMC activation and re-entry into the cell cycle. Multiple approaches to inhibiting SMC proliferation have been and are being evaluated. Gene delivery systems aimed at blocking SMC proliferation after PTCA have been tested4,5; however, the low efficiency and/or potential hazards of this approach may limit its usefulness. Radiation therapy has been evaluated in numerous studies and has shown considerable promise as a nonpharmacological, antiproliferative approach for the reduction of restenosis. However, significant side effects, including late stent thrombosis, may also limit its usefulness.6\u20138 The unusually late stent thrombosis seen in the patients treated with \u2026",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPreliminary reports of studies involving simple coronary lesions indicate that a sirolimus-eluting stent significantly reduces the risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard stent in 1058 patients at 53 centers in the United States who had a newly diagnosed lesion in a native coronary artery. The coronary disease in these patients was complex because of the frequent presence of diabetes (in 26 percent of patients), the high percentage of patients with longer lesions (mean, 14.4 mm), and small vessels (mean, 2.80 mm). The primary end point was failure of the target vessel (a composite of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, and repeated percutaneous or surgical revascularization of the target vessel) within 270 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rate of failure of the target vessel was reduced from 21.0 percent with a standard stent to 8.6 percent with a sirolimus-eluting stent (P<0.001)--a reduction that was driven largely by a decrease in the frequency of the need for revascularization of the target lesion (16.6 percent in the standard-stent group vs. 4.1 percent in the sirolimus-stent group, P<0.001). The frequency of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent was also decreased in the group that received sirolimus-eluting stents, as assessed by both angiography and intravascular ultrasonography. Subgroup analyses revealed a reduction in the rates of angiographic restenosis and target-lesion revascularization in all subgroups examined.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this randomized clinical trial involving patients with complex coronary lesions, the use of a sirolimus-eluting stent had a consistent treatment effect, reducing the rates of restenosis and associated clinical events in all subgroups analyzed.",

Design Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of 258\u2009544 patient years of follow-up from randomized trials. Data sources and study selection PubMed, Embase, and Central were searched for randomized trials comparing any of the Food and Drug Administration approved durable polymer drug eluting stents (sirolimus eluting, paclitaxel eluting, cobalt chromium everolimus eluting, platinum chromium everolimus eluting, zotarolimus eluting-Endeavor, and zotarolimus eluting-Resolute) or biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents, with each other or against bare metal stents. Outcomes Long term efficacy (target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis). Landmark analysis at more than one year was evaluated to assess the potential late benefit of biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents. Results From 126 randomized trials and 258\u2009544 patient years of follow-up, for long term efficacy (target vessel revascularization), biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to paclitaxel eluting stents (rate ratio 0.66, 95% credibility interval 0.57 to 0.78) and zotarolimus eluting stent-Endeavor (0.69, 0.56 to 0.84) but not to newer generation durable polymer drug eluting stents (for example: 1.03, 0.89 to 1.21 versus cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents). Similarly, biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to paclitaxel eluting stents (rate ratio 0.61, 0.37 to 0.89) but inferior to cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents (2.04, 1.27 to 3.35) for long term safety (definite stent thrombosis). In the landmark analysis after one year, biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to sirolimus eluting stents for definite stent thrombosis (rate ratio 0.29, 0.10 to 0.82) but were associated with increased mortality compared with cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents (1.52, 1.02 to 2.22). Overall, among all stent types, the newer generation durable polymer drug eluting stents (zotarolimus eluting stent-Resolute, cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents, and platinum chromium everolimus eluting stents) were the most efficacious (lowest target vessel revascularization rate) stents, and cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents were the safest with significant reductions in definite stent thrombosis (rate ratio 0.35, 0.21 to 0.53), myocardial infarction (0.65, 0.55 to 0.75), and death (0.72, 0.58 to 0.90) compared with bare metal stents. Conclusions Biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents are superior to first generation durable polymer drug eluting stents but not to newer generation durable polymer stents in reducing target vessel revascularization. Newer generation durable polymer stents, and especially cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents, have the best combination of efficacy and safety. The utility of biodegradable polymer stents in the context of excellent clinical outcomes with newer generation durable polymer stents needs to be proven.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nBiodegradable-polymer drug-eluting stents (BP-DES) were developed to be as effective as second-generation durable-polymer drug-eluting stents (DP-DES) and as safe >1 year as bare-metal stents (BMS). Thus, very late stent thrombosis (VLST) attributable to durable polymers should no longer appear.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTo address these early and late aspects, 2291 patients presenting with acute or stable coronary disease needing stents \u22653.0 mm in diameter between April 2010 and May 2012 were randomly assigned to biolimus-A9-eluting BP-DES, second-generation everolimus-eluting DP-DES, or thin-strut silicon-carbide-coated BMS in 8 European centers. All patients were treated with aspirin and risk-adjusted doses of prasugrel. The primary end point was combined cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated target-vessel revascularization within 2 years. The combined secondary safety end point was a composite of VLST, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. The cumulative incidence of the primary end point was 7.6% with BP-DES, 6.8% with DP-DES, and 12.7% with BMS. By intention-to-treat BP-DES were noninferior (predefined margin, 3.80%) compared with DP-DES (absolute risk difference, 0.78%; -1.93% to 3.50%; P for noninferiority 0.042; per protocol P=0.09) and superior to BMS (absolute risk difference, -5.16; -8.32 to -2.01; P=0.0011). The 3 stent groups did not differ in the combined safety end point, with no decrease in events >1 year, particularly VLST with BP-DES.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn large vessel stenting, BP-DES appeared barely noninferior compared with DP-DES and more effective than thin-strut BMS, but without evidence for better safety nor lower VLST rates >1 year.

Methods The Nobori 2 study was a prospective, multicentre, observational registry evaluating the safety and the efficacy of the biodegradable polymer biolimus-eluting stent (BP-BES) among 3067 patients recruited at 125 international sites. The primary combined endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction and target-lesion revascularisation (TLR). Results Five-year follow-up was available in 2738 (89.3%) patients.

We evaluated longer term (8\u201310\u2005years) clinical and angiographic outcomes after BP-BES implantation. Methods Between 2005 and 2008, 243 patients (301 lesions) underwent BP-BES implantation. The primary clinical outcome measure was defined as any target lesion revascularisation (TLR). Absolute serial angiographic studies without any concomitant TLR within 2\u2005years after the procedure were performed in 55 patients (65 lesions) at postprocedure, mid-term (within 1\u2005year), late term (between 1 and 2\u2005years) and very late term (beyond 2\u2005years). Results The median follow-up duration was 9.4\u2005years (IQR 8.2\u201310.2\u2005years). The 8-year cumulative incidence of any TLR was 20.3%. The increase rate was approximately 7% per year in the first 2\u2005years, but decelerated to approximately 1.2% per year beyond 2\u2005years after the procedure. The minimal lumen diameter significantly decreased from postprocedure (2.63\u00b10.44\u2005mm) to mid-term (2.43\u00b10.59\u2005mm, p=0.002) and from late term (2.27\u00b10.63\u2005mm) to very late term (1.98\u00b10.73\u2005mm, p=0.002). The 8-year cumulative incidences of definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) and major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) \u22653) were 0.5% and 12.0%, respectively. Definite ST was none within 10\u2005years in the entire cohort. Conclusions The long-term clinical outcomes after BP-BES implantation were favourable, although angiographic late progression of luminal narrowing did not reach a plateau.
