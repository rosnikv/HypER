        "title": "Providing Diabetes Education and Care to Underserved Patients in a Collaborative Practice at a Utah Community Health Center",
        "abstract": "Many underserved patients in Utah lack insurance coverage for health care and prescription drugs but are provided medical care in community health centers (CHCs). Before June 2000, comprehensive pharmacy services were not provided to these patients at a Utah CHC. As part of a Health Resources and Services Administration grant, a collaborative agreement between the University of Utah College of Pharmacy and Utah CHCs was established so that a faculty clinician who is a certified diabetes educator (CDE) could provide diabetes education and care to underserved patients. The College of Pharmacy faculty clinician (pharmacist CDE) collaborated with physicians and midlevel practitioners to provide diabetes education and care for 176 patients. In addition to initial diabetes education, the pharmacist CDE provided continuing disease management by providing information and feedback to patients and recommendations to providers. The pharmacist CDE conducted continuing chart reviews to track certain parameters, such as laboratory test results for hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and lipid levels, and blood pressure. Patients were followed for 1\u20133 years. The same outcome data were also collected for 176 patients with diabetes mellitus in another CHC clinic to provide a comparison group. Total cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, A1C, and triglyceride levels declined significantly from baseline at both sites. However, more patients who were provided care by the pharmacist CDE reached the American Diabetes Association A1C target goal of below 7%.",

        "title": "Diabetes Care in Community Health Centers: A Focus on Health Resources and Services Administration-Funded Clinical Pharmacy Demonstration Projects",
        "abstract": "Millions of Americans have limited access to health care and are ethnically diverse and medically underserved. Many of these patients are seen in community health centers (CHCs). These centers are federally supported clinics that provide primary care services for > 11 million underserved patients.1 CHCs were established in 1965 under the Public Health Services Act, through a federal grant program. CHCs serve patients who are uninsured, underinsured, or have a very low income. Many of these patients are at great risk for safety because of cultural or language barriers.\n\nStarting in 2000, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services awarded clinical pharmacy demonstration grants to 18 CHC networks. The purpose of these grants was to demonstrate that access to medications and comprehensive pharmacy services results in an improvement in the health status of patients by either starting pharmacies to provide affordable medications through 340B Drug Pricing Programs2 or expanding medication assistance programs (MAPs) by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Another goal was to determine the impact of pharmacists on diabetes and its comorbidities in these settings. In many cases, CHC patients were provided access to pharmacist care for the first time. These networks were composed of HRSA-funded health centers, a college of pharmacy, and sometimes other organizations.\n\nMathematica Policy Research, provided the overall evaluation of these grants and prepared a report to the HRSA.3 Mathematica highlighted five of the clinical pharmacy demonstration projects (CPDPs) in their report. Each CHC project was unique, but all provided certain components of disease management, expanded patient access to medications, medication formulary activities, and training of pharmacy students or residents. The highlighted projects had at least three characteristics in common: positive diabetes disease management clinical data, a large number of patients given pharmacist-provided care, and good retention \u2026",
