        "abstract": "Moderate arterial hypertension of the elderly has to be treated but the efficacy has to be progressive. Cicletanine has a pharmacokinetic profile well fitted to the therapy of this age group. The mechanism of action is characterized by synthesis of prostacyclin. A double blind prospective randomized study was conducted at two institutions on 132 patients aged more than 60, with diastolic arterial pressure over 95 mmHg and systolic over 160 mmHg. 62.9% of them were aged more than 75. The analysis of those two studies shows that the three groups with cicletanine (respectively 50, 100 and 150 mg per day) had a significant decrease of both pressures versus placebo. In the 50 mg group, 40% of arterial pressures were normalized after 3 months of treatment. There were no difference between 50 and 100 mg. There were no adverse drug reaction like falling down, day or night, or orthostatic hypotension. The biological tolerance, more particularly renal, was excellent with this dose of 50 mg a day. Cicletanine at the dose of 50 mg/day is a recommended treatment in arterial hypertension of the elderly.",
