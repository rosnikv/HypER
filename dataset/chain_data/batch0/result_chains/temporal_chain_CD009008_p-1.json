This trial investigated the contribution of the liraglutide component of IDegLira versus IDeg alone on efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a 26-week, double-blind trial, patients with type 2 diabetes (A1C 7.5\u201310.0% [58\u201386 mmol/mol]) on basal insulin (20\u201340 units) and metformin with or without sulfonylurea/glinides were randomized (1:1) to once-daily IDegLira + metformin or IDeg + metformin with titration aiming for fasting plasma glucose between 4 and 5 mmol/L. Maximum allowed doses were 50 dose steps (equal to 50 units IDeg plus 1.8 mg liraglutide) and 50 units for IDeg. The primary end point was change in A1C from baseline. RESULTS A total of 413 patients were randomized (mean A1C 8.8% [73 mmol/mol]; BMI 33.7 kg/m2). IDeg dose, alone or as part of IDegLira, was equivalent (45 units). A1C decreased by 1.9% (21 mmol/mol) with IDegLira and by 0.9% (10 mmol/mol) with IDeg (estimated treatment difference \u22121.1% [95% CI \u22121.3, \u22120.8], \u221212 mmol/mol [95% CI \u221214, \u22129; P < 0.0001). Mean weight reduction with IDegLira was 2.7 kg vs. no weight change with IDeg, P < 0.0001. Hypoglycemia incidence was comparable (24% for IDegLira vs. 25% for IDeg). Overall adverse events were similar, and incidence of nausea was low in both groups (IDegLira 6.5% vs. IDeg 3.5%). CONCLUSIONS IDegLira achieved glycemic control superior to that of IDeg at equivalent insulin doses without higher risk of hypoglycemia and with the benefit of weight loss. These findings establish the efficacy and safety of IDegLira and the distinct contribution of the liraglutide component.",

We assessed the efficacy and safety of initiating insulin degludec/liraglutide fixed-ratio combination (IDegLira) versus basal-bolus insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A phase 3b trial examined patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on insulin glargine (IGlar U100) 20\u201350 units/day and metformin, randomized to IDegLira or IGlar U100 and insulin aspart \u22644 times per day. RESULTS Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased from 8.2% (66 mmol/mol) to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) with IDegLira and from 8.2% (67 mmol/mol) to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) with basal-bolus (estimated treatment difference [ETD] \u22120.02% [95% CI \u22120.16, 0.12]; \u22120.2 mmol/mol [95% CI \u22121.7, 1.3]), confirming IDegLira noninferiority versus basal-bolus (P < 0.0001). The number of severe or blood glucose\u2013confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia events was lower with IDegLira versus basal-bolus (risk ratio 0.39 [95% CI 0.29, 0.51]; rate ratio 0.11 [95% CI 0.08, 0.17]). Body weight decreased with IDegLira and increased with basal-bolus (ETD \u22123.6 kg [95% CI \u22124.2, \u22122.9]). Fasting plasma glucose reductions were similar; lunch, dinner, and bedtime self-monitored plasma glucose measurements were significantly lower with basal-bolus. Sixty-six percent of patients on IDegLira vs. 67.0% on basal-bolus achieved HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Total daily insulin dose was lower with IDegLira (40 units) than basal-bolus (84 units total; 52 units basal).

        "title": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors for people with cardiovascular disease: a network meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. Recently, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were approved for treating people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although metformin remains the first-line pharmacotherapy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body of evidence has recently emerged indicating that DPP4i, GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may exert positive effects on patients with known CVD.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo systematically review the available evidence on the benefits and harms of DPP4i, GLP-1RA, and SGLT2i in people with established CVD, using network meta-analysis.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on 16 July 2020. We also searched clinical trials registers on 22 August 2020. We did not restrict by language or publication status.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating DPP4i, GLP-1RA, or SGLT2i that included participants with established CVD. Outcome measures of interest were CVD mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), and safety outcomes.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nThree review authors independently screened the results of searches to identify eligible studies and extracted study data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted standard pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses by pooling studies that we assessed to be of substantial homogeneity; subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also pursued to explore how study characteristics and potential effect modifiers could affect the robustness of our review findings. We analysed study data using the odds ratios (ORs) and log odds ratios (LORs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and credible intervals (Crls), where appropriate. We also performed narrative synthesis for included studies that were of substantial heterogeneity and that did not report quantitative data in a usable format, in order to discuss their individual findings and relevance to our review scope.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 31 studies (287 records), of which we pooled data from 20 studies (129,465 participants) for our meta-analysis. The majority of the included studies were at low risk of bias, using Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. Among the 20 pooled studies, six investigated DPP4i, seven studied GLP-1RA, and the remaining seven trials evaluated SGLT2i. All outcome data described below were reported at the longest follow-up duration. 1. DPP4i versus placebo Our review suggests that DPP4i do not reduce any risk of efficacy outcomes: CVD mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; high-certainty evidence), myocardial infarction (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08; high-certainty evidence), stroke (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence), and all-cause mortality (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11; high-certainty evidence). DPP4i probably do not reduce hospitalisation for HF (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.23; moderate-certainty evidence). DPP4i may not increase the likelihood of worsening renal function (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; low-certainty evidence) and probably do not increase the risk of bone fracture (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence) or hypoglycaemia (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence). They are likely to increase the risk of pancreatitis (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.37; moderate-certainty evidence). 2. GLP-1RA versus placebo Our findings indicate that GLP-1RA reduce the risk of CV mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; high-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95; high-certainty evidence), and stroke (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; high-certainty evidence). GLP-1RA probably do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; moderate-certainty evidence), and hospitalisation for HF (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence). GLP-1RA may reduce the risk of worsening renal function (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84; low-certainty evidence), but may have no impact on pancreatitis (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.35; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of GLP-1RA on hypoglycaemia and bone fractures. 3. SGLT2i versus placebo This review shows that SGLT2i probably reduce the risk of CV mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-certainty evidence), and reduce the risk of HF hospitalisation (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.71; high-certainty evidence); they do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.12; high-certainty evidence) and probably do not reduce the risk of stroke (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.36; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of treatment safety, SGLT2i probably reduce the incidence of worsening renal function (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.82; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably have no effect on hypoglycaemia (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence) or bone fracture (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence), and may have no impact on pancreatitis (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.86; low-certainty evidence). 4. Network meta-analysis Because we failed to identify direct comparisons between each class of the agents, findings from our network meta-analysis provided limited novel insights. Almost all findings from our network meta-analysis agree with those from the standard meta-analysis. GLP-1RA may not reduce the risk of stroke compared with placebo (OR 0.87, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.0; moderate-certainty evidence), which showed similar odds estimates and wider 95% Crl compared with standard pairwise meta-analysis. Indirect estimates also supported comparison across all three classes. SGLT2i was ranked the best for CVD and all-cause mortality.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nFindings from both standard and network meta-analyses of moderate- to high-certainty evidence suggest that GLP-1RA and SGLT2i are likely to reduce the risk of CVD mortality and all-cause mortality in people with established CVD; high-certainty evidence demonstrates that treatment with SGLT2i reduce the risk of hospitalisation for HF, while moderate-certainty evidence likely supports the use of GLP-1RA to reduce fatal and non-fatal stroke. Future studies conducted in the non-diabetic CVD population will reveal the mechanisms behind how these agents improve clinical outcomes irrespective of their glucose-lowering effects.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for osteoporosis. The effects of T2DM and anti-diabetic agents on bone and mineral metabolism have been observed. Sodium\u2013glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) promote urinary glucose excretion, reduce blood glucose level, and improve the cardiovascular and diabetic nephropathy outcomes. In this review, we focused on the extraglycemic effect and physiological regulation of SGLT-2is on bone and mineral metabolism. SGLT-2is affect the bone turnover, microarchitecture, and bone strength indirectly. Clinical evidence of a meta-analysis showed that SGLT-2is might not increase the risk of bone fracture. The effect of SGLT-2is on bone fracture is controversial, and further investigation from a real-world study is needed. Based on its significant benefit on cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease (CKD) outcomes, SGLT-2is are an outstanding choice. Bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk evaluation should be considered for patients with a high risk of bone fracture.",

        "title": "Improved Glycaemic Control and Nephroprotective Effects of Empagliflozin and Paricalcitol Co-Therapy in Mice with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
        "abstract": "Herein, we measured the antidiabetic and nephroprotective effects of the sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin; SGLT2i) and synthetic active vitamin D (paricalcitol; Pcal) mono- and co-therapy against diabetic nephropathy (DN). Fifty mice were assigned into negative (NC) and positive (PC) control, SGLT2i, Pcal, and SGLT2i+Pcal groups. Following establishment of DN, SGLT2i (5.1 mg/kg/day) and/or Pcal (0.5 \u00b5g/kg/day) were used in the designated groups (5 times/week/day). DN was affirmed in the PC group by hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, polyuria, proteinuria, elevated urine protein/creatinine ratio, and abnormal renal biochemical parameters. Renal SREBP-1 lipogenic molecule, adipokines (leptin/resistin), pro-oxidant (MDA/H2O2), pro-inflammatory (IL1\u03b2/IL6/TNF-\u03b1), tissue damage (iNOS/TGF-\u03b21/NGAL/KIM-1), and apoptosis (TUNEL/Caspase-3) markers also increased in the PC group. In contrast, renal lipolytic (PPAR\u03b1/PPAR\u03b3), adiponectin, antioxidant (GSH/GPx1/SOD1/CAT), and anti-inflammatory (IL10) molecules decreased in the PC group. Both monotherapies increased insulin levels and mitigated hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, renal and urine biochemical profiles alongside renal lipid regulatory molecules, inflammation, and oxidative stress. While SGLT2i monotherapy showed superior effects to Pcal, their combination demonstrated enhanced remedial actions related to metabolic control alongside renal oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In conclusion, SGLT2i was better than Pcal monotherapy against DN, and their combination revealed better nephroprotection, plausibly by enhanced glycaemic control with boosted renal antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Although single treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) or vitamin D3 (VD3) inhibited metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) development in diabetic patients, their combination has\u00a0not been explored previously. Hence, this study investigated the hepatoprotective effects of SGLT2i (empagliflozin) and/or VD3 against MASH in type 2 diabetic mice. Forty Mice were assigned into negative (NC) and positive (PC) controls, SGLT2i, VD3, and SGLT2i\u2009+\u2009VD3 groups. All animals, except the NC group, received high-fructose/high-fat diet (8\u2009weeks) followed by diabetes induction. Diabetic mice then received another cycle of high-fructose/high-fat diet (4\u2009weeks) followed by 8\u2009weeks of treatment (five times/week) with SGLT2i (5.1\u2009mg/kg/day) and/or VD3 (410\u2009IU/Kg/day). The PC group demonstrated hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, elevated liver enzymes, and increased non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with fibrosis. Hepatic glucose transporting molecule (SGLT2) with lipogenesis (SREBP-1/PPAR\u03b3), oxidative stress (MDA/H2O2), inflammation (IL1\u03b2/IL6/TNF-\u03b1), fibrosis (TGF-\u03b21/\u03b1-SMA), and apoptosis (TUNEL/Caspase-3) markers alongside the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway increased in the PC group. Conversely, hepatic insulin-dependent glucose transporter (GLUT4), lipolytic (PPAR\u03b1/INSIG1), antioxidant (GSH/GPx1/SOD1/CAT), and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) molecules with the inhibitor of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (PTEN) decreased in the PC group. Whilst SGLT2i monotherapy outperformed VD3, their combination showed the best attenuation of hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, and fibrosis with the strongest modulation of hepatic glucose-transporting and lipid-regulatory molecules, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. This study is the first to reveal boosted hepatoprotection for SGLT2i and VD3 co-therapy against diabetes-induced MASH, possibly via enhanced metabolic control and modulation of hepatic PI3K/AKT/mTOR, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-fibrotic pathways.",
