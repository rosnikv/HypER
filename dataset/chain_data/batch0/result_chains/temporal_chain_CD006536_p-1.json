        "abstract": "Objective: Previous evaluation of intracoronary autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSCs) therapy following ischemic heart disease (IHD) suggested improvement of cardiac functional parameters. We performed a meta-analysis to provide systematic assessment of the safety and efficacy of direct (intramyocardial or endomyocardial) BMSCs transplantation in patients with IHD. Research design and methods: Randomized controlled Trials (RCTs) were identified in the MEDLINE (\u223c Oct. 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central) (\u223c Oct. 2010), EMBASE (\u223c Oct. 2010), and EBSCO (\u223c Oct. 2010), reviews, and reference lists of relevant articles. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated for changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV and LVESV) by using a fixed effects model. Results: Eight RCTs with 307 participants were eligible. Compared with controls, direct BMSCs transplantation improved LVEF (8.4%, 95% CI, 6.49 to 10.31%; p < 0.01), reduced LVESV and LVEDV (\u201314.85 ml, 95%CI, \u201327.29 to \u20132.41 ml, p = 0.02 and \u201312.79 ml, 95% CI, \u201324.94 to \u20130.65 ml, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that direct BMSCs transplantation is associated with moderate but significant improvements over regular therapy in cardiac functional parameters in patients with IHD, and supports conducting further RCTs of a higher quality.",

        "title": "Challenges for heart disease stem cell therapy",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. The use of stem cells to improve recovery of the injured heart after myocardial infarction (MI) is an important emerging therapeutic strategy. However, recent reviews of clinical trials of stem cell therapy for MI and ischemic heart disease recovery report that less than half of the trials found only small improvements in cardiac function. In clinical trials, bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood cells were used as the source of stem cells delivered by intracoronary infusion. Some trials administered only a stem cell mobilizing agent that recruits endogenous sources of stem cells. Important challenges to improve the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for CVD include: (1) improved identification, recruitment, and expansion of autologous stem cells; (2) identification of mobilizing and homing agents that increase recruitment; and (3) development of strategies to improve stem cell survival and engraftment of both endogenous and exogenous sources of stem cells. This review is an overview of stem cell therapy for CVD and discusses the challenges these three areas present for maximum optimization of the efficacy of stem cell therapy for heart disease, and new strategies in progress.",

        "title": "Recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide therapy combined with bone mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for treating heart failure in rats.",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) therapy and bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation on cell survival in myocardial tissues and on heart function in a rat model of heart failure (HF). Rat BMSCs were isolated, amplified and adherent cultured in vitro. A rat model of HF was established via the intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (Adriamycin). The rats were randomly divided into normal, HF, BMSC, rhBNP and BMSC plus rhBNP groups. The BMSCs were administered once via tail vein injection and rhBNP was infused via the jugular vein. Echocardiography and polygraphy were used to evaluate heart function. An enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration prior to and following intervention. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of the myocardium\u2011specific proteins GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA-4), connexin 43 (Cx43) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The results of cardiac echocardiography and the hemodynamic data show that various indicators of left ventricular systolic function in the BMSC plus rhBNP group were significantly improved compared with those in the other groups (P<0.05). No significant differences in the improvement of cardiac function were observed between the BMSC and rhBNP groups (P>0.05). Following treatment, a significant difference in BNP levels was observed between the BMSC plus rhBNP and the BMSC groups (P<0.05). The GATA-4, Cx43 and cTnI expression levels in the BMSC plus rhBNP group were higher than those in the BMSC group. Compared with rhBNP treatment, BMSC transplantation alone does not significantly improve heart function. However, combining rhBNP therapy and BMSC transplantation increases the expression levels of GATA-4 and other proteins to improve cardiac systolic and diastolic function.",
