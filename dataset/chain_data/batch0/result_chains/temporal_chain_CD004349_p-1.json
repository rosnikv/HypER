        "abstract": "Albuminuria reduction could be renoprotective in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, the current use of renin-angiotensin-system intervention is targeted to BP only. Therefore, this study investigated the adequacy of this approach in 1428 patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy from the placebo-controlled Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. Investigated were the extent of discordance in treatment effects on systolic BP (SBP) and albuminuria and its association with renal outcome in a multivariate Cox model. Among patients with a reduced SBP during treatment, a lack of albuminuria reduction was observed in 37, 26, and 51% (total, losartan, and placebo, respectively) at month 6. SBP or albuminuria reduction was associated with a lower risk for ESRD, whereas combined SBP and albuminuria reduction was associated with the lowest risk for events. Across all categories of SBP change, a progressively lower ESRD hazard ratio was observed with a larger albuminuria reduction. A lower residual level of albuminuria was also associated with lower ESRD risk. In conclusion, changes in albuminuria are not concordant in a substantial proportion of patients when titrated for BP. Meanwhile, the ESRD risk showed a clear dependence on albuminuria reduction. The ESRD risk also showed dependence on the residual level of albuminuria, even in patients who reached the current SBP target. Antihypertensive treatment that is aimed at improving renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy may therefore require a dual strategy, targeting both SBP and albuminuria reduction.",

        "title": "Combination therapy with AT1 blocker and vitamin D analog markedly ameliorates diabetic nephropathy: Blockade of compensatory renin increase",
        "abstract": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, and blockade of the RAS is currently used for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. One major problem for the current RAS inhibitors is the compensatory renin increase, which reduces the efficacy of RAS inhibition. We have shown that vitamin D exerts renoprotective actions by transcriptionally suppressing renin. Here we demonstrated that combination therapy with an AT1 receptor blocker and a vitamin D analog markedly ameliorated renal injury in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model due to the blockade of the compensatory renin rise by the vitamin D analog, leading to more effective RAS inhibition. STZ-treated diabetic DBA/2J mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis within 13 weeks, accompanied by increased intrarenal production of angiotensin (Ang) II, fibronection, TGF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and decreased expression of slit diaphragm proteins. Treatment of the diabetic mice with losartan or paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2, an activated vitamin D analog) alone moderately ameliorated kidney injury; however, combined treatment with losartan and paricalcitol completely prevented albuminuria, restored glomerular filtration barrier structure, and markedly reduced glomerulosclerosis. The combined treatment suppressed the induction of fibronection, TGF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and reversed the decline of slit diaphragm proteins nephrin, Neph-1, ZO-1, and \u03b1-actinin-4. These were accompanied by blockade of intrarenal renin and Ang II accumulation induced by hyperglycemia and losartan. These data demonstrate that inhibition of the RAS with combination of vitamin D analogs and RAS inhibitors effectively prevents renal injury in diabetic nephropathy.",

        "title": "Vitamin D receptor attenuates renal fibrosis by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.",
        "abstract": "Analogs of vitamin D attenuate renal injury in several models of kidney disease, but the mechanism underlying this renoprotective effect is unknown. To address the role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in renal fibrogenesis, we subjected VDR-null mice to unilateral ureteral obstruction for 7 days. Compared with wild-type mice, VDR-null mice developed more severe renal damage in the obstructed kidney, with marked tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Significant induction of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen I), profibrogenic and proinflammatory factors (TGF-beta, connective tissue growth factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accompanied this histologic damage. Because VDR ablation activates the renin-angiotensin system and leads to accumulation of angiotensin II (AngII) in the kidney, we assessed whether elevated AngII in the VDR-null kidney promotes injury. Treatment with the angiotensin type 1 antagonist losartan eliminated the difference in obstruction-induced interstitial fibrosis between wild-type and VDR-null mice, suggesting that AngII contributes to the enhanced renal fibrosis observed in obstructed VDR-null kidneys. Taken together, these results suggest that the VDR attenuates obstructive renal injury at least in part by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.",

        "abstract": "There is increasingly evidence that the interactions between vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and klotho form an endocrine axis for calcium and phosphate metabolism, and derangement of this axis contributes to the progression of renal disease. Several recent studies also demonstrate negative regulation of the renin gene by vitamin D. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), low levels of calcitriol, due to the loss of 1-alpha hydroxylase, increase renal renin production. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), in turn, reduces renal expression of klotho, a crucial factor for proper FGF-23 signaling. The resulting high FGF-23 levels suppress 1-alpha hydroxylase, further lowering calcitriol. This feedback loop results in vitamin D deficiency, RAAS activation, high FGF-23 levels, and renal klotho deficiency, all of which associate with progression of renal damage. Here we examine current evidence for an interaction between the RAAS and the vitamin D-FGF-23-klotho axis as well as its possible implications for progression of CKD.",

        "title": "A Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Identifying FGF23 Regulated Genes in the Kidney of a Mouse CKD Model",
        "abstract": "Elevations of circulating Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of renal failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Efforts to identify gene products whose transcription is directly regulated by FGF23 stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)/\u03b1-Klotho complexes in the kidney is confounded by both systemic alterations in calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism and intrinsic alterations caused by the underlying renal pathology in CKD. To identify FGF23 responsive genes in the kidney that might explain the association between FGF23 and adverse outcomes in CKD, we performed comparative genome wide analysis of gene expression profiles in the kidney of the Collagen 4 alpha 3 null mice (Col4a3\u2212/\u2212) model of progressive kidney disease with kidney expression profiles of Hypophosphatemic (Hyp) and FGF23 transgenic mouse models of elevated FGF23. The different complement of potentially confounding factors in these models allowed us to identify genes that are directly targeted by FGF23. This analysis found that \u03b1-Klotho, an anti-aging hormone and FGF23 co-receptor, was decreased by FGF23. We also identified additional FGF23-responsive transcripts and activation of networks associated with renal damage and chronic inflammation, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) signaling pathways. Finally, we found that FGF23 suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the kidney, thereby providing a pathway for FGF23 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. These gene products provide a possible mechanistic links between elevated FGF23 and pathways responsible for renal failure progression and cardiovascular diseases.",

        "title": "Ramipril Lowers Plasma FGF-23 in Patients with Diabetic Nephropathy",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Ramipril attenuates renal Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) expression, ameliorates proteinuria and normalizes serum phosphate in the diabetic Zucker rat with progressive renal disease suggesting that the renoprotective effect by this drug may be in part due to a FGF-23-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Methods: In this nonrandomized study, we tested whether ACE-inhibition reduces circulating FGF-23 in type-2 diabetics with stage-1 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and proteinuria. Intact FGF-23, the eGFR, proteinuria and the endothelium-dependent flow-mediated (FMD) response to ischemia and other parameters were measured at baseline and after 12-weeks of treatment with ramipril (n = 68) or amlodipine (n = 32). Results: Blood Pressure (BP) fell to a similar extent (p < 0.001) in the two groups. However, 24 h proteinuria and the FMD improved more (both p < 0.01) in ramipril-treated patients than in amlodipine-treated patients. Changes in proteinuria (r = 0.47) and in FMD (r = -0.49) by ramipril were closely associated (p < 0.001) with simultaneous changes in FGF-23 and this link was confirmed in multiple regression analyses. In these analyses, the relationship between FMD and proteinuria changes attained statistical significance (p < 0.01) only in a model excluding FGF-23 suggesting that endothelial dysfunction and FGF-23 share a common pathway conducive to renal damage. Conclusion: Findings in this study contribute to generate the hypothesis that FGF-23 may be implicated in proteinuria and in endothelial dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy (clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01738945)).",

        "abstract": "The work in this thesis addresses the interaction between the phosphate-regulating hormone Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) as key player in bone-mineral homeostasis and renal volume handling, mainly in the context of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). First, we elaborate on the role of vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its potential to increase effectiveness of RAAS-blockade. Next, we review the role of (excessive) sodium intake and why patients with CKD are particularly susceptible to the effects of sodium. Consecutively, we found that high FGF-23 levels are associated with an impaired antiproteinuric response to RAAS-blockade combined with a low sodium diet in patients with CKD. High FGF-23 concentrations are strongly associated with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality in CKD and hemodialysis patients. We add to this that also in renal transplant recipients high FGF-23 concentrations are correlated with adverse cardiovascular events, independent of existing, established risk factors. Moreover, FGF-23 levels correlated with markers of high volume status as NT-proBNP and copeptin. FGF-23 levels are extremely high in end stage renal disease. We found that part of the variance in these levels can be explained by ultrafiltration volume: patients who need more fluid withdrawal in dialysis, have far higher FGF-23 levels. The aforementioned chapters strongly suggest a link between volume status and FGF-23. We tested whether volume interventions, i.e. infusion of 2L saline or a 6-week sodium restriction, could in turn affect FGF-23 levels, this seems not to be the case. Although sodium interventions do not change FGF-23 concentrations, interventions aimed at phosphate intake do. Therefore, we examined the relation between these two minerals. Sodium intake and phosphate intake, as assessed by 24h-excretion, are strongly and robustly correlated across different populations: in renal transplant recipients, but also in diabetes patients and healthy volunteers. We interpret these findings in line with the observation that food products rich in sodium are also rich in phosphate. For example, processed-foods are notorious for their high sodium content, but they also contain a lot of phosphate-based additives which is far less commonly known. Expanding on healthy components of a healthy diet, we next investigate potassium. Healthy food choices as fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium. Following the observation that potassium supplementation appears to increase serum phosphate level, we hypothesized that potassium may lower FGF-23 levels. We confirmed this in the KaNa trial, where participants received potassium supplements or placebo combined with a fully-controlled diet. Several of our findings advocate changes in dietary intake, however this is difficult to achieve. In the multicenter, randomized controlled trial SUBLIME we deployed an approach that combined E-health technology based on self-regulation (behavioral change) theory, group meetings and individual coaching and we discuss the first results and feedback from participants in this thesis. In conclusion, this thesis places FGF-23 firmly as a bridge between sodium-volume and bone-mineral (phosphate) homeostasis.",
