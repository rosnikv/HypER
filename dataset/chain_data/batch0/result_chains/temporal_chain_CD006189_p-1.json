        "title": "Frozen shoulder syndrome: comparison of oral route corticosteroid and intra-articular corticosteroid injection.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-six patients with frozen shoulder syndrome (Stage 2 and 3) were included in this study conducted at Dr. Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang, Indonesia and randomly allocated into 2 groups: 40 mg triamcinolone intra-articular injection and triamcinolone oral tablets. The result showed that triamcinolone intra-articular injection group \"cured\" rate was 5.8 times higher at week one compared to the triamcinolone tablet group. Sixty-two percent of the cases with triamcinolone intra-articular injection achieved their \"cured\" condition after one week of therapy, compared with only 14% of the triamcinolone tablets group. We conclude that, intra-articular corticosteroid injection provide faster improvement compared to oral route.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the effectiveness of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg) and methylprednisolone acetate (60 mg) in Iraqi patients with primary and secondary frozen shoulder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total number of 135 (93 males and 42 females) patients with frozen shoulder, allocated at outpatient clinic of rheumatology in Al-Yarmook Teaching Hospital (Baghdad-Iraq) from January 2004 to December 2005, were enrolled in non-controlled clinical trial. The diagnosis of frozen shoulder was made using the guidelines for shoulder complaint issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. Intraarticular injections of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (46 males and 22 females) or 60 mg methylprednisolone acetate (47 males and 20 females) were given every 3 weeks (not more than 3 injections) by using posterior route.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth triamcinolone acetonide (81.8%) and methylprednisolone acetate (83.3%) were equally effective in primary frozen shoulder. Triamcinolone acetonide is significantly improved diabetic frozen shoulder in comparison to methylprednisolone acetate (69% versus 39%). Also patients on triamcinolone acetonide required less number of steroid injections and higher percent of severe cases were significantly improved by triamcinolone acetonide in comparison with methylprednisolone acetate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that triamcinolone acetonide is a good rescue for painful stiff shoulder particularly for resistant cases as with diabetes mellitus, and with long duration of illness. Also, its efficacy can be observed with less frequent injections.",

        "abstract": "There is little evidence about the comparative efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of painful shoulder. The main aim was to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MTP) versus triamcinolone (TMC) in the treatment of painful shoulder using an ultrasound-guided injection. Patients with painful shoulder due to subacromial bursitis and partial or full-thickness rotator cuff tears demonstrated by musculoskeletal ultrasound received a guided-injection of MTP acetate 40\u00a0mg (12 patients) or TMC acetonide 40\u00a0mg (12 patients). Range of motion and pain visual analogue scale were registered at 10 and 30 min, 1 and 2\u00a0weeks postinjection. Two weeks postinjection, both groups reported a mean improvement in range of motion (33%) and relief of pain (61%). Relief of pain of 50% or more was observed in 92% of patients in MTP group and 50% of TMC group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Two months postinjection, 50% of the patients in MTP group and 25% in TMC group reported total relief of pain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.3). Patients with painful shoulder receiving an ultrasound-guided injection of MTP or TMC have a rapid and sustained overall response. Relief of pain tends to be more rapid with MTP than TMC.",

        "title": "Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injections Versus Pulsed Radiofrequency in Painful Shoulder: A Prospective, Randomized, Single-blinded Study",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveChronic shoulder pain treatment is known to be a difficult and long process. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injection and pulse radiofrequency (PRF) applied to the suprascapular nerve in patients with shoulder pain. MethodsFifty patients with shoulder pain were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated into group 1 (intra-articular injection of corticosteroid) and group 2 (PRF to the suprascapular nerve). Outcome measures included a pain scale (visual analog scale; VAS), range of motion, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), the Short Form-36, Beck Depression Scale questionnaires, and paracetamol consumption. ResultsIn both groups, significant improvement was observed in all weeks in VAS, range of motion (active-passive), and SPADI subscores (P<0.05). Improvement was detected in most of the Short Form-36 scores at the end of the treatment in both groups (P<0.05), whereas no significant change was observed in Beck Depression Inventory score (P>0.05). When the groups were compared, a significant difference was found between the groups in favor of group 1 in terms of VAS at night in weeks 1, 4, and 12; VAS at rest in weeks 1 and 4; and VAS during movement in week 1 (P<0.05). There was also a significant difference in favor of group 1 observed in weeks 1, 4, and 12 in SPADI pain and total subscores (P<0.05). Paracetamol consumption was observed to be lower in group 1 (P<0.05). ConclusionsIntra-articular injection of corticosteroid and PRF applied to the suprascapular nerve are effective in the treatment of painful shoulder. When 2 treatments are compared, it may be concluded that intra-articular steroid injection was more effective especially in the first weeks regarding pain than the PRF. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in the prospective treatment guidelines.",

        "title": "Percutaneous radiofrequency lesioning of the suprascapular nerve for the management of chronic shoulder pain: a case series",
        "abstract": "Purpose The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the analgesic effects of continuous radiofrequency lesioning of the suprascapular nerve (SSN) for chronic shoulder pain. The authors sought to obtain insight into the time-sensitive analgesic success and complications of this therapy. Patients and methods This study was a retrospective case series involving patients with unremitting shoulder pain that had lasted for at least 12 months. Patients were selected if they showed a reduction of at least 50% in pain intensity during the anesthetic phase after SSN block, no additional motor weakness of the shoulder, and pain relief lasting for less than 2 months after separate treatments of the SSN with depot corticosteroids and pulsed radiofrequency. Nine patients were referred to the Arnold Pain Management Center. Of these nine patients, six patients who had significant chronic shoulder pain unresponsive to oral medications and intra-articular injections and who were not considered surgical candidates were selected. These patients were treated with a single radiofrequency lesion of the SSN at 80\u00b0C for 60 seconds. The primary outcome was a reduction in pain intensity by 50%, as determined by the numeric rating scale, and duration of this effect. The secondary outcome was improvement in either the passive or the active range of motion (ROM). Patients were also monitored for adverse effects such as weakness or increased pain. Results The pooled mean numeric rating scale score before the procedure was 7.2 \u00b1 1.2; this fell to 3.0 \u00b1 0.9 at 5\u20137 weeks post procedure. The duration of pain relief ranged from 3 to 18 months, and all patients underwent at least one additional treatment. The change in baseline ROM improved from an average of 60\u00b0 \u00b1 28\u00b0 (flexion) and 58\u00b0 \u00b1 28\u00b0 (abduction) to 99\u00b0 \u00b1 46\u00b0 (flexion) and 107\u00b0 \u00b1 39\u00b0 (abduction). No adverse side effects were observed. Conclusion Continuous radiofrequency lesioning of the SSN seems to be an effective treatment for chronic shoulder pain. There can be improved ROM of the shoulder following this treatment. More formal, controlled studies are required to confirm these observations.",

        "title": "Pulsed radiofrequency for the suprascapular nerve for patients with chronic headache.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Chronic shoulder or suprascapular pain is a disabling phenomenon. Chronic headache is also a disabling phenomenon for many patients. Once it was believed that chronic headache that is attributed to the cervical spine originates from the upper cervical nerve roots (C0-C3). Currently, it is suggested by some authors that the reason for headache in many patients is attributed to the lower cervical nerve roots in the cervical spine. The suprascapular nerve originates from the C5 and C6 nerve roots and supplies the suprascapular and shoulder region. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) has gained popularity over recent years as a good clinical tool in treating patients with shoulder/suprascapular pain. It is usually considered as a treatment option after conservative treatment has failed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether PRF for the suprascapular nerve has also beneficial effect for patients that have also chronic headache that is attributed to the lower cervical nerve roots. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-nine patients with a follow-up of 1 year who had chronic shoulder/suprascapular pain and chronic headache were examined after they underwent PRF procedures to the suprascapular nerve (either unilateral or bilateral). RESULTS Forty patients (58%) reported long-term pain relief (1-y follow-up) for the shoulder/suprascapular pain and 31 patients (45%) reported long-term pain relief for the headache. This pain relief was defined as reduction of Visual Analogue Score by at least 30%. No complications were found in this study except for mild discomfort in the treated area which spontaneously resolved up to 3 weeks after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS PRF for the suprascapular nerve is a safe and an effective procedure for patients who suffer from shoulder/suprascapular pain and also for headache that is attributed to the lower cervical nerve roots. It should be tried after conservative treatment has failed.",
