        "abstract": "Quantifying the analgesic effect of placebo electrotherapy is an important part of understanding the placebo response in physiotherapy. This repeated measures study of induced ischaemic pain compared reports of pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain endurance under three conditions: control, placebo interferential, and placebo TENS. Both of the placebo conditions significantly delayed the report of pain threshold. Placebo interferential also delayed pain tolerance. Each placebo condition reduced pain intensity in the 6th minute. Only placebo TENS reduced pain at the 9th minute of ischaemic pain. The nature of pain reduction in the placebo conditions suggests that analgesia was due to learned expectancies and endogenous opioid release. Further research into the impact of positive expectancies of pain relief in our patients could clarify the efficacy of physiotherapy outcomes for pain.",

        "title": "Pain and placebo analgesia: two sides of the same coin",
        "abstract": "Abstract Health professionals have traditionally taken a negative view of the placebo phenomenon. This paper highlights current theories, biological and psychological mechanisms that explain why placebo analgesia should now be considered as an asset, rather than a hindrance, to pain management and patient care. First, an historical perspective outlines medical scepticism towards placebo and the improved understanding of central and descending mechanisms of pain control that have changed that view. Next, the key psychological mechanisms of conditioning, expectancy and desire for pain relief are discussed, in conjunction with the cortical mechanisms of action which account for placebo analgesia. Nocebo hyperalgesia (the antithesis of placebo analgesia) is summarised. The discussion uses the evidence to propose three main considerations for clinical application: (i) biomedical explanations about pain are potentially detrimental to patients in pain; (ii) consumatory beliefs, actions and behaviours mediate both self-efficacy and placebo analgesia and should be optimised during rehabilitation; and (iii) therapist's communication can reduce or heighten their patient's pain.",
