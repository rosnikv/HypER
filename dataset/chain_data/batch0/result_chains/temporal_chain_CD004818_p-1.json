        "abstract": "Effect of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) on mortality and rate of development of reinfarctions during 24 month follow-up was studied in 129 otherwise conventionally treated patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These patients were randomly divided into control (n=65) and intervention (n=64) groups. In the latter group treatment was supplemented with course of HBO. This course consisted of 6 HBO sessions in a single-place chamber (isopression for 40 min at working pressure 0.03 MPa o.d.) starting from day 4 - 6 of the disease. The use of HBO in combination with traditional course of drug treatment significantly reduced rate of reinfarctions (control group - 19%, intervention group - 5.3%, p < 0.05) and increased survival (control group 86.2%, intervention group 94.7%) during 2 years after hospital discharge. Maximal effect on survival was seen during first 0.5 years (91.4 and 100% in control and intervention groups, respectively, p=0.05).",
