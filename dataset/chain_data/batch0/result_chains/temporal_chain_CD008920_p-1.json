        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) in the treatment of depression in 191 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study. A placebo washout period of 3-7 days was followed by an 8 week active treatment phase during which patients received either paroxetine (20-40 mg daily) or amitriptyline (75-150 mg daily). The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at endpoint.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParoxetine was as effective as amitriptyline for the treatment of depression, with similar improvements in RA associated pain and disability also seen in both groups. However, paroxetine was better tolerated than amitriptyline, with an overall frequency of adverse experiences of 56.4% and 67.7% in the 2 groups, respectively. The frequency of anticholinergic adverse experiences was much lower in the paroxetine treatment group (18.1% vs 43.8% taking amitriptyline) and paroxetine treated patients also experienced fewer severe (16.0% vs 21.9%), serious nonfatal (0% vs 4.2%), and drug related adverse experiences (12.8% vs 29.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTolerability is an important consideration in this patient population, which is largely composed of elderly patients who are taking additional medications for RA. Paroxetine shows a number of advantages in the management of depression comorbid with RA.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE Our objective was to examine the relative association of depression severity and chronicity, other comorbid psychiatric conditions, and coexisting medical illnesses with multiple domains of health status among primary care patients with clinical depression. METHODS We collected cross-sectional data as part of a treatment effectiveness trial that was conducted in 8 diverse health care organizations. Patients aged 60 years and older (N = 1,801) who met diagnostic criteria for major depression or dysthymia participated in a baseline survey. A survey instrument included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, depression severity and chronicity, neuroticism, and the presence of 11 common chronic medical illnesses, as well as questions screening for panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Measures of 4 general health indicators (physical and mental component scales of the SF-12, Sheehan Disability Index, and global quality of life) were included. We conducted separate mixed-effect regression linear models predicting each of the 4 general health indicators. RESULTS Depression severity was significantly associated with all 4 indicators of general health after controlling for sociodemographic differences, other psychological dysfunction, and the presence of 11 chronic medical conditions. Although study participants had an average of 3.8 chronic medical illnesses, depression severity made larger independent contributions to 3 of the 4 general health indicators (mental functional status, disability, and quality of life) than the medical comorbidities.

        "abstract": "Objective. To examine the relative and combined impact of depressive and chronic physical conditions on functional status and health-care use in the general population. Method. Canadian, representative, population-based cross-sectional survey (n=130880). Major depressive disorder (MDD) in the past 12 months was assessed by structured interview, and physical disorders, activity reduction, role impairment and work absence by self-report. The relative impact of MDD and six common chronic physical illnesses (asthma, arthritis, back problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes) was estimated using multivariate regression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and overall chronic physical illness burden. Results. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol dependence and chronic physical illness burden, the presence of co-morbid MDD was associated with significantly greater (approximately double the) likelihood of health-care utilization and increased functional disability and work absence compared to the presence of a chronic physical illness without co-morbid MDD. This impact of MDD was seen across each of the six chronic physical illnesses examined in this study, with the strongest associations seen for work absence. Conclusions. These observations confirm prior findings of a strong association at the population level between major depression and health-care use and role impairment among persons with chronic physical disorders. They also point to the significant impact of co-morbid major depression on health-care seeking, disability and work absence in persons with chronic physical illness, underscoring the need for greater efforts to design and test the impact of detection and treatment programs for such individuals.",

Whether MI is associated with an increased risk of suicide is unknown. We examined the association between MI and suicide. Methods and Results\u2014 We conducted a population-based case-control study by retrieving data from 5 nationwide longitudinal registers in Denmark. As cases, we selected all persons aged 40 to 89 years who died by suicide from 1981 to 2006. As controls, we randomly selected up to 10 persons per case matched by sex, day of birth, and calendar time. We identified 19 857 persons who committed suicide and 190 058 controls. MI was associated with a marked increased risk of suicide. The risk of suicide was highest during the first month after discharge for MI for patients with no history of psychiatric illness (adjusted rate ratio, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 6.56) and for patients with a history of psychiatric illness (adjusted rate ratio, 64.05; 95% confidence interval, 13.36 to 307.06) compared with those with no history of MI or psychiatric illness.

The cardiovascular safety profile of antidepressant medications, in terms of subclinical atherosclerosis, is underexamined. Methods A total of 6814 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis were examined. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years with 4 race/ethnic groups represented: European Americans (38%), Hispanic Americans (23%), African Americans (28%), and Chinese Americans (11%). Antidepressants were subgrouped as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and \u201cother\u201d (bupropion, nefazodone, trazodone, mirtazapine). After adjusting for potential confounders, we estimated the association between antidepressant use and the following measures of subclinical atherosclerosis: coronary artery calcium (CAC), the ankle-brachial index, and carotid intima-media thickness, both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Results A total of 324 participants were exposed to SSRIs, 88 to TCAs, 41 to SNRIs, and 123 to other antidepressants.

        "abstract": "Depression is a very common and ancient mental disorder prevalent all over the world since centuries affecting all age groups of both male and female genders. It is the 4th most serious public health problem worldwide with about 350 million people being affected and expected to be the most common mental disorder by year 2020 [1]. Depression has a wide range of symptoms that include low mood, negative thoughts, pessimism, guilt, and ugliness, indecisiveness, lack of interest and motivation, decreased sexual desire, appetite and sleep [2]. Depressive patients end their lives through suicide as a Complication of the disease. Suicide rates vary from country to country with Hungary on top where the rate is 58/100, 000 followed by, USA 20/100000 and Spain9/100000 every year. Prevalence of depression has long been studied in different populations that were found as ranging from 5% in general population and 10%-20% in chronic sick patients [3]. It is 3%8.7% prevalent in children and 25% in pregnant women [4]. Students show a prevalence of 53.43% in Pakistan while 26.2% in Turkey [5]. Depression is also a risk factor for atherosclerosis in addition to smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and dyslipidemia [6]. The ideal treatment plan for depression consists of pharmacotherapy, psychological and educational interventions [7]. There are many pharmacological treatment options for depression like Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), Selective serotonin norepinephrine inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antidepressants [8]. SSRIs are most popular as they are safe, more tolerable, cheaper and due to their spectrum of indication other than depression [9]. It is also used to treat the premature ejaculation [10]. Escitalopram is derived from Citalopram with a bioavailability of 80% and halflife of 27-32 hours makes it once daily dosage of 10-20mg/day [9]. It is recommended to check total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides in patients which are at risk of atherosclerosis",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, studies have shown the prevalence of depression among people with diabetes. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the possible beneficial effects of escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on metabolic changes and cardiac complications in type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by feeding the rats high fat-high fructose diet (HFFD) for 8 weeks followed by a subdiabetogenic dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg, i. p.). Treatment with escitalopram (10 mg/kg/day; p. o.) was then initiated for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, electrocardiography was performed and blood samples were collected for determination of glycemic and lipid profiles. Animals were then euthanized and heart samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological examinations. Escitalopram alleviated the HFFD/STZ-induced metabolic and cardiac derangements as evident by improvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory, fibrogenic and apoptotic markers in addition to hypertrophy and impaired conduction. These results could be secondary to its beneficial effects on the glycemic control and hence the reduction of receptor for advanced glycation end products content as revealed in the present study. In conclusion, escitalopram could be considered a favorable antidepressant medication in diabetic patients as it seems to positively impact the glycemic control in diabetes in addition to prevention of its associated cardiovascular complications.",

In this study, T2DM mice were treated with different concentrations of TFs by gavage for 10 weeks to investigate the effect of TFs on diabetic nephropathy and their potential molecular mechanism of action. Biochemical and pathological analysis showed that the TFs effectively improved blood glucose, insulin resistance, kidney function, and other symptoms in diabetic mice. The mechanism studies indicated that TFs inhibited the formation of AGEs, thereby inhibiting the activation of the MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Therefore, our study suggested that TFs improved diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the formation of AGEs.",

However, its effect on diabetic liver and kidney injury and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

The data also showed that TFDG mitigates oxidative harm in the liver and kidney of rats afflicted with diabetes. Additionally, metformin combined with TFDG was significantly more effective in reducing blood glucose and oxidative stress. Further studies suggested that TFDG upregulates the Nrf2 signal pathway and circ-ITCH (hsa_circ_0001141) expression.
