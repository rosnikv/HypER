        "title": "The aspirin-ibuprofen interaction in rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "1 This was a double-blind crossover trial of ibuprofen and soluble aspirin against each drug alone and against placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Two dosage regimes were tested. 2 A weak clinical additive effect was demonstrated between soluble aspirin and ibuprofen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using moderate (1600 mg ibuprofen and 3.6 g aspirin daily) but not low (800 mg ibuprofen and 2.4 g aspirin daily) dosages of both drugs. 3 A significant correlation between clinical efficacy and serum ibuprofen but not salicylate level was found in the single drug periods of the trial. 4 No consistent effect of ibuprofen administration on serum salicylate levels was found. 5 Concurrent salicylate administration produced significant lowering of serum ibuprofen levels without affecting elimination half-lives of the drug.",

        "title": "Additive clinical effect of indomethacin suppositories during salicylate therapy in rheumatoid patients.",
        "abstract": "Twelve rheumatic patients were given 2.0 and 4.5 g acetylsalicylic acid daily in two 3-week periods. On days 13 and 20 of each period the patients took a suppository containing either placebo or 50 mg of indomethacin. The study was performed double-blind. Indomethacin had a significant additive effect during ASA therapy with 2 g daily as estimated by articular index and subjective ratings of pain and morning stiffness. On the 4.5 g ASA dose there was a significant improvement only for articular index. The patients experienced less pain during maintenance therapy with 4.5 g of ASA compared with 2.0 g daily. Both ASA doses induced complete inhibition of prostaglandin PGF2 alpha release from platelets. Thus the suppression of PGF2 alpha release does not reflect the therapeutic response of these drugs. Side effects observed comprised tinnitus, dizziness and gastritis. In 2 of the patients the aminotransferase levels increased, indicating hepatotoxicity. The protein binding of salicylate decreased with increasing salicylate concentration. As the dose was increased from 2.0 to 4.5 g/day the unbound concentration increased 5 to 24 times. This reflects the combined effect of capacity-limited metabolism and capacity-limited protein binding of salicylate.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the additive effect of another NSAID (indomethacin) during salicylate therapy, building upon the source paper's results regarding the interaction between aspirin and ibuprofen."
