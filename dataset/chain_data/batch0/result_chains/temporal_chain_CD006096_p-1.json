        "abstract": "Background:\u2002 Collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon with a benign and sometimes relapsing course. Frequency among patients with chronic diarrhea and normal looking colonoscopy is around 10\u201315%. To date, treatment of CC and LC is not well defined. Data about these conditions are mostly derived from retrospective studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response to treatment and the clinical course of CC and LC in a large group of patients prospectively diagnosed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCollagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active collagenous colitis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nRelevant papers published between 1970 and January 2002 were identified via the MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nFour randomized trials were identified. One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), and 3 trials (2 published in abstract form only) studied budesonide in the therapy of collagenous colitis.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThere were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active drug were more likely to have clinical (p=0.003) and histological (p=0.003) improvement than those assigned to placebo. A total of 86 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 16.79 (95% CI 7.28-38.74), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is effective in the treatment of collagenous colitis. The evidence for bismuth subsalicylate is weaker, but still important. The roles of these and other therapies in inducing or maintaining remission (as opposed to clinical or histological improvement) of collagenous colitis are unknown.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nBudesonide is effective in treating collagenous colitis, but no treatment is established for lymphocytic colitis. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of budesonide in patients with lymphocytic colitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty-two patients (median age, 61 years) with lymphocytic colitis and chronic diarrhea were randomly assigned to groups that were given oral doses of budesonide (9 mg/d) or placebo for 6 weeks. Nonresponders at week 6 were given open-label budesonide (9 mg/d) for 6 additional weeks. A complete colonoscopy and histologic and quality-of-life analyses were performed at baseline and at week 6. The primary end point was clinical remission at 6 weeks, with last observation carried forward (LOCF). All patients who left the study in clinical remission were followed for relapse.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 6, 86% of patients given budesonide were in clinical remission (with LOCF) compared with 48% of patients given placebo (P = .010). Furthermore, open-label budesonide therapy induced clinical remission in 7 of 8 patients given placebo. Histologic remission was observed in 73% of patients given budesonide compared with 31% given placebo (P = .030). Only 1 patient discontinued budesonide therapy prematurely. During a mean follow-up period of 14 months, 15 patients (44.1%) experienced a clinical relapse (after a mean of 2 months); 8 of the relapsing patients were retreated with and responded again to budesonide.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide effectively induces clinical remission in patients with lymphocytic colitis and significantly improves histology results after 6 weeks. Clinical relapses occur but can be treated again with budesonide.",

        "abstract": "Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, the two types of microscopic colitis, cause watery diarrhea. Budesonide, a glucocorticoid medication with limited systemic availability, is commonly used to treat these illnesses. Budesonide has proven efficacy in the induction of clinical remission in both collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. Budesonide is effective as a maintenance drug for patients with collagenous colitis, but has not been studied for this indication in patients with lymphocytic colitis. This drug improves quality of life in patients while causing few mild adverse events. Budesonide is an effective treatment of microscopic colitis that is safe and well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "Chronic diarrhea can have a substantial impact on the patient\u2019s quality of life and overall health. Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory bowel disease, which is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea. Many drugs, including steroids, had emerged to treat MC. Our aim was testing the efficacy of Budesonide enema in improvement of patients with collagenous microscopic colitis both clinically and histo-pathologiclly. 22 patients with active microscopic colitis were enrolled in the present study, 15 women, and 7 men, with mean age of 60.9\u00b18.5 years. Mean duration of symptoms was 2.6\u00b10.8 years. Patients were given Budesonide enema 2mg/100ml twice daily for 2 weeks then, once daily for 4 weeks. They were evaluated both clinically and histopathologically after 6 weeks.18 patients (81.8%) showed high statistically significant decrease in the thickness of collage layer, and degree of inflammation. The patients\u2019 frequency of stool decreased from 7.6\u00b11.0 to 2.7\u00b11.6 motions/day (p<0.001), and also consistency of stool improved (p<0.001).We concluded that Budesonide enema in a dose of 2 mg/100ml was well tolerated and effective in induction of remission in active collagenous colitis. Effects on both clinical symptoms and inflammatory infiltrate were seen. Recurrence rate after stopping treatment is moderate. Non-responders may need prolonged duration of treatment or omitting the drugs that may be responsible for colonic inflammation.",
