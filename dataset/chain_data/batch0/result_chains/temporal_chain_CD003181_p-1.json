        "title": "Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) treatment on chronic viral hepatitis in heart transplant patients: results of a prospective, double-blind, placebo-randomized study",
        "abstract": "Background. Chronic viral hepatitis averages 15% to 20% in heart transplant patients. Several studies have shown that ursodiol may improve liver biochemistry in patients with chronic hepatitis. We used a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of ursodiol in heart transplant patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Methods. Thirty heart patients with chronic viral hepatitis B, C, or non-A-G received ursodiol, 800 mg per day (group 1), and 30 received placebo (group 2) for 12 months. Endpoints were improvement in liver biochemical tests and in total Knodell score. Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Results. At entry, both groups were comparable for all of the studied parameters. During the study period, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and &ggr;-glutamyl transpeptidase variations were not different between group 1 and group 2 patients. Knodell score improved in 20% of group 1 patients and in 43% of group 2 patients (NS). Adverse events or mortality were not different in the two groups during the study period. Similar results were observed by intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Conclusions. A 12-month course of ursodiol therapy had no effect on liver enzymes or liver histology in heart transplant patients with chronic hepatitis.",

        "title": "Impact of Hepatitis C Infection on Outcomes After Heart Transplantation",
        "abstract": "Background. Prevalence of hepatitis C infection (HCV) among heart transplant (OHT) recipients ranges from 7% to 18%. Despite the paucity of data regarding the outcomes of heart transplant recipients who are HCV positive before transplant, many transplant centers are declining to perform OHT in HCV-seropositive patients. Methods. We assessed the clinical outcome of HCV-seropositive compared with HCV-seronegative heart transplant recipients using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network/the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005, 224 HCV-seropositive and 10,406 HCV-seronegative recipients who received HCV-seronegative donor organs were identified. Results. Overall patient survival rates of HCV-seropositive recipients were significantly lower than those of HCV-seronegative recipients (84.8% at 1 year, 77.1% 3 years, 68.9% 5 years for HCV-seropositive group vs. 87.9% at 1 year, 80.7% 3 years, and 74.1% 5 years for HCV-negative recipients, log rank P=0.036). However, adjusted relative risk of recipient HCV-seropositive versus HCV-seronegative status did not reach to statistical significance level (relative risk=1.23 with P=0.087) after adjusting for other donor and recipient factors. Causes of death among HCV-seropositive and HCV-seronegative groups were similar. Cumulative incidence of an acute rejection episode in the first year after transplantation among HCV-seropositive recipients was 35.7% versus 32.6% HCV-seronegative recipients (P=0.32). Conclusions. A more rational approach should be developed for the management of HCV-seropositive heart transplant candidates. Carefully selected HCV-seropositive patients should not be excluded from OHT.",

        "title": "Outcomes After Lung Transplantation and Practices of Lung Transplant Programs in the United States Regarding Hepatitis C Seropositive Recipients",
        "abstract": "Background. The estimated prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among lung transplant (LT) recipients is 1.9%. Many thoracic transplant programs are reluctant to transplant HCV-seropositive patients due to concerns of hepatic dysfunction caused by immunosuppression. The aims of this study are to survey current practices of US LT programs regarding HCV-seropositive patients and using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database and to assess the clinical outcomes of HCV-positive compared with HCV-negative LT recipients. Methods. A survey of US transplant centers that have performed more than 100 LTs was conducted. In addition, 170 HCV-seropositive and 9259 HCV-seronegative recipients who received HCV-seronegative donor organs between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, were identified from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database. Outcome variables including patient survival were compared between the two groups. Results. A total of 64.4% centers responded to the survey. Ten of 29 (34.5%) programs would not consider HCV-seropositive patients for LT. Among the 19 programs that will consider HCV-seropositive patients, only five centers would transplant actively viremic patients. Overall patient survival rates of HCV-seropositive patients were similar to HCV-seronegative patients (84.7% at 1 year, 63.9% at 3 years, 49.4% at 5 years for HCV-seropositive group vs. 82.0% at 1 year, 65.0% at 3 years, 51.4% at 5 years for HCV-seronegative group, P=0.712). Relative risk of recipients for death remained statistically insignificant after adjusting for recipient age, donor age, obesity, sensitization, serum creatinine, and medical condition at time of transplant (relative risk [RR]=1.07 [0.84\u20131.38], P=0.581). Conclusions. Since 2000, patient survival rates of HCV-positive patients are identical to those who are HCV-negative. However, most of these HCV-seropositive patients were probably nonviremic.",

        "abstract": "Use of organs from donors testing positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may safely expand the donor pool. The American Society of Transplantation convened a multidisciplinary expert panel that reviewed the existing literature and developed consensus recommendations for recipient management following the use of organs from HBV positive donors. Transmission risk is highest with liver donors and significantly lower with non\u2010liver (kidney and thoracic) donors. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of transmission to liver recipients from isolated HBV core antibody positive (anti\u2010HBc+) donors. Organs from anti\u2010HBc+ donors should be considered for all adult transplant candidates after an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits and appropriate patient consent. Indefinite antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in liver recipients with no immunity or vaccine immunity but not in liver recipients with natural immunity. Antiviral prophylaxis may be considered for up to 1 year in susceptible non\u2010liver recipients but is not recommended in immune non\u2010liver recipients. Although no longer the treatment of choice in patients with chronic HBV, lamivudine remains the most cost\u2010effective choice for prophylaxis in this setting. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is not recommended.",

        "abstract": "The use of hepatitis B core antibody\u2013positive (HBcAb+) grafts for liver transplantation (LT) has the potential to safely expand the donor pool, as long as proper prophylaxis against de novo hepatitis B (DNHB) is employed. The aim of this study was to characterize the longterm outcome of pediatric LT recipients of HBcAb+\u2009liver grafts under a prophylaxis regimen against DNHB using hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). From June 1996 to February 2013, 49 patients receiving pediatric LT at our center were from HBcAb+\u2009donors. Forty\u2010one patients who received DNHB prophylaxis according to our protocol were included in this analysis. Our DNHB prophylaxis protocol consists of HBV vaccine intramuscular injections given intermittently to maintain anti\u2013hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titers above 100 IU/L. HBIG was also used during the first posttransplant year with a target anti\u2010HBsAb titer level above 200 IU/L. There were 19 boys and 22 girls. Median age was 1.0 year (range, 4 months to 16 years). Median follow\u2010up time was 66 months after transplant. Median annual number of HBV vaccine injections was 0.8 per year (range, 0\u20101.8 per year). Four patients did not require any HBV vaccine injections during follow\u2010up. One patient with DNHB was encountered during the follow\u2010up period (1/41, 2.4%). DNHB was diagnosed at 3.5 years after transplant, when hepatitis B surface antigen was positive upon routine follow\u2010up serologic testing. Anti\u2010HBsAb titer was 101.5 IU/L at the time. No grafts were lost because of DNHB\u2010related events. Overall survival of the 41 recipients of HBcAb+\u2009grafts who received DNHB prophylaxis was 92.3% at 10 years after transplant. In conclusion, longterm prophylaxis against DNHB with HBV vaccine in pediatric LT recipients of HBcAb+\u2009grafts was safe and effective in terms of DNHB incidence as well as graft and patient survival.

        "abstract": "Introduction Prophylactic administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) is the standard treatment for controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). Since lifelong use of HBIG is expensive and inconvenient and the antibodies level in anti-hepatitis B surface (HBs) is not sustainable and stable, an alternative strategy is to produce anti-HBs antibodies by active immunization. Our present study aimed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of procedural HBV vaccination in transplanted patients. Methods Recipients who had undergone LT for hepatitis B related liver diseases more than one year before, with no evidence of HBV recurrence or rejection and normal liver function were enrolled. All subjects received the hepatitis B vaccine (40 \u03bcg) by intramuscular injection at months 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12 after enrollment with continuous administration of NAs. The liver function and anti-HBs titers were measured before each vaccination and HBIG (400U) was administrated intramuscularly when anti-HBs titer was lower than 30 IU/L during the course. The results of routine blood tests, liver function, concentration of immunosuppressant, and HBV-DNA copies were monitored during the research. After completion of the vaccination procedure, recipients were regarded as responders if their anti-HBs greater than 30 IU/L were maintained for up to six months without using HBIG and vaccine. Results Twenty-seven patients were enrolled in this study and the average anti-HBs titer before vaccination was 19.86\u00b114.80 IU/L. The average anti-HBs titer of the nine responders at the end of the follow-up was 57.14\u00b122.75 IU/L, giving an overall response rate of 33.3% (9/27). There were no reports of reactivation of HBV, rejection, severe anaphylaxis or other adverse events. Responders and non-responders showed their significant difference in anti-HBs titers after the fourth vaccination (P<0.01). Moreover, the majority of non-responders (11/18, 63.64%) had high LY/EO rates (lymphocyte number/eosinophil number>15) while most responders (8/9, 88.89%) had low LY/EO rates at the beginning of vaccination (P = 0.019). Conclusions Active immunization is an effective, cost-saving, and safe method for the prevention of HBV reactivation in patients transplanted for hepatitis B virus related liver diseases. The LY/EO rate may be a valuable indicator in selecting potential recipients for vaccination.",

        "abstract": "The advance in treatment against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with the development of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) with high genetic barrier to resistance, including entecavir and tenofovir, has improved clinical outcomes of patients transplanted for HBV infection, by preventing HBV recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) effectively. Currently, after LT, the combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and a high\u2010barrier NA is considered as the standard of care for prophylaxis against HBV recurrence. However, because of the high cost of intravenous high\u2010dose HBIG, other routes of HBIG administration, such as intramuscular or subcutaneous, have come to the foreground. In addition, several transplant centres tend to use a NA as monoprophylaxis, following a short post\u2010LT period of HBIG and NA combination. Lately, studies using HBIG\u2010free prophylactic regimens with entecavir or tenofovir have shown promising outcomes in preventing HBV recurrence, mostly regarding patients with undetectable HBV DNA at the time of LT. Although vaccination against HBV has been an attractive prophylactic approach, its efficacy has been controversial. Moreover, further studies are needed regarding long\u2010term outcomes of complete withdrawal anti\u2010HBV prophylaxis. For patients transplanted for HBV/HDV co\u2010infection, combined regimen should be administered for a longer period post\u2010LT. Finally, the use of grafts from hepatitis B core antibody\u2010positive donors is safe for HBV\u2010negative recipients, with the administration of lifelong antiviral prophylaxis.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aim Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection is important for long-term outcomes following liver transplantation (LT). Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is used among recipients who have (i) native HBV disease, (ii) hepatitis B core antibody positivity (HBcAb positivity), or (iii) received HBcAb positive organs. Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) monotherapy is emerging for treating patients in this setting. There is no generalized consensus on the ideal dosage of HBIG. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose HBIG (1560 international unit [IU]) for post-LT HBV prevention. Materials and Methods HBcAb positive patients who received either HBcAb positive or hepatitis B core antibody negative (HBcAb negative) organs and HBcAb negative patients who received HBcAb positive organs between January 2016 and December 2020 were reviewed. Pre-LT HBV serologies were collected. HBV-prophylaxis strategy included NA with/without HBIG. HBV recurrence was defined as HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) positivity during the 1-year, post-LT follow-up. No HBV surface antibody titers were followed. Results A total of 103 patients with a median age of 60 years participated in the study. Hepatitis C virus was the most common etiology. Thirty-seven HBcAb negative recipients and 11 HBcAb positive recipients with undetectable HBV DNA received HBcAb positive organs and underwent prophylaxis with 4 doses of low-dose HBIG and NA. None of the recipients in our cohort had a recurrence of HBV at 1 year. Conclusion Low-dose HBIG (1560 IU) \u00d7 4 days and NA, for HBcAb positive recipients and HBcAb positive donors, appear to be effective in preventing HBV reinfection during the post-LT period. Further trials are needed to confirm this observation.",
