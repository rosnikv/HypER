        "title": "Comparison of the Effectiveness of Lifestyle Modification with Other Treatments on the Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in People at High Risk: A Network Meta-Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background: Many clinical trials have been conducted to verify the effects of interventions for prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) using different treatments and outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications (LM) with other treatments in persons at high risk of T2D by a network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods: Searches were performed of PUBMED up to January 2018 to identify randomized controlled trials. The odds ratio (OR) with onset of T2D at 1 year in the intervention group (LM, dietary, exercise, or medication) versus a control group (standard treatments or placebo) were the effect sizes. Frequentist and Bayesian NMAs were conducted. Results: Forty-seven interventions and 12 treatments (20,113 participants) were used for the analyses. The OR in the LM was approximately 0.46 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.61) times lower compared to the standard intervention by the Bayesian approach. The effects of LM compared to other treatments by indirect comparisons were not significant. Conclusions: This meta-analysis further strengthened the evidence that LM reduces the onset of T2D compared to standard and placebo interventions and appears to be at least as effective as nine other treatments in preventing T2D.",

        "title": "Preventive Role of Diet Interventions and Dietary Factors in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Umbrella Review",
        "abstract": "Background: Although the body of evidence indicates clear benefits of dietary modifications for prevention of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it may be difficult for healthcare providers to recommend which diet interventions or dietary factors are appropriate for patients as there are too many modalities available. Accordingly, we performed an umbrella review to synthesize evidence on diet interventions and dietary factors in prevention of T2DM. Methods: Medline and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized-controlled trial or observational studies were eligible if they measured effects of diet interventions and/or dietary factors including dietary patterns, food groups, and nutrients on risk of T2DM. The effect of each diet intervention/factor was summarized qualitatively. Results: Sixty systematic reviews and meta-analyses were eligible. Results of the review suggest that healthy dietary patterns such as Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets, and high consumption of whole grains, low-fat dairy products, yogurt, olive oil, chocolate, fiber, magnesium, and flavonoid significantly reduced the risk of T2DM. In contrast, high glycemic index and glycemic load diets, high consumption of red and processed meat, and sugar or artificial sugar-sweetened beverages significantly increased risk of T2DM. Prescribing diet interventions with or without physical activity interventions significantly decreased risk of T2DM in both high-risk and general population. Conclusion: High consumption of Mediterranean and DASH diet, and interventions that modified the quality of diet intake significantly reduced risk of T2DM especially in the high-risk population. These lifestyle modifications should be promoted in both individual and population levels to prevent and decrease burden from T2DM in the future.",

        "title": "Diet Quality Is Associated with Glucose Regulation in a Cohort of Young Adults",
        "abstract": "Young-onset type 2 diabetes and prediabetes is a growing epidemic. Poor diet is a known risk factor for T2D in older adults, but the contribution of diet to risk factors for T2D is not well-described in youth. Our objective was to examine the relationship of diet quality with prediabetes, glucose regulation, and adiposity in young adults. A cohort of young adults (n = 155, age 17\u201322) was examined between 2014\u20132018, and 89 underwent a follow-up visit from 2020\u20132022. At each visit, participants completed diet and body composition assessments and an oral glucose tolerance test. Adherence to four dietary patterns was assessed: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Mediterranean diet, and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII). Regression analyses were used to determine adjusted associations of diet with risk for prediabetes and adiposity. Each one-point increase in DASH or HEI scores between visits reduced the risk for prediabetes at follow-up by 64% (OR, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.17\u20130.68) and 9% (OR, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.85\u20130.96), respectively. The DASH diet was inversely associated with adiposity, while DII was positively associated with adiposity. In summary, positive changes in HEI and DASH scores were associated with reduced risk for prediabetes in young adults.",

        "abstract": "The assessment of \u201comics\u201d signatures may contribute to personalized medicine and precision nutrition. However, the existing literature is still limited in the homogeneity of participants\u2019 characteristics and in limited assessments of integrated omics layers. Our objective was to use post-prandial metabolomics and fasting proteomics to identify biological pathways and functions associated with diet quality in a population of primarily Hispanic young adults. We conducted protein and metabolite-wide association studies and functional pathway analyses to assess the relationships between a priori diet indices, Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets, and proteins (n = 346) and untargeted metabolites (n = 23,173), using data from the MetaAIR study (n = 154, 61% Hispanic). Analyses were performed for each diet quality index separately, adjusting for demographics and BMI. Five proteins (ACY1, ADH4, AGXT, GSTA1, F7) and six metabolites (undecylenic acid, betaine, hyodeoxycholic acid, stearidonic acid, iprovalicarb, pyracarbolid) were associated with both diets (p < 0.05), though none were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Overlapping proteins are involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism and in hemostasis, while overlapping metabolites include amino acid derivatives, bile acids, fatty acids, and pesticides. Enriched biological pathways were involved in macronutrient metabolism, immune function, and oxidative stress. These findings in young Hispanic adults contribute to efforts to develop precision nutrition and medicine for diverse populations.",
