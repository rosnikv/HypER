        "title": "Safety of interferon \u03b2 treatment for chronic HCV hepatitis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In fact, chronic hepatitis C is considered as one of the primary causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the most common reason for liver transplantation. The primary objectives for the treatment of HCV-related chronic hepatitis is to eradicate infection and prevent progression of the disease. The treatment has evolved from the use of alpha-interferon (IFNalpha) alone to the combination of IFNalpha plus ribavirin, with a significant improvement in the overall efficacy, and to the newer PEG-IFNs which have further increased the virological response, used either alone or in combination with ribavirin. Despite these positive results, in terms of efficacy, concerns are related to the safety and adverse events. Many patients must reduce the dose of PEG-IFN or ribavirin, others must stop the treatment and a variable percentage of subjects are not suitable owing to intolerance toward drugs. IFNbeta represents a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and in some countries it plays an important role in therapeutic protocols. Aim of the present paper was to review available data on the safety of IFNbeta treatment in HCV-related chronic hepatitis. The rates of treatment discontinuation and/or dose modification due to the appearance of severe side effects during IFNbeta are generally low and in several clinical studies no requirements for treatment discontinuation and/or dose modifications have been reported. The most frequent side effects experienced during IFNbeta treatment are flu-like syndromes, fever, fatigue and injection-site reactions. No differences in terms of side-effect frequency and severity between responders and non-responders have been reported. A more recent study, performed to compare IFNbeta alone or in combination with ribavirin, confirmed the good safety profile of both treatments. Similar trends of adverse event frequency have been observed in subpopulations such as patients with genotype-1b HCV hepatitis unresponsive to IFNalpha treatment or with HCV-related cirrhosis and patients with acute viral hepatitis. If further studies will confirm the efficacy of combined IFNbeta and ribavirin treatment, this regimen could represent a safe and alternative therapeutic option in selected patients.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of recombinant human IFN \u03b2-1a alone or in combination with ribavirin in treatment-naive subjects with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nMETHODS: Open, randomized trial was performed in 6 Italian tertiary centers: 102 of the 108 patients screened were randomized to receive 6 MIU of recombinant human IFN \u03b2-1a subcutaneously daily for 24 wk, alone (Group 1, n = 51) or in combination with ribavirin 1 000 to 1 200 mg/d (Group 2, n = 51). \n \nRESULTS: The end-of-treatment virologic response rate was 29.4% in Group 1 and 41.2% in Group 2 (non-significant). Twenty-four weeks after stopping therapy, sustained virologic response rate was 21.6% in Group 1 and 27.4% in Group 2 (non-significant). All subjects in Group 1 completed treatment, while two subjects in Group 2 stopped therapy due to treatment-related adverse events. \n \nCONCLUSION: Recombinant human IFN \u03b2-1a, alone or in combination with ribavirin, has an excellent safety profile and, may represent an alternative for chronic hepatitis C patients who are unable to tolerate pegylated \u03b1-interferon.",

        "abstract": "The standard of care for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pegylated interferon (IFN) alpha plus ribavirin, results in a sustained virologic response (SVR) in approximately 50%\u201060% of patients. IFN beta is a potential alternative to IFN alpha. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and durability of IFN beta and its combination with ribavirin in the na\u00efve setting of chronic hepatitis C in Asian patients. In the initial randomized, double\u2010blind phase, patients with chronic hepatitis C (n = 257) received 12 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a, 44 \u03bcg subcutaneously 3 times weekly, or a placebo. In the subsequent open\u2010label phase, placebo nonresponders received 24 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a plus ribavirin, whereas patients receiving IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy received an additional 12 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome variable was SVR, which was defined as negative HCV RNA after weeks 24 and 48. A total of 34 of 128 patients (26.6%) receiving IFN beta\u20101a achieved an SVR versus 0 of 129 patients (0%) receiving the placebo (P < 0.001). In the IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin group, 73 of 127 patients (57.5%) achieved an SVR [P < 0.001 versus IFN beta\u20101a; the adjusted odds ratio was 4.54 (95% confidence interval: 2.53, 8.13)]. In HCV genotype 1 patients, 37 of 80 patients (46.3%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin achieved an SVR versus 19 of 85 patients (22.4%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a (P = 0.001). Conclusion: IFN beta\u20101a produced a clear antiviral effect in Asian patients with chronic HCV infection. The addition of ribavirin to IFN beta\u20101a significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved an SVR versus IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy. (HEPATOLOGY 2007.)",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this pilot study was to determine the safety and efficacy of natural human interferon beta (nIFNbeta) plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C who did not respond to pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN), with special emphasis on the incidence of mental disorders or refusal for fear of adverse effects.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 19 patients with HCV genotype 1b, 2a or 2b and a high viral load, including 8 patients with mental disorders. They were treated with nIFNbeta-RBV. Eleven patients with HCV genotype 1b of these patients were treated with nIFNbeta-RBV for 48 weeks (group A), and compared with 22 matched controls treated with PEG-IFN plus RBV for 48 weeks (group B). The other 8 patients with HCV genotype 2 were treated with nIFNbeta-RBV for 24 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix of 8 patients with mental disorders and 9 of 11 patients without mental disorders completed nIFNbeta-RBV therapy; 1 patient with mental disorder dropped out due to exacerbation of depression, and 3 patients suspended the therapy due to insufficient response. The sustained virological response (SVR) was 27% (3/11) in group A and 41% (9/22) in group B (p = 0.70). During treatment, platelet count increased in group A but not in group B. SVR was 88% (7/8) in patients of genotype 2 and high viral load treated with nIFNbeta plus RBV.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nnIFNbeta-RBV therapy offers sufficient safety and efficacy for patients with mental disorders, and thus could represent an excellent second-line therapy for subpopulations that are not suitable for PEG-IFN-RBV.",
