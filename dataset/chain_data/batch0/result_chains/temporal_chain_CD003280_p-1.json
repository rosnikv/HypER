        "title": "Intramuscular interferon beta-1a in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy",
        "abstract": "Objective: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) shares immunologic features with multiple sclerosis (MS). Because IM interferon beta-1a (IM IFN\u03b2-1a) is an effective and safe treatment for MS, we conducted a dose-ranging efficacy study of IFN\u03b2-1a in patients with CIDP. Methods: Adults with IV immunoglobulin (IVIg)-dependent CIDP (n = 67) were enrolled in this 32-week double-blind trial and randomized to IM IFN\u03b2-1a. Patients received 30 \u03bcg once weekly plus placebo (n = 12), IM IFN\u03b2-1a 60 \u03bcg once weekly plus placebo (n = 11), IM IFN\u03b2-1a 30 \u03bcg twice weekly (n = 11), IM IFN\u03b2-1a 60 \u03bcg twice weekly (n = 11), or placebo twice weekly (n = 22). Participants were maintained on IVIg through week 16, when IVIg was discontinued. Patients who worsened were restarted on IVIg. The primary outcome was total IVIg dose (g/kg) administered from week 16 to 32. Results: There was no difference in total IVIg dose administered after week 16 for patients treated with IFN\u03b2-1a (1.20 g/kg) compared with placebo (1.34 g/kg; p = 0.75). However, exploratory analyses suggested IFN\u03b2-1a significantly reduced total dose of IVIg compared with placebo for participants who required either high-dose IVIg (>0.95 g/kg per month) or had greater weakness at baseline (Medical Research Council sum score <51). Adverse events included flu-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue in the IFN\u03b2-1a groups. Conclusions: Interferon beta-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a) therapy did not provide significant benefit over IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy alone for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. However, IFN\u03b2-1a might be beneficial for patients with more severe disability or those needing high doses of IVIg. Level of evidence: This study was designed to provide Class I evidence for the safety and efficacy of IM IFN\u03b2-1a in the treatment of CIDP but has been subsequently classified as Class II due to a >20% patient dropout rate. Thus, this randomized, controlled clinical trial provides Class II evidence of no effect on primary and secondary endpoints of 4 dosage regimens of IM IFN\u03b2-1a added to IVIg in persons with CIDP.",

        "title": "New Treatments for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy",
        "abstract": "chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (cidP) is the most common treatable chronic neuropathy in the western world. There are three treatment options currently available for cidP: intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange or corticosteroids. despite the efficacy of these therapies cidP patients are often left with permanent neurological deficits, have a poor clinical prognosis or in some cases do not respond to treatment. Furthermore, high cost and restricted availability make them unfeasible in some treatment centres, especially in the developing world. Recent advances in the understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in cidP have brought a number of novel agents into consideration for use in cidP. Many of these novel therapies have been used in similar autoimmune disorders and target immunopathogenic pathways common to cidP. here we review a number of these novel therapies and their applicability to cidP.",

        "explanation": "This paper reviews novel therapies for CIDP, including immunosuppressive agents, and discusses their applicability to CIDP. The source paper's findings on the use of immunosuppressive treatment in refractory CIDP cases could be seen as a sub-hypothesis for this paper's exploration of new treatments, making this paper partially dependent on the source paper's findings."
