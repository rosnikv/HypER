        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nMTX, either alone or in combination with SSZ, is effective in the treatment of RA. Trials have shown that, after SSZ failure, the addition of MTX to SSZ is more effective than a switch to MTX. Whether this is also the case in daily practice has not been analysed yet. In this study, we compared the efficacy of a switch to MTX monotherapy with that of the addition of MTX to SSZ in the daily clinical practice of RA patients who had failed SSZ monotherapy in the Nijmegen RA Inception Cohort.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFor this study, 230 patients who failed to SSZ monotherapy were followed for up to 52 weeks. A total of 124 underwent a switch to MTX alone, whereas 106 patients received the combination of MTX and SSZ. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in the disease activity score (DAS28) after 24 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth treatment groups showed a significant decrease in DAS28 after 24 weeks, which was similar in both groups. Drug survival analysis showed that the chance to stop with a DMARD within 52 weeks was higher in the MTX-SSZ group (P <0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn RA patients who failed to SSZ the clinical efficacy of a switch to MTX monotherapy was similar to that of the addition of MTX, suggesting that in daily clinical practice a switch to MTX is a good option for patients with an inadequate response to SSZ.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis patients after sulphasalazine failure, which is related to the source paper that compared sulphasalazine with placebo in rheumatoid factor-negative rheumatoid arthritis. The key hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the effectiveness of sulphasalazine in combination with methotrexate."
