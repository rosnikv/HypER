        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNocturnal gastric acid breakthrough (NAB) is defined as intragastric pH<4 for more than one continuous hour overnight. Adding H(2)-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) at bedtime to high-dose proton pump inhibitors is likely to enhance nocturnal gastric pH control and decrease nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness of additional bedtime H2-receptor antagonists in suppressing nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough and the incidence of adverse effects.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe identified eligible trials by searching The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2008), MEDLINE (1966-August 2008), EMBASE (1980-August 2008) and CINAHL (1982-August 2008). We re-ran the search on CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2008), and in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL in June 2004, July 2005, August 2006 and August 2008.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nAll randomized controlled trials evaluating H2-receptor antagonists for the control of nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough were eligible for inclusion.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo reviewers have independently selected the trials to be included in the review according to the pre-stated eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. If the data could not be pooled for meta-analysis, a narrative description was provided.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\n8 small randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The results show that additional bedtime H2RAs can decrease the prevalence rate of nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough. The results of the analyses for secondary outcomes show that additional bedtime H2RAs can decrease the percentage of time during which pH is less than 4.0 inside the stomach and promote median intragastric pH.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nWe can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effects of additional bedtime H2RAs in suppressing nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough.",

        "title": "Influence of pretreatment with H2 receptor antagonists on the cure rates of Helicobacter pylori eradication",
        "abstract": "Summary Background Pretreatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) reportedly decreases the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, however, the effect of pretreatment with an H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) on H. pylori eradication has not yet been studied. We compared the efficacy of eradication regimen (lansoprazole/amoxicillin/clarithromycin) in patients with H. pylori infection with or without H2RA pretreatment. Material/Methods In this retrospective study conducted at three centers, 310 patients with H. pylori infection were treated. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection was made using the rapid urease test, bacterial cultures and histological examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens. The patients were assigned to receive an eradication regimen first or following pretreatment with H2RA. Eradication was assessed using the 13C-urea breath test more than 4 weeks after the completion of therapy. Results Overall, H. pylori was eradicated in 79.7% of the cases: the eradication rate was 81.6% in the pretreatment group, and 77.6% in the eradication first group (p=0.3799, chi-square test). No significant difference in the eradication rate was observed between the two groups. Conclusions Pretreatment with H2RA had no significant influence on the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy.",

        "abstract": "Summary Background Until now there has been no study that directly compares the effect of lansoprazole and pantoprazole administered intravenously on intragastric acidity. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of lansoprazole (30 mg) and pantoprazole (40 mg) administered intravenously on gastric acidity. Material/Methods Helicobacter pylori-negative healthy volunteers were recruited in this open-label, randomized, two-way crossover, single centre study. Lansoprazole at 30 mg or pantoprazole at 40 mg was intravenously administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days with at least a 14-day washout interval. Twenty-four-hour intragastric pH was continuously monitored on days 1 and 5 of each dosing period. Results Twenty-five volunteers completed the 2 dosing periods. The mean intragastric pH values were higher in subjects treated with lansoprazole than those with pantoprazole on both day 1 (6.41\u00b10.14 vs. 5.49\u00b10.13, P=0.0003) and day 5 (7.09\u00b10.07 vs. 6.64\u00b10.07, P=0.0002). Significantly higher percentages of time with intragastric pH >4 and pH >6 were found in the subjects treated with lansoprazole than those with pantoprazole on day 1 (pH >4, 87.12\u00b14.55% vs. 62.28\u00b14.15%, P=0.0012; pH >6, 62.12\u00b14.12% vs. 47.25\u00b13.76%, P=0.0216) and pH >6 on day 5 (76.79\u00b13.77% vs. 58.20\u00b13.77%, P=0.0025). Conclusions Intravenous lansoprazole produces a longer and more potent inhibitory effect on intragastric acidity than does intravenous pantoprazole.",
