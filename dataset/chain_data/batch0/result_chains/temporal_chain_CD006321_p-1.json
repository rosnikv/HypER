        "title": "Growth Hormone, Glutamine, and an Optimal Diet Reduces Parenteral Nutrition in Patients With Short Bowel Syndrome: A Prospective, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Clinical Trial",
        "abstract": "Objective:To determine if growth hormone (GH) and glutamine (Gln) might allow for a reduction in parenteral nutrition (PN) in individuals with short bowel syndrome. Background Data:Following massive intestinal resection, patients frequently sustain severe nutrient malabsorption and are dependent on PN for life. GH treatment with or without Gln might allow for a reduction in PN. Methods:A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in 41 adults dependent on PN. Following screening, patients were admitted to an in-house facility for 6 weeks. After 2 weeks of stabilization and dietary optimization, patients were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms (1:2:2 ratio): oral Gln (30 g/day) + GH placebo (control group, n = 9), Gln placebo + GH (0.1 mg/kg per day, n = 16), or Gln + GH (n = 16). Standard criteria based on clinical and laboratory measurements were followed to determine PN volume and content. After 4 weeks of treatment, patients were discharged and monitored; GH and GH placebo were discontinued, but the diet with Gln or Gln placebo was continued for 3 months. Results:Patients receiving GH + Gln placebo + diet showed greater reductions in PN volume (5.9 \u00b1 3.8 L/wk, mean \u00b1 SD), PN calories (4338 \u00b1 1858 calories/wk), and PN infusions (3 \u00b1 2 infusions/wk) than corresponding reductions in the Gln + diet group (3.8 \u00b1 2.4 L/wk; 2633 \u00b1 1341 calories/wk; 2 \u00b1 1 infusions/wk, P < 0.05). Patients who received GH + Gln + diet showed the greatest reductions (7.7 \u00b1 3.2 L/wk; 5751 \u00b1 2082 calories/wk; 4 \u00b1 1 infusions/wk, P < 0.001 versus Gln + diet). At the 3-month follow-up, only patients who had received GH + Gln + diet maintained significant reductions in PN (P < 0.005) compared with the Gln + diet. Conclusions:Treatment with GH + diet or GH + Gln + diet initially permitted significantly more weaning from PN than Gln + diet. Only subjects receiving GH + Gln + diet maintained this effect for at least 3 months.",

        "title": "Economic implications of growth hormone use in patients with short bowel syndrome",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: Short bowel syndrome is a rare, lifethreatening condition that can result in nutritional malabsorption. Parenteral nutrition provides life-saving support but can lead to complications and affect quality of life. Recombinant human growth hormone, somatropin (rDNA origin), has been shown to significantly reduce dependence on nutritional support (p < 0.05). This study evaluates the economic impact of somatropin use in the management of short bowel syndrome. Methods: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed to estimate the benefits and costs associated with somatropin use. Risks of treatment complications and of disease-related events were modeled in identical patient pairs \u2013 one receiving parenteral nutrition alone, the other receiving 4 weeks of somatropin \u2013 for 2 years following initiation of treatment. Life expectancy was assumed equivalent. Risk functions were estimated from the literature and one randomized clinical trial. Total and component costs associated with each strategy were determined. The distribution of patients reducing parenteral nutrition need and the final parenteral nutrition frequency were also estimated. Sensitivity analyses were completed for key inputs. Direct medical costs are reported in USD$2004. Results: The model predicted that 96.0% of patients receiving somatropin reduce or eliminate parenteral nutrition within 6 weeks: average use was reduced by 2.8 days and one-third weaned completely. Based on 1.9\u2009L of parenteral nutrition per day, estimated costs were $118\u2009098 in year one and $132\u2009935 in year two. With somatropin, costs dropped to $84\u2009309 in year one \u2013 despite the $17\u2009459 cost of somatropin treatment \u2013 and $81\u2009250 in year two. Over 2 years savings totaled $85\u2009474. Limitations: Insufficient data required that assumptions be made for some inputs. DES is new in pharmacoeconomics and may be perceived as a limitation. Conclusions: Somatropin use improves quality of life by reducing the need for parenteral nutrition and results in health care cost savings.",

        "title": "Growth Hormone Therapy Improves Growth in Children with Cystic Fibrosis Related Liver Disease",
        "abstract": "Growth impairment in cystic fibrosis (CF) is worsened by liver disease. Children with CF have serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) that are lower than expected for their normal growth hormone (GH) production. In children with CF-related liver disease (CFLD), response to endogenous GH is further reduced. We present our experience with two young children with CFLD given recombinant human GH (rhGH). The first patient was a 5 year-old female with CFLD and poor growth who responded well for 1 1/2 years to rhGH therapy during her initial course and without a significant increase in serum IGF-I, but with a substantial increase in IGF-I concentration when the GH dose was increased. The second patient was a 5 month-old male with advanced liver disease who had transient improved growth and liver function following rhGH. These patients suggest that rhGH is safe and may be effective in children with CFLD.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the use of growth hormone therapy in children with cystic fibrosis-related liver disease, which is a different condition from short bowel syndrome. However, both papers deal with the use of growth hormone therapy, suggesting a potential connection. The hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the general concept of growth hormone therapy, but it is not directly dependent on the findings of the source paper."
