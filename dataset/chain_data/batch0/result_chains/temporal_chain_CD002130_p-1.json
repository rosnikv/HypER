        "title": "Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor to reduce postpercutaneous coronary intervention myonecrosis and improve coronary flow in diabetics: the \u2018OPTIMIZE-IT\u2019 pilot randomized study",
        "abstract": "Background Subgroup analyses of trials enrolling acute coronary syndrome patients suggest that inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa can improve the outcome of diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), possibly by improving microvascular perfusion. However, the efficacy of small-molecule IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors to improve microvascular perfusion in stable diabetic patients undergoing elective PCI has not been specifically investigated. Methods We randomized consecutive stable diabetic patients, undergoing elective PCI, to tirofiban or placebo groups along with double antiplatelet therapy. High-dose bolus (25 \u03bcg/kg per 3 min) of tirofiban was administered immediately before PCI followed by 8 h continuous infusion (0.15 \u03bcg/kg per min). Postprocedural myonecrosis was assessed prospectively by measurement of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) at 6 and 24 h after PCI. The primary end-points were post-PCI coronary flow estimated by corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count and post-PCI myocardial infarction. Platelet aggregation was measured by platelet function analyser-100 values. Results Forty-six patients entered the study (22 randomized to placebo and 24 randomized to tirofiban). The study drug was associated with a significant increase of platelet function analyser-100 values that peaked immediately after PCI and was maintained at 6 h (pre-PCI: 131 \u00b1 65 s; post-PCI: 222 \u00b1 49 s; after 6 h: 219 \u00b1 55 s). Post-PCI corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count was similar in tirofiban and in placebo groups (10.2 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 12.0 \u00b1 7.6, P = 0.30, respectively). The prevalence of raised cTnT levels was similar in the two groups (25 vs. 30%, P = 0.56, respectively). At multivariate analysis, direct stenting (associated with reduced myonecrosis) and postdilatation (associated with increased myonecrosis) predicted cTnT elevation. Conclusion A high-dose bolus of tirofiban in stable diabetic patients undergoing elective PCI, along with double antiplatelet therapy, was associated with a significant further inhibition of platelet aggregation which, however, did not translate in a lower incidence of post-PCI distal embolization.",

        "title": "Safety of downstream high-dose tirofiban bolus among 1578 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: the Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study",
        "abstract": "Background The Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study (SANTISS) is an open-label investigator-initiated single-centre registry launched to assess the combination of bleeding and access site in-hospital complications (primary end-point) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by femoral approach only. Methods We compared patients who were on oral single antiaggregating drug (AAD) and received, just prior to PCI, high-dose tirofiban and a second oral antiplatelet agent (triple AAD: group 1, n = 970) with those who were already on an oral double AAD regimen and did not receive tirofiban (double AAD: group 2, n = 608). Results Group 2 patients were slightly older, presented less frequently with unstable angina and had chronic renal failure more frequently. They were more than twice as frequently on rescue PCI, being more than three-fold less frequently on primary PCI (all: 0.01>P < 0.001). Overall, there were 87 in-hospital (average 4.7 days of stay) complications: 51 (5.3%) in group 1 and 36 (5.9%) in group 2 (not significant). Haemotransfusions were needed in 34 patients: 21 (2.2%) in group 1 and 13 (2.1%) in group 2 (not significant). Of the 16 hospital deaths, eight (0.8%) were seen in group 1 and eight (1.3%) in group 2 (not significant). Multivariate prediction showed a high predictive accuracy (areas under the curve >0.700) of female sex, rescue PCI and chronic renal failure to index complications, with highly significant odds ratios. The presence of high-dose tirofiban did not increase complication risk. Conclusion In the real world, high-dose tirofiban is well tolerated by patients on elective, primary or rescue PCI, and the in-hospital complication rate, including major bleeding, is low. This may have pharmacoeconomic consequences.",

However, the focus of this paper is more on the safety aspect rather than the efficacy of tirofiban, and it does not directly build upon the source paper's hypothesis or findings. Therefore, the relevance score is 1."

        "abstract": "Background There is no head-to-head comparison between tirofiban versus eptifibatide in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when added to standard antiaggregating drugs (AAD) to prevent ischemic events within 1 year. Methods We compared real-world patients undergoing PCI who were on oral single AAD and were block randomized to receive, immediately preintervention, high-dose tirofiban (n = 519) or double-bolus eptifibatide (n = 147) and a second oral antiplatelet agent. The incidence of composite ischemic events within 1 year, including death, acute myocardial infarction, angina, stent thrombosis or repeat PCI or coronary bypass surgery (primary end-point) was modelled by forced Cox's regression. Results There were overall 65 composite ischemic events: 47 (9.1%) in the tirofiban group and 18 (12.2%) in the eptifibatide group (univariate log-rank test: P = 0.22). On the basis of 21 potential covariates fitted simultaneously, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios showed that age [hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01\u20131.07, P = 0.01], chronic renal failure (hazard ratio 3.21, 95% CI 1.02\u201310.10, P = 0.05), pre-PCI values of creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) (hazard ratio 1.002, 95% CI 1.0002\u20131.0054, P = 0.04), intra-aortic balloon pump (hazard ratio 5.88, 95% CI 12.33\u201314.85, P = 0.0002) and the presence of eptifibatide (hazard ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.04\u20133.29, P = 0.04) were significant risk factors whereas thrombolysis by tenecteplase (hazard ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.69, P = 0.01) was a significant protector. Interestingly, eptifibatide versus tirofiban efficacy was explained based on pre-PCI values of CK-MB. Conclusion Head-to-head comparison between eptifibatide and tirofiban in patients undergoing PCI while on double AAD showed that eptifibatide had a lower efficacy on the incidence of composite ischemic events within 1 year, which might be explained by a reduced action on CK-MB pre-PCI.",
