        "title": "Technical Considerations and Patient Comfort in Total Colonoscopy with and without a Transparent Cap: Initial Experiences from a Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS\nEven though colonoscopy was introduced 30 years ago, endoscopists still leave a small percentage of the colonic mucosal surface unexamined because of the limitations of the procedure, so there is still room for technical improvements. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of attaching a transparent cap to the tip of the colonoscope, partly to gather basic data and experience for planning a larger randomized study, and partly to evaluate any technical advantages or disadvantages, and also to appraise the patients' experiences.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn 50 consecutive patients examined by a single experienced endoscopist, a prospective pilot study was carried out comparing the use of a colonoscope fitted with a transparent cap (in half of the colonoscopies) with the use of an ordinary colonoscope without a cap (in the remaining 25 patients). The following parameters were recorded: indication for colonoscopy, time to reach the cecum, total time for the colonoscopy, findings, diagnosis, type of colonoscopy (diagnostic or therapeutic, partial or total, ileal intubation), the amount of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy, and complications. At the end of the examination and also before leaving the hospital, the patients were asked by a nurse to estimate pain experienced during the colonoscopy, using a visual analogue scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time for the procedure, the ability to perform a complete colonoscopy (including ileal intubation when it was medically relevant), and the complication rate turned out to be similar in both groups. There were no differences between the amounts of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy or between the patients' estimations of the pain experienced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe time to reach the cecum and the total time for the colonoscopy is the same with or without the cap, which is well tolerated by patients. Using the cap greatly facilitates the possibility of finding small polyps behind folds in the colon, because the folds can be straightened, thereby improving the view, although in this small pilot study it could not be proven that the number of polyps found was greater using a cap-fitted colonoscope.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Colonoscopy is an established method of colorectal cancer screening, but has an adenoma miss rate of 10\u201320%. Detection rates are expected to improve with optimised visualisation methods. This prospective randomised study evaluated narrow-band imaging (NBI), a new technique that may enhance image contrast in colon adenoma detection. Methods: Eligible patients presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to undergo wide-angle colonoscopy using either conventional high-resolution imaging or NBI during instrument withdrawal. The primary outcome parameter was the difference in the adenoma detection rate between the two techniques. Results: A total of 401 patients were included (mean age 59.4 years, 52.6% men). Adenomas were detected more frequently in the NBI group (23%) than in the control group (17%) with a number of 17 colonoscopies needed to find one additional adenoma patient; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.129). When the two techniques were compared in consecutive subgroups of 100 study patients, adenoma rates in the NBI group remained fairly stable, whereas these rates steadily increased in the control group (8%, 15%, 17%, and 26.5%, respectively). Significant differences in the first 100 cases (26.5% versus 8%; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) could not be maintained in the last 100 cases (25.5% versus 26.5%, p\u200a=\u200a0.91). Conclusions: The increased adenoma detection rate means of NBI colonoscopy were statistically not significant. It remains speculative as to whether the increasing adenoma rate in the conventional group may have been caused by a training effect of better polyp recognition on NBI.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Colonoscopy, the \u201cgold standard\u201d screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC), has known diagnostic limitations. Advances in endoscope technology have focused on improving mucosal visualisation. In addition to increased angle of view and resolution features, recent colonoscopes have non-white-light optics, such as narrow band imaging (NBI), to enhance image contrast. We aimed to study the neoplasia diagnostic characteristics of NBI, by comparing the neoplasm miss rate when the colonoscopy was performed under NBI versus white light (WL). Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: US Veterans hospital. Patients: Elective colonoscopy adults. Intervention: We randomly assigned patients to undergo a colonoscopic examination using NBI or WL. All patients underwent a second examination using WL, as the reference standard. Main outcome measures: The primary end point was the difference in the neoplasm miss rate, and secondary outcome was the neoplasm detection rate. Results: In 276 tandem colonoscopy patients, there was no significant difference of miss or detection rates between NBI or WL colonoscopy techniques. Of the 135 patients in the NBI group, 17 patients (12.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5 to 19.4%) had a missed neoplasm, as compared with 17 of the 141 patients (12.1%; 95% CI 7.2 to 18.6%) in the WL group, with a miss rate risk difference of 0.5% (95% CI \u22127.2 to 8.3). 130 patients (47%) had at least one neoplasm. Missed lesions with NBI showed similar characteristics to those missed with WL. All missed neoplasms were tubular adenomas, the majority (78%) was \u2a7d5 mm and none were larger than 1 cm (one-sided 95% CI up to 1%). Nonpolypoid lesions represented 35% (13/37) of missed neoplasms. Interpretation: NBI did not improve the colorectal neoplasm miss rate compared to WL; the miss rate for advanced adenomas was less than 1% and for all adenomas was 12%. The neoplasm detection rates were similar high using NBI or WL; almost a half the study patients had at least one adenoma. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00628147",

        "title": "Chromoscopy versus conventional endoscopy for the detection of polyps in the colon and rectum.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough conventional colonoscopy is the most accurate test available for the investigation of the colorectum for polyps, data exist that raise concerns about its sensitivity. Chromoscopy (spraying dye onto the surface of the colon to make polyps more visible) may be one way of enhancing the ability of colonoscopy to detect polyps, particularly diminutive flat lesions, which otherwise may be difficult to detect.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine whether the use of chromoscopy enhances the detection of polyps and neoplasia during endoscopic examination of the colon and rectum.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following databases: Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Specialised Register (October 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library; Issue 10, 2015), MEDLINE (January 1950 to October 2015), EMBASE (January 1974 to October 2015), and ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (both November 2015). We also handsearched abstracts from relevant meetings from 1980 to 2015. Search terms included 'randomised trials' containing combinations of the following: 'chromoscopy' 'colonoscopy' 'dye-spray' 'chromo-endoscopy' 'indigo-carmine' 'magnifying endoscopy'.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all prospective randomised trials comparing chromoscopic with conventional endoscopic examination of the whole of the colon and rectum. We excluded studies of people with inflammatory bowel disease or polyposis syndromes and any studies that combined chromoscopy with additional interventions (cap assistance, water-perfused, etc.).\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible trials, and two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. Outcome measures included the detection of polyps (neoplastic and non-neoplastic), the detection of diminutive lesions, the number of participants with multiple neoplastic lesions, and the extubation time.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included seven trials (2727 participants) in this update. Five trials were of sufficiently similar design to allow for pooled results. Two trials differed substantially in design and were included in a subgroup analysis. All the trials had some methodological drawbacks. However, combining the results showed a significant difference in favour of chromoscopy for all detection outcomes. In particular, chromoscopy was likely to yield significantly more people with at least one neoplastic lesion (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 1.79; 7 trials; 2727 participants), and at least one diminutive neoplastic lesion (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.92; 4 trials; 1757 participants). Significantly more people with three or more neoplastic lesions were also detected, but only when studies that used high-definition colonoscopy in the control group were excluded (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.99 to 10.80; 2 trials; 519 participants). None of the included studies reported any adverse events related to the use of the contrast dye.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of neoplasia in the colon and rectum. People with neoplastic polyps, particularly those with multiple polyps, are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Such lesions, which presumably would be missed with conventional colonoscopy, could contribute to the interval cancer numbers on any surveillance programme.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background and study aims\u2003(Virtual) chromoendoscopy detects more polyps than standard white-light endoscopy in patients with Lynch syndrome. Previous back-to-back trials did not randomize for the examination order, creating a possible bias in favor of chromoendoscopy. We aimed to assess the difference in polyp detection between high definition white-light endoscopy (HD-WLE) and virtual chromoendoscopy with I-SCAN in patients with Lynch syndrome. Patients and methods\u2003In this prospective, controlled trial, patients were randomized to either HD-WLE followed by I-SCAN (Group 1; n\u200a=\u200a31) or I-SCAN followed by HD-WLE (Group 2; n\u200a=\u200a30). Polyps found during the first pass were removed. The primary end point of the study was the difference in adenoma detection between HD-WLE and I-SCAN, expressed as the miss rate for adenomas for each technique. Results\u2003In Group 1, I-SCAN detected four additional patients with at least one adenoma, whereas HD-WLE did not increase the adenoma detection rate in Group 2 (relative risk [RR] 0.4; P\u200a=\u200a0.08). In Group 1, five adenomas were detected and removed with HD-WLE and a second pass with I-SCAN detected a further eight adenomas. In Group 2, I-SCAN detected 15 adenomas and subsequent HD-WLE detected 2 additional adenomas. The adenoma miss rate was significantly higher for HD-WLE (62\u200a%) compared with I-SCAN (12\u200a%; RR 0.44, 95\u200a% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 0.87; P\u200a=\u200a0.007). The miss rate for lesions was 57\u200a% and 24\u200a%, respectively, and was significantly different in favor of I-SCAN (RR 0.54, 95\u200a%CI 0.3 to 0.85; P\u200a=\u200a0.005). The mean inspection time in both groups was not significantly different during first (485 vs. 536 seconds; 95\u200a%CI\u200a\u2013\u200a139.91 to 33.34) or second pass (421 vs. 387 seconds; 95\u200a%CI\u200a\u2013\u200a32.24 to 104.89). Conclusion\u2003Our data suggest that virtual chromoendoscopy with I-SCAN reduces the adenoma and polyp miss rate in patients with Lynch syndrome, independently of inspection time.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background\u2002To improve detection of mucosal lesions during colonoscopy a number of imaging modalities have been suggested, including high definition and virtual chromoendoscopy. Given the theoretical advantage of these new imaging techniques, we aimed to investigate their use for the detection of polyps in patients referred for colonoscopy in a large tertiary hospital. Methods\u2002Demographic, endoscopic, and histological data from 1855 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy were collected prospectively. Patients were randomly assigned to three endoscopy systems (Fujinon, Olympus, or Pentax) in combination with four modalities: conventional white-light colonoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a505), high definition white-light colonoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a582), virtual chromoendoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a285) and high definition virtual chromoendoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a483). Results\u2002The mean adenoma detection rate (ADR) was 34.9\u200a%, and the adenoma per colonoscopy rate (APCR) was 2.1. No significant differences were noted between the three endoscopy systems. Moreover, no differences in ADR or APCR were observed between the four imaging modalities. High definition white-light colonoscopy resulted in a significantly higher detection of sessile serrated adenomas (8.2\u200a% vs. 3.8\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.01) and adenocarcinomas (2.6\u200a% vs. 0.5\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.05) compared with the conventional procedure. Conclusions\u2002No significant differences in ADR or APCR between different endoscopy systems, high definition, and/or virtual chromoendoscopy could be observed in routine colonoscopies in the general population. High definition endoscopy was associated with a significantly higher detection rate of serrated adenomas and adenocarcinomas.",
