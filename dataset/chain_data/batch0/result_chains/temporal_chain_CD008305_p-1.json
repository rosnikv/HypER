        "abstract": "To study the efficacy and tolerability of Daming capsule (DMC) in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia, a randomized, multi\u2010centre, open\u2010label, parallel\u2010group trial was conducted. Sixty enrolled patients with hyperlipidemia allocated to six medical centers were randomly divided into two groups of 30 individuals each. One group received DMC 2 g b.i.d. for 6 weeks, and the other received pravastatin 10 mg o.d. for 6 weeks. For efficacy assessment, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL\u2010C) were measured before and after drug treatment. Serum TC and LDL\u2010C levels in the DMC\u2010treatment group were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment (p < 0.05), while TG and HDL\u2010C levels did not change much. Tolerability was assessed by heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Cr), which were not changed in either the DMC or pravastatin groups at 3 and 6 weeks (p > 0.05). Besides, eight patients experienced diarrhea during DMC treatment and two experienced myalgia and epigastric discomfort during pravastatin treatment. Based on the above results, it was concluded that DMC may be a good candidate for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and further clinical trials are warranted.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHypertriglyceridaemia is associated with many diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension and chylomicronaemia. Chinese herbal medicines have been used for a long time as lipid-lowering agents.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched a number of databases including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and several Chinese databases (all until May 2012).\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials in participants with hypertriglyceridaemia comparing Chinese herbal medicines with placebo, no treatment, and pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion and a decision was achieved based on consensus. We assessed trials for risk of bias against key criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included three randomised trials with 170 participants. Ninety participants were randomised to the Chinese herbal medicines groups and 80 to the comparator groups with numbers ranging from 50 to 60 participants per trial. The duration of treatment varied from four to six weeks. All the included trials were conducted in China and published in Chinese. Overall, the risk of bias of included trials was unclear. There were no outcome data in any of the trials on death from any cause, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, health-related quality of life, or costs.Three different herbal medicines, including Zhusuan Huoxue decoction, Huoxue Huayu Tongluo decoction, and Chushi Huayu decoction were evaluated. All three trials investigating Chinese herbal medicines treatment alone (two studies) or in combination with gemfibrozil (one study) reported results on serum triglyceride (TG) in favour of the herbal treatment. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to significant clinical heterogeneity between the studies.No relevant differences in adverse effects occurred and no serious adverse events were noted.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe present systematic review suggests that Chinese herbal medicines may have positive effects on hypertriglyceridaemia. The trials did not report serious adverse effects following Chinese herbal medicines treatment. However, based on an unclear risk of bias in included studies and lack of patient-important long-term outcomes, no definite conclusion could be reached.",

However, it does not directly build upon or depend on the findings of the source paper, and its focus is on a different aspect of lipid disorders."

        "title": "Supplementation with the Extract of Schisandrae Fructus Pulp, Seed, or Their Combination Influences the Metabolism of Lipids and Glucose in Mice Fed with Normal and Hypercholesterolemic Diet",
        "abstract": "Schisandrae Fructus (SF), which possesses five tastes: sweet (fruit skin), sour (pulp), bitter/pungent (seed core), and saltiness (all parts), can produce a wide spectrum of biological activities in the body. Here, we investigated the effects of the ethanolic extract of SF pulp, seed, or their combination (namely, EtSF-P, EtSF-S, or EtSF-P/S, resp.; collectively called EtSF) on the metabolism of lipids and glucose in normal diet- (ND-) and hypercholesterolemic diet- (HCLD-) fed mice. Supplementation with EtSF significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels by 18\u201347% in both ND- and HCLD-fed mice. EtSF supplementation reduced serum triglyceride levels (approximately 29%), whereas EtSF-P and EtSF-S/P elevated serum cholesterol (up to 26 and 44%, resp.) in HCLD-fed mice. Treatment with EtSF decreased hepatic glucose levels (by 9\u201344%) in both ND- and HCLD-fed mice. Supplementation with EtSF-S or EtSF-S/P (at 1 and 3%) increased biliary or fecal TC contents in HCLD-fed mice. However, supplementation with EtSF-S/P at 9% reduced biliary TC levels in HCLD-fed mice. EtSF-P or EtSF-S/P supplementation reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activity in HCLD-fed mice. The findings suggested that supplementation with EtSF lowered lipid and glucose accumulation in the liver and increased fecal cholesterol contents in mice. Dietary supplementation with EtSF-P or EtSF-S/P attenuated liver damage in HCLD-fed mice.",

        "title": "Schisandrae Fructus Reduces Symptoms of 4-Vinylcyclohexene Diepoxide-Induced Ovarian Failure in Mice",
        "abstract": "Menopause is associated with a decrease in the level of sex hormones such as ovarian estradiol and progesterone and can cause various symptoms such as depression, hot flash, fatigue, heart palpitations, and headache. Furthermore, there is a risk of developing complications such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and ovarian cancer. Schisandrae Fructus (SF) is widely used in Korean medicine as a cure for such complications. This study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of SF against menopause symptoms associated with follicle depletion caused by the industrial chemical 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) in mice. VCD directly targets the preantral follicles. Mice were injected with VCD (160\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 15 days and then with SF dosage 3 times/week for six weeks. To evaluate the effects of SF, body weight, tail skin temperature, uterine weight, lipid profile, and osteocalcin levels were measured. A decrease in body weight and tail skin temperature and an increase in uterine weight were observed upon SF treatment. Moreover, SF treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglyceride, osteocalcin, and low-density lipoprotein levels and low-density/high-density lipoprotein ratio. These results suggest the potential use of SF in the treatment of menopausal symptoms in women.",
