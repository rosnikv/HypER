        "abstract": "Twenty-three children with destructive polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) were treated for 0.5-4.3 years (median 1.6 years) with weekly doses of methotrexate (MTX) (0.11-0.6 mg/kg/week). Serum levels of MTX at 1 hour and at 24 hours after drug administration were obtained at each dosage level and every 3 months after a stable dosage was achieved. No patient had serum levels of MTX that were in the toxic range nor evidence of hematologic, skin, mucous membrane, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary abnormalities. Ten patients had transiently elevated serum transaminase levels. Arthritis symptoms improved in 21 of these JRA patients, and the improvement was significantly associated with a mean 1-hour serum MTX level of greater than or equal to 5.8 x 10(-7)M (P = 0.008) and a dosage of greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/week (P = 0.004). The 1-hour serum level of MTX was correlated with the MTX dosage (r = 0.28, P = 0.005). Our observations suggest that with close monitoring, MTX can be used safely at dosages as high as 0.6 mg/kg/week, and improvement in the symptoms of JRA will become evident when the serum levels of MTX 1 hour after administration approach 6.0 x 10(-7)M.",

        "title": "Safety and efficacy therapy for juvenile of methotrexate rheumatoid arthritis",
        "abstract": "Twenty-nine children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis were studied to determine the safety and efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The initial dose of methotrexate averaged 7.1 mg/m2/wk and was given as a single, oral weekly dose or as three divided doses, each separated by 12 hours. Current antiinflammatory medications were continued; 25 of 29 children had had lack of efficacy, and 8 of 29 had toxic effects, with one or more prior drugs such as intramuscularly or orally administered gold, hydroxychloroquine, or D-penlcillamine. Intolerable corticosteroid dependency or toxic effects were present in 18 of 29 cases. Methotrexate-treated patients were examined monthly; minimum treatment duration required to assess efficacy and toxicity was 6 months. The range of treatment duration was 8 to 39 months (mean 18.5 months). Efficacy was assessed by comparing pretreatment versus posttreatment fever and rash, swollen-joint counts, articular indexes, duration of morning stiffness, functional class, hemoglobin levels, and platelet counts. Treatment with methotrexate effectively controlled fever and rash in 83% of children with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, reduced morning stiffness by 63%, eliminated recalcitrant joint restriction in 48%, and reduced numbers of swollen joints and swelling indexes by 46% and 52%, respectively. No significant toxic effects were observed. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of long duration, or with major erosions, was more likely to be refractory to methotrexate therapy. We recommend earlier consideration of methotrexate in place of other slow-acting antirheumatic drugs for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis not responding well to usual therapy. Future studies should address potential methotrexate toxic effects in the lungs and reproductive system, as well as outcome after discontinuation of methotrexate treatment.

        "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although associated with many mild adverse effects, the short and long-term safety of MTX in JIA has been excellent. While many JIA children treated with MTX develop liver enzyme abnormalities, no cases of irreversible liver damage or of severe non-infectious hepatitis with Reye-like features have been reported in non-systemic JIA. We report a 2-year-old girl with oligoarthritis whose liver enzyme increased to greater than 45 times the upper limit of normal, and developed hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia after 10 months of MTX and naproxen therapy. An infectious and metabolic work-up for other causes was unremarkable. She recovered completely after folinic acid therapy; MTX and naproxen was not restarted. While very rare in JIA, MTX in synergism with naproxen can induce severe liver toxicity and it is important to screen children for liver enzyme abnormalities.",

        "title": "Incidence of Chronic Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases After Diagnosis with Kawasaki Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nKawasaki disease (kDa) is an immune-mediated vasculitis of childhood with multi-organ inflammation. We determined the risk of subsequent immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), including arthritis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune liver disease (ALD), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a matched population-based cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Children aged <18\u2009years born between 1991-2016 diagnosed with kDa (n\u2009=\u20093,753) were matched to 5 non-kDa controls from the general population (n\u2009=\u200918\u2009749). We determined the incidence of IMIDs after resolution of kDa. Three- and 12-month washout periods were used to exclude kDa-related symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was an elevated risk of arthritis in kDa patients compared with non-kDa controls starting three months after index date (103.0 vs 12.7 per 100\u2009000 person-years (PYs); incidence rate ratio (IRR) 8.07 (95% CI 4.95-13.2); hazard ratio (HR) 8.08 (95% CI 4.95-13.2), resulting in the overall incidence of IMIDs being elevated in kDa patients (175.1 vs 68.0 per 100\u2009000 PYs; IRR 2.58 (95% CI 1.93-3.43); HR 2.58, 95% CI 1.94-3.43). However, there was no increased risk for diabetes, IBD, ALD, PSC or MS in kDa patients. Similar results were observed using a 12-month washout period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren diagnosed with kDa were at increased risk of arthritis following the acute kDa event, but not other IMIDs. Health care providers should monitor for arthritis in children following a diagnosis of kDa.",

        "title": "Impact of Kawasaki disease on juvenile idiopathic arthritis in real-world patients: A population-based cohort study",
        "abstract": "Objectives Recent research has demonstrated the commonality of several biological markers between Kawasaki disease (KD) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), including interleukin-1\u03b2 and -6. Therefore, in this cohort study, we assessed whether KD increases the risk of JIA. Methods This study enrolled 7009 patients with and 56 072 individuals without KD in the period 2010\u20132018 from Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. On the basis of sex, age, and comorbidities, we executed propensity score matching at the ratio 1:8. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for JIA was determined through multiple Cox regression. Stratified analysis and sensitivity tests were also employed. Results When adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the JIA risk was noted to be 2.02-fold greater in children with KD than it was in those without (aHR: 2.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.12\u20133.67, p = 0.0205). The sensitivity test and subgroup analysis obtained consistent findings in the different sex and comorbidity subgroups. Conclusion Children\u2019s risk of JIA is higher if they have KD. Pediatricians should consider the possibility of JIA in this population. More investigations are necessary to identify the pathological mechanisms that link JIA and KD.",
