        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe mechanism by which enhanced external counterpulsation therapy exerts its beneficial effects on chronic and symptomatic stable angina is largely unknown. To clarify the mechanism of action of enhanced external counterpulsation, we used(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography to evaluate myocardial perfusion.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThis was not a randomized controlled study. Eleven patients (eight male, age: 61.6+/-9.7) with angina pectoris underwent enhanced external counterpulsation therapy for 35 1 h sessions. They underwent a treadmill exercise test and(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography, both at rest and with dipyridamole, before and after enhanced external counterpulsation therapy. Neurohumoral factors and nitric oxide were also evaluated. Myocardial perfusion increased at rest after therapy (0.69+/-0.27 to 0.85+/-0.47 ml x min(-1) x g(-1), P<0.05). In ischaemic regions, particularly the anterior region, myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and coronary flow reserve improved significantly after therapy (at rest: 0.71+/-0.26 to 0.86+/-0.31;P<0.05, with dipyridamole: 1.26+/-0.65 to 1.84+/-0.94;P<0.02, coronary flow reserve: 1.75+/-0.24 to 2.08+/-0.28;P<0.04). Exercise time was prolonged and the time to 1-mm ST depression improved markedly (P<0.01). After therapy, nitric oxide levels increased (P<0.02) and neurohumoral factors decreased.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnhanced external counterpulsation therapy improved myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and was associated with an increased exercise tolerance with(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography and increased nitric oxide levels. These results suggest that one of the enhanced external counterpulsation mechanisms is development and recruitment of collateral vessels.",

        "title": "Left Ventricular Systolic Unloading and Augmentation of Intracoronary Pressure and Doppler Flow During Enhanced External Counterpulsation",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a noninvasive, pneumatic technique that provides beneficial effects for patients with chronic, symptomatic angina pectoris. However, the physiological effects of EECP have not been studied directly. We examined intracoronary and left ventricular hemodynamics in the cardiac catheterization laboratory during EECP. Methods and Results\u2014Ten patients referred for diagnostic evaluation underwent left heart catheterization and coronary angiography from the radial artery. At baseline and then during EECP, central aortic pressure, intracoronary pressure, and intracoronary Doppler flow velocity were measured using a coronary catheter, a sensor-tipped high-fidelity pressure guidewire, and a Doppler flow guidewire, respectively. Similar to changes in aortic pressure, EECP resulted in a dramatic increase in diastolic (71\u00b110 mm Hg at baseline to 137\u00b121 mm Hg during EECP; +93%;P <0.0001) and mean intracoronary pressures (88\u00b19 to 102\u00b116 mm Hg; +16%;P =0.006) with a decrease in systolic pressure (116\u00b120 to 99\u00b126 mm Hg; \u221215%;P =0.002). The intracoronary Doppler measure of average peak velocity increased from 11\u00b15 cm/s at baseline to 23\u00b15 cm/s during EECP (+109%;P =0.001). The TIMI frame count, a quantitative angiographic measure of coronary flow, showed a 28% increase in coronary flow during EECP compared with baseline (P =0.001). Conclusions\u2014EECP unequivocally and significantly increases diastolic and mean pressures and reduces systolic pressure in the central aorta and the coronary artery. Coronary artery flow, determined by both Doppler and angiographic techniques, is increased during EECP. The combined effects of systolic unloading and increased coronary perfusion pressure provide evidence that EECP may serve as a potential mechanical assist device.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe hemodynamic effects of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) and its mechanism(s) were investigated in relation to neurohumoral factors in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTwenty-four patients with AMI were studied before, during and after EECP treatment for 60 min. Heart rate (HR), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) were determined. In addition, circulating concentrations of neurohumoral factors were determined at each time point. HR did not change following EECP treatment. However, RAP and PCWP increased significantly and CI was significantly elevated during EECP and thereafter. Blood atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration was significantly increased 15 and 60 min after the start of EECP treatment, but brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) did not change. Renin, aldosterone and catecholamine concentrations also did not change.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with EECP resulted in an increased preload because of increased venous return, and CI was increased thereafter. In patients with AMI, EECP increased blood ANP concentration, but not BNP, which suggests that an increase in ANP without an increase in BNP is an important mechanism for the effects of EECP treatment.",

        "title": "Management options for angina refractory to maximal medical and surgical interventions.",
        "abstract": "Despite the seemingly daily advances in the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for coronary artery disease, many patients will ultimately experience progression of their disease and experience angina refractory to further active treatment. In these patients, disabling angina occurs at rest or during simple activities of daily living. When this occurs, symptom management, a predominant focus of nursing, becomes the goal of care. Several medical and surgical alternatives are available to patients with refractory angina. Enhanced external counterpulsation and transmyocardial laser revascularization are Food and Drug Administration approved therapies that can be used to attempt to restore the balance of supply and demand. Modulation of sympathetic tone via procedures such as stellate ganglion blocks has also been employed. Other methods to control the pain are techniques that alter pain perception such as spinal opioids, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation. Too few patients with refractory angina are referred for any of these palliative therapies. Armed with knowledge regarding these therapies, nurses will be better prepared to provide anticipatory guidance to patients and their families and to support the patient's hope for relief as they cope with this devastating condition.",

        "abstract": "Acute chest pain is a common presentation in emergency. After clinical assessment undiagnosed chest pain can become a difficult problem. Sympathetically mediated chest pain is a rare presentation, as it is similar to that of secondary hyperalgesia in the intact skin surrounding an injury site. We are reporting a case of a 62 years old man who presented with atypical chest pain four months after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). On investigation no new change was noticed than previous evaluation. On chronic pain assessment he was having hyperalgesia to light touch in addition to the spontaneous chest pain. He was treated as a case of sympathetically mediated chest pain, pain modulators, analgesics and Stellate ganglion block. Patient responded dramatically to Stellate ganglion block and returned to work within two weeks time. This case illustrated the importance of early diagnosis of sympathetically mediated chest pain and role of Stellate ganglion block.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of preincisional ipsilateral stellate ganglion block for acute post operative pain control in unilateral mastectomy. Methodology: In a randomized clinical trial, 62 patients selected for unilateral mastectomy were recruited in Tabriz Imam Reza educational Hospital during 18-month period. They were randomly divided into two equal groups; receiving either preincisional ipsilateral stellate ganglion block using bupivacaine (study group) or without these blocks (control group). Postoperative pain was evaluated based on visual analogue scale (VAS). The total dose of analgesics were also compared between the two groups. Results: Thirty one female patients with a mean age of 48.7\u00b17.4 (36-60) years and 31 other female patients with a mean age of 50.7\u00b16.9 (36-60) years were enrolled in the study and control groups, respectively (p=0.292). The number of patients with decrease in postoperative pain was significantly higher in the case study group comparing with that of the control group (p<0.001). Decrease in total dose of postoperative analgesics was also significantly lower in the case study group compared with control group (P<0.001). Forty eight hours after operation, there were 15 pain-free patients in the study group with no pain-free patients in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusion: Based on our findings, the preincisional ipsilateral stellate ganglion block is an effective method in controlling the postoperative pain after unilateral mastectomy. This approach had also got a considerable analgesic-sparing effect.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPostoperative pain as an important medical concern is usually treated by opioids which also are of various inevitable side effects. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of multimodal preincisional premedication on preventing post-cholecystectomy acute pain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized clinical trial, sixty patients undergoing open cholecystectomy were randomized into two groups. Before anesthesia induction, Diclofenac suppository (100 mg) and oral Clonidine (0.2 mg) were administered in the first group. Immediately before operation, patients received Ketamine (1 mg/kg IV) while the control group received placebo. The site of incision was infiltrated by the surgeon with 20 mL Bupivacaine 0.25% in both groups. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were similar in both groups. The severity of pain was recorded 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after operation according to Visual Analogue Scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe severity of pain at two defined stages (6 and 12 hours later) was significantly less in the intervention group than the control group (P<0.005). The average pain severity score was less than the control group (P<0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn our study, the administration of Clonidine, Diclofenac and Ketamine and bupivacaine infiltration to the site of incision, altogether was associated with a significant decrease in pain score and opioid requirement after cholecystectomy in comparison to bupivacaine infiltration to the site of incision.",

        "title": "Premedication With Single Dose of Acetazolamide for the Control of Referral Shoulder Pain After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy",
        "abstract": "Background: The use of laparoscopic surgeries is escalating thanks to their advantages over the open surgeries. However, several complications can be observed following laparoscopy operation. Postoperative pain is a major concern in cholecystectomy surgeries. Pain can be both experienced in operated areas and radiated to the right shoulder. Acetazolamide is used for glaucoma, acute mountain sickness prophylaxis, and epilepsy in few patients with recurrent epilepsy. It seems that patients\u2019 pain can be reduced by preventing carbonic acid production in abdomen after operation. Objectives: We aimed at evaluating if administration of acetazolamide preoperatively could affect early or late postoperative pain following laparoscopic surgery. Patients and Methods: In a randomized-controlled clinical trial study, 70 subjects (30 - 60 years) scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included after obtaining a written informed consent. Patients were divided into two groups randomly (intervention and control). The intervention group received 5 mg/kg oral acetazolamide one hour before the operation. The control group did not receive any further medication. Results: Administration of a single dose of acetazolamide did not have any statistically significant impact on sleep quality (P = 1.000). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding nausea and vomiting on single dose administration of acetazolamide (P = 1.000). Single dose of acetazolamide was associated with statistically significant decrease in shoulder pain immediately after laparoscopy (P = 0.017). However, there was no statistically significant difference regarding shoulder pain between the studied groups 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after laparoscopy. Single dose of acetazolamide did not significantly affect analgesic administration in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after laparoscopy. Conclusions: Single dose of acetazolamide was associated with statistically significant decrease in shoulder pain immediately after laparoscopy. However, this effect was limited to the first postoperative hours and it failed to reduce postoperative pain of right shoulder during 24 hours after the operation.",
