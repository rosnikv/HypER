        "title": "Effects of skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract on frequency of gout flares: a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives Previous laboratory studies have identified two dairy fractions, glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract (G600), with anti-inflammatory effects in models of acute gout. The aim of this proof-of-concept clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that daily intake of skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with GMP and G600 can prevent gout flares. Methods This was a 3-month randomised double-blind controlled trial of milk products for prevention of gout flares. One hundred and twenty patients with recurrent gout flares were randomised to one of three arms: lactose powder control, SMP control and SMP enriched with GMP and G600 (SMP/GMP/G600). The primary end point was change in the frequency of gout flares using a daily flare diary measured monthly for 3 months. Results The frequency of gout flares reduced in all three groups over the 3-month study period compared with baseline. Over the 3-month study period there was a significantly greater reduction in gout flares in the SMP/GMP/G600 group (analysis of covariance pgroup=0.031, Tukey post hoc test compared with lactose control, p=0.044). Following treatment with SMP/GMP/G600 over the 3-month period, greater improvements were also observed in pain and fractional excretion of uric acid, with trends to greater improvement in tender joint count. Similar adverse event rates and discontinuation rates were observed between the three groups. Conclusions This is the first reported controlled trial of dietary intervention in patients with gout, and suggests that SMP enriched with GMP and G600 may reduce the frequency of gout flares.",

        "abstract": "Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

        "title": "New Perspectives in Rheumatology: Implications of the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities Trial and the Associated Food and Drug Administration Public Safety Alert",
        "abstract": "Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now\u2010published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all\u2010cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate\u2010lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long\u2010term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first\u2010line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first\u2010line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision\u2010making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

        "title": "Association Between Uric Acid and Worsening Peripheral Microangiopathy in Systemic Sclerosis",
        "abstract": "Objective: The key element in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is microcirculatory changes in several vascular beds. Uric acid is associated with endothelial dysfunction and therefore, microvascular damage. The aim of this study was to examine the association between uric acid (UA) and peripheral microvascular involvement in patients with SSc. Methods: We included consecutive, consenting patients with SSc. Serum UA, urea and creatinine were measured, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated with CKD-EPI. All participants underwent nailfold video-capillaroscopy (NVC) to evaluate the microcirculation. Results: A total of 64 patients (95.3% women) were included in the study. UA levels were significantly associated with the number of avascular areas (r = 0.290; p = 0.020), whereas no correlation was shown for the GFR (r = \u22120.065; p = 0.609). A significant trend of UA in the three capillaroscopic patterns was shown (3.90 \u00b1 1.52 vs. 4.15 \u00b1 0.98 vs. 5.38 \u00b1 2.26; for early, active, and late patterns respectively, p = 0.028). Multivariate analysis showed that male gender (\u03b2 = 3.049; 95% CI = 0.997\u20135.101) and UA (\u03b2 = 0.352; 95% CI = 0.117\u20130.588) were independently associated with the number of avascular areas. Conclusion: These data suggest that UA levels are significantly associated with the capillaroscopic patterns, reflecting a progressive microvasculopathy.",

        "title": "Lowering Uric Acid May Improve Prognosis in Patients With Hyperuricemia and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction",
        "abstract": "Background An association between uric acid (UA) and cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (HF), has been reported. However, whether UA is a causal risk factor for HF is controversial. In particular, the prognostic value of lowering UA in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unclear. Methods and Results We enrolled patients with HFpEF from the PURSUIT\u2010HFpEF (Prospective Multicenter Observational Study of Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) registry. We investigated whether UA was correlated with the composite events, including all\u2010cause mortality and HF rehospitalization, in patients with hyperuricemia and HFpEF (UA >7.0\u2009mg/dL). Additionally, we evaluated whether lowering UA for 1\u2009year (\u22651.0\u2009mg/dL) in them reduced mortality or HF rehospitalization. We finally analyzed 464 patients with hyperuricemia. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, UA was an independent determinant of composite death and rehospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15 [95% CI, 1.03\u20131.27], P=0.015). We divided them into groups with severe and mild hyperuricemia according to median estimated value of serum UA (8.3\u2009mg/dL). Cox proportional hazards models revealed the incidence of all\u2010cause mortality was significantly higher in the group with severe hyperuricemia than in the group with mild hyperuricemia (HR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.19\u20132.25], P=0.004). The incidence of all\u2010cause mortality was significantly decreased in the group with lowering UA compared with the group with nonlowering UA (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.02\u20132.86], P=0.041). The incidence of urate\u2010lowering therapy tended to be higher in the group with lowering UA than in the group with nonlowering UA (34.9% versus 24.6%, P=0.06). Conclusions UA is a predictor for the composite of all\u2010cause death and HF rehospitalization in patients with hyperuricemia and HFpEF. In these patients, lowering UA, including the use of urate\u2010lowering therapy, may improve prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Background Hyperuricemia and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) are both widespread in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients. RVD is associated with a poor prognosis in HFpEF. The correlation between serum uric acid (UA) levels and right ventricular function is unclear. The prognostic performance of UA in patients with HFpEF needs further validation. Methods and results A total of 210 patients with HFpEF were included in the study and divided into two groups according to UA level: the normal UA group (\u22647 mg/dl) and the high UA group (>7 mg/dl). The variables examined included clinical characteristics, echocardiography, and serum biochemical parameters. Right ventricular function was assessed by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid annular peak systolic velocity (TAPSV). Baseline characteristics were compared between the two groups, and the correlation between baseline UA and RVD was assessed using multifactorial binary logistic regression. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were used to describe all-cause mortality and heart failure readmission. Results showed that right ventricular function parameters were worse in the high UA group. After adjusting for UA, left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), atrial fibrillation (AF), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), UA (odds ratio = 2.028; p < 0.001) was independently associated with RVD, and UA >7 mg/dl (HR = 2.98; p < 0.001) was associated with heart failure readmission in patients with HFpEF. Conclusion Elevated serum UA is closely associated with RVD and significantly associated with the heart failure readmission rate in patients with HFpEF.",

        "abstract": "Aims This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between serum uric acid levels and the efficacy of uric acid-lowering therapies on clinical outcomes among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted through October 21, 2023, across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The pooled effect sizes were estimated and presented with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on various factors, including sample size (<1,000 vs. \u22651,000), follow-up duration (<2 years vs. \u22652 years), study quality (assessed by a score of <7 vs. \u22657), ethnicity (Non-Asian vs. Asian), study design (prospective vs. retrospective), type of heart failure (HF) (acute vs. chronic), presence of hyperuricemia (yes or no), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds (\u226545% vs. \u226550%), and the type of uric acid-lowering therapy (traditional vs. novel). Results The analysis included a total of 12 studies. Elevated serum uric acid levels were significantly linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality [relative risk (RR): 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06\u20131.37, P\u2009=\u20090.004] and cardiovascular (CV) mortality (RR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.42\u20132.04, P\u2009<\u20090.001) in HFpEF patients. Subgroup analyses confirmed this association, particularly in non-Asian populations, those with chronic HFpEF, and studies with a follow-up duration of two years or more. Additionally, higher uric acid levels were associated with an increased risk of HF-related hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR): 1.61, 95% CI: 1.12\u20132.34, P\u2009=\u20090.011]. Regarding treatment, uric acid-lowering therapy did not show a significant effect on reducing mortality in HFpEF patients. However, it was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization due to HF (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79\u20130.91, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the prognostic significance of serum uric acid levels in HFpEF and suggest that uric acid-lowering therapy may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of HF hospitalizations. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which uric acid-lowering therapy confers its potential benefits.",
