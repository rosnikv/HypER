        "title": "Gastrointestinal toxicity with celecoxib vs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: the CLASS study: A randomized controlled trial. Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nConventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000.\n\n\nSETTING\nThree hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nIncidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255",

        "title": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a critical review on current concepts applied to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide. Nevertheless, their intake is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects, representing still an important medical and socio-economic problem. In recent years efforts focused on the development of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors with an improved gastric tolerability profile. However, severe cardiovascular adverse reactions challenged the initial enthusiasm in this new class of anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, the market withdrawals of some coxibs led to a relative reluctance in prescribing COX-2 inhibitors in clinical practice. As a consequence, the interest for alternative approaches to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with NSAIDs has re-emerged. There are two main components of gastric damaging properties of NSAIDs: (1) the acute toxicity associated with the short-term intake of NSAIDs, which is principally caused by local irritation of the gastric mucosa (2) the chronic toxicity resulting mainly from systemic effects associated with prolonged administration of NSAIDs. Based on that background two different approaches were pursued in the search for GI sparing NSAIDs: a) modification of classical NSAIDs by associating them with phospholipids, cyclodextrins, or chemical moieties that release gastroprotective mediators and b) defining novel targets as well as developing new compounds like dual COX/5-LO or mPGES-1 inhibitors. This review provides the first comprehensive overview of all currently applied approaches taken to improve the risk-benefit ratio of NSAIDs focusing on the structure activity relationships and the respective mechanism of action underlying the individual approaches. The insight gained in this review is useful for further research activity in this field.",

        "title": "Ibuprofen Inhibits Activation of Nuclear \u03b2-Catenin in Human Colon Adenomas and Induces the Phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2",
        "abstract": "Nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors target many of the same cancer-associated molecular pathways as COX-2\u2013specific inhibitors. Although these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often associated with gastrointestinal toxicity, there is renewed interest in their use as colorectal cancer (CRC) chemopreventive agents due to the adverse side effects associated with long-term use of selective COX-2 inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term use (up to 25 years) of NSAIDs (ibuprofen or aspirin) on adenoma pathology and \u03b2-catenin\u2013mediated signaling in sporadic human colon adenomas. Although NSAID use did not impact overall adenoma size or degree of dysplasia, it did cause a significant inhibition of nuclear \u03b2-catenin localization, which correlated with suppression of cyclin D1 expression. To further elucidate the effect of these agents in regulating \u03b2-catenin, we treated SW480 colon cancer cells with a panel of NSAIDs and determined their effects on \u03b2-catenin levels and cellular localization. In agreement with our in vivo results, both S-ibuprofen and aspirin were found to decrease total levels of \u03b2-catenin while increasing its phosphorylation. In addition, S-ibuprofen induced both degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB. Despite its nuclear localization, however, the activation of the NF-\u03baB target genes, Bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was suppressed. This reduction in NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity may be due to increased phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 following S-ibuprofen treatment. These data suggest that ibuprofen can effectively target both the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB pathways, and potentially uncovers a novel mechanism through which NSAIDS may exert their chemopreventive efficacy.
