        "title": "Efficacy of symptomatic control of knee osteoarthritis with 0.0125% of capsaicin versus placebo.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent and associated with both pain and functional disability. Current treatments aim to alleviate mild to moderate symptoms by various methods. Topical capsaicin (0.075% and 0.05%) has been evaluated for the treatment of the painful joints. A burning sensation was the most common side effect at these strengths. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 0.0125% capsaicin gel (Capsika gel) compared to a placebo (the vehicle gel) in patients with symptomatic OA knee.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nThis was a cross-over; double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 100 patients with mild to moderate knee OA. All of the patients received either capsaicin gel or placebo gel applied to the affected knee, three times daily for 4 weeks with one week washout period after which the treatment switched to either capsaicin gel or placebo gel for the next 4 weeks. A blinded examiner used the visual analog scale (VAS) and WOMAC score to do weekly assessments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects averaged 61 years of age (range, 44 to 82). During the enrollment phase, only female farmers presented. Mean body weight and height was 62.97 +/- 10.25 kg and 1.54 +/- 0.053 m, respectively The respective baseline VAS and WOMAC score was 6.40 +/- 1.64 and 51.65 +/- 13.3. The severity of OA, according to the KL criteria was: 83 patients with grade 2 and 16 with grade 3. The respective mean difference of VAS and total WOMAC score in the capsaicin group vs. the placebo group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean difference of the WOMAC pain, stiffness and functional subscales in the capsaicin vs. the placebo group was also significant (p < 0.05). The only adverse event reported was a burning sensation. During the 4-week treatment with capsaicin, approximately 67% of patients had a burning sensation but none withdrew for this reason.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n0.0125% capsaicin gel was an effective treatment in mildly to moderately painful OA knees. The burning sensation reported by patients in the capsaicin group was less disturbing than in previous studies and none of the present patients withdrew for this reason.",

        "title": "Diabetic Neuropathy: A Randomized, Double- Blind, Crossover, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "& Abstract Background: Topical therapy may provide additional benefit in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). This study was conducted to study the safety and efficacy of 0.025% capsaicin gel in this condition. Methods: A 20-week, double-blind, crossover, randomized, single-center study enrolled subjects with PDN. They received 0.025% capsaicin gel or placebo for 8 weeks, with a washout period of 4 weeks between the two treatments. Primary efficacy end point was percent change in visual analog scale (0\u2013100 mm) of pain severity. Secondary outcomes were score change in Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS), short-form McGill Pain Questionnaires (SF-MPQ), proportion of patients who had pain score reductions of 30% and 50%, and adverse event. Results: Of the 35 subjects screened, 33 were enrolled and 33 completed at least an 8-week treatment period. Intentionto-treat analysis showed no significant improvement in pain with capsaicin gel, compared with placebo with visual analog scale (VAS) score 28.8 mm vs. 34.6 mm (P = 0.53). No significant difference between the groups was found in SF-MPQ (7.4 vs. 7.71, P = 0.95), NPS (29.4 vs. 31.3, P = 0.81), and proportion of patients who had 30% or 50% pain relief. Capsaicin gel was well tolerated with minor skin reaction. Conclusions: 0.025% capsaicin gel is safe and well tolerated, but does not provide significant pain relief in patients with PDN. &",

        "title": "Reducing CXCR 4-mediated nociceptor hyperexcitability reverses painful diabetic neuropathy",
        "abstract": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is an intractable complication of diabetes that affects 25% of patients. PDN is characterized by neuropathic pain and small-fiber degeneration, accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor hyperexcitability and loss of their axons within the skin. The molecular mechanisms underlying DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability and small-fiber degeneration in PDN are unknown. We hypothesize that chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is central to this mechanism, as we have shown that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is necessary for the development of mechanical allodynia, a pain hypersensitivity behavior common in PDN. Focusing on DRG neurons expressing the sodium channel Nav1.8, we applied transgenic, electrophysiological, imaging, and chemogenetic techniques to test this hypothesis. In the high-fat diet mouse model of PDN, we were able to prevent and reverse mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration by limiting CXCR4 signaling or neuronal excitability. This study reveals that excitatory CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration in a mouse model of PDN. Hence, we propose that targeting CXCR4-mediated DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic approach for disease-modifying treatments for this currently intractable and widespread affliction.

        "title": "GPR177 in A-fiber sensory neurons drives diabetic neuropathic pain via WNT-mediated TRPV1 activation",
        "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is a common and devastating complication in patients with diabetes. The mechanisms mediating DNP are not completely elucidated, and effective treatments are lacking. A-fiber sensory neurons have been shown to mediate the development of mechanical allodynia in neuropathic pain, yet the molecular basis underlying the contribution of A-fiber neurons is still unclear. Here, we report that the orphan G protein\u2013coupled receptor 177 (GPR177) in A-fiber neurons drives DNP via WNT5a-mediated activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) ion channel. GPR177 is mainly expressed in large-diameter A-fiber dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and required for the development of DNP in mice. Mechanistically, we found that GPR177 mediated the secretion of WNT5a from A-fiber DRG neurons into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was necessary for the maintenance of DNP. Extracellular perfusion of WNT5a induced rapid currents in both TRPV1-expressing heterologous cells and nociceptive DRG neurons. Computer simulations revealed that WNT5a has the potential to bind the residues at the extracellular S5-S6 loop of TRPV1. Using a peptide able to disrupt the predicted WNT5a/TRPV1 interaction suppressed DNP- and WNT5a-induced neuropathic pain symptoms in rodents. We confirmed GPR177/WNT5A coexpression in human DRG neurons and WNT5A secretion in CSF from patients with DNP. Thus, our results reveal a role for WNT5a as an endogenous and potent TRPV1 agonist, and the GPR177-WNT5a-TRPV1 axis as a driver of DNP pathogenesis in rodents. Our findings identified a potential analgesic target that might relieve neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes. Description GPR177 in A-fiber sensory neurons mediates the secretion of WNT5a, which activates TRPV1 and drives diabetic neuropathic pain in mice. A path toward diabetic pain relief Individuals with diabetes often suffer from chronic diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). The mechanisms mediating the development of DNP are not completely elucidated. Now, Xie et al. reported that the orphan G protein\u2013coupled receptor GPR177 expressed in A-fiber dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is required for the development of DNP in mice. Activation of GRP177 resulted in WNT5a release and subsequent activation of the TRPV1 ion channel. Pharmacological blockade of the interaction between WNT5a and TRPV1 eliminated DNP in rodents. In subjects with DNP, WNT5A secretion in CSF was increased compared with diabetic patients without DNP, suggesting that the GPR177-WNT5A-TRPV1 pathway could be a potential target for treating DNP in diabetic individuals.",

        "title": "Wnt5a/Ryk signaling contributes to bone cancer pain by sensitizing the peripheral nociceptors through JNK-mediated TRPV1 pathway in rats.",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nTreating bone cancer pain (BCP) continues to be a clinical challenge, and the underlying mechanisms of BCP remain elusive. This study reports that Wnt5a/Ryk signaling in the dorsal root ganglion neurons is critical to the development of BCP. Tibia bone cavity tumor cell implantation produces spontaneous and evoked behaviorally expressed pain as well as ectopic sprouting and activity of Wnt5a/Ryk signaling in the neural soma and peripheral terminals and the tumor-affected bone tissues. Intraplantar, intratibial, or intrathecal injection of Wnt5a/Ryk signaling blockers significantly suppresses the painful symptoms. Peripheral injection of exogenous Wnt5a in na\u00efve rats produces pain, and the dorsal root ganglion neurons become more sensitive to Wnt5a. Wnt5a/Ryk signaling activation increases intracellular calcium response and expression of transient receptors potential vanilloid type-1 and regulates capsaicin-induced intracellular calcium response. Blocking Ryk receptor activation suppresses Wnt5a-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Wnt5a facilitation of transient receptors potential vanilloid type-1 sensitization is blocked by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. These findings indicate a critical peripheral mechanism of Wnt5a/Ryk signaling underlying the pathogenesis of BCP and suggest that targeting Wnt5a/Ryk in the primary sensory neurons and the tumor-invasive area may be an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of BCP.",
