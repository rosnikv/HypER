        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 dosage regimens of lyophilized certolizumab pegol (a novel PEGylated anti-tumor necrosis factor agent) as adjunctive therapy to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an inadequate response to MTX therapy alone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this 52-week, phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 982 patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive treatment with subcutaneous certolizumab pegol at an initial dosage of 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2, and 4, with a subsequent dosage of 200 mg or 400 mg given every 2 weeks, plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX. Co-primary end points were the response rate at week 24 according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% criteria for improvement (ACR20) and the mean change from baseline in the modified total Sharp score at week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 24, ACR20 response rates using nonresponder imputation for the certolizumab pegol 200-mg and 400-mg groups were 58.8% and 60.8%, respectively, as compared with 13.6% for the placebo group. Differences in ACR20 response rates versus placebo were significant at week 1 and were sustained to week 52 (P < 0.001). At week 52, mean radiographic progression from baseline was reduced in patients treated with certolizumab pegol 200 mg (0.4 Sharp units) or 400 mg (0.2 Sharp units) as compared with that in placebo-treated patients (2.8 Sharp units) (P < 0.001 by rank analysis). Improvements in all ACR core set of disease activity measures, including physical function, were observed by week 1 with both certolizumab pegol dosage regimens. Most adverse events were mild or moderate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with certolizumab pegol 200 or 400 mg plus MTX resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in RA signs and symptoms, inhibited the progression of structural joint damage, and improved physical function as compared with placebo plus MTX treatment in RA patients with an incomplete response to MTX.",

        "title": "How tumour necrosis factor blockers interfere with tuberculosis immunity",
        "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immunity to numerous bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept are anti\u2010TNF agents used to treat a range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The use of some of these drugs has been linked to reactivation TB. In addition to blocking TNF\u2010mediated immune responses, some anti\u2010TNF drugs have been found to interfere with innate immune responses, such as phagolysosomal maturation and monocyte apoptosis, as well as cell\u2010mediated responses, including interferon\u2010\u03b3 secretion by memory T cells, complement\u2010mediated lysis of Mtb\u2010reactive CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cell activity. This review summarizes some of the reported effects of TNF blockers on immune cell responses in the context of the observed clinical data on TB reactivation in patients on anti\u2010TNF therapy.",

        "title": "Incidence of Tuberculosis Among Korean Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis Who Are Taking Tumor Necrosis Factor Blockers",
        "abstract": "Objective. To assess the incidence and relative risk of new tuberculosis (TB) infections in Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and patients with AS who are undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Methods. New cases of TB were identified by reviewing the medical records of 919 patients with AS not treated with TNF blockers and those of 354 patients with AS treated with adalimumab (n = 66), infliximab (n = 78), or etanercept (n = 210) between 2002 and 2009. Reference data were obtained from the Korean National Tuberculosis Association. Results. The mean incidence rate of TB was 69.8 per 100,000 person-years (PY) in the general population, 308 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, and 561 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort. The incidence rate of TB in the infliximab-treated AS cohort (540 per 100,000 PY) was higher than that in the adalimumab-treated AS cohort (490 per 100,000 PY). No cases of TB occurred in the etanercept-treated AS cohort. Comparing the relative risks of TB infections between the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort and the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, no statistically significant difference was identified (risk ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.144\u20131.913). Conclusion. The risk of TB was higher in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort than it was in the general population. However, the risk of TB was not increased in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort compared with the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort. Among patients with AS, etanercept is associated with a lower risk of TB compared with monoclonal antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Background Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The objective of the present study was to determine the rate of active TB infection in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and to determine the results of their latent TB infection (LTBI) screening tests during the follow up. Methods This is a retrospective observational study of IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. Tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA), and chest radiography were used to determine LTBI. Active TB infection rate during anti-TNF treatment was determined. Results Seventy-six IBD patients (25 with ulcerative colitis, 51 with Crohn\u2019s disease; 53 male; mean age 42.0\u00b112.4 years) were included. Forty-four (57.9%) patients received infliximab and 32 (42.1%) adalimumab. Their median duration of anti-TNF therapy was 15 months. Forty-five (59.2%) patients had LTBI and received isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis. During the follow-up period, active TB was identified in 3 (4.7%) patients who were not receiving INH prophylaxis. There was a moderate concordance between the TST and the IGRA (kappa coefficient 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.76). Patients with or without immunosuppressive therapy did not differ significantly with respect to TST (P=0.318) and IGRA (P=0.157). Conclusion IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and prophylactic INH have a decreased risk of developing active TB infection. However, despite LTBI screening, the risk of developing active TB infection persists.",
