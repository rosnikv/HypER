        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been associated with substantial adverse health outcomes for both mothers and offspring, few modifiable risk factors for GDM have been identified.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study among women in the Nurses' Health Study II to assess whether the amount, type, and intensity of pregravid physical activity and sedentary behaviors are associated with GDM risk. The analysis included 21,765 women who reported at least 1 singleton pregnancy between 1990 and 1998. Physical activity and sedentary behaviors were assessed through validated questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe documented 1428 incident GDM cases. After controlling for body mass index, dietary factors, and other covariates, there was a significant inverse association between vigorous activity and the risk of GDM. The multivariate relative risk (RR) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of vigorous activity was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.94) (P = .002 for trend). Among women who did not perform vigorous activity, brisk walking pace was associated with significantly lower GDM risk (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95) compared with an easy pace. Women who spent 20 h/wk or more watching television but did not perform vigorous activity had a significantly higher GDM risk than women who spent less than 2 h/wk watching television and were physically active (multivariate RR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.06-4.97).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur prospective study provides strong evidence that regular physical activity before pregnancy is associated with lower GDM risk.",

        "title": "The role of exercise in the prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus",
        "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes first diagnosed during pregnancy, usually between 24 and 28 weeks. Currently, management for women with GDM consists of medical nutrition therapy with adjunctive exercise for at least 30 minutes/day. Patients who fail to maintain glycemic goals through diet and exercise therapy are given insulin injections. Several epidemiological studies have suggested a robust link between physical activity and reduced risk of GDM; however, researchers have been unable to suggest a cost-effective, easily accessible, evidence-based program with guidelines for frequency, intensity, duration, and type of activity to prevent the incidence of GDM in sedentary, at-risk populations. True effectiveness of specific structured exercise programs remains untapped in GDM prevention and treatment and many well-controlled exercise studies are warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRegular physical activity is an important component of a health pregnancy. Being physically active during pregnancy often creates uncertainty and leads to numerous questions: How much and which kind of sports is possible? In pregnant woman a lot of physiological changes are taking place in haemodynamics, in the respiratory system, in the muculoskeletal system, in the glucose metabolism, and in further endocrinological feedback systems besides the psyche and bring about changes in fitness and physical performance.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThere is evidence that the most active women show the lowest prevalence for gestational diabetes (GDM) and, moreover a lower incidence for obesity and diabetes in both mother and child. Physically active women rarely develop not only GDM but also pre-eclampsia. The protective effect of physical activity can be explained by an enhanced placental growth and vascularity, by decreased oxidative stress, reduced inflammation and an adaption of the disease-related endothelial dysfunction. Maternal obesity increases the frequencies of infertility and miscarriage. Weight loss programmes with nutritional advice and activity counsellings represent a cost-effective infertility treatment. Moreover the possibility of health problems during pregnancy are limited thereby. A high degree of fitness before pregnancy and regular physical activity before conception can prevent the excessive weight gain during pregnancy and influence the weight at the very best.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConsidering common recommendations for training, as well as careful measures and contraindications, a moderate individual training to maintain physical and psychic fitness is desirable. Many kinds of sports like jogging, nordic walking, swimming and cycling, for example, can be carried out in a pregnancy without any risks and furthermore promote the health of the future mother and child.",
