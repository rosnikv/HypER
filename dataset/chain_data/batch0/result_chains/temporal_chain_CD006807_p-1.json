        "title": "Laparascopic cholecystectomy: cystic duct occlusion with titanium clips or ligature? A prospective randomized study.",
        "abstract": "During laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), cystic duct occlusion can be done with titanium clips or laparoscopically tied knots. However, till date, there is no randomized, controlled study reported in the literature that has prospectively compared the outcome using either of these methods. In the present study, 105 patients who were to undergo LC were randomly assigned to two groups. Group I comprised patients undergoing cystic duct occlusion with clips while group II comprised those undergoing cystic duct occlusion with knots. Our aim was to compare the postoperative outcome in both the cases. The incidence of overall bile leak following LC was 4 out of 105 (3.8%) while the leak rate following cystic duct occlusion with clips was 2 out 52 (3.9%), and that following ligature was 2 out of 53 (3.8%). The procedure using ligature took slightly longer time than that using clips. There was no significant difference in the postoperative outcome in either group. The use of ligature is a feasible, safe and cost-effective alternative to the use of titanium clips for cystic duct occlusion during LC.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo describe a series of patients who have had cystic duct stump leaks (CDSLs) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to compare the current presentation and management with that in previous studies.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwo-institution retrospective case series and review of the previously published literature.\n\n\nSETTING\nTwo teaching hospitals.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nTwelve patients who had CDSLs of 5751 patients who underwent total laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSymptoms at presentation, laboratory values, imaging modalities, treatment modalities, and operative indications and techniques.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween January 1, 1998, and March 31, 2007, 12 patients (0.21%) developed CDSLs a mean of 2.3 days postoperatively. Five patients (42%) were reported to have abnormal cystic ducts. A mean of 3 surgical clips were used for closure. Abdominal pain (58%) was the most common presenting symptom; 9 patients (75%) had an elevated white blood cell count, and 9 (75%) had abnormal liver function test results. Ten patients (83%) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and 8 (67%) were definitively treated with ERCP stenting of the common bile duct. Two patients (17%) required adjunctive computed tomography-guided drainage. There was 1 death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA CDSL can occur for a variety of reasons. Any patient with a postoperative picture consistent with a bile leak should undergo ERCP. If a CDSL is discovered, the common bile duct should be stented. Computed tomography-guided drainage is indicated if the patient does not improve after ERCP. Operative intervention should be reserved for the most serious of circumstances.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the pattern of post-operative bile duct injuries and their subsequent endoscopic management.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe prospective, non-randomised, cross-sectional study was conducted at the endoscopic suite of Surgical Unit-IV of the Civil Hospital, Karachi, over a period of three years. A total of 97 patients were included in the study. Post-procedure patients were followed up for resolution of symptoms and cessation of the bile leak. Patients with complete biliary cutoff or transection on Endoscopic Retrograde Cholaugio-Paucreatography (ERCP) were advised Magnetic Resonance Cholaugio-Papereatography (MRCP). Average followup of patients in our study was for 3 months. Mann Whitney U test was applied for non-parameteric data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of 97 patients in the study, 82 (84.5%) presented with post-operative bile leakage and 15 (15.5%) with obstructive jaundice. The age of the study population ranged between 20-70 years with a mean age of 40.80 +/- 13.45 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1:3. ERCP findings in our study included 41 (42.26%) patients with bile leakage out of which 27 (27.8%) had high-grade leak and 5 (5.1%) had low-grade leak, while 9 (9.3%) patients had Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones. Among the patients, 39 (40.2%) had complete cutoff of CBD. There were 15 patients with strictures and 6 with normal ERCP. As for the bile leads, 36/41 (87.8%) patients were managed successfully by endoscopic stenting, stone removal or simple sphincterotomy. Of the 41 patients, 5 (12.2%) with bile leak developed biliary stricture on subsequent ERCP. Nine of the 15 patients (60%) with complete cutoff on initial endoscopy were successfully stented on subsequent ERCP after demonstration of biliary continuity on MRCP. Six (40%) patients were referred for surgery.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with postoperative biliary leaks fare much better than those with complete cutoff or strictures. MRCP should be done in all patients where ERCP shows loss of biliary continuity. Re-exploration should be deferred till all other non-invasive modalities have been tried.",

        "abstract": "Background and study aims: A study was undertaken to describe the management of post-cholecystectomy biliary fistula according to the type of cholecystectomy. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of 111 patients was undertaken. They were divided into open cholecystectomy (OC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) groups. Results: Of the 111 patients, 38 (34.2\u200a%) underwent LC and 73 (65.8\u200a%) underwent OC. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) diagnosed major bile duct injury (BDI) in 27 patients (38.6\u200a%) in the OC group and in 3 patients (7.9\u200a%) in the LC group (P\u200a=\u200a0.001). Endoscopic management was not feasible in 15 patients (13.5\u200a%) because of failed cannulation (n\u200a=\u200a3) or complete ligation of the common bile duct (n\u200a=\u200a12). Endoscopic therapy stopped leakage in 35 patients (92.1\u200a%) and 58 patients (82.9\u200a%) following LC and OC, respectively, after the exclusion of 3 patients in whom cannulation failed (P\u200a=\u200a0 0.150). Major BDI was more commonly detected after OC (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Leakage was controlled endoscopically in 77 patients (98.7\u200a%) with minor BDI and in 16 patients (53.3\u200a%) with major BDI (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Conclusions: Major BDI is more common in patients presenting with bile leakage after OC. ERCP is the first-choice treatment for minor BDI. Surgery plays an important role in major BDI. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogrphy (MRCP) should be used before ERCP in patients with bile leakage following OC or converted LC.",

This study was planned to compare early LC versus late LC. Patients and Methods: This is a prospective randomized study on patients who are presented with concomitant gallbladder and common bile duct stone. The study population was divided into two groups; group (A) managed by early LC within three days after ERCP; and group (B) managed by late LC one month after ERCP. Results: No significant difference between both groups as regards the conversion rate, the degree of adhesion, cystic duct diameter, and intraoperative common bile duct injury or bleeding. Recurrent biliary symptoms were significantly more in delayed LC group in 7 (12.71%) patient versus 1 patient in early LC (P=0.03). Conclusions: No significant difference between both groups as regards the conversion rate. Recurrent biliary symptoms were significantly more in delayed LC while waiting LC.

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Recurrence of primary common bile duct (CBD) stone commonly occurs after complete removal of CBD stones in patients with cholecystectomy. This study aimed to investigate potential risk factors for the recurrence of primary CBD stones after endoscopic treatment. Materials and methods: Between January 2005 and December 2015, the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) database of our medical center was retrospectively reviewed; information regarding eligible patients who had recurrent CBD stones with a history of previous cholecystectomy was collected. The characteristics of the patients, CBD stone, CBD and ERCP-related factors were analyzed. Results: The recurrence rate of CBD stone was 18.5% (115/622) after endoscopic treatment in patients with cholecystectomy. In univariate analysis, the number of CBD stones (\u22652), CBD stone diameter (\u226510\u2009mm), stone composition, stone consistency, CBD diameter (\u226515\u2009mm), bile duct dilatation pattern, sharp bile duct angulation (<145\u00b0), balloon dilatation, large balloon (>12\u2009mm) dilatation, endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy, endoscopic sphincterotomy, and endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation alone method were significant between the non-recurrence and recurrence groups. However, in multivariate analysis (based on the binary logistic regression method), the number of CBD stones (\u22652) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.232; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.344\u20137.773; p\u2009=\u2009.009), cholesterol stone (AOR 2.824; 95% CI 1.175\u20136.786; p\u2009=.02) and sharp bile duct angulation (<145\u00b0) (AOR 2.462; 95% CI 1.062\u20135.711; p\u2009=\u2009.036) were independent risk factors of CBD stone recurrence after cholecystectomy. Conclusions: CBD stone number (\u22652), cholesterol stone and sharp bile duct angulation (<145\u00b0) are associated with recurrent common bile duct stones after cholecystectomy.",

        "abstract": "Objective Common bile duct stone (CBDS) recurrence is associated with bile microbial structure. This study explored the structure of bile microbiome in patients with recurrent CBDS, and its relationship with the recurrence of CBDS. Methods Patients with recurrent CBDS (recurrence group) and controls without CBDS (control group) requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were prospectively included. The control group was noncholelithiasis patients, mainly including benign and malignant biliary stenosis. Bile samples were collected, and bile microbiome structure was analyzed by the 16S rRNA encoding gene (V3\u2013V4). Results A total of 27 patients in the recurrence group and 19 patients in the control group were included. The diversity of bile microbiome in the recurrence group was significantly lower than that in the control group (Shannon index: 2.285 vs. 5.612, P = 0.001). In terms of bile microbial distribution, patients with recurrent CBDS had significantly higher Proteobacteria (86.72% vs. 64.92%, P = 0.037), while Bacteroidetes (3.16% vs. 8.53%, P = 0.001) and Actinobacteria (0.29% vs. 6.74%, P = 0.001) are significantly lower compared with the control group at the phylum level. At the genus level, the recurrence group was mainly the Escherichia, and there was a variety of more evenly distributed microbiome in the control group, with significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion The diversity of bile microbiome in patients with recurrent CBDS is lower. Patients with recurrent CBDS may have bile microbial imbalance, which may be related to the repeated formation of CBDS.",

        "abstract": "Background Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) is a epidemiologically significant food-borne parasite, causing several hepatobiliary diseases. Biliary microbiota community structure might be influenced by infection with pathogens. However, the biliary microbiome of biliary obstruction patients infected with C. sinensis is still an unexplored aspect. Methods A total of 50 biliary obstruction patients were enrolled, including 24 infected with C. sinensis and 26 non-infected subjects. The bile samples were collected by Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography. Biliary microbiota alteration was analyzed through high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Results Our findings revealed that there was significant increase in both richness and diversity, as well as changes in the taxonomic composition of the biliary microbiota of C. sinensis infected patients. At the phylum level, C. sinensis infection induced Proteobacteria increased and Firmicutes reduced. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus increased significantly, while Enterococcus decreased prominently in infected groups (P < 0.05). The PICRUSt analysis further showed remarkably different metabolic pathways between the two groups. Conclusion C. sinensis infection could modify the biliary microbiota, increasing the abundance and changing the phylogenetic composition of bacterial in biliary obstruction patients. This study may help deepen the understanding of the host-biliary microbiota interplay with C. sinensis infection on the background of biliary obstruction and provide new insights into understanding the pathogenesis of clonorchiasis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Clonorchis sinensis is a zoonotic liver fluke that inhabits the bile ducts of the human liver for prolonged periods, leading to cholangiocarcinoma. Recent research indicates associations between altered biliary microbiota and bile duct disorders. However, the impacts of C. sinensis infection on bile duct epithelium and subsequent effects on biliary microbiota remain unknown. Methods: Feline bile duct samples were collected from both uninfected and C. sinensis-infected cats. Histopathological examination was performed to assess epithelial changes, fibrosis, mucin and cell proliferation using hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, biliary microbiota composition was analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the microbial diversity and relative abundance between infected and uninfected samples. Results: Histopathological analysis of infected feline bile ducts revealed prominent epithelial hyperplasia characterized by increased cell proliferation. Moreover, periductal fibrosis and collagen fibrosis were observed in infected samples compared to uninfected controls. Biliary microbial richness decreased with disease progression compared to uninfected controls. Streptococcus abundance positively correlated with disease severity, dominating communities in cancer samples. Predictive functional analysis suggested that C. sinensis may promote bile duct lesions by increasing microbial genes for carbohydrate metabolism, replication, and repair. Conclusions: This study provides comprehensive insights into the pathological effects of C. sinensis infection on feline bile duct epithelium and its influence on biliary microbiota composition. These novel findings provide insight into C. sinensis pathogenesis and could inform therapeutic development against human clonorchiasis. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these changes and their implications for host-parasite interactions.",
