        "abstract": "Objective To define the cardiovascular effects of lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease. Design Collaborative prospective meta-analysis of randomised trials. Data sources and eligibility Participating randomised trials of drugs to lower blood pressure compared with placebo or each other or that compare different blood pressure targets, with at least 1000 patient years of follow-up per arm. Main outcome measures Major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) in composite and individually and all cause death. Participants 26 trials (152\u2009290 participants), including 30\u2009295 individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Data extraction Individual participant data were available for 23 trials, with summary data from another three. Meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated with a random effects model. Results Compared with placebo, blood pressure lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced eGFR (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P=1.00 for homogeneity). The results were similar irrespective of whether blood pressure was reduced by regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics/\u03b2 blockers. There was no evidence that the effects of different drug classes on major cardiovascular events varied between patients with different eGFR (all P>0.60 for homogeneity). Conclusions Blood pressure lowering is an effective strategy for preventing cardiovascular events among people with moderately reduced eGFR. There is little evidence from these overviews to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease.",

        "abstract": "Background Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin\u2013angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. Methods The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke. Results The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.",

Design Population based cohort study using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting UK primary care, 1997-2014. Participants Patients starting treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (n=122\u2009363). Main outcome measures Poisson regression was used to compare rates of end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death among patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more after starting treatment against those without such increases, and for each 10% increase in creatinine. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of other antihypertensive drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Results Among the 2078 (1.7%) patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more, a higher proportion were female, were elderly, had cardiorenal comorbidity, and used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop diuretics, or potassium sparing diuretics. Creatinine increases of 30% or more were associated with an increased adjusted incidence rate ratio for all outcomes, compared with increases of less than 30%: 3.43 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 4.91) for end stage renal disease, 1.46 (1.16 to 1.84) for myocardial infarction, 1.37 (1.14 to 1.65) for heart failure, and 1.84 (1.65 to 2.05) for death. The detailed categorisation of increases in creatinine concentrations (<10%, 10-19%, 20-29%, 30-39%, and \u226540%) showed a graduated relation for all outcomes (all P values for trends <0.001). Notably, creatinine increases of less than 30% were also associated with increased incidence rate ratios for all outcomes, including death (1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) for increases of 10-19% and 1.35 (1.23 to 1.49) for increases of 20-29%, using <10% as reference). Results were consistent across calendar periods, across subgroups of patients, and among continuing users. Conclusions Increases in creatinine after the start of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment were associated with adverse cardiorenal outcomes in a graduated relation, even below the guideline recommended threshold of a 30% increase for stopping treatment.",

        "abstract": "Discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is recommended if patients experience \u226530% acute increase in serum creatinine after starting this therapy. However, the long-term effects of its continuation or discontinuation on major clinical outcomes after increases in serum creatinine are unclear. In the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation), 11\u2009140 diabetes mellitus patients were randomly assigned to perindopril-indapamide or placebo after a 6-week active run-in period. The current study included 11\u2009066 participants with 2 serum creatinine measurements recorded before and during the active run-in period (3 weeks apart). Acute increase in creatinine was determined using these 2 measurements and classified into 4 groups: increases in serum creatinine of <10%, 10% to 19%, 20% to 29%, and \u226530%. The primary study outcome was the composite of major macrovascular events, new or worsening nephropathy, and all-cause mortality. An acute increase in serum creatinine was associated with an elevated risk of the primary outcome (P for trend <0.001). The hazard ratios were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97\u20131.28) for those with an increase of 10% to 19%, 1.34 (1.07\u20131.66) for 20% to 29%, and 1.44 (1.15\u20131.81) for \u226530%, compared with <10%. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the benefit of randomized treatment effects on the outcome across subgroups defined by acute serum creatinine increase (P for heterogeneity=0.94). Acute increases in serum creatinine after starting perindopril-indapamide were associated with greater risks of subsequent major clinical outcomes. However, the continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy reduced the long-term risk of major clinical outcomes, irrespective of acute increase in creatinine.

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Lowering blood pressure (BP) can lead to an initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). However, there is debate how much eGFR decline is acceptable. We performed a post hoc analysis of ACCORD-BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure) and SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which randomized patients to intensive or standard systolic BP-targets. We determined the relation between initial decline in mean arterial pressure and eGFR. Subsequently, we stratified patients to BP-target and initial eGFR decrease and assessed the relation with annual eGFR decline after 1 year. A total of 13 266 patients with 41 126 eGFR measurements were analyzed. Up to 10 mm Hg of BP-lowering, eGFR did not change. Hereafter, there was a linear decrease of 3.4% eGFR (95% CI, 2.9%\u20133.9%) per 10 mm Hg mean arterial pressure decrease. The observed eGFR decline based on 95% of the subjects varied from 26% after 0 mm Hg to 46% with a 40 mm Hg mean arterial pressure decrease. There was no difference in eGFR slope (P=0.37) according to initial eGFR decline and BP-target, with a decrease of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.09\u20131.39), 1.20 (95% CI, 0.97\u20131.43), and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.77\u20131.50) in the 5%, 5% to 20%, and >20% stratum during intensive and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.81\u20131.09), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.97\u20131.49), and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.65\u20131.69) mL/minute per 1.73 m2 per year during standard treatment. In patients at high cardiovascular risk with and without diabetes mellitus, we found no association between initial eGFR and annual eGFR decline during BP-lowering treatment. Our results support that an eGFR decrease up to 20% after BP lowering can be accepted and suggest that the limit can be extended up to 46% depending on the achieved BP reduction.

        "abstract": "Importance\nCardiovascular trials have traditionally been underpowered to assess advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) outcomes, and when included as a secondary end point, trials have used progression of CKD as incidence of some variation of a composite of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) outcomes. Such outcomes are infrequent or occur late in cardiovascular outcome trials, which highlights the need for alternate markers for assessing the impact of interventions on kidney function at an earlier stage of the disease and, from the prevention perspective, more relevant stage of the disease.\n\n\nObservations\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope has demonstrated strong association with subsequent progression to ESKD. With adequate sample size, treatment effects in the range of 0.5 to 1.00 mL/min/1.73 m2/y had 96% probability of predicting CKD progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine, eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or ESKD. eGFR slope can be used in patients with higher baseline values and may provide CKD progression insights when few hard kidney events are observed, especially in trials with limited follow-up. However, among trials that have determined eGFR slope, significant variations exist regarding inclusion of baseline values, calculation of eGFR values, and the follow-up period, which make it difficult to compare and gauge the incremental benefit of the interventions. There are multiple challenges in computing eGFR slope in cardiovascular trials, such as accounting for initial eGFR dip, nonlinearity, and heteroscedasticity.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\neGFR slope may serve as a valuable marker to determine progression of CKD in cardiovascular trials. Further work is required to standardize data collection, follow-up duration, time points for kidney function assessment, and analytic methods to compute eGFR slope in cardiovascular trials.",

We also examined poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), frailty, and worsening HF (WHF), defined as HF hospitalization, emergency department visit, or outpatient intensification of therapy between baseline and 8-month follow-up.\n\n\nANALYTICAL APPROACH\nFine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models and Cox proportional hazard models regressed clinical outcomes on baseline eGFRdiffcysC-sCr. Logistic regression investigated the association of baseline eGFRdiffcysC-sCr with poor HRQoL and frailty. Linear regression models assessed the association of WHF with eGFRcysC, eGFRsCr, and eGFRdiffcysC-sCr at an 8-month follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline eGFRdiffcysC-sCr was >+10 and <-10 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 13.0% and 35.7% of the patients, respectively.
