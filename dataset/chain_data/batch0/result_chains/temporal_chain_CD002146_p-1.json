        "title": "Effect of two different therapeutic approaches on total and cardiovascular mortality in a Cardiovascular Study in the Elderly (CASTEL).",
        "abstract": "Although limited numbers of elderly subjects have occasionally been included in population-based studies, only a few studies have been conducted specifically on elderly hypertensives, and practically none at a population level. We studied 655 hypertensive subjects from a cohort of 2,254 elderly subjects. The intervention consisted of the creation of a Hypertension Outpatients' Clinic under our auspices but with complete co-operation from general practitioners, randomizing the identified hypertensive patients into pre-established therapeutic drug regimens, and early follow-up recording of mortality for 7 years. The drugs used were clonidine (n = 61), nifedipine (n = 146) and the fixed combination of atenolol+chlorthalidone (n = 144); 304 subjects underwent \"free therapy\" by their personal physicians without any special intervention. There were 1,404 normotensive subjects. Overall 7-year follow-up mortality was 34.9% in the hypertensive subjects receiving \"free therapy\", 22.5% in those receiving \"special care\", and 24.2% in the normotensives. Cardiovascular mortality was respectively 23.7%, 12.2%, and 12.0%. Overall and cardiovascular annual cumulative mortality were significantly lower in the << special therapy >> than in the << free therapy >> group. The fixed combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone reduced mortality below that of the normotensives, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Background \nElderly persons have higher prevalences of hypertension than younger and middle-aged persons and elders with hypertension have a much higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than middle-aged persons with hypertension. Despite the higher prevalence and risk in older persons, most early randomized controlled trials evaluating antihypertensive drug therapy were conducted in middle-aged persons. Since 1985, multiple large trials have been published, and several meta-analyses have summarized their results (Davidson 1987, Staessen 1988, Staessen 1990a, Staessen 1990b, Leonetti 1992, Thijs 1992, Celis 1993, MacMahon 1993, Thijs 1994, Pearce 1995). The purpose of this systematic review is to build on these prior published meta-analyses and provide a comprehensive overview of available trial evidence regarding long-term benefits and harms of antihypertensive drug therapy in elders. \n \nObjectives \nTo quantify the long-term effects of antihypertensive drug therapy on morbidity and mortality in the elderly. To characterize co morbid risk profiles of trial participants. \n \nSearch strategy \nElectronic search of WHO-ISH Collaboration register (August 1997), The Cochrane Library (1997; Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to April 1997) and two Japanese databases (1973-1995); references from reviews, trials and 10 previously published meta-analyses; and experts. \n \nSelection criteria \nRandomized controlled trials of at least one year duration in hypertensive elders (at least 60 years old) assessing antihypertensive drug therapy and providing morbidity and mortality data. \n \nData collection and analysis \nAt least two independent reviewers abstracted data on morbidity and mortality results and trial characteristics. The following outcomes were assessed: total mortality; coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality; combined CHD morbidity and mortality; cerebrovascular mortality; combined cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; cardiovascular mortality; combined cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; and drop outs due to side effects of treatment. \n \nMain results \nFifteen trials including 21,908 elderly subjects were identified. The average prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and competing co morbid diseases was lower among trial participants than the general population of hypertensive elderly persons. Most subjects were 60 to 80 years old. Most trials were conducted in Western, industrialized countries and evaluated diuretic and beta-blocker therapies. Event rates per 1000 participants over approximately 5 years indicated that antihypertensive drug therapy was beneficial. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reduced from 177 to 126 events (95% CI of the difference 31 to 73). Cardiovascular mortality was reduced from 69 to 50 deaths (95% CI of the difference 9 to 31). Total mortality was reduced from 129 to 111 deaths (95% CI of difference 4 to 28). The data from the three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension indicated a significant benefit: cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over approximately 5 years was reduced from 157 to 104 events per 1000 participants (95% CI of the difference 12 to 89). Numbers of participants who dropped out of trials secondary to adverse drug effects were often not reported. The four trials that did report this data showed a wide variation in drop out rates ranging from no significant differences between treatment and control groups to as many as one out of four patients dropping out due to side effects of treatment. \n \nAuthors' conclusions \nRandomized controlled trials establish that treating healthy older persons with hypertension is highly efficacious. Benefits of treatment with low dose diuretics or beta-blockers are clear for persons in their 60s to 70s with either diastolic or systolic hypertension. Differential treatment effects based on patient risk factors, pre-existing cardiovascular disease and competing co-morbidities could not be established from the published trial data.",

        "title": "Appropriate Drug Prescribing for Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in persons older than 65 years. Hospitalizations due to heart failure have doubled over the past 20 years. Two thirds of myocardial infarcts occur in patients older than 65 [1]. Many articles have been published on appropriate use of drug therapy in the elderly, and the underuse of potentially beneficial therapy has been targeted as an area for improvement. However, evidencebased practice is a challenge when there are inadequate data or exclusion of the elderly from research trials [2]. Gurwitz et al [3] found that 60% of individuals aged 75 and older were excluded from therapeutic trials for acute myocardial infarction [3]. There is also a growing interest in employing cost-effective therapies, particularly with a rapidly aging population. We conducted a systematic literature search to examine pharmaceutical use and appropriate pharmacomanagement of common cardiac conditions in the elderly. Studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE database and Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials for articles published through November 1999. Search terms included adrenergic-\u03b2 antagonists and aged, congestive heart failure and aged, hypertension and aged, hypercholesterolemia and statins and fibrates and aged. Only trials looking at morbidity and mortality were selected. References were also handsearched for additional relevant articles.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the appropriate use of drug therapy in the elderly for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. It is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it aims to provide evidence-based practice for treating hypertension in the elderly, which was the focus of the source paper. Therefore, it uses the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis."
