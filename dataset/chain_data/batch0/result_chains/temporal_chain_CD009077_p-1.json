They claim that a randomized study with a larger number of patients could provide better information. Additionally, they ask for further risk stratification, taking into account the contribution of his group on this matter. Finally, a number of reasons are given in an attempt to justify the use of amiodarone as opposed to \u03b2-blockers in this scenario.\n\nWe agree that only a large multicenter randomized trial could provide \u2026",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the effects of \u03b2-blockers on patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, which is related to the source paper's focus on carvedilol, a \u03b2-blocker, in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. The paper's findings on the potential benefits of \u03b2-blockers in this context are partially dependent on the source paper's results."
