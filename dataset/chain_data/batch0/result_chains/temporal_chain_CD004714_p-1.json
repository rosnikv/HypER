        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nThe AIM of this study was to evaluate the effect of non-surgical therapy on clinical variables and glycemic control on type 2 diabetics with chronic periodontitis.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nForty six type 2 diabetics with chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups (group A and group B). Treatment included scaling and root planning for group A plus systematic use of doxycycline in both groups. Assessment was made prior to and 16 weeks following the therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of data showed that both groups had clinical and glycated hemoglobin (HbAlc) improvement after the treatment. Group A had a statistically significant reduction of plaque index and bleeding on probing scores compared with controls (P < 0.05) at 16 weeks.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that non-surgical therapy is of value in maintaining periodontal health and may be beneficial in reducing blood glucose level in type 2 diabetics with chronic periodontitis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe literature contains few studies regarding the relationships between receipt of regular dental care and medical outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors compared hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) levels (< 7 percent versus < 7 percent), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (< 100 milligrams/deciliter versus \u2265 100 mg/dL) and diabetes-specific hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits (one or more visits versus no visits) in 493 people with type 2 diabetes who received regular dental care (\u2265 two prophylactic visits, periodontal treatment visits or both during a 12-month period) with measures in 493 people with type 2 diabetes who did not receive any dental care. The authors matched patients, all of whom had private medical and dental insurance benefits during the study period, with regard to age, sex and previous utilization of ED visits and hospital admissions, and they followed them for three years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe authors analyzed the data by using multiple logistic regression, which showed that receipt of regular dental care was associated with lower diabetes-specific ED utilization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.40-0.92) and hospital admissions (OR = 0.61, 95 percent CI, 0.39-0.95) after they adjusted for age, sex, previous hospital admissions, previous ED utilization, race, baseline HbA(1c) values, Charlson comorbidity index score, body mass index status, periodontal risk status and primary care utilization. The authors found no significant association between receipt of dental care and control of HbA(1c) levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe study results show an association between regular receipt of dental care and reduced diabetes-specific medical care utilization (that is, ED visits and hospital admissions).\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nAlthough the results of this study could not show causality, they suggest that receipt of dental care may reduce diabetes-specific health care utilization. Prospective studies are needed to better understand the relationship of receipt of dental care with diabetes control and health care utilization measures.",

        "title": "Association of Dental Care with Adherence to HEDIS Measures.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nThe dental setting represents an unrealized opportunity to increase adherence to preventive services and improve health outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare adherence to a subset of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures among a population that received dental care with a population that did not receive dental care.\n\n\nDESIGN\nUsing a retrospective cohort design, we identified 5216 adults who received regular dental care and 5216 persons who did not. The groups were matched on propensity scores, were followed for 3 years, and retained medical and dental benefits. Receipt of dental care was defined as 1 or more dental visits in each 12-month period.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nOutcome measures were assessed in a subpopulation that qualified for 1 of 5 HEDIS denominator groups (dental = 4184 patients; nondental = 3871 patients). They included 3 preventive measures (cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer screening), 4 chronic disease management services (hemoglobin A1c and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol testing, and nephropathy and retinopathy screening among the diabetes mellitus [DM] population), and 4 health outcome measures (poor glycemic control, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control, blood pressure control in the DM population, and blood pressure control in the hypertensive population).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDental care was associated with higher adherence to all three cancer screening measures, one of four disease management services (higher retinopathy screening), and three of four health outcomes (better glycemic control in the DM population and better blood pressure control in the DM and hypertensive populations).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDental care was associated with improved adherence to 7 of 11 HEDIS measures.",

        "abstract": "There is a remarkable phenomenon occurring among health professionals: the development of ongoing, routine collaboration, both in educating the next generation of providers and in delivering care. These new approaches, commonly referred to as interprofessional education and interprofessional collaborative practice, have been introduced into academic health settings and delivery systems throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world; however, the full integration of dentistry in health care teams remains unrealized. In academic settings, dentistry has found ways to collaborate with the other health professions, but most practicing dentists still find themselves on the margins of new models of care delivery. This article provides a perspective on the history and context of the evolution of collaborative approaches to health care and proposes ways in which dentistry can participate more fully in the future.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges and American Dental Education Association have identified oral health knowledge, skills, and attitudes shared by both medical and dental professionals. Although oral health was deemed an essential competency for medical practitioners, our state struggled to ensure learners received proper training. This training deficit resulted in conducting a needs assessment and implementing an oral health interprofessional module at our schools.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFirst-year medical students and clinical faculty were emailed surveys in 2016 to obtain baseline information. A team of faculty and students from the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry reviewed the curriculum to determine where to augment oral health content. An oral health module to teach a basic head, neck, and oral examination to first-year medical students during their patient-centered care small-group sessions was implemented and evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 13.6% of faculty respondents were aware of national oral health competency recommendations, and <50% rated oral health important for primary care physicians (PCPs) to include in history, physical exam, or oral health counseling. On baseline, \u226425% of PCP respondents reported integrating the listed skills in their practice, and most indicated lacking expertise to teach oral health. Teaching sessions were rated helpful by students and faculty. After the teaching sessions, ratings on the importance of including oral health significantly increased from baseline.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCollaboration between Schools of Dentistry and Medicine successfully integrated oral health into medical school curriculum and improved the tutors' attitudes of its importance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Oral health is essential to human health. Conditions associated with poor oral health involve all organ systems and many major disease categories including infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, cancer, and mental health. Outcomes are also associated with health equity. Medical education organizations including the Association of American Medical Colleges and National Academy of Medicine recommend that oral health be part of medical education. However, oral health is not traditionally included in many medical school, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner curricula. Several challenges explain this exclusion including lack of time, expertise, and prioritization; we therefore provide suggestions for integrating oral health education into the health professions school curriculum. These recommendations offer guidance for enhancing the oral health curriculum across institutions. We include key organizational and foundational steps, strategies to link oral health with existing content, and approaches to achieve curricular sustainability.",

        "abstract": "(1) Background/Objective: California has one of the highest rates of pediatric dental caries in the nation. One way to combat this problem is through non-dental provider training programs that focus on prevention. However, there are limited data on healthcare provider training program integration and evaluation of oral health curricula focused on prevention of early childhood caries. This study will assess the change in healthcare providers\u2019 attitudes, knowledge, and skills by implementing an interprofessional educational (IPE) oral health curriculum in medicine and nurse practitioner programs at one university in Southern California. (2) Methods: A mixed method design was employed using a pre- and post-educational survey, and end-of-program focus group interviews. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to assess group differences and thematic analyses for the focus groups. (3) Results: A total of 81 students (14 pediatric medicine residents, 18 pediatric, and 49 family nurse practitioners) completed the curriculum and surveys. Attitudes related to oral hygiene remained unchanged, with the nurse practitioner group showing improved clinical skills (all questions; p < 0.021). Knowledge scores significantly improved across all groups (paired t-test; p < 0.001). All focus groups expressed the helpfulness of the educational modules, the usefulness of the skills learned, and the benefits of IPE activities. (4) Conclusion: Healthcare providers showed improved oral health knowledge and clinical skills acquired through the oral health program and can serve as a model to educate across disciplines on the prevention of early childhood caries.",
