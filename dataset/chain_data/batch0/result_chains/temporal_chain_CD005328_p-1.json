        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether triamcinolone acetonide diffuses from the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) to the navicular bursa, diffusion is direct or systemic, and addition of sodium hyaluronan has an effect on diffusion in horses.\n\n\nANIMALS\n11 adult horses without forelimb lameness.\n\n\nPROCEDURES\n1 randomly chosen forelimb DIPJ of each horse received an injection of 10 mg of triamcinolone acetonide plus 20 mg of sodium hyaluronan (group 1), and the contralateral forelimb DIPJ received an injection of 10 mg of triamcinolone acetonide plus 2 mL of lactated Ringer's solution (group 2). Synovial fluid samples were taken from both forelimb navicular bursae and 1 hind limb navicular bursa (systemic control group) at 6 hours. Triamcinolone acetonide concentrations in synovial fluid were quantified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography plus tandem mass spectrometry. Data were logarithmically transformed, and contrast analysis was performed on the 3 groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTriamcinolone acetonide was detected in navicular bursal samples in all groups. Groups 1 and 2 had significantly greater concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide than the systemic control group. There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nTriamcinolone acetonide diffused directly from the DIPJ into the navicular bursa in clinically normal horses, and diffusion was not affected by addition of hyaluronan. Injection into the DIPJ with triamcinolone acetonide or a triamcinolone acetonide-hyaluronan combination can potentially be used for treatment of navicular syndrome, but further studies are needed to determine whether triamcinolone acetonide diffuses similarly in horses with navicular syndrome.",

        "title": "Steroid diffusion into the navicular bursa occurs in horses affected by palmar foot pain",
        "abstract": "Palmar foot pain is frequently treated by steroid injections into the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) in the anticipation that the steroid will diffuse to the navicular bursa and palmar foot structures. The object of this study was to determine if triamcinolone acetonide (TA) would in fact be able to locally diffuse from the DIPJ into the navicular bursa in horses affected by palmar foot pain. Both forelimb DIPJs (nine horses) were injected with 10\u2005mg of TA. Navicular bursa fluid samples, both forelimb and one hind limb (systemic control), were analysed for TA with high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) six hours later. Foot radiographs were graded (0\u20134) on severity of changes. Forelimb navicular bursa TA concentrations (mean\u00b1sd log10, 3.20\u00b10.56) were significantly higher than systemic control concentrations (mean\u00b1sd log10, 1.89\u00b10.3) (P<0.0001). Horses with a radiographic grade of >2 were four times as likely to have TA log10 concentrations less than 3.2 (158.49\u2005ng/ml). TA locally diffused from the DIPJ into the navicular bursa in horses affected by palmar foot pain; TA concentrations decreased as radiographic severity increased.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNavicular disease in the horse often requires injection of the navicular bursa. We have developed an ultrasound-guided, lateral needle approach to navicular bursocentesis, which avoids penetration of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) and the need for radiographic control.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe and evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an ultrasound-guided, lateral bursocentesis technique.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nCadaveric and in vivo experiments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe navicular bursa in 62 cadaveric forelimbs of 31 horses and in both forelimbs of 26 live horses, positioned with the foot flexed in a navicular block, were submitted to lateral, ultrasound-guided injection of 1.5 ml radiocontrast agent. Lateromedial radiographs were taken to locate the contrast. A second injection of 0.5 ml methylene blue was administered during needle withdrawal in cadaveric limbs to investigate the needle pathway during dissection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nContrast agent was successfully deposited in the navicular bursa in 104 of 114 (91%) limbs and in the navicular bursa alone in 89 of 114 (78%) limbs. Dissection showed no evidence of penetration of the DDFT in cadaver limbs. Failure to inject the navicular bursa was significantly associated with poor quality of the ultrasound image (P = 0.04) and resulted in aberrant injection of the distal interphalangeal joint in five of 114 (4%) limbs, the peribursal soft tissues in four of 114 (4%) limbs and the digital flexor tendon sheath in one of 114 (0.9%) limbs. Synovial fluid was observed at the needle hub in 58% of live horses.\n\n\nMAIN LIMITATIONS\nIt is unknown whether injection results obtained in the limbs of horses without disease can be extrapolated to horses with clinical disease of the podotrochlear apparatus. The localisation of contrast medium on radiographs may not accurately reflect the behaviour of local anaesthetic solution or therapeutic medications injected in the navicular bursa.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis lateral, ultrasound-guided technique for injecting the navicular bursa is effective, does not penetrate the DDFT and avoids exposure of personnel to radiation.",

        "title": "Communication between the distal interphalangeal joint and the navicular bursa in the horse at Computed Tomography Arthrography",
        "abstract": "Diffusion of drugs injected into the distal interphalangeal joint or the navicular (podotrochlear) bursa can influence diagnosis and treatment of foot pain. Previous anatomical and radiographic studies of the communication between these synovial structures have produced conflicting results and did not identify the location of any communication if present. This anatomic study aimed to assess the presence and site of communication between the distal interphalangeal joint and the navicular bursa in the horse by computed tomography arthrography. Sixty\u2010six pairs of cadaver forelimbs were injected with contrast medium into the distal interphalangeal joint and imaged by computed tomography arthrography. The presence of a communication, location of the communication and additional structural changes were assessed. Navicular bursa opacification occurred in 7 distal limbs (5.3%) following distal interphalangeal joint injection. One limb showed a communication through the T\u2010ligament and 6 limbs showed a communication through the distal sesamoidean impar ligament. In 3 cases, the communication through the distal sesamoidean impar ligament was associated with a distal border fragment. Our study showed that communication between the distal interphalangeal joint and navicular bursa is uncommon and inconsistent. Clinically, the presence of a communication could (1) influence the interpretation of diagnostic analgesia of the distal interphalangeal joint or the navicular bursa by facilitating the diffusion of local anaesthetic between these structures; (2) allow the drug and its potential adverse effects to spread from the treated synovial cavity to the non\u2010targeted synovial cavity; (3) be responsible for the failure of joint drainage in the case of sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Background Potential synovial penetration following palmar digital nerve blocks has not been investigated. Objectives To evaluate the proximity of needles placed for palmar digital nerve blocks to nearby synovial structures using computed tomography (CT). Study design Descriptive observational study. Methods In 18 cadaver forelimbs, sequential injection of the navicular bursa (NB), distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) and digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) was performed using 3, 5 and 10\u2009mL diluted radiodense contrast medium, respectively. After each synovial injection, 25 gage needles were placed over the palmar digital nerves at the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages (distal injections) and 1\u2009cm further proximally (proximal injections), and CT examination was performed. Subsequently, needles were removed, and the synovial structures further distended with the same volume as for the first injection. Perineural needle placement and image acquisition were repeated. The distance between the needle tip and adjacent synovial structures was measured (mm) in reconstructed images. Results were analyzed in separate general linear mixed models, to determine the effect of needle position and synovial distension on the distance from the tip of the needle to the NB, DFTS and DIPJ. Results Synovial penetration was confirmed following 12/420 (3%) needle placements (NB n\u2009=\u20095, 1 after proximal and 4 after distal injections; DIPJ n\u2009=\u20092, DFTS n\u2009=\u20092, NB or DIPJ n\u2009=\u20093, all after distal injections). The mean distance from the needle tip to the NB and DIPJ was significantly smaller after the second distension (NB: p\u2009=\u20090.025; DIPJ: p\u2009<\u20090.001) and with the distal needle placements (NB: p\u2009<\u20090.001; DIPJ: p\u2009<\u20090.001). For the DFTS, the distance from the needle tip was significantly smaller with the proximal needle placements (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Main limitations Ex-vivo study. Conclusion There is a small risk of synovial penetration when performing palmar digital nerve blocks, especially when distension of adjacent synovial structures is present.",
