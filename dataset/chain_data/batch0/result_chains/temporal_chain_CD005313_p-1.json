        "abstract": "To overcome the problem of in\u2010stent restenosis, the concept of local delivery of antiproliferative or immunosuppressive drugs has been introduced into interventional cardiology. Local drug delivery can be achieved by drug\u2010eluting stents coated with polymer surfaces used for controlled drug release. However, several polymer coatings have shown an induction of inflammatory response and increased neointima formation. In the present study, the effect of a new inorganic ceramic nanoporous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) coating on neointima proliferation and its suitability as a carrier for the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus have been investigated. 316 L stainless steel coronary stents were coated with a 500 nm thin nanoporous aluminum oxide layer. This ceramic nanolayer was used as a carrier for tacrolimus. Bare stents (n = 6), ceramic coated stents (n = 6), and ceramic coated stents loaded with 60 (n = 7) and 120 \u03bcg (n = 6) tacrolimus were implanted in the common carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. The ceramic coating caused no significant reduction of neointimal thickness after 28 days. Loading the ceramic stents with tacrolimus led to a significant reduction of neointima thickness by 52% for 60 \u03bcg (P = 0.047) and 56% for 120 \u03bcg (P = 0.036) as compared to the bare stents. The ceramic coating alone as well as in combination with tacrolimus led to a reduced infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages in the intima in response to stent implantation. Ceramic coating of coronary stents with a nanoporous layer of aluminum oxide in combination with tacrolimus resulted in a significant reduction in neointima formation and inflammatory response. The synergistic effects of the ceramic coating and tacrolimus suggest that this new approach may have a high potential to translate into clinical benefit.

        "title": "Particle debris from a nanoporous stent coating obscures potential antiproliferative effects of tacrolimus\u2010eluting stents in a porcine model of restenosis",
        "abstract": "Polymer stent coatings may not be suitable for drug elution because of inherent proinflammatory effects. A previous study suggested a beneficial effect of a stent eluting tacrolimus from a nanoporous ceramic aluminum oxide coating in a rabbit restenosis model. We investigated whether this stent is effective in preventing in\u2010stent restenosis in a porcine restenosis model. Thirty\u2010four juvenile swine underwent balloon overstretch injury and were subjected to implantation of either stainless steel (bare) stents, bare stents coated with nanoporous aluminum oxide alone, and coated stents eluting 50 and 180 \u03bcg of tacrolimus (FK506). In\u2010stent restenosis was quantified at 1 and 3 months after stent placement by histomorphometry. A significant increase of neointimal hyperplasia was noted with the stents coated with aluminum oxide alone compared with bare stents (2.92 \u00b1 1.02 and 1.38 \u00b1 0.51 mm2, respectively; P < 0.02). In all arteries containing coated stents, particle debris was found in the media and neointima, resulting in augmented vascular inflammation. In the group of stents coated with aluminum oxide, FK506 elution at a dose 180 \u03bcg reduced neointimal hyperplasia vs. no drug elution (1.66 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 2.92 \u00b1 1.02 mm2; 180 \u03bcg vs. ceramic alone; P < 0.03). At a dose of 50 \u03bcg stent\u2010based delivery of FK506, no reduction of neointimal hyperplasia was found (2.88 \u00b1 1.31 and 2.92 \u00b1 1.02 mm2, respectively; P = NS; FK506 vs. ceramic alone). In summary, particle debris shed from a drug\u2010eluting aluminum oxide coating of a stainless steel stent counteracts potential antiproliferative effects of stent\u2010based tacrolimus delivery in a porcine model of restenosis. We propose that stent coatings eluting drugs need to be routinely tested for being tightly anchored into the stent surface. Alternatively, omission of any coating used as a drug reservoir may eliminate inflammatory particle debris after placement of drug\u2010eluting stents.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLong-term efficacy and safety of tacrolimus-eluting stent (Janus) for treatment of coronary artery disease in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) \"real world\" is uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Janus stent for treating coronary heart disease in PCI daily practice, the safety of 4-month clopidogrel therapy after Janus stent implantation and the feasibility for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for first time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom February 20, 2006 to August 26, 2006, a total of 200 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Janus stent (n = 100) or bare metal stent (Tecnic Carbostent, n = 100). All patients were administered with clopidogrel for 4 months and aspirin for life long after stenting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. AMI was present in 37% of patients with Janus and 36% with Tecnic Carbostent. At an average of 246-day follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6% with the Janus stent and 15% with the Tecnic Carbostent (P = 0.038). Primary events included 1 cardiac death, 1 myocardial infarction (MI) due to subacute stent thrombosis and 13 target lesion revascularizations (TLR) due to restenosis in patients with Tecnic Carbostent and 6 TLR due to restenosis in patients with Janus stent. Although all patients had discontinued clopidogrel for an average of 126 days, there was no additional thrombotic event in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nJanus stent is efficient in reducing MACE compared with Tecnic Carbostent at an average of 8-month follow-up. Discontinuation of clopidogrel at 4 months after PCI is safe for patients with Janus stent, including AMI patients. Long-term efficacy of Janus stent in reducing restenosis requires further study.",

Background: There are no data of Janus Flex stent (Carbostent and Implantable Devices\u2014CID, Saluggia, Italy), a polymer\u2010free, tacrolimus\u2010eluting coronary stent, followed by short\u2010term DAT, in daily practice. Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled at 12 high\u2010volume procedures centres. After stenting, four sites prescribed 2\u2010month DAT, eight sites 6\u2010month DAT. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and stent thrombosis (ST) rate was evaluated at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, for entire population, as well as for 2\u2010 and 6\u2010month DAT groups, distinctly. MACE included cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Results: From March 2007 to June 2008, 572 patients (mean age 64.91 \u00b1 11 years, 77.45% males) were enrolled. After successful stenting, 12\u2010month follow\u2010up showed a 12.74% MACE occurrence (cardiac death 0.98%; MI 3.13%; TLR 8.62%), with good Janus Flex safety profile confirmed by only two (0.39%) ST. After adjustment for potential confounding, no significant differences were noted at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up among 2\u2010 or 6\u2010month DAT groups (MACE\u20148.99% versus 12.47%, P = 0.16; cardiac death\u20140.54% versus 1.14%, P = 0.52; MI\u20142.38% versus 2.71%, P = 0.83; TLR\u20145.66% versus 10.60%, P = 0.20; ST\u20140% versus 0.55%, P = 0.99). At multivariable analysis, DAT time duration was not an independent risk factor for adverse events (adjusted HR 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.16\u20131.35, P = 0.16). Conclusions: Janus Flex coronary stenting, followed by short DAT, is safe and feasible, without differences between 2\u2010 and 6\u2010month DAT groups.

        "abstract": "Clinical evaluations have proven the efficacy of drug-elution stents (DES) in reduction of in-stent restenosis rates as compared to drug-free bare metal stents (BMS). Typically, DES are metal stents that are covered with a polymer film loaded with anti-inflammatory or antiproliferative drugs that are released in a sustained manner. However, although favorable effects of the released drugs have been observed, the polymer coating as such has been associated with several adverse clinical effects, such as late stent thrombosis. Elimination of the polymeric carrier of DES may therefore potentially lead to safer DES. Several technologies have been developed to design polymer-free DES, such as the use of microporous stents and inorganic coatings that can be drug loaded. Several drugs, including sirolimus, tacrolimus, paclitaxel, and probucol have been used in the design of carrier-free stents. Due to the function of the polymeric coating to control the release kinetics of a drug, polymer-free stents are expected to have a faster drug elution rate, which may affect the therapeutic efficacy. However, several polymer-free stents have shown similar efficacy and safety as the first-generation DES, although the superiority of polymer-free DES has not been established in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "During the last years substantial effort was taken in order to provide an effective and safe pharmacotherapy that can be adjusted to the individual needs of patients. Stereolithography is a simple and accurate additive manufacturing technology. According to these characteristics, it may offer unique opportunities for the industrial fabrication of structured drug delivery systems (DDS), which can be tailored to individual needs. During the stereolithographic process photopolymerizable biomaterial is transformed, layer by layer, into the designed polymer DDS. Combined with inkjet printing in an innovative 3D building system it enables selective and precise incorporation of the drug depot into the basic body of the DDS. Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), a hydrophilic and low-immunogenic compound, is a suitable material as drug depot in a photopolymerizable basic biomaterial for this purpose. By combination of PEGDA with other acrylates, the physical properties of the DDS can be adjusted towards the desired characteristics. Therefore, it should be possible to modify the drug release profile through the positioning of drug depots and the diffusion of the drug and adjust it for a wide range of applications.In this study we investigated basic biological and thermodynamic properties of conventionally photocured systems consisting of PEGDA and its coacrylates: 1,3-butanediol diacrylate and pentaerythritol triacrylate. Our preliminary outcomes demonstrate the hydrophilic character of the samples and the importance of a rinsing process. They also show that the addition of different amounts of co-monomers influence the glass transition temperature, which increases with increasing content of coacrylate. Therefore, PEGDA/comonomer composition can be used as a tool for the modification of drug release properties. Consequently, these materials may be regarded as interesting and promising components for DDS via novel additive manufacturing with the ability of highly controlled drug release.",

        "abstract": "Novel fabrication techniques based on photopolymerization enable the preparation of complex multi-material constructs for biomedical applications. This requires an understanding of the influence of the used reaction components on the properties of the generated copolymers. The identification of fundamental characteristics of these copolymers is necessary to evaluate their potential for biomaterial applications. Additionally, knowledge of the properties of the starting materials enables subsequent tailoring of the biomaterials to meet individual implantation needs. In our study, we have analyzed the biological, chemical, mechanical and thermal properties of photopolymerized poly(ethyleneglycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and specific copolymers with different photoinitiator (PI) concentrations before and after applying a post treatment washing process. As comonomers, 1,3-butanediol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate were used. The in vitro studies confirm the biocompatibility of all investigated copolymers. Uniaxial tensile tests show significantly lower tensile strength (82% decrease) and elongation at break (76% decrease) values for washed samples. Altered tensile strength is also observed for different PI concentrations: on average, 6.2 MPa for 1.25% PI and 3.1 MPa for 0.5% PI. The addition of comonomers lowers elongation at break on average by 45%. Moreover, our observations show glass transition temperatures (Tg) ranging from 27 \u00b0C to 56 \u00b0C, which significantly increase with higher comonomer content. These results confirm the ability to generate biocompatible PEGDA copolymers with specific thermal and mechanical properties.

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printed hydrogels fabricated using light processing techniques are poised to replace conventional processing methods used in tissue engineering and organ-on-chip devices. An intrinsic potential problem remains related to structural heterogeneity translated in the degree of cross-linking of the printed layers. Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels were used to fabricate both 3D printed multilayer and control monolithic samples, which were then analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess their nanomechanical properties. The fabrication of the hydrogel samples involved layer-by-layer (LbL) projection lithography and bulk cross-linking processes. We evaluated the nanomechanical properties of both hydrogel types in a hydrated environment using the elastic modulus (E) as a measure to gain insight into their mechanical properties. We observed that E increases by 4-fold from 2.8 to 11.9 kPa transitioning from bottom to the top of a single printed layer in a multilayer sample. Such variations could not be seen in control monolithic sample. The variation within the printed layers is ascribed to heterogeneities caused by the photo-cross-linking process. This behavior was rationalized by spatial variation of the polymer cross-link density related to variations of light absorption within the layers attributed to spatial decay of light intensity during the photo-cross-linking process. More importantly, we observed a significant 44% increase in E, from 9.1 to 13.1 kPa, as the indentation advanced from the bottom to the top of the multilayer sample. This finding implies that mechanical heterogeneity is present throughout the entire structure, rather than being limited to each layer individually. These findings are critical for design, fabrication, and application engineers intending to use 3D printed multilayer PEGDA hydrogels for in vitro tissue engineering and organ-on-chip devices.",

A pure PEGDA formulation served as a control in comparative studies. Additionally, two structural designs (solid cube and cubic lattice) were also quantitatively compared to determine the adsorption performance for Rhodamine B (RhB) dye removal. Results indicated that the cubic lattice formulated with hydrophilic PEGDA:HEMA (\u03b8~47.20\u00b0) was more effective at removing RhB dye. Additionally, the preliminary study identified pH 9 as the optimal level for RhB dye removal using 3D cubic monolith for both formulations. A Taguchi orthogonal array of L9 (33) was used to concurrently vary three parameters: adsorbent dosage (0.65 \u00b1 0.02\u2009g per cubic lattice), operating temperature (30\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, and 50\u00b0C), and initial RhB concentration (20, 60, and 100\u2009ppm). The highest mean of the signal\u2010to\u2010noise (S/N) ratio was chosen to obtain the highest adsorption performance. The removal efficiency (R%) of RhB dye ranged from 44.48% to 94.86%, and the adsorption capacity (K) ranged from 0.59 to 3.73 (mg/g) after 5\u2009h. Seven adsorption isotherms and five adsorption kinetics modelling were performed. Adsorption isotherm data fitted well with the Redlich\u2013Peterson model for both linear (R2 = 0.998) and nonlinear (R2 = 1). Besides that, the pseudo\u2010second\u2010order model (PSO) accurately described adsorption kinetics (R2 = 0.995). The separation factor (RL) confirmed favourable adsorption (0 < RL < 1). Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was endothermic and at higher temperatures, entropy increased. Also, the 3D\u2013printed PEGDA:HEMA cubic lattice exhibited good mechanical stability. Furthermore, the 3D PEGA: HEMA lattice has the ability to be used in several adsorption cycles of degrading RhB dye. Ultimately, the present work demonstrates the viability of 3D printing photocurable PEGDA:HEMA resin and utilizes statistical tools to optimize process parameters, enhancing predictability for wastewater management.",
