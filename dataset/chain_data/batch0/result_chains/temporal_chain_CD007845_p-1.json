        "title": "Activation of AMPK by Bitter Melon Triterpenoids Involves CaMKK\u03b2",
        "abstract": "We recently showed that bitter melon-derived triterpenoids (BMTs) activate AMPK and increase GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in vitro, and improve glucose disposal in insulin resistant models in vivo. Here we interrogated the mechanism by which these novel compounds activate AMPK, a leading anti-diabetic drug target. BMTs did not activate AMPK directly in an allosteric manner as AMP or the Abbott compound (A-769662) does, nor did they activate AMPK by inhibiting cellular respiration like many commonly used anti-diabetic medications. BMTs increased AMPK activity in both L6 myotubes and LKB1-deficient HeLa cells by 20\u201335%. Incubation with the CaMKK\u03b2 inhibitor, STO-609, completely attenuated this effect suggesting a key role for CaMKK\u03b2 in this activation. Incubation of L6 myotubes with the calcium chelator EGTA-AM did not alter this activation suggesting that the BMT-dependent activation was Ca2+-independent. We therefore propose that CaMKK\u03b2 is a key upstream kinase for BMT-induced activation of AMPK.",

        "title": "Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia) Extract Inhibits Tumorigenicity and Overcomes Cisplatin-Resistance in Ovarian Cancer Cells Through Targeting AMPK Signaling Cascade",
        "abstract": "Objective. Acquired chemoresistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Therefore, searching for alternative therapeutic modalities is urgently needed. Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is a traditional dietary fruit, but its extract also shows potential medicinal values in human diabetes and cancers. Here, we sought to investigate the extract of bitter melon (BME) in antitumorigenic and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. Methods. Three varieties of bitter melon were used to prepare the BME. Ovarian cancer cell lines, human immortalized epithelial ovarian cells (HOSEs), and nude mice were used to evaluate the cell cytotoxicity, cisplatin resistance, and tumor inhibitory effect of BME. The molecular mechanism of BME was examined by Western blotting. Results. Cotreatment with BME and cisplatin markedly attenuated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model, whereas there was no observable toxicity in HOSEs or in nude mice in vivo. Interestingly, the antitumorigenic effects of BME varied with different varieties of bitter melon, suggesting that the amount of antitumorigenic substances may vary. Studies of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that BME activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in an AMP-independent but CaMKK (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)-dependent manner, exerting anticancer effects through activation of AMPK and suppression of the mTOR/p70S6K and/or the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 (Forkhead Box M1) signaling cascade. Conclusion. BME functions as a natural AMPK activator in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth and might be useful as a supplement to improve the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.",

        "abstract": "Natural products are the best source for various medicinal drugs. Regardless investigate the toxic effect of these plant extracts, the results will still unsafe and unacceptable. This study aimed to identify anti-cancer activity and cytotoxicity effect of Momordica charantia extract on different cancer cell line. Materials and Methods:to archive the aim of this study 3 different cancer cell lines (HCT116, MCF-7, and HepG2) were treated with different Momordicacharantia extract doses (from 0-100\u00b5g) for each cell line. IC 50 , cell viability,apoptosis, were evaluated. Results:The effect of Momordicacharantia extract was highly significant in HepG2 cells than HCT116 cell as well as MCF-7 which showing the IC50 of Momordicacharantia extract in HepG2 was 0.77 \u00b5g/ml while in HCT116 was 0.81\u00b5g/mland was 1.35\u00b5g/ml in MCF-7 cells respectively. Also, the effect of the Momordicacharantia extract was more potent in HCT116 compared to MCF-7 cells.Conclusions: in the light of these results Momordicacharantia extract may use as anticancer pro-drugat a specific type of cancer (Liver HepG2 cell line) but still need further studies to explore the mechanism of action that led to observe different results from different cell lines despite the same extract. Keywords: Momordicacharantia , Apoptosis, MCF-7, HepG2, HCT116.",

        "title": "The Effect of Bitter Melon Extract (Momordica Charantia) On CASPASE-9 and Bcl-2 Proteins Expression",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer has a significant morbidity and death rate worldwide, thus various therapeutic strategies, including the phytopharmaca approach, must be researched further. Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) extract is predicted to have anticancer properties due to its influence on Caspase-9 and BcL2 proteins, which will be shown in this in vitro investigation utilizing MCF-7 cell culture. This study was an in vitro laboratory experimental study with a post-test-only control group design. The doses of Momordica charantia extract used were 125 \u03bcg/ml, 500 \u03bcg/ml, and 1,000 \u03bcg/ml. Caspase-9 and BcL2 protein expression in MCF-7cell culture was measured by immunocytochemistry method, Shapiro Wilk, Levene Test, One Way Anova, and Post Hoc LSD. Administration of Momordica charantia extract at a dose of 500 \u03bcg/ml and 1,000 \u03bcg/ml significantly increased the average expression of Caspase-9 protein (p = 0.044 and p = 0.004 respectively), but not at a dose of 125 \u03bcg/mL (p = 0.125). Administration of bitter melon extract at doses of 125 \u03bcg/ml, 500 \u03bcg/ml, and 1,000 \u03bcg/ml significantly reduced the average BcL2 protein expression (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.001 respectively). Momordica charantia extract has the potential to be employed as an anti-breast cancer agent due to its ability to increase the average expression of Caspase-9 protein while reducing the average expression of BcL2 protein.",
