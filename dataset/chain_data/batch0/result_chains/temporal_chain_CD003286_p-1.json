        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether a 6-month home-based intervention program in adolescents with poorly controlled diabetes improves metabolic control and whether benefits are maintained after the intervention.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nAdolescents with a mean HbA1c of > 9.0% over the preceding 12 months received either routine care in a diabetes clinic and an ambulatory intervention for 6 months (n = 37) or routine care only (n = 32). A diabetes educator provided monthly home visits and weekly phone contact to educate and support the adolescents in setting goals for insulin adjustment, blood glucose monitoring, and target blood glucose range. There was no systematic change in the frequency of insulin injections. After the intervention, there was a 12-month follow-up when the intervention and control groups both received only routine care. Outcome measures were HbA1c and Diabetes Knowledge Assessment (DKN).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the intervention, mean HbA1c fell (baseline: 11.1 +/- 1.3%, 6 months: 9.7 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.0001) and mean knowledge scores increased (P = 0.0001) in the intervention group but not in control subjects. However, this improvement in HbA1c and increase in knowledge was not maintained in the intervention group at 12- and 18-month follow-up assessments. Parents' knowledge scores also improved significantly from baseline levels in the intervention group at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn ambulatory program improves metabolic control and knowledge in adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes; however, it is effective only while the intervention is maintained.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that adolescents with type 1 diabetes can learn to become better problem solvers in diabetes self-care and thereby improve their metabolic control. METHODS Fifty-three adolescents aged 13 to 17 with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a 6-week problem-solving diabetes education program or to a control group (usual care). Al C levels were obtained as well as assessments of problem solving, frequency of behavior, level of responsibility, and 24-hour behavior recall at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS The experimental group participants showed significantly improved problem-solving test scores and Al C values from baseline to 6 months, changes not evident in the control group. At 6 months, the experimental group participants were doing blood glucose testing more often than those in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in problem-solving test scores or Al C values. CONCLUSIONS This 6-week intervention for adolescents with diabetes resulted in better problem-solving skills, more frequent blood glucose testing, and improved Al C values. The results suggest that a diabetes problem-solving program for adolescents can be effective in improving metabolic control.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of Type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide, imposing enormous public health costs, as well as profoundly affecting individual quality of life. There is evidence that psychological problems are increased in children with diabetes and this morbidity is often associated with poor metabolic control. Specific risk factors for this dual morbidity are emerging from empirical studies. The next challenge is to identify effective interventions for use with children at risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes. The intervention literature is reviewed. It is noted that most studies have used diabetes\u2010specific, unstandardized interventions in groups of adolescents, with few interventions trialled with younger children. No study has targeted a specific psychological disorder such as behaviour problems or depression, both of which are known to be increased in children with diabetes and for which effective standardized interventions are available. Attention is drawn to methodological limitations in many of the studies conducted to date and suggestions made to reduce these in future interventions attempting to reduce the burden of illness in children with diabetes.",

An independent sample of primary caretakers of 87 children aged 10 to 16 years with type 1 diabetes completed the measure of parenting goals (diabetes-specific and general goals); both parent and child completed measures of parent responsibility for diabetes management at baseline and 6 months. Parents ranked diabetes-specific parenting goals as more important than general parenting goals, and rankings were moderately stable over time. Parenting goals were related to parent responsibility for diabetes management. The relative ranking of diabetes-specific parenting goals predicted changes in parent involvement over 6 months, with baseline ranking of goals predicting more parental involvement at follow-up. Parenting goals may play an important role in family management of type 1 diabetes.",

        "title": "Effects of Family Treatment on Parenting Beliefs Among Caregivers of Youth With Poorly Controlled Asthma",
        "abstract": "Objective: Caregiver involvement is critical in ensuring optimal adolescent asthma management. The study investigated whether multisystemic therapy (MST), an intensive home-based family therapy, was superior to family support for changing beliefs regarding asthma-related positive parenting among caregivers of African-American youth with poorly controlled asthma. The relationship between parenting beliefs and asthma management at the conclusion of the intervention was also assessed. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 167 adolescents with moderate-to-severe, persistent, poorly controlled asthma and their primary caregivers. Families were randomly assigned to MST or family support (FS), a home-based family support condition. Data were collected at baseline and 7-month posttest. Changes in caregiver ratings of importance and confidence for engaging in asthma-related positive parenting were assessed through questionnaire. Illness management was assessed by the Family Asthma Management System Scale. Results: Participation in MST was associated with more change in caregiver beliefs as compared with FS for both importance (t = 2.39, p = .02) and confidence (t = 2.04, p = .04). Caregiver beliefs were also significantly related to youth controller medication adherence at the conclusion of treatment (importance: r = .21, p = .01; confidence: r = .23, p = .004). Conclusion: Results support the effectiveness of MST for increasing parental beliefs in the value of asthma-related positive parenting behaviors and parental self-efficacy for these behaviors among families of minority adolescents with poorly controlled asthma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background and objectives: Adherence to daily asthma controller medication has been shown to be the most effective component of asthma self-management; however, patient's adherence to asthma medication remains poor. This study aimed to understand how patients' long-term asthma controller medication adherence may be improved and facilitated by comparing key asthma stakeholders' perspectives. Method: Six focus group interviews including 38 asthma stakeholders (n = 13 patients, n = 13 pulmonologist physicians, and n = 12 allied healthcare professionals) were conducted. Interviews were qualitatively analysed. Results: Although similar themes were brought up across different asthma stakeholders, the way in which they were framed differed across stakeholders. The most salient discussion revolved around the content and the moment in which asthma education should be approached to facilitate patients' adherence to asthma medication. Conclusion: Asthma medication adherence is a complex process and successful interventions aimed at its improvement would benefit from: (a) making an effort to understand patients' experiences and negotiate the treatment regimen, rather than imposing recommendations; (b) considering treatment as a shared responsibility involving the patient, the healthcare professional(s), and the patients' social networks; and, (c) taking into account different stakeholders' concerns, needs, perspectives, and knowledge.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: Poor outcomes and health disparities related to asthma result in part from difficulty disseminating new evidence such as shared decision making (SDM) into clinical practice. As part of a three-arm cluster randomized dissemination study, evaluation of the impact of different dissemination methods was studied. Here we evaluate themes from patient and provider focus groups to assess the impact of a facilitated, traditional dissemination approach, or no intervention, on patient and provider perspectives of asthma care. Methods: Using semi-structured questions, twenty-four pre- and post-intervention focus groups with patients and providers took place across primary care practices. Discussions were held in all three arms both before and after the time of intervention rollout. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed for themes. Results: Across all sites patients and providers discussed themes of communication, asthma self-management, barriers, education, and patient awareness. After the intervention, compared to traditional sites, facilitated practices were more likely to discuss themes related to SDM, such as patient-centered communication, patient-provider negotiation on treatment plan, planning, goal-setting, and solutions to barriers. Conclusions: Emergent themes allowed for further understanding of how the SDM implementation was perceived at the patient and provider level. The facilitated implementation was associated with higher adoption of the SDM intervention. These themes and supporting quotes add to knowledge of best practices associated with implementing an evidence-based SDM intervention for asthma into primary care and will inform researchers, practices, and providers as they work to improve adoption of evidence-based interventions into practice.",
