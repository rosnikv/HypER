        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLow intake of dietary fat and high intake of soy foods have been suggested to partly explain the lower breast cancer rates in Asia, perhaps because of lower endogenous estrogens.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective was to assess the hormonal and nonhormonal effects of diets resembling an Asian diet in terms of total fat and soy food contents.\n\n\nDESIGN\nFifty-seven postmenopausal women participated in a randomized, controlled, dietary intervention study. The subjects consumed a very-low-fat diet (VLFD; 11% of energy as fat), a Step I diet (25% of energy as fat) supplemented with soy food (SFD; 50 mg isoflavones/d), or a control Step I diet (CD; 27% of energy as fat) with no soy food. All diets were prepared at the General Clinical Research Center of the University of Southern California. Serum hormones and other markers were measured at baseline and every 2 wk during the 8 wk of intervention.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences in total estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin at the completion of the intervention between women in the SFD and VLFD groups and those in the CD group. Serum insulin decreased significantly in the SFD group, and leptin decreased significantly in the SFD and VLFD groups; however, these changes did not differ significantly from the changes in the CD group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study does not provide evidence that ingestion of soy food or a VLFD significantly reduces estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women. However, short-term changes in diet may have significant and beneficial effects on blood insulin and leptin concentrations.",

        "title": "Phytoestrogen Exposure Is Associated with Circulating Sex Hormone Levels in Postmenopausal Women and Interact with ESR1 and NR1I2 Gene Variants",
        "abstract": "In this large cross-sectional study, we investigated the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in 1988 healthy postmenopausal women and their interactions with polymorphisms in genes involved in estrogen signaling. Plasma estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, and SHBG were measured. Urinary levels of five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, and equol) and two lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) were measured and used as biomarkers for dietary intakes. Eighteen polymorphisms in ESR1, ESR2, and NR1I2 genes were genotyped. Results showed that lignans were positively associated with plasma SHBG levels (\u03b7p2 = 1.2%; P < 0.001) and negatively associated with plasma testosterone (\u03b7p2 = 0.2%; P = 0.042). Equol was negatively associated with plasma estradiol levels (\u03b7p2 = 0.3%; P = 0.028), whereas O-desmethylangolensin was positively associated with plasma estradiol level (\u03b7p2 = 0.3%; P = 0.010). There were significant phytoestrogen interactions with polymorphisms in ESR1 and NR1I2 genes in affecting estrone levels. We conclude that phytoestrogens modulate sex hormone and SHBG levels in postmenopausal women and interact with gene variants involved in estrogen signaling. Such phytoestrogen-gene interactions may explain the conflicting literature on the hormonal effects of phytoestrogens. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(5):1009\u201316)",

        "abstract": "Results from epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that phytoestrogens may protect against breast cancer. Because one of the biological effects of phytoestrogens is probably estrogenic, it's possible that the preventive effect on breast cancer differs by estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor. We evaluated the associations between dietary phytoestrogen (isoflavonoids, lignans, and coumestrol) intake and risk of breast cancer and whether the ER/PR statuses of the tumor influence this relationship. In 1991-2 a prospective population-based cohort study among Swedish pre- and postmenopausal women was performed, making questionnaire data available for 45,448 women. A total of 1014 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed until December 2004. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to estimate multivariate risk ratios, 95% CI for associations with risk of breast cancer. Intakes of lignan, isoflavonoid, or coumestrol were not associated with breast cancer risk overall or before or after 50 y of age. The effects of lignans or isoflavonoids were independent of receptor status. However, intake of coumestrol was associated with decreased risk of receptor negative tumors (ER-PR-) but not positive tumors. The risk of ER-PR- tumors was significantly lower (50%) in women with intermediate coumestrol intake compared with those who did not consume any. In conclusion, we found no association between intake of isoflavonoids or lignans and breast cancer risk. Our results of a decreased risk of ER-PR- tumors in women with intermediate intake of coumestrol could be due to chance because of the low intake. The results should be confirmed in other studies.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nLignans--plant-derived compounds with estrogen-dependent and -independent anticarcinogenic properties--have been associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but data are limited regarding their effect on survival. Dietary lignans are metabolized to enterolignans, which are subsequently absorbed and become bioavailable.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe assessed the prognosis of 1,140 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer age 50 to 74 years who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2005. Vital status through the end of 2009 was ascertained via local population registries, and deaths were verified by death certificates. Information on recurrences and secondary tumors was verified by clinical records and attending physicians. Associations of postdiagnostic serum enterolactone (a biomarker for dietary lignans) with overall survival and distant disease-free survival were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian enterolactone levels for deceased patients and those still alive were 17.0 and 21.4 nmol/L, respectively. During a median of 6.1 years of follow-up after diagnosis, 162 deaths were confirmed. Higher serum enterolactone levels were associated with significantly reduced hazard ratios (HRs) for death (HR per 10 nmol/L increment, 0.94; P = .04; HR for the highest quartile, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.99). For distant disease, HR was 0.94 per 10 nmol/L increment (P = .08) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.09) for the highest quartile. The highest quartile of serum enterolactone was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death only for estrogen receptor-negative tumors (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.87) but not for estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.84: P for heterogeneity = .09).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPostmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have high serum enterolactone levels may have better survival.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nSex steroid exposure increases the risk of breast cancer by unclear mechanisms. Diet modifications may be one breast cancer prevention strategy. The proinflammatory cytokine family of IL-1 is implicated in cancer progression. IL-1Ra is an endogenous inhibitor of the proinflammatory IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to elucidate whether estrogen, tamoxifen, and/or diet modification altered IL-1 levels in normal human breast tissue.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nMicrodialysis was performed in healthy women under various hormone exposures, tamoxifen therapy, and diet modifications and in breast cancers of women before surgery. Breast tissue biopsies from reduction mammoplasties were cultured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe show a significant positive correlation between estradiol and in vivo levels of IL-1\u03b2 in breast tissue and abdominal sc fat, whereas IL-1Ra exhibited a significant negative correlation with estradiol in breast tissue. Tamoxifen or a dietary addition of 25 g flaxseed per day resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-1Ra in the breast. These results were confirmed in ex vivo culture of breast biopsies. Immunohistochemistry of the biopsies did not reveal any changes in cellular content of the IL-1s, suggesting that mainly the secreted levels were affected. In breast cancer patients, intratumoral levels of IL-1\u03b2 were significantly higher compared with normal adjacent breast tissue.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIL-1 may be under the control of estrogen in vivo and may be attenuated by antiestrogen therapy and diet modifications. The increased IL-1\u03b2 in breast cancers of women strongly suggests IL-1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment and prevention.",

        "abstract": "Nontransformed breast epithelial cells that are adjacent to tumor cells are constantly exposed to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), two inflammatory cytokines identified as having pro-tumoral causative roles. We show that continuous stimulation of nontransformed breast epithelial cells by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 for 2 to 3 weeks induced their spreading and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanistic bases for this slow induction of EMT by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 are: 1) it took 2 to 3 weeks for the cytokines to induce the expression of the EMT activators Zeb1 and Snail; 2) although Twist has amplified the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail, its expression was reduced by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2; however, the lack of Twist was compensated by prolonged stimulation with TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 that has potentiated the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail. Stimulation by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 has induced the following dissemination-related properties in the nontransformed cells: 1) up-regulation of functional matrix metalloproteinases; 2) induction of migratory and invasive capabilities; 3) disruption of the normal phenotype of organized three-dimensional acini structures typically formed only by nontransformed breast cells and spreading of nontransformed cells out of such acini. Our findings suggest that TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 induce dissemination of nontransformed breast epithelial cells and their reseeding at the primary tumor site; if, then, such detached cells are exposed to transforming events, they may form secondary malignant focus and lead to disease recurrence. Thus, our study reveals novel pathways through which the inflammatory microenvironment may contribute to relapsed disease in breast cancer.",

Genetic and epigenetic modifications shift cells toward either end of the EMT spectrum, and can be influenced by the microenvironment surrounding a tumor. EMT and mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition are critical to normal function and development and an intricate network of transcription factors and transcriptional regulators tightly regulates these processes. As evidenced in normal and transformed cell lines, many signaling pathways trigger EMT during development and differentiation. The signaling pathways include those triggered by different members of the transforming growth factor superfamily, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor, Wnt, Notch, and many others. Functional redundancies allow cells to undergo EMT even if these key transcriptional regulators are lacking, but these same redundancies also make these pathways particularly susceptible to gain-of-function mutations or constitutive signal activation; the \u201cforced\u201d transition toward either a mesenchymal or epithelial phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induces epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between S1P and syndecan-1 in HCC, the molecular mechanism involved, as well as their roles in EMT of HCC. Results revealed a high serum S1P level presents in patients with HCC, which positively correlated with the serum syndecan-1 level. A significant inverse correlation existed between S1P1 and syndecan-1 in HCC tissues. S1P elicits activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways via S1P1, which triggers HPSE, leading to increases in expression and activity of MMP-7 and leading to shedding and suppression of syndecan-1. The loss of syndecan-1 causes an increase in TGF-\u03b21 production. The limited chronic increase in TGF-\u03b21 can convert HCC cells into a mesenchymal phenotype via establishing an MMP-7/Syndecan-1/TGF-\u03b2 autocrine loop. Finally, TGF-\u03b21 and syndecan-1 are essential for S1P-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our study demonstrates that S1P induces advanced tumor phenotypes of HCC via establishing an MMP-7/syndecan-1/TGF-\u03b21 autocrine loop, and implicates targetable S1P1-PI3K/AKT-HPSE-MMP-7 signaling axe in HCC metastasis.",

Specifically, ecto\u2010 and cytoplasmic domains are responsible for the interaction with extracellular matrix molecules and intracellular kinases, respectively. These interactions indicate syndecans as key molecules during cancer initiation and progression. Particularly syndecans interact with other cell surface receptors, such as growth factor receptors and integrins, which lead to activation of downstream signaling pathways, which are critical for the cellular behavior. Moreover, this review describes the key role of syndecans in intracellular calcium regulation and homeostasis.

        "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) are complex unbranched carbohydrate chains that are heavily modified by sulfate and exist either conjugated to proteins or as free, unconjugated chains. Proteins with covalently bound Heparan sulfate chains are termed Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). Both HS and HSPGs bind to various growth factors and act as co-receptors for different cell surface receptors. They also modulate the dynamics and kinetics of various ligand-receptor interactions, which in turn can influence the duration and potency of the signaling. HS and HSPGs have also been shown to exert a structural role as a component of the extracellular matrix, thereby altering processes such as cell adhesion, immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that HS are deregulated in a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and regulate key aspects of cancer initiation and progression. HS deregulation in cancer can occur as a result of changes in the level of HSPGs or due to changes in the levels of HS biosynthesis and remodeling enzymes. Here, we describe the major cell-autonomous (proliferation, apoptosis/senescence and differentiation) and cell-non-autonomous (angiogenesis, immune evasion, and matrix remodeling) roles of HS and HSPGs in cancer. Finally, we discuss therapeutic opportunities for targeting deregulated HS biosynthesis and HSPGs as a strategy for cancer treatment.",
