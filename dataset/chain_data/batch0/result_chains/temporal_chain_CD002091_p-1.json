        "title": "An Improved Scoring System for Identifying Patients at High Early Risk of Stroke and Functional Impairment after an Acute Transient Ischemic Attack or Minor Stroke",
        "abstract": "Background Risk of a subsequent stroke following an acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke is high. The ABCD2 tool was proposed as a method to triage these patients using five clinical factors. Modern imaging of the brain was not included. The present study quantified the added value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors to the ABCD2 tool. Methods Patients with TIA or minor stroke were examined within 12 h and had a brain MRI within 24 h of symptom onset. Primary outcomes were recurrent stroke and functional impairment at 90 days. A new tool, ABCD2+ MRI, was created by adding diffusion-weighted imaging lesion and vessel occlusion status to the ABCD2 tool. The predictive accuracy of both tools was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Results One hundred and eighty patients were enrolled and 11\u00b71% had a recurrent stroke within 90 days. The predictive accuracy of the ABCD2+MRI was significantly higher than ABCD2 (AUC of 0\u00b788 vs. 0\u00b778, P = 0\u00b701). Those with a high score (7\u20139) had a 90-day recurrent stroke risk of 32\u00b71%, moderate score (5\u20136) risk of 5\u00b74%, and low score (0-4) risk of 0\u00b70%. The ABCD2 tool did not predict risk of functional impairment at 90 days (P = 0\u00b733), unlike the ABCD2+MRI (P = 0\u00b702): high score (22\u00b79%), moderate (7\u00b75%), low (7\u00b77%). Conclusions Risk of recurrent stroke and functional impairment after a TIA or minor stroke can be accurately predicted by a scoring system that utilizes both clinical and MRI information. The ABCD2+MRI score is simple and its components are commonly available during the time of admission.",

        "title": "Addition of Brain Infarction to the ABCD2 Score (ABCD2I): A Collaborative Analysis of Unpublished Data on 4574 Patients",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 The ABCD system was developed to predict early stroke risk after transient ischemic attack. Incorporation of brain imaging findings has been suggested, but reports have used inconsistent methods and been underpowered. We therefore performed an international, multicenter collaborative study of the prognostic performance of the ABCD2 score and brain infarction on imaging to determine the optimal weighting of infarction in the score (ABCD2I). Methods\u2014 Twelve centers provided unpublished data on ABCD2 scores, presence of brain infarction on either diffusion-weighted imaging or CT, and follow-up in cohorts of patients with transient ischemic attack diagnosed by World Health Organization criteria. Optimal weighting of infarction in the ABCD2I score was determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and random effects meta-analysis. Results\u2014 Among 4574 patients with TIA, acute infarction was present in 884 (27.6%) of 3206 imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging and new or old infarction was present in 327 (23.9%) of 1368 imaged with CT. ABCD2 score and presence of infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging or CT were both independently predictive of stroke (n=145) at 7 days (after adjustment for ABCD2 score, OR for infarction=6.2, 95% CI=4.2 to 9.0, overall; 14.9, 7.4 to 30.2, for diffusion-weighted imaging; 4.2, 2.6 to 6.9, for CT; all P<0.001). Incorporation of infarction in the ABCD2I score improved predictive power with an optimal weighting of 3 points for infarction on CT or diffusion-weighted imaging. Pooled areas under the curve increased from 0.66 (0.53 to 0.78) for the ABCD2 score to 0.78 (0.72 to 0.85) for the ABCD2I score. Conclusions\u2014 In secondary care, incorporation of brain infarction into the ABCD system (ABCD2I score) improves prediction of stroke in the acute phase after transient ischemic attack.",

        "title": "TWO ACES: Transient Ischemic Attack Work-Up as Outpatient Assessment of Clinical Evaluation and Safety",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 To evaluate a novel emergency department-based TIA triage system. Methods\u2014 We developed an approach to TIA triage and management based on risk assessment using the ABCD2 score in combination with early cervical and intracranial vessel imaging. It was anticipated that this triage system would avoid hospitalization for the majority of TIA patients and result in a low rate of recurrent stroke. We hypothesized that the subsequent stroke rate among consecutively encountered patients managed with this approach would be lower than predicted based on their ABCD2 scores. Results\u2014 From June 2007 to December 2009, 224 consecutive patients evaluated in the Stanford emergency department for a possible TIA were enrolled in the study. One hundred fifty-seven were discharged to complete their evaluation at the outpatient TIA clinic; 67 patients were hospitalized. One hundred sixteen patients had a final diagnosis of TIA/minor stroke or possible TIA. The stroke rates at 7, 30, and 90 days were 0.6% (0.1%\u20133.5%) for patients referred to the TIA clinic and 1.5% (0.3%\u20138.0%) for the hospitalized patients. Combining both groups, the overall stroke rate was 0.9% (0.3%\u20133.2%), which is significantly less than expected based on ABCD2 scores (P=0.034 at 7 days and P=0.001 at 90 days). Conclusions\u2014 This emergency department-based inpatient versus outpatient TIA triage system led to a low rate of hospitalization (30%). Recurrent stroke rates were low for both the hospitalized and outpatient subgroups.",

        "title": "Reduction in Early Stroke Risk in Carotid Stenosis With Transient Ischemic Attack Associated With Statin Treatment",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 Statins reduce stroke risk when initiated months after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke and reduce early vascular events in acute coronary syndromes, possibly via pleiotropic plaque stabilization. Few data exist on acute statin use in TIA. We aimed to determine whether statin pretreatment at TIA onset modified early stroke risk in carotid stenosis. Methods\u2014 We analyzed data from 2770 patients with TIA from 11 centers, 387 with ipsilateral carotid stenosis. ABCD2 score, abnormal diffusion weighted imaging, medication pretreatment, and early stroke were recorded. Results\u2014 In patients with carotid stenosis, 7-day stroke risk was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7\u201311.1) compared with 2.7% (CI, 2.0%\u20133.4%) without stenosis (P<0.0001; 90-day risks 17.8% and 5.7% [P<0.0001]). Among carotid stenosis patients, nonprocedural 7-day stroke risk was 3.8% (CI, 1.2%\u20139.7%) with statin treatment at TIA onset, compared with 13.2% (CI, 8.5%\u201319.8%) in those not statin pretreated (P=0.01; 90-day risks 8.9% versus 20.8% [P=0.01]). Statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk in patients with carotid stenosis (odds ratio for 90-day stroke, 0.37; CI, 0.17\u20130.82) but not nonstenosis patients (odds ratio, 1.3; CI, 0.8\u20132.24; P for interaction, 0.008). On multivariable logistic regression, the association remained after adjustment for ABCD2 score, smoking, antiplatelet treatment, recent TIA, and diffusion weighted imaging hyperintensity (adjusted P for interaction, 0.054). Conclusions\u2014 In acute symptomatic carotid stenosis, statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk, consistent with findings from randomized trials in acute coronary syndromes. These data support the hypothesis that statins started acutely after TIA symptom onset may also be beneficial to prevent early stroke. Randomized trials addressing this question are required.",
