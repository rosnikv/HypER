        "title": "A randomized study of adefovir dipivoxil in place of HBIG in combination with lamivudine as post\u2013liver transplantation hepatitis B prophylaxis",
        "abstract": "Prior to effective prophylaxis, liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)\u2010related disease was frequently complicated by recurrence, which could be severe and rapidly progressive. Combination hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and lamivudine prophylaxis reduces this rate of recurrence to <5% at 5 years; however, HBIG administration is costly and inconvenient. We conducted a multicenter randomized study of adefovir dipivoxil substitution for low\u2010dose intramuscular (IM) HBIG in patients without HBV recurrence at least 12 months posttransplantation for HBV\u2010related disease. Thirty\u2010four patients were randomized, 16 to adefovir (1 patient withdrew consent at 3 months and is not considered in the results) and 18 to continue HBIG. All continued lamivudine. Groups were well matched by age, sex, and time since transplantation (median, 4.5 years), and background virological risk for HBV recurrence (30% of patients in the adefovir group, 24% in the HBIG group having detectable HBV DNA at transplantation). All patients were alive at study completion without recurrence. One patient in the adefovir group became hepatitis B surface antigen\u2013positive at 5 months but was persistently HBV DNA undetectable via polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 14 IU/mL) over the following 20 months. Median creatinine was not significantly changed over the course of the study in either group. One patient in the adefovir group with a background of diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy (baseline creatinine 150 \u03bcmol/L) developed increased creatinine leading to dose reduction and ultimately cessation of adefovir at 15 months. Yearly cost of combination adefovir/lamivudine prophylaxis was $8,290 versus $13,718 IM HBIG/lamivudine. Conclusion: Compared with combination HBIG plus lamivudine prophylaxis, combination adefovir plus lamivudine provides equivalent protection against recurrent HBV infection but with better tolerability and less cost.

        "title": "Current management of hepatitis B virus infection before and after liver transplantation",
        "abstract": "The progress in treatment against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has substantially improved the outcome of all HBV\u2010infected patients. We systematically reviewed the existing data in the management of HBV transplant patients in order to assess the optimal regimen in the pretransplant setting, for post\u2010transplant prophylaxis and for therapy of HBV recurrent infection. All data suggest that an effective pretransplant anti\u2010HBV therapy prevents post\u2010transplant HBV recurrence. Pretransplant therapy has been based on lamivudine with addition of adefovir upon lamivudine resistance, but the use of newer, potent high\u2010genetic barrier agents is expected to improve long\u2010term efficacy. Moreover, it may lead to improvement of liver function, which sometimes removes the need for transplantation, although more objective criteria for removal from waiting lists are required. After liver transplantation, the combination of HBV immunoglobulin and one nucleos(t)ide analogue, mostly lamivudine, is currently the best approach, almost eliminating the probability of HBV recurrence. Treatment of post\u2010transplant HBV recurrence has been mainly studied with lamivudine, but it will be most effective with entecavir and tenofovir, which have a low risk of resistance. In conclusion, the newer anti\u2010HBV agents improve the treatment of HBV both pretransplant and post\u2010transplant. HBV immunoglobulin is still used in combination with an anti\u2010HBV agent for post\u2010transplant prophylaxis. Monoprophylaxis with one of the new anti\u2010HBV agents might be possible, particularly in patients preselected as having a low risk of HBV recurrence, but further data are needed and strategies to ensure compliance must be used.",

        "title": "Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues for prophylaxis against hepatitis b virus recurrence after liver transplantation: A systematic review",
        "abstract": "A combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) is currently recommended as prophylaxis against the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (LT), but the optimal protocol is a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was the identification of factors associated with post\u2010LT HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and NUCs. We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies in English about the effectiveness of HBIG and NUCs [lamivudine (LAM) and/or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)] against post\u2010LT HBV recurrence (January 1998 to June 2010). Forty\u2010six studies, which included 2162 HBV LT recipients, met the selection criteria. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM experienced HBV recurrence more frequently than patients receiving HBIG and ADV with or without LAM [6.1% (115/1889) versus 2.0% (3/152), P = 0.024], although they also were more frequently treated with indefinite HBIG prophylaxis (90% versus 57%, P < 0.001). For patients receiving HBIG and LAM, a lower frequency of HBV recurrence was associated with a high HBIG dosage (\u226510,000 IU/day) versus a low HBIG dosage (<10,000 IU/day) during the first week after LT [3.2% (14/440) versus 6.5% (80/1233), P = 0.016], but the HBIG protocol had no impact on HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. In conclusion, in comparison with the combination of HBIG and LAM, the combination of HBIG and ADV is associated with a lower rate of HBV recurrence after LT. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM should be given a high dosage of HBIG during the first week after LT, but a lower dosage can be used safely in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. Further studies with newer and more potent anti\u2010HBV agents are definitely required. Liver Transpl 17:1176\u20131190, 2011. \u00a9 2011 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "The combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues [NA(s)] is considered as the standard of care for prophylaxis against HBV recurrence after liver transplantation (LT), but the optimal protocol is controversial. We evaluated the efficacy of the newer NAs with high genetic barrier (hgbNA) [i.e. entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF)] with or without HBIG as prophylaxis against HBV recurrence after LT. In total, 519 HBV liver transplant recipients from 17 studies met the inclusion criteria and they were compared to those under lamivudine (LAM) and HBIG who had been selected in our previous review. Patients under HBIG and LAM developed HBV recurrence (115/1889 or 6.1%): (a) significantly more frequently compared to patients under HBIG and a hgbNA [1.0% (3/303), p < 0.001], and (b) numerically but not significantly more frequently compared to the patients who received a newer NA after discontinuation of HBIG [3.9% (4/102), p = 0.52]. The use of a hgbNA without any HBIG offered similar antiviral prophylaxis compared to HBIG and LAM combination, if the definition of HBV recurrence was based on HBV DNA detectability [0.9% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.11]. Our findings favor the use of HBIG and a hgbNA instead of HBIG and LAM combined prophylaxis against HBV recurrence after LT.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThis article provides an update on the latest development on deploying oral nucleosides in an immunoglobulin-free regime against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation. Recent findingsEntecavir and tenofovir are the two newer oral nucleosides that are associated with a low virological rebound rate at less than 2% at 5 years. As a result, they have been applied as standalone treatment against HBV recurrence after liver transplantation without immunoglobulin. Recent evidence has shown that a hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance rate of 86% and 91% after 1 and 2 years was achievable with entecavir monotherapy. Moreover, none of the patients had histological graft damage because of HBV recurrence and an overall survival over 80% at 7 years has been reported. SummaryWith newer and more potent oral nucleos(t)ide (NA) available, a hepatitis B immune globulin-free regimen after liver transplantation has become safe and feasible for suppression of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation, and for avoidance of HBV-related graft complications.",

We aimed to report the outcomes of D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) KTx in recipients with or without hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb).\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty-three D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) living KTx cases were retrospectively identified. The 384 cases of KTx from hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)+ living donors to HBcAb- recipients [D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-)] were used as the control group. Primary endpoint was post-transplant HBsAg -\u2192+.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore KTx, 24 donors (28.9%) in the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) group were hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA+, and 20 recipients were HBsAb-. All eighty-three D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) recipients received HBV prophylaxis, while no D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-) recipients received prophylaxis. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range 6-106) and 36 months (range 4-107) for the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) and D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-) groups, respectively, 2/83 (2.41%) D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) recipients and 1/384 (0.26%) D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-) became HBsAg+, accompanied with HBV DNA+ (P=0.083). The three recipients with HBsAg-\u2192+ were exclusively HBsAb-/HBcAb- before KTx. Recipient deaths were more frequent in the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) group (6.02% vs. 1.04%, P=0.011), while liver and graft function, rejection, infection, and graft loss were not significantly different. In univariate analyses, pre-transplant HBsAb-/HBcAb- combination in the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) recipients carried a significantly higher risk of HBsAg-\u2192+, HBV DNA-\u2192+, and death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiving D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) KTx in HBsAb+ recipients provides excellent graft and patient survivals without HBV transmission. HBV transmission risks should be more balanced with respect to benefits of D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) KTx in HBsAb-/HBcAb- candidates.",

        "abstract": "Introduction It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation (KT) from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) +donors\u2009to HBsAg\u2212 recipients (D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg\u2212)) provides comparable transplant outcomes without hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission compared with D(HBsAg\u2212)/R(HBsAg\u2212) KT. Moreover, no consensus has been reached for standardised prophylaxis regimens to prevent HBV transmission after D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg\u2212) KT. We developed stratified prophylaxis regimens, including pretransplant antiviral treatment of donors, and pretransplant hepatitis B vaccination and post-transplant antiviral treatment of recipients, based on donors\u2019 and recipients\u2019 HBV serological characteristics. However, the safety and efficacy of stratified prophylaxis regimens remains unknown. Methods and analysis We are conducting a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Between September 2020 and December 2023, 100 cases of (D(HBsAg+)/R (HBsAg\u2212)) KT will be recruited from four university-affiliated hospitals with a follow-up at least 2 years. They will naturally receive stratified prophylaxis regimens or routine prophylaxis based on clinical experience to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens in (D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg\u2212)) KT. The primary outcome will be post-transplant HBV infection to evaluate safety, defined as post-transplant HBsAg\u2212\u2192+or\u2009HBV DNA\u2212\u2192+. The composite endpoint of prevention failure will be also an endpoint of safety (any one of HBsAg\u2212\u2192+, HBV DNA\u2212\u2192+, HB e antigen\u2212\u2192+, HB e antibody\u2212\u2192+ and HB c antibody\u2212\u2192+). The efficacy will be evaluated by transplant outcomes, including death-censored graft survival, patient survival, acute rejection, delayed graft function and kidney graft function.
