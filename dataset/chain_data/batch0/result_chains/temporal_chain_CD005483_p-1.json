        "title": "Effect of nandrolone decanoate therapy on weight and lean body mass in HIV-infected women with weight loss: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWeight loss is associated with accelerated mortality and disease progression in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although studies have examined a variety of anabolic therapies in HIV-infected men, the safety and efficacy of such treatments in women have not been adequately studied.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase I/II study, 38 HIV-infected women with documented weight loss of 5% or greater in the preceding year or a body mass index of less than 20 kg/m(2) were randomized to receive nandrolone decanoate (100 mg) or an equivalent volume of placebo every other week by intramuscular injection. Subjects received blinded treatment for 12 weeks, followed by open-label therapy for 12 weeks. Lean body mass and fat (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and weight were measured at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Biochemical assessments of safety (hematologic analyses, liver function tests, and sex hormone measurements) were performed at these same time points. Clinical signs and symptoms were monitored biweekly.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects randomized to receive nandrolone had significant increases in weight and lean body mass during blinded treatment (4.6 kg [9.0%] and 3.5 kg [8.6%], respectively; P<.001 vs baseline and placebo in each case). Fat mass did not change statistically significantly in either group. Although there were no statistically significant differences between groups in biochemical measures, the number of grade 3 or greater toxicities, or reports of virilizing effects, a full assessment of safety cannot be made in a trial of this size.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNandrolone decanoate therapy may prove to be generally safe and beneficial in reversing weight loss and lean tissue loss in women with HIV infection and other chronic catabolic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxandrolone in promoting body weight and body cell mass (BCM) gain in HIV-associated weight loss. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred sixty-two HIV-infected men with documented 10% to 20% weight loss or body mass index \u226420 kg/m2 were randomized to placebo or to 20, 40, or 80 mg of oxandrolone daily. After 12 weeks, subjects were allowed to receive open-label oxandrolone at a dose of 20 mg for another 12 weeks. Results: Body weight increased in all groups, including the group receiving placebo, during the double-blind phase (1.1 \u00b1 2.7, 1.8 \u00b1 3.9, 2.8 \u00b1 3.3, and 2.3 \u00b1 2.9 kg in placebo and 20-, 40-, and 80-mg oxandrolone groups, respectively; all P < 0.014 vs. baseline). BCM increased from baseline in all groups (0.45 \u00b1 1.7, 0.91 \u00b1 2.2, 1.5 \u00b1 2.5, and 1.8 \u00b1 1.8 kg in placebo and 20-, 40-, and 80-mg oxandrolone groups, respectively). At 12 weeks, only the gain in weight at the 40-mg dose of oxandrolone and the gain in BCM at the 40- and 80-mg doses of oxandrolone were greater than those in the placebo group, however. Oxandrolone treatment was associated with significant suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and total and free testosterone levels. Treatment was generally well tolerated but accompanied by significant increases in transaminases and low-density lipoprotein as well as decreases in high-density lipoprotein. Conclusion: Oxandrolone administration is effective in promoting dose-dependent gains in body weight and BCM in HIV-infected men with weight loss.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nMen with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) wasting and hypogonadism are frequently treated with testosterone and oxandrolone, an orally administered anabolic-androgenic steroid hormone. We observed reductions in testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, in association with complaints of erectile dysfunction, after prolonged exposure to this therapeutic regimen.\n\n\nAIM\nFirst description of an association between long-term receipt of oxandrolone with erectile dysfunction, low SHBG and testosterone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCase report of three human immunodeficiency virus-infected hypogonadal male patients receiving treatment for wasting syndrome and hypogonadism, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. All three patients received long-term oxandrolone in addition to testosterone replacement therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTestosterone and SHBG levels for patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively: total testosterone 183, 71, and 151 ng/dL (260-1,000 ng/dL); free testosterone (not done for patient 3) 58.3 and 26.9 pg/mL (50-210 pg/mL); SHBG 6, 9, and 6 nmol/L (7-50 nmol/L). No other hormonal abnormalities were detected. Following discontinuation of oxandrolone, levels of total testosterone rose, consistent with increase in SHBG. One patient received repeat SHBG assay documenting rise in SHBG level. Patient 2 reported return of libido and early morning erections several weeks after discontinuation of oxandrolone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients had erectile dysfunction in association with low testosterone and SHBG, in spite of exogenous testosterone replacement. Discontinuation of oxandrolone led to the normalization or improvement of testosterone levels in all three patients with symptomatic improvement in one patient. First pass metabolism of orally administered oxandrolone may decrease hepatic synthesis of SHBG, allowing exogenously supplied testosterone to be excreted. Further work is necessary to elucidate the relationship.",

        "title": "Premature Decline of Serum Total Testosterone in HIV-Infected Men in the HAART-Era",
        "abstract": "Background Testosterone (T) deficiency remains a poorly understood issue in men with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). We investigated the gonadal status in HIV-infected men in order to characterize T deficiency and to identify predictive factors for low serum T. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a cross-sectional, observational study on 1325 consecutive HIV male outpatients, most of them having lipodystrophy. Serum total T<300 ng/dL was used as the threshold for biochemical T deficiency. Morning serum total T, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, HIV parameters, and body composition parameters by CT-scan and Dual-Energy-X-ray-Absorptiometry were measured in each case. Sexual behavior was evaluated in a subset of 247 patients. T deficiency was found in 212 subjects, especially in the age range 40\u201359, but was frequent even in younger patients. T deficiency occurred mainly in association with low/normal serum LH. Adiposity was higher in subjects with T deficiency (p<0.0001) and both visceral adipose tissue and body mass index were the main negative predictors of serum total T. Osteoporosis and erectile dysfunction were present in a similar percentage in men with or without T deficiency. Conclusions/Significance Premature decline of serum T is common (16%) among young/middle-aged HIV-infected men and is associated with inappropriately low/normal LH and increased visceral fat. T deficiency occurs at a young age and may be considered an element of the process of premature or accelerated aging known to be associated with HIV infection. The role of HIV and/or HIV infection treatments, as well as the role of the general health state on the gonadal axis, remains, in fact, to be elucidated. Due to the low specificity of signs and symptoms of hypogonadism in the context of HIV, caution is needed in the diagnosis of hypogonadism in HIV-infected men with biochemical low serum T levels.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is common among elderly men and patients suffering from chronic diseases, the latter probably including also HIV infection. No studies, however, compared the prevalence of ED in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals using the international index of erectile function (IIEF-15).\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim of this study is to compare ED prevalence in young to middle-aged men with and without HIV infection using the IIEF-15 questionnaire.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, observational, controlled study on 444 HIV-infected men and 71 HIV-uninfected men.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES\nThe IIEF-15 questionnaire was used to assess ED. A cutoff score of \u226425 of the erectile domain was used to diagnose ED. Serum testosterone, demographic, and anthropometric (weight, height, and body mass index [BMI]) characteristics were obtained from all participants. Statistics included the T-test, the Fisher's test, univariable and multivariable logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate Spearman's correlation analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe HIV-uninfected group was significantly younger than the HIV-infected group and presented a higher BMI (P\u2003<\u20030.001). The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe ED was higher in HIV-infected men than in HIV-uninfected men of all decades of age. In univariate analysis, HIV infection was associated with ED (odds ratio [OR]\u2003=\u200334.19, P\u2003<\u20030.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, HIV infection remained the strongest predictors of ED (OR\u2003=\u200342.26, P\u2003<\u20030.001) followed by hypogonadism, after adjusting for age and BMI.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates a clear association between ED and HIV infection, after adjusting for age and BMI. Other than HIV infection, hypogonadism was associated with ED. In addition, the prevalence of ED was higher in HIV-infected men than in HIV-uninfected men, in all decades of age. The early onset of ED in HIV-infected men could be considered a peculiar clinical hallmark of HIV and confirms precocious aging in these patients. ED should be of concern to clinicians when managing HIV-infected men even if the latter are young or middle aged.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is more prevalent in men living with HIV (MLHIV) when compared with age-matched HIV-negative men. This may be related to a premature decline in testosterone levels. In the general population, ED has been associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of ED, testosterone deficiency, and risk of CHD in a cohort of young to middle-aged MLHIV in Belgium.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional, observational study among 244 MLHIV attending the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe short version of the international index of erectile function (IIEF-5) questionnaire diagnosed ED (cutoff score \u2264 21). The 10-year risk score for CHD was calculated. In a subset of men reporting ED, the calculated free testosterone (CFT) was determined using Vermeulen's formula. Testosterone deficiency was defined as CFT <0.22 nmol/L.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred fifty-one men (61.9%) self-reported ED (median IIEF-5 score: 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 12-19]). In multivariate analysis, only increasing age, but none of the HIV-related parameters, nor any of the individual cardiovascular-risk related parameters, was statistically significantly associated with ED. Eighteen out of the 49 (36.7%) men with ED who received a blood test to assess testosterone levels were diagnosed with testosterone deficiency. The 10-year risk of CHD in the cohort was 4.3% (IQR 3.6-5.7) and was significantly higher in men with ED (5.1%, IQR 4.4-6.6) compared with men without ED (3.1%, IQR 2.5-4.2).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study showed that ED and testosterone deficiency are highly prevalent in young to middle-aged MLHIV and that ED might be associated with an increased risk of CHD. Therefore, healthcare professionals should screen for clinical ED and should consider testing for underlying testosterone deficiency. A clinical diagnosis of ED should trigger a full evaluation of the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, even at younger age.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\u2013infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function\u20135 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence.",

        "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy has reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality. In the daily life of people living with HIV (PLWHIV), quality of life (QoL) has become a key concern, gaining increasing attention in the HIV research field. Low QoL influences treatment adherence, medical treatment outcomes, and access to care. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors influencing the QoL of PLWHIV in Finland and to compare it with the QoL of Portuguese PLWHIV, of the general population, and of patients with other chronic diseases (asthma, diabetes, and arthritis), and thus to provide healthcare professionals with tools to identify individuals most at risk for impaired QoL. Finnish data were collected by self-administered questionnaires (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF, 15D and our own questionnaire) and from patients\u2019 electronic medical records. Individuals were recruited from four different sites (Infectious Disease Clinic of Helsinki University Hospital, Hivpoint, Hiv Finland, and Helsinki Deaconess Institute). All the engaged participants received care and were followed up in the Infectious Disease Clinic of Helsinki University Hospital. In Study I, the properties of the Finnish version of the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF were explored by comparing the results obtained with the Finnish WHOQOL-HIV-BREF version with those obtained with the generic 15D instrument. In Study II, the QoL of PLWHIV was compared in Finnish and in Portuguese PLWHIV. This comparison was based on the results obtained with the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF instrument. Study III explored the influence of sociodemographic and HIV-related variables on the QoL, measured by the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF, of PLWHIV in Finland. Study IV assessed HIV-related self-stigma and the impact of self-stigma on health-related QoL (HRQoL) of the Finnish PLWHIV measured both by the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF and the 15D instruments. In Study V, the HRQoL of PLWHIV in Finland was compared with that of the general population and of patients with other chronic diseases (asthma, diabetes, and arthritis); in that study, the HRQoL was measured with the 15D instrument. A total of 453 PLWHIV from Finland were included in the thesis study. The most common modes of transmission were sexual contact among men having sex with men (55%) and among heterosexuals (33%). Of all the participants, 95% were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The Finnish version of the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF showed satisfactory psychometric properties. However, the ability of the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF to assess physical and physiological dimensions of QoL was poor when compared to that of the 15D. PLWHIV in Finland reported better QoL than did those living in Portugal after controlling for sociodemographic and HIV-related variables. The QoL of PLWHIV in Finland is strongly influenced by psychological and socio-demographic variables and HIV-related stigma. HIV-related variables were not associated with the QoL in this population with well-controlled HIV infection. High levels of self-stigma were negatively associated with HRQoL and QoL and strongly associated with socio-demographic variables. When compared with the HRQoL of the general population, PLWHIV\u2019s HRQoL was statistically significantly and clinically importantly lower, but did not differ from that of patients with the other chronic diseases (asthma, diabetes, and arthritis). PLWHIV were worst off in the psychological and sexual activity dimensions in both comparisons. Psychosocial factors are the core of the QoL of PLWHIV. In the era of modern cART, HIV-related factors do not seem to be associated with the QoL of PLWHIV. Further efforts must be devoted to identifying and developing adequate interventions to improve PLWHIV\u2019s QoL. TIIVISTELM\u00c4 Antiretroviraalil\u00e4\u00e4kitys on v\u00e4hent\u00e4nyt HIV:st\u00e4 johtuvaa sairastavuutta ja kuolleisuutta. HIVpotilaiden jokap\u00e4iv\u00e4isess\u00e4 el\u00e4m\u00e4ss\u00e4 keskeiseksi huolenaiheeksi on noussut el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatu, johon kiinnitet\u00e4\u00e4n yh\u00e4 enemm\u00e4n huomiota HIV-tutkimuksessa. El\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatu vaikuttaa hoitoon hakeutumiseen, siihen sitoutumiseen ja hoitotuloksiin. T\u00e4m\u00e4n tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on selvitt\u00e4\u00e4 tekij\u00f6it\u00e4, jotka vaikuttavat HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun Suomessa ja verrata sit\u00e4 Portugalin HIVpotilaiden, suomalaisen v\u00e4est\u00f6n ja er\u00e4it\u00e4 muita kroonisia tauteja (astma, diabetes ja niveltulehdus) sairastavien potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun. Tutkimuksen tulokset tarjoavat terveydenhuollon ammattilaisille ty\u00f6kaluja niiden potilaiden tunnistamiseen, joiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatu on eniten vaarassa heikenty\u00e4. Suomen aineisto ker\u00e4ttiin kyselylomakkeilla, jotka vastaajat t\u00e4yttiv\u00e4t itsen\u00e4isesti (WHOQOL-HIVBREF, 15D ja oma kyselylomake) sek\u00e4 potilaan hoitotiedoista.

Kaikki osallistujat saivat hoitoa ja olivat seurannassa Helsingin yliopistollisen keskussairaalan Infektiosairauksien poliklinikalla. Tutkimuksessa I tutkittiin WHOQOL-HIV-BREF:n suomalaisen version ominaisuuksia vertailemalla, sill\u00e4 saatuja tuloksia geneerisell\u00e4 15D-mittarilla saatuihin tuloksiin suomalaisilla HIVpotilailla. Tutkimuksessa II verrattiin HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatua WHOQOL-HIV-BREF:ll\u00e4 mitattuna Suomessa ja Portugalissa. Tutkimuksessa III selvitettiin sosiodemografisten ja HIV:iin liittyvien muuttujien yhteytt\u00e4 Suomessa asuvien HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun WHOQOL-HIVBREF:lla mitattuna. Tutkimuksessa IV analysoitiin HIV:n aiheuttamaa stigmaa ja stigman vaikutusta terveyteen liittyv\u00e4\u00e4n el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun Suomessa asuvilla HIV-potilailla.

T\u00e4ss\u00e4 tutkimuksessa el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatua mitattiin 15D:ll\u00e4. Tutkimukseen osallistui Suomessa yhteens\u00e4 453 HIV\u2013potilasta. Yleisimm\u00e4t tartuntatavat olivat miesten v\u00e4linen seksi (55 %) ja heteroseksi (33 %). Kaikista osallistujista 95 % sai antiretroviraalista yhdistelm\u00e4hoitoa (cART). WHOQOL-HIV-BREF:n suomalainen versio osoittautui psykometrisilt\u00e4 ominaisuuksiltaan tyydytt\u00e4v\u00e4ksi. WHOQOL-HIV-BREF:n kyky arvioida el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaadun fyysisi\u00e4 ja fysiologisia ulottuvuuksia oli kuitenkin heikko verrattuna 15D:n (I). HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatu oli parempi Suomessa kuin Portugalissa, kun sosiodemografiset ja HIV:iin liittyv\u00e4t muuttujat oli vakioitu. Molemmissa maissa el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun vaikuttivat voimakkaasti fyysiset, psykologiset ja riippumattomuuteen liittyv\u00e4t tekij\u00e4t (II). HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun Suomessa vaikuttivat voimakkaasti sosiodemografiset ja psykologiset tekij\u00e4t. HIV:iin liittyv\u00e4t muuttujat eiv\u00e4t olleet yhteydess\u00e4 el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun t\u00e4ss\u00e4 potilasjoukossa, jonka HIV-infektio oli hyv\u00e4ss\u00e4 hoitotasapainossa (III). Stigman samoin kuin taloudellisten vaikeuksien yhteys el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun oli negatiivinen ja stigmaan olivat yhteydess\u00e4 negatiivisesti mm. yhdess\u00e4 asuminen ja miessukupuoli (IV). Verrattuna ik\u00e4ja sukupuolivakioituun v\u00e4est\u00f6\u00f6n HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatu oli tilastollisesti merkitsev\u00e4sti ja kliinisesti merkitt\u00e4v\u00e4sti huonompi, mutta se ei eronnut muita kroonisia tauteja (astma, diabetes ja niveltulehdus) sairastavien el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaadusta. Huonoin tilanne HIV-potilailla oli molemmissa vertailuissa el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaadun psyykkisill\u00e4 ja sukupuoliel\u00e4m\u00e4n ulottuvuuksilla (V). Psykososiaaliset tekij\u00e4t ovat HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaadun ytimess\u00e4. Nykyaikaisen antiretroviraalisen yhdistelm\u00e4hoidon aikakaudella HIV:iin liittyv\u00e4t tekij\u00e4t eiv\u00e4t n\u00e4yt\u00e4 olevan yhteydess\u00e4 HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaatuun. Lis\u00e4toimia tarvitaan asianmukaisten toimenpiteiden tunnistamiseen ja kehitt\u00e4miseen HIV-potilaiden el\u00e4m\u00e4nlaadun parantamiseksi.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS in Finland, which is related to the source paper's focus on clinical and emotional factors related to erectile dysfunction in HIV-infected men. However, the connection is not direct, and the paper does not build upon the source paper's findings. The paper is more focused on the general quality of life of HIV-infected individuals, whereas the source paper is focused on a specific aspect of their health."
