        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare two regimens of pantoprazole administered intravenously in patients with ulcerative gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB), and a high risk of presenting with persitent or recurrent hemorrhage.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nPatients were randomized into two groups: group 0--treatment with a 80 mg bolus of pantoprazole administered intravenously, followed by continuous infusion of 8 mg/h for 72 hours; group 1--treatment with 40 mg of pantoprazole administered intravenously on a daily basis. The percentage of hemorrhagic persistence/recurrence in both groups was analyzed, as were transfusion requirements, need for surgery, and mortality resulting from the hemorrhagic episode.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 20 patients in group 0 and 21 in group 1. No differences were found between groups in terms of gender, age, smoking habits, use of NSAIDs, presence of hemodynamic instability or stigmata in ulcer crater (Forrest Ia: 5 vs. 14.3%, p = 0.322; Forrest Ib: 30 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.819; Forrest IIa: 60 vs. 50.1%, p = 0.753). In group 0, 90% of patients received endoscopic treatment, versus 100% in group 1, p = 0.232. In group 0, 50% of patients had a transfusion, as compared to 52.4% in group 1, p = 0.879. In group 0, 2 patients (10.5%) presented with recurrent hemorrhage, versus 3 patients (14.3%) in group 1. Surgery was required by 1 person from each group, and 1 patient in group 0 died.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMaximum acid inhibition with a bolus and then a continuous infusion of pantoprazole does not yield better results than treatment with conventional doses in acute hemorrhagic episodes.",

        "abstract": "Summary Background Until now there has been no study that directly compares the effect of lansoprazole and pantoprazole administered intravenously on intragastric acidity. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of lansoprazole (30 mg) and pantoprazole (40 mg) administered intravenously on gastric acidity. Material/Methods Helicobacter pylori-negative healthy volunteers were recruited in this open-label, randomized, two-way crossover, single centre study. Lansoprazole at 30 mg or pantoprazole at 40 mg was intravenously administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days with at least a 14-day washout interval. Twenty-four-hour intragastric pH was continuously monitored on days 1 and 5 of each dosing period. Results Twenty-five volunteers completed the 2 dosing periods. The mean intragastric pH values were higher in subjects treated with lansoprazole than those with pantoprazole on both day 1 (6.41\u00b10.14 vs. 5.49\u00b10.13, P=0.0003) and day 5 (7.09\u00b10.07 vs. 6.64\u00b10.07, P=0.0002). Significantly higher percentages of time with intragastric pH >4 and pH >6 were found in the subjects treated with lansoprazole than those with pantoprazole on day 1 (pH >4, 87.12\u00b14.55% vs. 62.28\u00b14.15%, P=0.0012; pH >6, 62.12\u00b14.12% vs. 47.25\u00b13.76%, P=0.0216) and pH >6 on day 5 (76.79\u00b13.77% vs. 58.20\u00b13.77%, P=0.0025). Conclusions Intravenous lansoprazole produces a longer and more potent inhibitory effect on intragastric acidity than does intravenous pantoprazole.",
