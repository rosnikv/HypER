        "title": "Effect of exercise and Cimicifuga racemosa (CR BNO 1055) on bone mineral density, 10-year coronary heart disease risk, and menopausal complaints: the randomized controlled Training and Cimicifuga racemosa Erlangen (TRACE) study",
        "abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the effect of periodized exercise training with and without Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in early postmenopausal women. Methods:A total of 128 women were randomly assigned to three subgroups: exercise (EG, n = 43), exercise and CR supplementation (EGCR, n = 43), and wellness control (control group [CG], n = 42). Both exercise groups performed a periodized exercise program with high-intensity-resistance/high-impact exercise dedicated to bone parameters interspersed by blocks of 10 weeks of training focusing on CHD parameters. In addition to the exercise program, the EGCR was supplemented with 40 mg/day of CR according to the specification of the manufacturer. A low-intensity exercise program of 60 minutes per week for a period of 10 weeks interspersed with 10-week blocks without exercise was performed in the CG. Primary endpoints were BMD and 10-year CHD risk proposed by Wilson. Secondary endpoints were body composition and menopausal symptoms. Results:BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained in both exercise groups (EG, \u22120.1% \u00b1 2.2%, P = 0.74; EGCR, \u22120.4% \u00b1 2.4%, P = 0.40) and significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the CG (2.0% \u00b1 2.0%). Both exercise groups significantly differed from the CG (P = 0.001 and 0.005 for the EG and EGCR, respectively); however, no differences between the exercise groups with and without CR was determined. Although slight increases in femoral neck BMD were determined in both exercise groups (EG, 0.5% \u00b1 3.0%, P = 0.36; EGCR, 0.4% \u00b1 3.1%, P = 0.52), a reduction was assessed in the CG (\u22120.6% \u00b1 2.7%, P = 0.29). No significant differences were determined between the groups. The 10-year CHD risk significantly increased in the EGCR (12.9% \u00b1 25.1%, P = 0.018) and in the CG (16.5% \u00b1 27.8%, P = 0.007). The EG did not show corresponding changes (\u22122.7% \u00b1 21.9%, P = 0.60). However, no significant between-group differences were observed. Conclusions:In conclusion our exercise program favorably affected bone, menopausal symptoms, lean body mass, and, to a smaller extent, 10-year CHD risk in early postmenopausal women. Adjuvant supplementation of CR did not enhance these positive effects.",

        "title": "Exercise and osteoporosis-related fractures: perspectives and recommendations of the sports and exercise scientist.",
        "abstract": "Osteoporosis-related fractures represent a major health concern, particularly in elderly populations. Direct and indirect costs (amounting to nearly $17 billion in 2005), increased morbidity, and loss of independence place substantial burden on the health care system. Observational studies have shown that a physically active lifestyle is associated with a 30% to 50% decrease in vertebral or hip fractures, and a recent meta-analysis that determined the effects of exercise on fracture incidence further confirmed these results. However, because no randomized controlled exercise trials have selected fractures as a primary endpoint, causality between a sedentary lifestyle and fractures may be potentially confounded by participants' poor health status. With regard to fall reduction and bone strength as the main surrogates for fracture risk, many randomized controlled trials and corresponding meta-analyses have reported significant positive outcomes. Interestingly, no study that has assessed fall-related injuries has focused specifically on interventions that aimed to reduce fall impact. There is ongoing debate as to which factor, osteoporosis or falls, is more important for fracture prevention. This may be dependent on the region prone to fracture and the subjects' health status. In randomized controlled trials on exercise, the type, mode, and composition of exercise parameters are predictors of study outcome. Unfortunately, many exercise trials on fall prevention have not adequately described the exercise protocol used, which makes it difficult to determine which fall prevention protocol was most effective. A recent meta-analysis recommended Tai Chi and/or a mix of balance and resistance exercises for fall prevention. More sophisticated protocols are required to impact bone strength. Corresponding state-of-the-art protocols have focused on periodized high-impact/high-intensity resistance protocols performed at least twice per week. In the frail elderly, high-frequency/high-cycle number exercise programs with low-to-moderate strain intensity may also positively affect bone strength.",

        "title": "Dose\u2013response effect of exercise frequency on bone mineral density in post\u2010menopausal, osteopenic women",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the long\u2010term dose\u2013response relationship of exercise frequency on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in early post\u2010menopausal women with osteopenia. Based on the 12\u2010year results of the consequently supervised exercise group (EG) of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study, we retrospectively structured two exercise groups according to the overall exercise frequency. Changes in aBMD at lumbar spine and proximal femur as assessed by dual\u2010energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry technique were compared between a low\u2010frequency exercise group (LEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200916) with 1.5\u2013<2 sessions/week and a high\u2010frequency exercise group (HEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200925) with \u22652\u20133.5 sessions/week. Changes in aBMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur were significantly more favorable in the HEF\u2010EG compared with the LEF\u2010EG; lumbar spine: (mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7% vs \u22124.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.001, ES: d'\u2009=\u20091.26; total hip: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs \u22126.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.045, ES: d'\u2009=\u20090.70). BMD results of the LEF\u2010EG did not significantly differ from the data of the non\u2010training control group (lumbar spine: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2%, total hip: \u22126.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0%). Although this result might not be generalizable across all exercise types and cohorts, it indicates that to impact bone, an overall exercise frequency of at least 2 sessions/week may be crucial, even if exercise is applied with high intensity/impact.",

        "title": "Long\u2010Term Exercise and Bone Mineral Density Changes in Postmenopausal Women\u2014Are There Periods of Reduced Effectiveness?",
        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that physical exercise can prevent fractures in postmenopausal women. However, even with careful adaptation of the exercise program to subjects' changing bone, health, and fitness status, effectivity may still decrease over the time. This could be specifically the case where the limitations of higher age collide with the specification of the exercise program. Thus, the aim of this study was to monitor bone mineral density (BMD) changes over a 16\u2010year period of supervised exercise. Our hypothesis was that BMD differences at lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) between exercisers (EG) and nontraining controls (CG) increased throughout the intervention with significant differences for each of the four 4\u2010year observation periods. Sixty\u2010seven (EG, n = 39 versus CG, n = 28) initially early\u2010postmenopausal osteopenic women of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study (EFOPS) with complete BMD data sets for baseline (1998) and 4\u2010, 8\u2010, 12\u2010, and 16\u2010year follow\u2010up were included in the analysis. The exercise protocol initially focused on a high\u2010intensity strategy that addressed bone but increasingly shifted to a more comprehensive intervention. LS\u2010BMD differences between the EG and CG continuously increased (year 4: 2.4% (95%\u2010 Confidence Interval 1.0% to 3.8%), year 8: 3.1% (1.6% to 4.7%), year 12: 3.9% (1.9% to 5.8), year 16: 4.5% (2.5% to 6.6%). Correspondingly, rising differences for FN\u2010BMD (0.9% (\u20130.2% to 2.1%) versus 1.9% (0.4% to 3.3%) versus 2.0% (0.5% to 3.8%) versus 3.0% (1.0% to 5.0%)) were observed. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, group differences within the four 4\u2010year periods were not consistently significant (LS, p = 0.001 to 0.097; FN, p = 0.026 to 0.673); further, BMD kinetics among the groups varied between LS and FN. Of particular importance, significant differences (p \u2264 0.030) for both regions were still found in the final period. We conclude that exercise\u2014even when adapted for subjects' decreasing bone, health, and fitness status\u2014is consistently effective in favorably affecting BMD in (initially) early\u2010postmenopausal osteopenic women without any leveling\u2010off effect after 16 years of exercise. \u00a9 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Multimorbidity related to menopause and/or increased age will put healthcare systems in western nations under ever-greater strain. Effective strategies to prevent diseases are thus of high priority and should be started earlier in life. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the long-term effect of exercise on different important health parameters in initially early postmenopausal women over a 16-year period. Methods: In 1998, 137 early postmenopausal women with osteopenia living in Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg were included in the study. Eighty-six women joined the exercise group (EG) and conducted two supervised group and two home training sessions per week, whereas the control group (CG: n\u200a=\u200a51) maintained their physical activity level. Primary outcome parameters were clinical overall fractures incidence; secondary study endpoint was Framingham study-based 10-year risk of coronary death/myocardial infarction and low back pain. Results: In 2014, 59 women of the EG and 46 women of the CG were included in the 16-year follow-up analysis. Framingham study-based 10-year risk of myocardial infarction/coronary death increased significantly (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) in both groups; however, changes were significantly more favorable in the EG (5.00%\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.94% vs CG: 6.90%\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.98%; P\u200a=\u200a0.02). The ratio for clinical \u201coverall\u201d fractures was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.24-0.92; P\u200a=\u200a0.03), and thus significantly lower in the EG. Although we focused on a high-intensity exercise strategy, low back pain was favorably affected in the EG. Conclusions: Multipurpose exercise programs demonstrated beneficial effects on various relevant risk factors and diseases of menopause or/and increased age, and should thus be preferentially applied for primary or secondary prevention in postmenopausal women.",
