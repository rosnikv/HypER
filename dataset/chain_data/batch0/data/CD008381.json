        "Abstract":"Depression is a prevalent and chronic condition in diabetes and is associated with poor glucose regulation and poor compliance with diabetes treatment. This investigation evaluated the effects of nortriptyline on depression and glycemic control to see whether depression in diabetes is treatable and whether restoring mental health contributes to improved medical outcome.\n                Sixty-eight diabetic patients with poor glycemic control, 28 of whom had active major depression (DSM-IIIR), completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 8 weeks of treatment with nortriptyline targeted to therapeutic plasma levels (50-150 ng\/ml). Depression improvement was determined with the Beck Depression Inventory; glucose control was measured by glycated hemoglobin levels. Compliance behavior was assessed using medication dispensing devices and glucometers equipped with electronic memory.\n                The reduction in depression symptoms was significantly greater in depressed patients treated with nortriptyline compared with those receiving placebo (-10.2 vs -5.8, p = .03). Nortriptyline was not statistically superior to placebo in reducing glycated hemoglobin of the depressed subjects (p = .5). However, path analysis indicated that the direct effect of nortriptyline was to worsen glycemic control whereas depression improvement had an independent beneficial effect on glycated hemoglobin. These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or depression improvement to compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).\n                Major depression in diabetic patients can be effectively treated with nortriptyline at the expense of a direct hyperglycemic effect. Path analysis demonstrated a treatment-independent effect of depression improvement on glycemic control, suggesting that a more ideal antidepressant agent may both restore mental health and improve medical outcome.",

All patients participated in a diabetes education program to control for the effects of supportive attention and the possible influence of enhanced diabetes control on mood.\n                Degree of depression was measured by using the Beck Depression Inventory; glycemic control was measured by using glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Outcomes were assessed immediately after treatment and 6 months after treatment.\n                The percentage of patients achieving remission of depression (Beck Depression Inventory score < or = 9) was greater in the CBT group than in the control group: posttreatment, 85.0% of patients in the CBT group (17 of 20) compared with 27.3% of controls (6 of 22) achieved remission (difference, 57.7 percentage points [95% CI, 33 to 82 percentage points]) (P < 0.001); at follow-up, 70.0% of patients in the CBT group (14 of 20) compared with 33.3% of controls (7 of 21) achieved remission (difference, 36.7 percentage points [CI, 9 to 65 percentage points]) (P = 0.03).

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of fluoxetine for depression in patients with diabetes.\n                Sixty patients with diabetes (type 1, n = 26; type 2, n = 34) and major depressive disorder entered an 8-week randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.

The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the antidepressant paroxetine on metabolic control, quality of life and mental well-being in mildly depressed women with type 2 diabetes.\n                We randomised 15 mildly depressed women with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes to a 10-week single-blind treatment with either paroxetine 20 mg per day or placebo. Primary efficacy measurements were glycemic control and quality of life. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (GHbA1c) was used as a measure of glycemic control. Quality of life was evaluated using RAND-36. Mental state was assessed using two clinician-rated scoring instruments, Hamilton's Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Montgomery-Asberg's Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and a patient-rated scoring instrument, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI).\n                At the end of the study no significant difference between groups in improvement of quality of life was found. A trend towards a superior improvement in glycemic control was found in the paroxetine group (p = 0.08). A superior increase in sex-hormone-binding-globuline (SHBG) levels was evidenced in the paroxetine group (p = 0.01) as a sign of improved insulin sensitivity. There was also a trend for superior efficacy of paroxetine in investigator-rated anxiety and depression. This notion was supported by a trend for superior decrease of serum cortisol levels in the paroxetine group (p = 0.06).\n                Paroxetine has a beneficial effect on measures of insulin sensitivity and may improve glycemic control. Larger studies of longer duration are needed to verify the benefits of paroxetine in type 2 diabetes. While waiting for more conclusive evidence it seems sensible to augment standard care of type 2 diabetes with paroxetine even in patients who do not fulfil routine psychiatric criteria for initiation of antidepressant drug treatment.",

        "Abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral magnesium supplementation, with magnesium chloride (MgCl2), in the treatment of newly diagnosed depression in the elderly with type 2 diabetes and hypomagnesemia. Twenty-three elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and hypomagnesemia were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either 50 mL of MgCl2 5% solution equivalent to 450 mg of elemental magnesium or Imipramine 50 mg daily during 12 weeks. Widowhood or divorce in the last six months, alcoholism, degenerative illnesses of the nervous central system, recent diagnosis of diabetes, previous or current treatment with antidepressants, chronic diarrhea, use of diuretics, and reduced renal function were exclusion criteria. Hypomagnesemia was defined by serum magnesium levels < 1.8 mg\/dL and depression by Yasavage and Brink score > or = 11 points. The primary trial end point was the improvement of depression symptoms. At baseline, there were no differences by age (69 +\/- 5.9 and 66.4 +\/- 6.1 years, p = 0.39), duration of diabetes (11.8 +\/- 7.9 and 8.6 +\/- 5.7 years, p = 0.33), serum magnesium levels (1.3 +\/- 0.04 and 1.4 +\/- 0.04 mg\/dL, p = 0.09), and Yasavage and Brink Score (17.9 +\/- 3.9 and 16.1 +\/- 4.5 point, p = 0.34) in the groups with MgCl2 and imipramine, respectively. At end of follow-up, there were no significant differences in the Yasavage and Brink score (11.4 +\/- 3.8 and 10.9 +\/- 4.3, p = 0.27) between the groups in study; whereas serum magnesium levels were significantly higher in the group with MgCl2 (2.1 +\/- 0.08 mg\/dL) than in the subjects with imipramine (1.5 +\/- 0.07 mg\/dL), p < 0.0005.

Psychotherapy treatments in diabetes mellitus can lead to improvements in both depressive symptoms and glycaemic control. The objective of this study was to investigate whether depressive symptoms can be reduced by psychotherapy treatment delivered as a joint interdisciplinary service to in-patients with diabetic foot syndrome and comorbid depression.\n                Thirty in-patients with diabetic foot syndrome and comorbid depression were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 15) with supportive psychotherapy treatment or a control group (n = 15) that received only standard medical treatment.

These recorded sociodemographic variables, anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and diabetes-related problems (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale).\n                Although the diabetic foot syndrome improved significantly in 75% of patients, the extent of depressive symptoms and anxiety reported by the control group did not decrease by the end of treatment. In contrast, in the intervention group, anxiety, depression and diabetes-related problems were all reduced. The extent of anxiety and depression was not, as had been anticipated, associated with the severity of the physical symptoms.\n                These results indicate that psychotherapeutic intervention during in-patient treatment can have a positive influence on anxiety, depressive symptoms and diabetes-related problems in patients with diabetic foot syndrome.",

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and fasting blood sugar (FBS) was obtained to monitor glycemic control.\n                After the 12-week treatment, both groups showed significant improvement in severity of depression, FBS, and HbA1c. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of improvement in depression and diabetic status.\n                Fluoxetine and Citalopram can effectively reduce the severity of depression in diabetic patients without an adverse effect on glycemic control.",
