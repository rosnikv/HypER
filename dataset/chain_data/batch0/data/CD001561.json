        "Title":"Multiple risk factor intervention trial. Risk factor changes and mortality results. Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial Research Group.",
        "Abstract":"The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial was a randomized primary prevention trial to test the effect of a multifactor intervention program on mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in 12,866 high-risk men aged 35 to 57 years. Men were randomly assigned either to a special intervention (SI) program consisting of stepped-care treatment for hypertension, counseling for cigarette smoking, and dietary advice for lowering blood cholesterol levels, or to their usual sources of health care in the community (UC). Over an average follow-up period of seven years, risk factor levels declined in both groups, but to a greater degree for the SI men. Mortality from CHD was 17.9 deaths per 1,000 in the SI group and 19.3 per 1,000 in the UC group, a statistically nonsignificant difference of 7.1% (90% confidence interval, -15% to 25). Total mortality rates were 41.2 per 1,000 (SI) and 40.4 per 1,000 (UC). Three possible explanations for these findings are considered: (1) the overall intervention program, under these circumstances, does not affect CHD mortality; (2) the intervention used does affect CHD mortality, but the benefit was not observed in this trial of seven years' average duration, with lower-than-expected mortality and with considerable risk factor change in the UC group; and (3) measures to reduce cigarette smoking and to lower blood cholesterol levels may have reduced CHD mortality within subgroups of the SI cohort, with a possibly unfavorable response to antihypertensive drug therapy in certain but not all hypertensive subjects. This last possibility was considered most likely, needs further investigation, and lends support to some preventive measures while requiring reassessment of others.",

        "Title":"Five-year blood pressure control and mortality following health education for hypertensive patients.",
        "Abstract":"Three health education interventions for urban poor hypertensive patients were introduced sequentially in a randomized factorial design: 1) an exit interview to increase understanding of and compliance with the prescribed regimen; 2) a home visit to encourage a family member to provide support for the patient's regimen; and 3) invitations to small group sessions to increase the patient's confidence and ability to manage his\/her problem. Previous evaluation of the initial two-year experience demonstrated a positive effect of the educational program on compliance with the medical treatment and blood pressure control. Data accumulated over an additional three years, including mortality analysis, are now presented. The study group consisted of the same cohort of 400 ambulatory hypertensive outpatients in the eight experimental and control groups. The five-year analysis shows a continuing positive effect on appointment keeping, weight control, and blood pressure control. All-cause life table mortality rate was 57.3 per cent less for the experimental group compared to the control group (12.9\/100 vs 30.2\/100, p less than .05), while the hypertension-related mortality rate was 53.2 per cent less (8.9\/100 vs 19.0\/100, p less than .01). The results from this longitudinal study provide evidence to encourage health practitioners to utilize such educational programs in the long-term management and control of high blood pressure.",

        "Abstract":"Tests of behavioral interventions seldom examine changes in health beliefs and behaviors thought to be prerequisites of improved outcome health states and they do not attempt to specify how patient characteristics or pretest measures influence responses to the intervention. In this study an experimental nursing intervention, its impact on hypertensive patients' beliefs about their disease, efficacy of medications and diet, as well as blood pressure and weight are described. Among patients from the experimental group, the ability of selected pretest variables to predict clinical outcomes and changes in clinical health states was evaluated. The intervention was successful in lowering diastolic blood pressure and altering certain beliefs held by the patients. The pretest characteristics were not successful in explaining hypertensive patients' responses to the intervention. Explanations for this are pursued through remarks from the content analysis of the intervention protocol. From these observations, the original health belief model was revised. The discussion concludes with a set of research questions that may prove promising for future research.",

A matched high-risk control group (n = 610) and a low-risk control group (n = 593) were not treated. The program markedly improved the risk factor status, yet the five-year coronary incidence tended to be higher in the intervention group than in the control group (3.1% vs 1.5%), while the stroke incidence was significantly reduced (1.3% vs 0%). The coronary events tended to be accumulated in subgroups treated with beta-blocking agents or clofibrate, but there were few in those receiving probucol or diuretics. Thus, the intervention program significantly reduced development of stroke, but the occurrence of cardiac events was not prevented. Possible adverse drug effects offsetting the probable benefit of improved risk profile are not excluded.",

All the patients were given a device to measure their blood pressure at home and had monthly checks at a health centre. Two hundred patients on antihypertensive drugs (G1) started additional non-pharmacological therapy after 1 year in the study, while the rest (G2) had used it from the beginning. Antihypertensive drugs were withdrawn according to predetermined criteria. The drop-out rate was 1.5% each year. Medication was withdrawn completely from 42.7% of G1, and in 21.5% it was withheld for at least 18 months. The corresponding figures for G2 were 46.4% and 25.5% respectively. Most of the medication withdrawal in G1 occurred during the first year, when the group's management consisted solely of blood pressure measurements at home and frequent visits to the health centre. Serum triglycerides decreased on non-pharmacological treatment in both sexes in both groups. Life quality improved, particularly for the group (n = 173) that had the drugs withdrawn.",

The incidence of hypertension was 8.8% among 102 intervention group participants vs 19.2% among 99 control group members. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension in the control group was 2.4. Mean trial blood pressure also was lower in the intervention compared with the control group (-1.2 and -1.9 mm Hg, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure at work-site and office visits and -1.3 and -2.0 mm Hg, respectively, for systolic blood pressure at the two sites). Net weight loss in the intervention group averaged 2.7 kg during the trial; sodium intake was reduced by 25% and reported alcohol intake decreased by 30%. The majority of intervention participants also reported an increase in physical activity. Effect on blood pressure was related particularly to degree of weight loss. Results indicate that even a moderate reduction in risk factors for hypertension among hypertension-prone individuals contributes to the primary prevention of the disease.",

The men and their families were randomly allocated to a control or intervention condition. The intervention families were given advice on diet, smoking, and exercise. At rescreening in 1986\/1987, significantly lower risk factor levels were found in both the intervention men and their spouses compared with those in the control group.

The examinations included interviews by a nutritionist, pertinent laboratory tests, and a medical examination. The intervention involved an individually planned energy-restricted diet of 1000-1500 kcal per day, weekly discussions, and various leaflets on diet modification and on increase of physical activity. The mean body weight was reduced by 5 kg in the intervention group, but remained unchanged in the control group. The intervention group reduced their fat intake by 14 g\/day while the control group increased it by 9 g\/day on the average.

        "Abstract":"Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are, in some prospective studies, linked to an increased cardiovascular risk, at least in men. We tested the hypothesis that hyperinsulinaemia may be reduced by non-pharmacological methods independently of other cardiovascular risk factors.\n                In a non-pharmacological intervention study for 1 year three groups of subjects (hypertensives as well as normotensives) were selected after stratification for insulin level at baseline. Half of the hyperinsulinaemic subjects were randomly assigned to active intervention with physical exercise and dietary regulation (HI-A group), the other half were followed passively during the study period (HI-P group). Normo-insulinaemics and hypo(low)-insulinaemics also underwent active intervention (NI-A and LI-A groups, respectively).\n                Primary health care in Sweden.\n                During the 1-year follow-up subjects in the HI-A group reduced their weight, waist:hip ratio and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as their low:high-density lipoprotein (LDL:HDL)-cholesterol ratio. Glucose levels before and during an oral glucose tolerance test did not change. However, plasma insulin and plasma-C-peptide decreased both in the fasting state and after 1 and 2 h of oral glucose tolerance testing. This decrease was independent of the previously mentioned reduction in weight, waist:hip ratio, blood pressure and LDL:HDL-cholesterol ratio. No reduction in insulin levels was seen in the HI-P, NI-A or LI-A groups, but in the HI-P group there was a slight decrease in fasting plasma-C-peptide levels. In the HI-A group dietary improvements were observed during the study period, with a reduction in energy intake, fat consumption and cholesterol intake. Fibre intake was increased. No major changes were seen in the HI-P group.\n                We conclude that in hypertensive and normotensive subjects with hyperinsulinaemia insulin levels can be reduced by active non-pharmacological treatment for 1 year without altering glucose tolerance. This shows that insulin resistance may be lowered by non-pharmacological treatment, which may be of considerable importance, and not only for hypertensives.",

The aim was to examine whether an intensified diet education would result in a better metabolic control and greater reduction in cardiovascular risk factors than conventional treatment for obese patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, both groups were re-examined after a second year of observation period to find out the maintenance of the results after intervention. After basic education, Int. group participated in 12-months diet education, while Conv. group was treated in local health centres. During the intervention period, only Int. group showed further weight reduction. Only 20% of patients in Int. and 6% of patients in Conv. group had BMI < 27 kg\/m2 at the end of the intervention, while 75% of patients in Int. and 52% of patients in Conv. group had achieved a good metabolic control (fasting blood glucose < 6.7 mmol\/l; P = 0.005 between groups). Serum total cholesterol did not change significantly, but the changes in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B level were significant in Int. group only. The proposed acceptable values for serum lipids were achieved by 52 to 88% of patients without major differences between the two groups.

Despite reductions in urinary Na+ (-35 mEq; 95% CI = -50, -19), dietary Na+ (-521 mg; 95% CI = -710, -332), total calories ingested (-238; 95% CI = -335, -140), and weight (-1.4 lb; 95% CI = -3.7, +0.8), and significant increases in dietary K+ (+294 mg; 95% CI = +107, +480) and in mets-minutes of exercise (+43; 95% CI = +20, +67) at three months, assignment to the LFG intervention had no effect on DBP at three or 12 months. The subjects assigned to take propranolol more frequently reported fatigue during ordinary activities, sleep disturbance, decrease in sexual activity, and depressed feelings, when compared with the subjects taking placebo, but the numbers of study withdrawals did not differ by drug assignment. No significant difference in total cholesterol and glucose levels was observed by group assignment. Triglycerides increased significantly in the subjects assigned to propranolol (mean difference = +20 mg\/dL; 95% CI of difference +1.5, +39). There was no difference in the responses to 21 quality of life items between the subjects assigned to propranolol and those assigned to placebo.\n                This multicomponent lifestyle modification intervention was unable to promote persistent behavior changes and thus was inferior to propranolol therapy for the treatment for mild diastolic hypertension. Future research should focus on single modifiable factors to lower blood pressure.",

It was conducted in Yu-Chi district of Nan-Tou county in central Taiwan from 1993 to 1994. The study included blood pressure screening, follow-up, health education, village-based campaigns, and program evaluation after 6 months of intervention. Two villages each were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Intervention comprised visits by trained volunteers to measure blood pressure and body weight, and education related to hypertension. All residents 40 years of age and older were enrolled. A total of 471 residents from the intervention villages and 426 residents from the control villages completed the study. Overall, for the intervention and control groups, the knowledge and behavior related to hypertension improved significantly 6 months after the baseline survey. The improvement was greater in the subgroup of hypertensives in the intervention group than in the controls. The educational intervention also significantly improved the status of awareness, treatment, and the control of hypertension, and reduced blood pressure in the hypertensive subjects. We conclude that a hypertension control program that relies solely on limited community resources is feasible and effective.",

Attendance at a family-based screening clinic after an acute cardiac event could motivate patients and relatives to modify their lifestyles.\n                The Family Atherosclerosis Risk Intervention Study (FARIS) aimed to determine (i) whether a high proportion of patients and relatives would attend a special screening and prevention programme; (ii) whether the risk factor profiles of relatives would be worse than those in the general community; and (iii) whether ongoing management of patients and families together in a special clinic would improve risk factor profiles.\n                Consecutive patients, together with spouse, siblings and offspring, aged 18 to 69 years, were randomly allocated three months after an acute cardiac event to attend a special outpatient clinic, a screening and advice group, or a control group. Risk factor measures were total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDLC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI) and smoking behaviour. This paper presents the risk factor profiles of all FARIS attenders and compares those of family members, age adjusted, with risk factors measured in a multicentre urban cross-sectional survey conducted in the same period. Differences between groups were compared using t-tests for numerical variables and ANOVA and chi-square for categorical variables.\n                Six hundred and twenty-eight patients and 1723 family members were enrolled, representing 85.9% and 82.7% of eligible patients and relatives respectively.

Little is known, however, about the effects of exercise or the NCEP diet, which is moderately low in fat and cholesterol, in persons with lipoprotein levels that place them at high risk for coronary heart disease.\n                We studied plasma lipoprotein levels in 180 postmenopausal women, 45 through 64 years of age, and 197 men, 30 through 64 years of age, who had low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (< or =59 mg per deciliter in women and < or =44 mg per deciliter in men) and moderately elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (>125 mg per deciliter but <210 mg per deciliter in women and >125 mg per deciliter but <190 mg per deciliter in men). The subjects were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise, the NCEP Step 2 diet, or diet plus exercise, or to a control group, which received no intervention.\n                Dietary intake of fat and cholesterol decreased during the one-year study (P<0.001), as did body weight, in women and men in either the diet group or the diet-plus-exercise group, as compared with the controls (P<0.001) and the exercise group (P<0.05), in which dietary intake and body weight were unchanged. Changes in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol did not differ significantly among the treatment groups, for subjects of either sex. The serum level of LDL cholesterol was significantly reduced among women (a decrease of 14.5+\/-22.2 mg per deciliter) and men (a decrease of 20.0+\/-17.3 mg per deciliter) in the diet-plus-exercise group, as compared with the control group (women had a decrease of 2.5+\/-16.6 mg per deciliter, P<0.05; men had a decrease of 4.6+\/-21.1 mg per deciliter, P<0.001). The reduction in LDL cholesterol in men in the diet-plus-exercise group was also significant as compared with that among the men in the exercise group (3.6+\/-18.8 mg per deciliter, P<0.001). In contrast, changes in LDL cholesterol levels were not significant among the women (a decrease of 7.3+\/-18.9 mg per deciliter) or the men (10.8+\/-18.8 mg per deciliter) in the diet group, as compared with the controls.\n                The NCEP Step 2 diet failed to lower LDL cholesterol levels in men or women with high-risk lipoprotein levels who did not engage in aerobic exercise. This finding highlights the importance of physical activity in the treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol levels.",

Weight losses were associated with positive changes in CHD risk factors. After 6 months, there was gradual deterioration of behavioral and physiological changes, so that at 2 years, almost no between-group differences were maintained. Differences between groups in risk of developing diabetes were of borderline significance (P = 0.08). Strongest predictors were impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, which was positively related to risk of developing diabetes, and weight loss from baseline to 2 years, which was negatively related; in all treatment groups, a modest weight loss of 4.5 kg reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by approximately 30% compared with no weight loss.\n                Although initially successful, the interventions studied here were not effective in producing long-term changes in behavior, weight, or physiological parameters. However, weight loss from 0 to 2 years reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

One hundred four persons aged 40-64 years who had serum total cholesterol levels between 6.21 and 7.73 mmol\/l (240 and 299 mg\/dl) in 1988-89 cardiovascular risk surveys were enrolled in the trial. The intervention group (n=51, 82% for women) attended eight education classes in 1 year, while the control group (n=53, 85% for women) attended only two classes. Both groups were invited to the subsequent annual surveys. The mean serum cholesterol was 0.24-0.26 mmol\/l less in the intervention than in the control group at both 6 month and 1 year (P=0.03, each) while the proportion of subjects using hypolipidemic agents was 0 and 6% in both groups, respectively. During 8-year follow-up, the probability of using hypolipidemic agents and\/or total cholesterol > or =7.76 mmol\/l was 51% in the education group and 69% in the control group; the risk ratio in the intervention vs control groups was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.36-1.06). When stratified by the apolipoprotein E polymorphism examined for 78% of the subjects, the risk ratio was 0.61 (0.31-1.18) among subjects without e4 allele (n=59) and 0.55 (0.14-2.14) among those with e4 allele (n=22). The intervention group had reduced intake of egg, fish egg, butter, mayonnaise and fatty meat compared to the control group at 6-month, 1- and 8-year follow-up. In conclusion, our community-based program was effective in reducing serum total cholesterol levels non-pharmacologically during the first year, and also reduced the likelihood of progressive worsening of hypercholesterolemia during the subsequent 8 years, regardless of the apolipoprotein E polymorphism.",

Moreover, individuals with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese are at particularly high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. Although short-term weight loss has been shown to ameliorate obesity-related metabolic abnormalities and CVD risk factors, the long-term consequences of intentional weight loss in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes have not been adequately examined. The primary objective of the Look AHEAD clinical trial is to assess the long-term effects (up to 11.5 years) of an intensive weight loss program delivered over 4 years in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Approximately 5000 male and female participants who have type 2 diabetes, are 45-74 years of age, and have a body mass index >or=25 kg\/m(2) will be randomized to one of the two groups. The intensive lifestyle intervention is designed to achieve and maintain weight loss through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity. This program is compared to a control condition given diabetes support and education. The primary study outcome is time to incidence of a major CVD event. The study is designed to provide a 0.90 probability of detecting an 18% difference in major CVD event rates between the two groups. Other outcomes include components of CVD risk, cost and cost-effectiveness, diabetes control and complications, hospitalizations, intervention processes, and quality of life.",

        "Title":"Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus by changes in lifestyle among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.",
        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.\n                We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years.\n                The mean (+\/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+\/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+\/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+\/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+\/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.\n                Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.",

        "Abstract":"To evaluate the additional benefit of \"intensive\" health care advice through six group sessions, compared with the advice usually offered to subjects with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n                Prospective, randomised controlled clinical study lasting 18 months.\n                681 subjects aged 30-59 years, with at least two cardiovascular risk factors in addition to moderately high lipid concentrations: total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol\/l on three occasions, triglycerides < 4.0 mmol\/l, and ratio of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol > 4.0. Most (577) of the subjects were men.\n                Percentage reduction in total cholesterol concentration (target 15%); quantification of the differences between the two types of health care advice (intensive v usual) for the Framingham cardiovascular risk and for individual risk factors.\n                In the group receiving intensive health care advice total cholesterol concentration decreased by 0.15 mmol\/l more (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.26) than in the group receiving usual advice. The overall Framingham risk dropped by 0.068 more (0.014 to 0.095) in the group receiving intensive advice, and most of the risk factors showed a greater change in a favourable direction in this group than in the group receiving usual advice, but the differences were seldom significant. The results from questionnaires completed at the group sessions showed that the subjects improved their lifestyle and diet.\n                Limited additional benefit was gained from being in the group receiving the intensive health care advice. It is difficult to make an important impact on cardiovascular risk in primary care by using only the practice staff. Better methods of communicating the messages need to be devised.",

        "Abstract":"Physical inactivity and obesity are major public health problems. Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of an individual counseling intervention at the workplace on physical activity fitness and health. Counseling content derived from the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise and Nutrition (PACE) program.\n                A total of 299 employees of three municipal services in the Dutch town of Enschede were randomly allocated into intervention (n =131) and control group (n =168). Over a 9-month period, intervention group subjects were offered seven counseling sessions. Counseling was based on the individual's stage of behavioral change using PACE physical activity and nutrition protocols. Subjects in both the intervention and control group received written information about several lifestyle factors. Primary outcome measures were physical activity (total energy expenditure, during sports activities, during physical activity leisure time other than sports, and meeting the moderate-intensity public health recommendations); cardiorespiratory fitness; and prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were body composition (body mass index [BMI], and percentage of body fat measured via skinfold thicknesses); blood pressure; and blood cholesterol.\n                There were significant positive effects on total energy expenditure, physical activity during sports, cardiorespiratory fitness, percentage of body fat, and blood cholesterol. No effects were found for the proportion of subjects meeting the public health recommendation of moderate-intensity physical activity, physical activity during leisure time other than sports, prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, body mass index, and blood pressure.\n                Individual face-to-face counseling at the workplace based on PACE protocols positively influenced physical activity levels and some components of physical fitness. The implementation of workplace counseling programs for individuals should therefore be promoted.",
