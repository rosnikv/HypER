        "Abstract":"Emerging evidence suggests that stem cells can be used to improve cardiac function in patients after acute myocardial infarction. In this randomized trial, we aimed to use Doppler tissue tracking and strain imaging to assess left ventricular segmental function after intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow stem cells (BMCs) for 6 months' follow up.\n                Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction and anterior descending coronary artery occlusion proven by angiography were [corrected] randomized into intracoronary injection of bone-marrow cell (treated, n = 9) or diluted serum (control, n = 11) groups. GE vivid 7 and Q-analyze software were used to perform echocardiogram in both groups 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after treatment. Three apical views of tissue Doppler imaging were acquired to measure peak systolic displacement (Ds) and peak systolic strain (epsilonpeak) from 12 segments of LV walls. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) were obtained by Simposon's biplane method.\n                (1) 3 months later, Ds and epsilonpeak over the infract-related region clearly increased in the BMCs group [Ds: (4.49 +\/- 2.71) mm vs (7.56 +\/- 2.95) mm, P < 0.01; epsilonpeak: (-13.40 +\/- 6.00)% vs (-17.06 +\/- 6.05)%, P < 0.01], but not in the control group [Ds: (4.74 +\/- 2.67) mm vs (5.01 +\/- 3.23) mm, P > 0.05; epsilonpeak: (-13.84 +\/- 6.05)% vs (-15.04 +\/- 6.75)%, P > 0.05]. At the same time, Ds over the normal region also increased, but the Ds enhancement was markedly higher in the BMCs group than that in the control group [(3.21 +\/- 3.17) mm vs (0.76 +\/- 1.94) mm, P < 0.01]. Parameters remained steady from the 3rd to 6th month in either group (P > 0.05). (2) LVEF in treated and control groups were almost the same at baseline (1st week after PCI) [(53.37 +\/- 8.92)% vs (53.51 +\/- 5.84)%, P > 0.05]. But 6 months later, LVEF in the BMCs group were clearly higher than that in the control group [(59.33 +\/- 12.91)% vs (50.30 +\/- 8.30)%, P < 0.05]. (3) There were no evident difference in EDV or ESV between two groups at baseline [EDV: (113.74 +\/- 23.24) ml vs (129.94 +\/- 32.72) ml, P > 0.05; ESV: (57.12 +\/- 18.66) ml vs (62.09 +\/- 17.68) ml, P > 0.05]. Three months later, EDV and ESV in the control group were markedly greater than those in the BMCs group [EDV: (154.89 +\/- 46.34) ml vs (104.85 +\/- 33.21) ml, P < 0.05; ESV: (82.91 +\/- 35.79) ml vs (49.54 +\/- 23.32) ml, P < 0.05]. But EDV and ESV did not change much from 3rd to 6th month in either group (P > 0.05).\n                Emergency transplantation of autologous BMCs in patients with acute myocardial infarction helps to improve global and regional contractility and attenuate post-infarction left ventricular remodeling.

        "Abstract":"It is difficult to distinguish the effects early revascularization and regenerative therapy have on left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study was an investigation into three groups of patients who had a revascularized anterior wall AMI and depressed left ventricular function (i.e., ejection fraction < 45%). The aim was to compare changes in left ventricular function between patients who received regenerative therapy and those who did not.\n                Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an intracoronary infusion of autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells (Group I; n=10) or systemic administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Group II; n=10), or to a control group (Group III; n=10). In Group I, intracoronary infusion was carried out 7(2) days after AMI. Group-II patients received a 10-day course of subcutaneous G-CSF injections, 10 .g\/kg per day starting 5 days after AMI. Ventricular function was assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up.\n                A 20% increase in mean ejection fraction was observed in Group I, compared with increases of 4% (P<.01) and 6% (P<.05) in Groups II and III, respectively.\n                Intracoronary infusion of mononuclear bone marrow cells in patients with AMI and poor ventricular function was associated with better short-term functional recovery than previously reported. However, mobilization of stem cells by G-CSF did not have a significant influence on functional recovery.",

        "Abstract":"the objective of the study was to determine whether the effects of infarct-related artery (IRA) infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells after ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are dependent on the dose (quantity and mobility) of the cells infused. Beneficial effects of IRA infusion of mononuclear cells after STEMI have been inconsistent, possibly because of differences in timing, cell type, quantity, and mobility of infused cells.\n                patients were randomized to bone marrow harvest (n = 16) or control (n = 15). At a median of 8.3 days after coronary stenting for STEMI, CD34(+) cells were infused via the IRA at 3 dose levels (5, 10, and 15 \u00d7 10(6)) in cohorts of 5 patients each. Baseline and follow-up imaging and ex vivo CD34(+) cell mobility were performed.\n                Cell harvest and infusion were safe. Quantitative rest hypoperfusion score measured by single-photon emission computed tomography improved at 6 months in the \u2265 10 million cohorts compared with controls (-256 vs +14, P = .02). There was a trend toward improved ejection fraction at 6 months (+4.5%) in the \u2265 10 million cohorts compared with no change in the controls and 5 million cohort (+0.7%). Improved perfusion and infarct size reduction correlated with the quantity and mobility of the infused CD34(+) cells.\n                the effects of CD34(+) cell IRA infusion during the repair phase after STEMI are dose dependent and, at a threshold dose of 10 million CD34(+) cells, associated with a significant improvement in perfusion that may limit deterioration in cardiac function (IRA infusion of CD34(+) cells in patients with acute myocardial infarction [AMR-01] NCT00313339).",

        "Abstract":"There are only few data on long-term effectiveness of the stem cell therapy.\n                We studied the time course of global and regional left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction within 1 year after the autologous mononuclear bone marrow cell transplantation.\n                Sixty patients with a first acute myocardial infarction, who had been randomized into 3 groups, completed a 12-month protocol. Two groups were intracoronarily given bone marrow cells in either higher (10(8) cells, HD group, n=20) or lower (10(7) cells, LD group, n=20) doses. Twenty patients without cell transplantation served as a control (C) group. Doppler tissue imaging and the gated technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography were performed before cell transplantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months later.\n                The baseline peak systolic velocities of longitudinal contraction of the infarcted wall (S(infarct)) of 5.2 cm\/s, 4.6 cm\/s, and 4.4 cm\/s in C, LD, and HD groups increased by 0.0 cm\/s, 0.3 cm\/s (p=NS vs. C group), and by 0.7 cm\/s (p<0.05 vs. C group), respectively, at 3 months. At 12 months, however, the corresponding changes from baseline values of 0.1 cm\/s, 0.2 cm\/s, and 0.6 cm\/s did not differ significantly (all p=NS). In contrast, the post-transplant improvements in the left ventricular ejection fraction by 6%, 7%, and 7% at months 3, 6, and 12, respectively, were preserved in HD group patients during the whole 12-month follow-up and remained significantly better as compared to controls.\n                In our study, the autologous mononuclear bone marrow cell transplantation provided sustained improvement in global left ventricular systolic function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, when evaluating regional systolic function of the infarcted wall, the short-term benefit was partially lost during the 12-month follow-up.",
