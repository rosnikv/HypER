        "Abstract":"Chronic hepatitis C (non-A, non-B hepatitis) is a common and often progressive viral liver disease. To assess the efficacy of therapy with the antiviral agent interferon alfa, we randomly assigned 166 patients with chronic hepatitis C to treatment with either 3 million or 1 million units of recombinant interferon alfa three times weekly for 24 weeks, or to no treatment. The probability of normalization or near normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase levels after six months of interferon therapy was 46 percent in patients treated with 3 million units of interferon (P less than 0.001) and 28 percent in those treated with 1 million units (P less than 0.02), but only 8 percent in untreated patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase level became completely normal in 22 of the 26 patients (85 percent) who responded to treatment with 3 million units of interferon and 9 of the 16 patients (56 percent) who responded to treatment with 1 million units. The patients who received 3 million units of interferon had histologic improvement because of the regression of lobular and periportal inflammation. Relapse within six months after the completion of treatment occurred in 51 percent of the patients treated with 3 million units of interferon and 44 percent of those treated with 1 million units. We conclude that a 24-week course of interferon therapy is effective in controlling disease activity in many patients with hepatitis C, although relapse after the cessation of treatment is common.",

        "Abstract":"Thirty-three Swedish patients with chronic post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis entered a randomized trial of interferon alfa-2b treatment (INTRON A, Schering-Plough Corporation) (3 million units, three times weekly, subcutaneously for 36 weeks). Twenty-two patients (67%) were reactive for antibodies against hepatitis C virus. Nineteen patients completed the course of therapy; 11 (58%) had a complete response with normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase levels, compared to none of the 12 controls (p less than 0.001). Four treated patients with chronic active hepatitis were non-responders. Non-responders had a significantly higher mean body weight than responders (p less than 0.05) and tended to have a longer duration of prior disease. During the 10-month follow-up period post treatment, 4\/11 (36%) complete responders had a sustained response and three (75%) of these four were reactive for antibodies against hepatitis C virus, whereas 7\/11 (64%) relapsed, of whom four (57%) were reactive for antibodies against hepatitis C virus. All patients who were treated again responded but relapsed once more after retreatment was stopped. We conclude that the majority of patients with chronic post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis will respond to 9 months' interferon alfa-2b treatment, but that only one of three responders will have a sustained response 10 months post treatment. Reactivity for antibodies against hepatitis C virus is not predictive of the outcome of therapy.",

We have used recombinant interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) in a randomized controlled liver biopsy trial to treat hemophiliacs with chronic hepatitis. Eighteen patients entered the study, 16 of whom were subsequently shown to have antibodies to the HCV. All underwent liver biopsy at entry and were randomized to either treatment with self-administered IFN alpha-2b, 3 million units subcutaneously thrice weekly (n = 10) or no treatment (control group) (n = 8). Nine subjects had chronic active hepatitis, seven had chronic persistent hepatitis, and two had cirrhosis. Twelve months after entry into the study 17 patients underwent a second liver biopsy. All biopsies were coded, assessed, and scored according to the histologic severity of the liver disease. Ten patients were administered IFN for 1 year, and in four patients normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred compared with none in the untreated group. After the second liver biopsy, six of the eight initial no-treatment patients were treated with interferon 3 million units thrice weekly for 6 months, and normalization of ALT was seen in five patients. Biochemical relapse within 4 months of stopping IFN occurred in one of four patients treated for 1 year and in four of five patients treated for 6 months. IFN treatment was well tolerated. Although the histologic scores of the two groups were similar at entry into the study, after 12 months the biopsy appearances in the treated group were significantly improved compared with the controls (P less than .01). Histologic improvement was noted in the three interferon-treated human immunodeficiency virus antibody-positive patients and also in other patients who had no biochemical response. We conclude that low-dose recombinant IFN alpha is effective in normalizing transaminases and improving the histologic appearances in at least 50% of hemophiliacs with chronic hepatitis C.",

We also aimed to determine if histological or liver function data could predict either response or relapse. Sixty patients with chronic sporadic-type non-A, non-B hepatitis were randomized in two groups of 30. One group was treated with interferon-alpha (3 MU thrice weekly) for one year; the other group was untreated controls. The treated group was followed for another year after interferon withdrawal. Liver function tests were performed during treatment. Liver biopsy was carried out before and a year after randomization. We evaluated rate of response [normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels for at least three consecutive months] and rate of relapse (ALT rebound after therapy suspension). We also looked at possible predictive factors for response and relapse. In the treatment group the rate of response was 55% (16\/29). No control patient exhibited ALT normalization. Among the responders, 31% (5\/16) relapsed after interferon withdrawal. Low gamma GT and female sex are positive predictive factors of response (P < 0.01 and P < 0.02 respectively). Presence of portal and periportal inflammation at the second liver biopsy was correlated with relapse (P < 0.05). In conclusion, human lymphoblastoid interferon-alpha treatment for one year is beneficial in patients suffering from chronic sporadic-type non-A, non-B hepatitis.

        "Abstract":"Patients with chronic active hepatitis C and cirrhosis often develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferon (IFN) seems to be effective in some patients but whether it prevents carcinogenesis is unknown. In a prospective randomised controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of IFN-alpha in cirrhotic patients with HCV infection because of their high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. 90 patients with compensated chronic active hepatitis C with cirrhosis were randomly allocated to receive IFN-alpha (6 MU three times weekly for 12-24 weeks) (45 patients) or symptomatic treatment (45 controls), and were followed up for 2-7 years. In nine controls, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased to less than 80 IU\/L but did not stay in the normal range. In 19 patients given IFN-alpha, ALT decreased to less than 80 IU\/L (in seven patients, it became and stayed normal; p = 0.011, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). However, the mean change in ALT was not significantly different between the two groups. The mean change in peak alpha-fetoprotein values was smaller in patients given IFN-alpha than in controls (p = 0.021). The mean change in the serum albumin level was higher in the IFN-alpha group (p < 0.001). The histological activity index in the 12 IFN-alpha patients undergoing a second biopsy after therapy was improved (p = 0.031). Hepatitis C viral RNA disappeared in seven (16%) of the 45 IFN-alpha patients (95% CI, 7-29%) and in none of the 45 controls (0-8%; p = 0.018). Hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in two (4%, 1-15%) IFN-alpha patients and 17 (38%, 24-54%) controls (p = 0.002, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The risk ratio of IFN-alpha treatment versus symptomatic treatment was 0.067 (0.009-0.530; p = 0.010 Cox's proportional hazards). IFN-alpha improved liver function in chronic active hepatitis C with cirrhosis, and its use was associated with a decreased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "Abstract":"Two hundred and thirty patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C were randomized to receive one of the following treatment protocols: (a) 3 million units of interferon alfa-2b thrice weekly for 6 months, (b) 5 million units thrice weekly for 6 months, or (c) 3 million units thrice weekly for 2 years. The short-term response to treatment was defined by normal alanine aminotransferase for at least 3 months and until the end of treatment, and was confirmed by loss of hepatitis C viraemia in 42 (91%) of 46 cases as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Short-term response to interferon alfa-2b was independent of the incremental dose, being 64% for 5 million units and 58% for 3 million units. Long-term response to interferon alfa-2b was defined by continued normality of alanine aminotransferase levels for at least 6 months after treatment withdrawal. The long-term response rates among responders treated for 6 months and those treated for 2 years were 29% and 54%, respectively (p < 0.001). Among all 18 patients tested, serum HCV-RNA was negative at both 6 and 12 months of follow-up in all long-term responders, and none have subsequently relapsed. Improvement in hepatic necroinflammatory changes was confirmed by quantitative histology (Scheuer score) in responders at the end of interferon alfa-2b treatment. The changes were significantly greater among those who had been treated for 2 years compared with those treated for 6 months (p < 0.05 and p < 0.02, respectively, for portal and lobular inflammation scores). Several pretreatment characteristics could be correlated with a favourable response to interferon alfa-2b. Thus, absence of cirrhosis was associated with a short-term response of 75%, while only 42% of patients with cirrhosis had a short-term response (p < 0.001). The frequency of short-term response to interferon alfa-2b also differed according to mode of disease acquisition, being best for injecting drug use (71%), less favourable for blood transfusion (56%) and worst for sporadic cases (43%) (p < 0.01). This observed difference, however, was not independent of histology on multivariate analysis. In summary, a 5 million unit dose of interferon alfa-2b failed to improve the short-term or long-term response to interferon alfa-2b treatment, but prolongation of interferon alfa-2b treatment to 2 years resulted in substantially improved long-term response rate.",

The diagnosis of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis was established on the basis of the liver-biopsy findings and an abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase value (greater than 1.5 times the normal value) for at least one year. All patients were treated for six months with 3 million units of interferon alfa-2b given subcutaneously three times a week and were then randomly assigned to the same treatment for an additional 12 months (group 1), a regimen of 1 million units three times a week for 12 months (group 2), or no further treatment (group 3). Patients in group 3 who had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations for three consecutive months underwent the initial regimen once again. Follow-up continued for two years after the discontinuation of treatment. Histologic improvement was defined as a decrease of at least one grade in the score for necroinflammatory activity (0, no activity; 1, mild; 2, moderate; or 3, severe) between the first liver biopsy and a biopsy performed at 18 months.\n                Of the 329 patients initially treated, 303 were randomized: 103 to group 1, 101 to group 2, and 99 to group 3.

        "Abstract":"Ninety consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C were included in a randomized, uncontrolled trial to compare the efficacy of two treatment regimens, 10 MU (group A) vs 5 MU (group B), of lymphoblastoid interferon, in a step-down schedule for 24 weeks. All of the patients had antibodies against the hepatitis C virus, and all but one were HCV RNA positive in serum. The origin of the infection was attributed to blood transfusion in 30 patients and classified as sporadic in 60 patients. During treatment reduction in the ALT levels as well as the elimination of viraemia was observed in both treated groups, although these changes did not correlate significantly with the interferon dose. Nine months after the end of therapy, a sustained response was achieved in 13.6% (12\/88) of the patients. Relapse in group B (87.5%) was significantly higher than in group A (59.1%). The percentage of cases which remained with undetectable HCV RNA was significantly higher for the sustained responders (66.7%) than for the non-responders (11.8%) and relapser patients (2.4%). Repeated liver biopsies showed an overall significant reduction of all the subindices of histological activity from patients with sustained response, except for fibrosis. In short: the 10 MU dosing regimen of lymphoblastoid interferon was as efficient as the 5 MU dose as it brought about a similar improvement in ALT levels, histological activity and elimination of viraemia, albeit 10 MU proved significantly more effective in the prevention of a relapse among the responders after 24 weeks therapy.",

At the end of therapy, 67% of patients in the 10 MU group normalized serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels and 59% had no hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA detected by polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the follow-up period, 44% of patients in the 10 MU group maintained normal ALT, and 24% had nondetectable HCV RNA. Lower doses were much less effective. Interferon alfa-n3 was well tolerated and no patient developed neutralizing anti-interferon antibodies during or after the treatment period. Interferon alfa-n3 appears to be effective against hepatitis C virus and deserves further study in larger randomized controlled trials.",

Patients infected with HCV non-type 1 genotypes were significantly more likely to achieve a sustained response than were those infected with HCV type 1 (63% vs 10.5%, P = 0.001). Sustained virological responses were also associated with lower pretreatment viraemia level, younger age, absence of cirrhosis and the higher interferon dosage regimens but these associations failed to reach statistical significance. In 97% of patients there was concordance between virological and biochemical responses, and a statistically significant (P = 0.005) improvement in the Knodell histological activity index was observed in the virological sustained responders.",

        "Abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers with normal aminotransferase levels often show histological chronic hepatitis. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of interferon (IFN) in such patients. Nineteen HCV carriers with normal aminotransferase activities and chronic hepatitis were randomized to receive IFN-alpha2b (3 million units 3 times weekly for 12 months) or no treatment. Therapy was monitored by qualitative and quantitative determination of viral RNA. Patients who did not clear HCV RNA after 6 months discontinued therapy. In all, 9 patients constituted the control group, while 10 patients were treated. Five of these patients, still viremic after 6 months, stopped IFN. The remaining 5 patients, who cleared the viral RNA within 6 months, completed the 12-month course. Three of these patients relapsed off treatment, and 2 were still free of viremia 12 months after stopping therapy. A transient flare-up of aminotransferase activities was detected in 2 patients during treatment and in 3 patients after. None of the 9 control patients cleared the viral RNA during follow-up. A variable degree of sequence heterogeneity was detected in the hypervariable region before therapy, and IFN treatment decreased sequence diversity in all patients. These results indicate that IFN therapy can be effective in chronic HCV carriers with normal aminotransferase activities, inducing short-term virological response in 3 of 10 patients and sustained response in 2. The effects of treatment on viral load and quasispecies complexity were similar to those reported previously in patients with increased aminotransferase activities.",

Patients were randomized to receive CIFN at doses of 3 microg or 9 microg, or 15 microg IFN-alpha2b (3 million units), subcutaneously three times weekly for 24 weeks, followed by 24 weeks of observation. Efficacy was assessed by normalization of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration and decrease in serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA concentration below the limit of detection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (100 copies\/mL). The beneficial effect of CIFN was greater with the 9-microg dose than the 3-microg dose. The sustained ALT and HCV RNA response rates were 20.3% and 12.1%, respectively, in the 9-microg CIFN cohort and 19.6% and 11.3%, respectively, in the 15-microg IFN-alpha2b cohort. However, patients receiving 9 microg of CIFN had a greater reduction in serum HCV RNA concentrations compared with patients receiving 15 microg IFN-alpha2b over the course of treatment (P < .01). Similarly, analysis of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 showed a greater reduction in serum HCV RNA concentration over the course of treatment for the 9-microg CIFN group when compared with the 15-microg IFN-alpha2b group (P < .01). In addition, a greater percentage of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 treated with 9 microg CIFN had undetectable HCV RNA concentrations when compared with patients in the 15-microg IFN-alpha2b cohort at the end of treatment (24% vs. 15%; P = .04). Improvements in liver histology were noted in all three treatment groups; 52% to 55% of the patients in the three cohorts had at least a 2-unit improvement in the Knodell score at the end of the posttreatment period. The adverse-events profiles were characteristic of treatment with type-1 interferon, and the incidences of anti-interferon antibody formation did not significantly differ among the three treatment groups. These results show that administration of 9 microg CIFN three times weekly for 6 months is safe and is effective in reducing serum HCV RNA concentration.",

HCV RNA was tested by nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using 5'-untranslated region complementary primers, quantified by branched-DNA assay, and typed by nested RT-PCR testing for the HCV core region. Treated and untreated patients had similar epidemiological, virological, and histological characteristics.

Response was evaluated by monitoring ALT levels monthly during treatment and during the 6 months post-treatment follow-up. Sixty-one per cent and 66% of the patients in the fixed and de-escalating treatment groups had a primary response (serum ALT normalization) during the treatment period; sustained-response rates at the end of follow-up were 20% and 29%, respectively (not significant).

In univariate analysis, patients with sustained response tended to be non-cirrhotic and had lower initial serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and ferritin levels. Multivariate analysis indicated that only ALT activity assessed at month 1 (P < 0.01) was a significant predictor of sustained response. These findings suggest that although the difference in the response rates between the de-escalating (6 MIU three times a week for 3 months; 3 MIU three times a week for 3 months) and fixed (3 MIU three times a week for 6 months) treatment regimens did not reach statistical significance, there was a clear trend towards higher response with the 6 MIU induction dose in patients without cirrhosis.",

One thousand seventy-one patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized to receive lymphoblastoid IFN-alpha n1 or recombinant IFN-alpha2b at the same dosing regimen, 3 million units administered subcutaneously three times a week for 24 weeks. Hepatitis C viral (HCV) genotype (by line probe assay) was determined at baseline, and serum HCV RNA level (by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) was measured at baseline and weeks 24, 48, and 72. Primary end points were normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels at end of therapy (week 24) and sustained ALT normalization at weeks 48 and 72. Secondary end points were nondetectability of serum HCV RNA at 24, 48, and 72 weeks, and histological improvement at weeks 24 and 72. The two treatment groups were similar with respect to demographic, clinical, and histological variables (10% had cirrhosis at entry), baseline serum HCV RNA levels, and distribution of HCV genotypes. Intent-to-treat analysis showed that ALT response at end of treatment was 35.3% for IFN-alpha n1 and 37.9% for IFN-alpha2b (P = .38). Histological improvement and nondetectability of HCV RNA were also similar between the two treatment groups at the end of treatment, as were the type and frequency of reported adverse experiences. Among treatment responders, post-treatment relapse was significantly less frequent with IFN-alpha n1 than with IFN-alpha2b. Thus, sustained ALT responses (SR) to IFN-alpha n1 were significantly more frequent than SR to IFN-alpha2b (12.0% vs. 7.6% at 48 weeks, P = .02; 10.3% vs. 6.7% at 72 weeks, P = .04). SR were associated with viral loss and histological improvement, and more patients treated with IFN-alpha n1 were HCV RNA negative at week 72 compared with patients treated with IFN-alpha2b (P = .03). SR at week 72 were two- to sixfold better with other HCV genotypes relative to type 1, but the improved long-term efficacy of IFN-alpha n1 compared with IFN-alpha2b was evident for all major HCV genotypes. It is concluded that IFN-alpha n1 and IFN-alpha2b have similar end-of-treatment response rates and safety profiles but the sustained response rate is higher with IFN-alpha n1. SR to IFN-alpha treatment are associated with clearance of HCV RNA, and histological improvement was maximal in patients who exhibited sustained ALT normalization and clearance of HCV RNA.",

        "Title":"Treatment of hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis: a randomized, controlled trial of interferon alfa-2b versus no treatment.",
        "Abstract":"To examine the effects of interferon (IFN) therapy on clinical, biochemical, and histological features in patients with compensated hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis, we have conducted a randomized, controlled trial of IFN therapy versus observation. Eight centers included a total of 99 patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis. IFN-alpha2b, 3 million units three times per week, or no antiviral therapy was given for 48 weeks. Twenty-three patients dropped out. End-of-treatment biochemical response was not observed in any of the 39 controls but was observed in 6 of the 47 treated patients (P <.02); sustained biochemical response was obtained in only 2 treated patients. Controls and treated patients did not significantly differ with regard to the changes in serum level of albumin, bilirubin, alpha-fetoprotein, in plasma prothrombin, in histological activity, or liver collagen content. During trial or follow-up (160 +\/- 57 weeks), hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 9 controls and 5 treated patients (NS); decompensation of cirrhosis occurred in 5 controls and 7 treated patients. Seven controls and 10 treated patients died. In conclusion, in patients with compensated HCV-related cirrhosis, a 48-week course of IFN therapy is safe and is able to induce end-of-treatment biochemical response in a significant proportion of patients. However, a 48-week course of IFN therapy usually fails to achieve sustained response and, within the limit of this study, did not significantly improve the 3-year outcome. Therefore, a longer course of IFN therapy or combination therapy with ribavirin should be evaluated in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis.",

        "Abstract":"To compare the efficacy of low and relatively high dosages of recombinant interferon (IFN)-alpha-2a in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C, as well as to characterize the type of patients who will respond well to a low-dosage treatment, 88 patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C were randomly assigned to two treatment groups; one treated with IFN-alpha-2a 6 MU daily for 2 weeks followed by 6 MU three times weekly for 22 weeks (6-MU group), and another given the same initial treatment followed by 3 MU three times weekly for 22 weeks (3-MU group). The rate of sustained normalization of ALT 6 months after the cessation of treatment was 33% in the 3-MU group and 40% in the 6-MU group (p = 0.64). In addition, there was no difference in elimination of serum HCV-RNA 6 months after the cessation of treatment between the 3-MU group (26%) and 6-MU group (29%). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis revealed that serum HCV-RNA level (p = 0.0035) and platelet count (p = 0.0009) were independent variables useful in predicting a sustained response of ALT. The sustained response rate of ALT in patients with a serum HCV-RNA level less than 10(5) copies\/ml and serum platelet level above 15 x 10(4)\/microliter was 71%, whereas that in patients with a serum HCV-RNA level above 10(5) copies\/ml and serum platelet level less than 15 x 10(4)\/microliter was 12%. These results indicate that a high rate of sustained response to IFN therapy can be expected in chronic hepatitis C patients with a low serum level of HCV-RNA and a high level of platelets, even if treated with a low dose of IFN.",

        "Abstract":"We have conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing two doses of recombinant human alpha-interferon for efficacy in 60 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. The source of infection appeared to be transfusion in 30 patients, intravenous drug abuse in 16 patients and was unknown in 14 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to no treatment or to treatment with either 1 or 3 MU of alpha-interferon given three times a week for 24 wk. Forty-five patients (75%) were positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus. During the 24-wk treatment period, mean serum ALT levels decreased in both treatment groups, but the decrease was statistically significant only in the 3 MU group. However, at 24 wk, the proportion of patients with normal ALT levels was similar in the 3 MU group (39%) and the 1 MU group (45%), and both were significantly higher than in controls (0%). Repeat liver biopsy specimens showed a significant decrease in the severity of histological changes in the 3 MU group but not in the 1 MU group or in controls. Responses to alpha-interferon did not correlate with patient's age, gender, source of infection, pretreatment serum ALT, presence of anti-hepatitis C virus or cirrhosis. After treatment, the mean ALT levels rose in both treated groups. The proportion of patients with normal ALT levels at wk 48 was 28% in the 3 MU group and 20% in the 1 MU group. In conclusion, a dose of 3 MU was superior to 1 MU of alpha-interferon given three times weekly for 24 wk in inducing improvements in serum ALT levels and liver histological examinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"We studied the clinical course and the effect of alfa interferon treatment in sixty-six patients of Southern Italy suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus. The patients were randomly assigned to the control group (33 patients without treatment) or to the group treated with 3MU of interferon three times a week for six months. Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels normalized in 17 of the 33 treated subjects (52%) within two months of treatment. Seven of these \"responders\" relapsed at the end of the six-month treatment period, but ALT normalized in these patients after resumption of interferon at the same dosage. None of the non responders on 3MU for four months showed improvement even when the dose was increased to 6MU. Our results coincide with other reports on interferon treatment in hepatitis C virus. Further studies are required to clarify whether or not higher doses at the onset of treatment increase the number of responders and decrease the frequency of relapses.",

        "Abstract":"Interferon-alpha has been widely used in chronic hepatitis C, but controlled studies with intramuscular interferon-beta are lacking. We therefore performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized study comparing intramuscular IFN-alpha and -beta in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive 3 MU thrice weekly intramuscularly of either recombinant IFN-alpha or leukocyte IFN-alpha or fibroblast IFN-beta for six months. Nine of 20 patients (45.0%) in the recombinant IFN, 5\/19 (26.3%) in the leukocyte IFN, and none in the IFN-beta group had a complete response during therapy (recombinant IFN vs IFN-beta: P < 0.01). Only in IFN-alpha-treated patients, was infection with a single HCV genotype (type 2a or 2b) associated with significantly better long-term outcome. IFN-alpha is useful in chronic hepatitis C while intramuscular IFN-beta interferon does not exert any beneficial effect. This is probably due to an insufficient bioavailability of IFN-beta when given intramuscularly.",
