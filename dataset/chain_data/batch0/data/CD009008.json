        "Abstract":"Diabetic control was compared in groups of Type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetic patients treated concurrently for 1 year with five different sulphonylurea drugs: chlorpropamide (21), glipizide (24), gliquidone (22), gliclazide (22) and glibenclamide (23). Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) levels decreased in all groups over the first 2 months, but tended to level off or increase thereafter. In a total of 96 patients assessed after 1 year, gliclazide produced normal HbA1 levels in a significantly greater number of patients than chlorpropamide (p = 0.01) and gliquidone (p = 0.038), and glibenclamide was also significantly better than chlorpropamide (p = 0.02). Significant improvements in HbA1 were produced overall in the gliquidone (p less than 0.01), gliclazide (p less than 0.01) and glibenclamide (p less than 0.02) groups and the gliquidone and gliclazide groups were significantly better than the glipizide group (p less than 0.01 in both cases). Only the glibenclamide group had a significant change in weight (p less than 0.05).

        "Abstract":"Medication compliance may be a problem in the management of patients with diabetes. Some physicians initially treat patients having non-insulin-dependent diabetes with oral sulfonylureas because they fear greater compliance problems with insulin therapy. We compared compliance with insulin and chlorpropamide in patients newly beginning medication for NIDDM. Seventy-seven adults with hyperglycemia despite diet therapy were randomly assigned to chlorpropamide or insulin. Compliance was measured four times over 24 wk. Patients then crossed over to the other medication and were followed for 24 additional weeks. Overall, there were no differences in compliance with the two medications in terms of percent of prescription used, proportion taking at least 80% of prescribed medication, self-report of medication or diet compliance, or protocol dropout rates. However, treatment satisfaction was higher with chlorpropamide, and most patients preferred chlorpropamide to insulin (P less than 0.0001). While such differences in satisfaction may affect long-term compliance, physicians should not assume that their patients will be less compliant with insulin than with oral sulfonylureas.",

Efficacy, based on fasting blood glucose (BG), BG 1 h after ingestion of standard breakfast (postprandial), serum insulin, postprandial insulin increase, and HbA1c; and tolerability, based on subjective symptoms and laboratory values, were investigated every 6 weeks. Efficacy evaluation was valid for 85 patients.\n                The test drugs were dosed as follows: 100 mg acarbose (A) three times a day, 1 placebo tablet three times a day, 3.5 mg glibenclamide tablets dosed 1-0-0 or 1-0-1, mean dose 4.3 mg\/day.

There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial.\n                3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48-60 years), who after 3 months' diet treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6.1-15.0 mmol\/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol\/L. In the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone; drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than 15 mmol\/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also analysed by actual therapy.\n                Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.0% (6.2-8.2) in the intensive group compared with 7.9% (6.9-8.8) in the conventional group--an 11% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in the intensive group was 12% lower (95% CI 1-21, p=0.029) for any diabetes-related endpoint; 10% lower (-11 to 27, p=0.34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6% lower (-10 to 20, p=0.44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25% risk reduction (7-40, p=0.0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p<0.0001). The rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0.7% with conventional treatment, 1.0% with chlorpropamide, 1.4% with glibenclamide, and 1.8% with insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2.9 kg) than in the conventional group (p<0.001), and patients assigned insulin had a greater gain in weight (4.0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2.6 kg) or glibenclamide (1.7 kg).\n                Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

        "Abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor miglitol vs. the sulfonylurea glyburide in the treatment of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled by diet alone. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 1-yr trial of miglitol 25 mg TID and 50 mg TID compared with placebo and a titrated dose of glyburide in a parallel group comparison study conducted in 30 out-patient sites across the United States. Four hundred eleven (411) diet-treated patients age 60 yr or greater were randomized to receive either placebo TID (n = 101), miglitol 25 mg TID (n = 104), miglitol 50 mg TID (n = 102), or a once-daily dose of glyburide titrated based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (n = 104), for a period of 56 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting and post-meal glucose, insulin, and lipid levels, and by 24-h urinary excretion of glucose and albumin. Safety and tolerability were assessed by tabulation of adverse events, periodic laboratory determinations, and home blood glucose monitoring. HbA1c treatment effects (placebo-subtracted change in HbA1c from baseline) at the 1-yr endpoint were -0.49%, -0.40%, and -0.92% in the miglitol 25 mg TID, miglitol 50 mg TID, and glyburide groups, respectively (P < 0.05- 0.01 vs. placebo). Postprandial insulin levels were significantly greater than placebo and miglitol in the glyburide group (P < 0.01). Hypoglycemia, weight gain, and both routine and serious cardiovascular events were more frequent in the glyburide group (P < 0.05-0.01 vs. placebo or miglitol groups). Diarrhea (or soft stools) and flatulence were more common in both miglitol groups than in the other two groups in a dose-dependent manner, but resulted in relatively few study dropouts. Treatment with miglitol offers the elderly type 2 diabetic patient significant reductions in daylong glycemia as measured by HbA1c. The greater HbA1c reductions seen with once-a-day glyburide occurred at a cost of significant increases in weight, insulin levels, and the incidences of clinical and subclinical hypoglycemia, which did not occur in the miglitol groups. alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are a useful and relatively safe therapeutic option in the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract":"In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive blood-glucose control with insulin or sulphonylurea therapy decreases progression of microvascular disease and may also reduce the risk of heart attacks. This study investigated whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or disadvantage.\n                Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704 overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0 mmol\/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol\/L (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol\/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268).\n                Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78).\n                Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.",

        "Abstract":"The sulfonylurea gliclazide and the biguanide metformin have different mechanisms to reduce glycemia. We performed a randomized study to compare these two agents with respect to glycemic control and effects on lipid peroxidation markers in 36 adult patients with type 2 diabetes. Both agents significantly decreased glycosylated hemoglobin ([HbA1c] P < .05), fructosamine (P < .05), and the glucose-excursion curve during the oral glucose tolerance test ([OGTT] P < .01). With regard to the insulin curve during this test, no significant change was observed with metformin and a significant increase was measured with gliclazide (P < .05). Considering the small number of events, no significant difference was detected in the number of hypoglycemic episodes between the two agents. More upper-gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were observed with metformin compared with gliclazide (P < .05). Even with no change in the standard lipid profile, both agents increased serum vitamin E (P < .01 for gliclazide and P < .05 for metformin) and decreased the level of lipid peroxidation markers in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (P < .05). Despite different mechanisms of action, gliclazide and metformin demonstrated comparable levels of efficacy and complementary effects on lipid peroxidation markers.",

        "Abstract":"This prospective, 1-year, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study was designed to show that repaglinide was at least equivalent to glyburide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Five hundred and seventy-six patients with type 2 diabetes of at least 6 months' duration were randomized to receive monotherapy with repaglinide (n = 383) or glyburide (n = 193). During weeks 1-8, doses were gradually increased to achieve a target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) range of 80-140 mg\/dl. The final adjusted dose was maintained for 12 months. Repaglinide patients received a starting dose of 0.5 mg three times\/day preprandially, adjusted as necessary to 1, 2 or 4 mg before breakfast, lunch and dinner. Glyburide patients received a starting dose of 2.5 mg before breakfast and placebo before lunch and dinner. Glyburide was increased as necessary to 5 or 10 mg before breakfast (placebo before lunch and dinner) or to 15 mg (10 mg before breakfast, placebo before lunch, and 5 mg before dinner). After study drug was stopped, patients were transferred to an appropriate therapy, as recommended by the investigator. Efficacy was assessed by changes from baseline in glycemic control parameters and in C-peptide, insulin, and lipid profiles. Repaglinide provided glycemic control that was at least as effective and potentially safer than that provided by glyburide. The glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide was most pronounced in pharmacotherapy-naive patients, who showed rapid and marked decreases in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels from baseline (9.4%) to month 3 (7.6%) and month 12 (7.9%). Mean FPG levels also decreased overall in this group, from 222 mg\/dl at baseline, to 175 mg\/dl at month 3, to 188 mg\/dl at month 12. At endpoint, morning C-peptide levels had increased significantly in glyburide-treated patients compared with those treated with repaglinide, but morning fasting insulin levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. Repaglinide efficacy was sustained over 1 year and was not influenced by age or sex. Overall safety and changes in lipid profile and body weight were similar with both agents, with no significant change after extended pharmacotherapy. Weight gain data for the subset of pharmacotherapy-na\u00efve patients suggest that patients given repaglinide may gain less weight than those given glyburide. Repaglinide, at doses of 0.5-4.0 mg administered three times preprandially, was well tolerated and provided safe and consistently effectiveglycemic control during this 1-year study. Patients using repaglinide received the same therapeutic benefits as those using glyburide, and may have received additional benefits.",

        "Abstract":"The present study examined the hemodynamic mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) lowering by troglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) at rest and during a mental arithmetic test (MAT). Twenty-two patients with DM with normal to high-normal BP and 12 controls matched for age, gender, glucose tolerance, and BP were studied. DM subjects showed significantly higher systolic BP response during MAT than controls (157 versus 139 mm Hg; P<0.01). All 22 DM patients and 5 of 12 controls had systolic BP >140 mm Hg during MAT. Heart rate and diastolic BP were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The DM group was then randomized to receive troglitazone (n=10; 400 mg\/d) or glyburide (n=12; 20 mg\/d). MAT was repeated after 6 months of treatment. Both treatments reduced glucose equally (-1.7 mmol\/L for troglitazone and -1.5 mmol\/L for glyburide), but only troglitazone reduced insulin (-15 microU\/mL; P<0.001) and C-peptide (-0.9 ng\/mL; P<0.02) levels. Troglitazone significantly reduced BP at baseline (P<0.05) and systolic BP response to MAT (P<0.01), whereas glyburide did not affect BP at baseline or during MAT. Stroke volume and cardiac output did not change with either drug, but troglitazone decreased peripheral vascular resistance (-112 dyne. s. cm(-5); P<0.05). Improved insulin resistance rather than an improved glycemic control is associated with lower resting and stress BP values in patients with DM. A reduction in vascular resistance may be a primary hemodynamic mechanism of the manner in which troglitazone lowers BP. Insulin sensitizers may offer potential therapeutic advantage in subjects with DM with elevated BP.",

This multicenter study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of this drug with glyburide in a 1-year randomized double-blind study of outpatients with type 2 diabetes.\n                A total of 424 subjects (154 women, 270 men) participated and had the following characteristics: age, 61 +\/- 9 years; duration of diabetes. 8 years (range 0.5-35); BMI, 28.3 +\/- 3.5 kg\/m2; HbA1c, 7.1 +\/- 1.4%; and fasting plasma glucose, 10.8 +\/- 3.1 mmol\/l. The majority of the subjects (91%) were previously treated with sulfonylurea, alone or in combination with metformin. The patients were randomized to a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg t.i.d.) or glyburide (1.75-10.5 mg daily) treatment. The study protocol included a screening visit to assess patient eligibility; a titration period of 6-8 weeks, during which the dosages of repaglinide and glyburide were optimized; and a subsequent 12-month treatment period on fixed, optimal dosages.\n                The trial was completed by 320 subjects, 211 (74%) in the repaglinide and 109 (78%) in the glyburide group. HbA1c initially decreased in both groups and then increased during the second half-year of the maintenance period to a similar extent in the repaglinide and glyburide subjects (0.58 and 0.45% vs. at screening, respectively). In the small group of subjects who previously controlled their condition with diet only (n = 37), a sustained improvement of metabolic control could be observed with both drugs, which was slightly better with glyburide than with repaglinide (theta HbA1c -2.4 vs. -1.0%; P < 0.05). The same trends were seen with fasting plasma glucose. There were no changes in serum lipids. Over the course of the study, 15% of the repaglinide-treated and 13% of glyburide-treated subjects withdrew due to adverse events, mostly hyperglycemia. No differences in adverse events between both drugs were reported. There were no differences in incidences of hypoglycemia.\n                Repaglinide is a safe and efficacious oral blood glucose-lowering agent, with a potency similar to that of glyburide. Its rapid onset of action and hepatic clearance allows meal-related administration, including in subjects with impaired kidney function.",

The study was open and 57 patients (33 males and 24 females) completed it. MNT was provided for each patient based on personal requirements as defined by a dietitian.

However, PP serum insulin levels in the gliclazide group increased more than those in the group treated with acarbose (p = 0.007). Moreover, a small weight reduction was obtained with acarbose treatment but not with gliclazide. Lipid levels were favourably affected by both drugs. Total cholesterol levels decreased in both groups, the decrease only reaching significance in the acarbose group (p = 0.013). However, serum levels of LDL cholesterol decreased in both groups (acarbose and gliclazide, p = 0.033 and p = 0.023, respectively), but the ratio of HDL to LDL cholesterol increased in the acarbose group only (p = 0.045). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Common complaints in the acarbose group were flatulence and meteorism (29.6%). However, 10.0% of the patients in the gliclazide group reported at least one mild hypoglycaemic episode.\n                The results of the study demonstrate that acarbose and gliclazide were reasonably effective in improving metabolic control in patients insufficiently controlled with diet alone, and both treatments were well tolerated.

After a period of at least 4 weeks run-in on diet only, the patients were randomized to pioglitazone, glibenclamide, or placebo. Blood samples were taken before the treatments and at the end of the 6-month therapy. Basal C-reactive protein (CRP) level was related to acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) concentration (r =.55, P <.01), and many acute phase serum protein concentrations were associated with each other. The treatment reduced HbA(1c) level in the pioglitazone (from 9.1 +\/- 0.3% to 8.0 +\/- 0.5%, P <.05) and glibenclamide (from 8.9 % +\/- 0.3% to 7.7% +\/- 0.2%, P <.05) groups.

        "Abstract":"Repaglinide and glimepiride are relatively new oral hypoglycemic agents. Few data are available concerning their effects on metabolic parameters other than measures of glycemic control.\n                In addition to assessing the effects of repaglinide and glimepiride on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, this study also examined the effects of these agents on 3 metabolic parameters known to be cardiovascular risk factors--lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and homocysteine (Hcy).\n                This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at a single center in Italy. Eligible patients were nonsmokers; had no hypertension or coronary heart disease; were taking no hypolipidemic drugs, diuretics, beta-blockers, or thyroxin; and had normal renal function. After an initial 4-week placebo washout period, patients were randomized to receive repaglinide 1 mg\/d or glimepiride 1 mg\/d. The dose of study drug was optimized over an 8-week titration period, which was followed by a 12-month treatment period. Measures of glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting plasma glucose [FPG], postprandial plasma glucose [PPG], fasting plasma insulin [FPI], postprandial plasma insulin [PPI]) and the other metabolic parameters of interest were assessed after 6 and 12 months of treatment.\n                One hundred twenty-four patients (63 women, 61 men) completed the study, 62 in each treatment group. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between groups. After 6 and 12 months of treatment, FPG levels and HbA1c values were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (6 months, P < 0.05; 12 months, P < 0.01). After 6 months, PPG levels were significantly decreased only in the repaglinide group (P < 0.05 vs baseline); at 12 months, however, PPG levels were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (P < 0.01 repaglinide, P < 0.05 glimepiride). No significant changes from baseline in FPI or PPI levels were seen in either group at 6 months, although FPI levels were significantly increased in the repaglinide group at 12 months (P < 0.05). Repaglinide significantly lowered levels of Lp(a), PAI-1, and Hcy after 12 months (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). Glimepiride significantly lowered levels of Lp(a) and Hcy after 6 months (both, P < 0.05 vs baseline) and levels of Lp(a) (P < 0.01 vs baseline), Hcy (P < 0.01 vs baseline), and PAI-1 (P < 0.05 vs baseline) after 12 months.\n                Repaglinide and glimepiride improved glycemic control and reduced levels of other metabolic parameters of interest in this population of patients with type 2 diabetes. It is possible that the reductions in Lp(a), PAI-1, and Hcy were the result of improved glucose metabolism; however, the possibility that repaglinide and glimepiride may have a direct effect on these parameters should not be excluded.",

        "Abstract":"The efficacy and safety of the preprandial injection of insulin lispro was compared with the oral administration of glibenclamide in patients with early type 2 diabetes. In this open-label, multicenter study, 143 patients with a glucagon-stimulated increase in C-peptide of at least 0.4 nmol\/L were randomized to receive preprandial insulin lispro (LP) or glibenclamide (GB) for 26 weeks. Seventy-five patients received LP (51 male\/24 female; age 40 to 70 years, duration of diabetes 4.4 +\/- 2.9 years) and 68 patients received GB (39 male\/29 female; age 39 to 70 years; duration of diabetes 4.3 +\/- 3.4 years). After 12 weeks, mean 90 minute blood glucose excursions were 0.9 +\/- 1.0 mmol\/L for LP and 1.8 +\/- 1.2 mmol\/L for GB (p < 0.0001). After 24 weeks, mean blood glucose excursions were 1.0 +\/- 1.1 mmol\/L for LP and 1.7 +\/- 1.2 mmol\/L for GB (p = 0.002). Body weight decreased slightly from 87.2 +\/- 2.3 to 86.5 +\/- 12.2 kg in the LP group and increased from 84.1 +\/- 13.7 to 84.4 +\/- 13.3 kg in the GB group.

HbA 1c at baseline was 7.5 +\/- 1.0 % for LP and 7.7 +\/- 1.2 % for GB and did not change significantly in either group during the investigation. No significant difference was observed between the groups with respect to hypoglycemic episodes. Treatment with LP improved postprandial blood glucose control more than GB without increasing body weight or hypoglycemic episodes. In addition, use of LP was associated with a decrease in fasting C-peptide and proinsulin levels, suggesting a potential down regulation of endogenous insulin production and improved proinsulin processing efficiency.",

In patients receiving metformin or glibenclamide alone, the maximal dose was reached in 21 and 25 patients, respectively; 8 and 15 of these subjects, respectively, required the maximal dose when they were on the combination treatment. During the study, 4 (10.0%) subjects receiving metformin, 7 (17.1%) receiving glibenclamide, and 31 (39.2%) receiving the combination treatment reached HbA1c levels < or = 6.0%. Moreover, when efficacy of the combination treatment on glycemic control was compared with that of single-drug therapies in each individual patient, the combination was significantly more effective than either metformin or glibenclamide (HbA1c after treatment, 6.1%+\/-1.1% v 7.3%+\/-1.4%, and 6.5%+\/-0.7% v 7.6%+\/-1.5%, respectively, both P<.0001).

        "Abstract":"Pioglitazone and glimepiride improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by different mechanisms. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that reduces insulin resistance, and glimepiride is a sulfonylurea insulin secretagogue.\n                The goals of this study were to compare changes in measures of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes who received pioglitazone or glimepiride for 1 year.\n                This was a multicenter, 52-week, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Patients were randomized to receive monotherapy with either glimepiride (2 mg QD initially) or pioglitazone (15 mg QD initially). Doses were titrated (maximal doses: pioglitazone 45 mg, glimepiride 8 mg) to achieve glycemic targets (fasting blood glucose < or =7 mmol\/L and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose < or =10 mmol\/L). Insulin sensitivity (primary end point) was evaluated in terms of the Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA-S), the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), and fasting serum insulin (FSI) concentrations. Glycemic control was evaluated in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations. Patients were encouraged to maintain their individual diet and exercise regimens throughout the study.\n                Two hundred forty-four patients (125 women, 119 men; all but 1 Hispanic) were randomized to receive pioglitazone (n = 121) or glimepiride (n = 123). In the intent-to-treat sample, pioglitazone and glimepirede produced comparable reductions in HbA(1c) from baseline to the end of the study (-0.78% and -0.68%, respectively). The pioglitazone group had significantly higher HbA(1c) values compared with the glimepiride group after 12 weeks of therapy (8.66% vs 7.80%; P = 0.007) but had significantly lower values after 52 weeks (7.46% vs 7.77%; P = 0.027). Pioglitazone significantly reduced FPG compared with glimepiride (-0.6 vs 0.6 mmol\/L; P = 0.01). Pioglitazone therapy was associated with significant increases in insulin sensitivity (reduced insulin resistance), whereas glimepiride had no effect. HOMA-S values changed 18.0% for pioglitazone and -7.9% for glimepiride (P < 0.001), QUICKI values changed a respective 0.013 and -0.007 (P < 0.001), and FSI values were -21.1 and 15.1 pmol\/L (P< 0.001). Both drugs were well tolerated, with pioglitazone associated with more peripheral edema (number of treatment-emergent cases: 35\/121[28.9%] vs 17\/123 [13.8%]; P = 0.005) and fewer hypoglycemic episodes (19 [15.7%] vs 38 [30.9%]; P = 0.024). The incidence of weight gain was not significantly different between treatment groups. Conclusions: These data suggest that long-term treatment with pioglitazone enhances insulin sensitivity relative to glimepiride in Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes and that pioglitazone may have a more sustained antihyperglycemic effect.",

The difference in mean decrease of fasting blood glucose was 1.0 mmol\/l in favour of tolbutamide (95% CI 0.3, 1.7). There were no significant differences in post-load blood glucose, fasting and post-load insulin levels, or lipids. In the acarbose group significantly more patients (15 versus 3) discontinued therapy because of adverse effects, mostly of gastrointestinal origin. We conclude that the results of this study favour tolbutamide over acarbose as first treatment for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",

Doses were titrated (to 45 mg for pioglitazone and 10.5 mg for glibenclamide) to achieve glycaemic targets during the next 12 weeks: fasting blood glucose of < or = 7 mmol\/l and 1-h postprandial blood glucose of < or = 10 mmol\/l. Patients were maintained on the titrated dose for 40 weeks.\n                Pioglitazone significantly increased insulin sensitivity compared with glibenclamide, as assessed by homeostasis model assessment (17.0% vs. -13.0%; P < 0.001), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (0.011 vs. -0.007; P < 0.001) and fasting serum insulin (-1.3 pmol\/l vs. 23.8 pmol\/l; P = 0.007). The glibenclamide group had significantly lower HbA1c than the pioglitazone group after 12 weeks of therapy (7.8% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.015), but significantly higher HbA1c after 52 weeks of therapy (7.8% vs. 7.2%, P = 0.001). Pioglitazone significantly (vs. glibenclamide) increased mean HDL-C (P < 0.001), decreased mean triglycerides (P = 0.019), and decreased mean atherogenic index of plasma (AIP; P = 0.001) and mean total cholesterol\/HDL-C (P = 0.004), without significantly elevating mean total cholesterol or mean LDL-C compared with glibenclamide. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that the effects of pioglitazone are more sustained than those of glibenclamide for improving insulin sensitivity in patients with Type 2 diabetes, and that 52 weeks' treatment with pioglitazone has favourable effects on glycaemic control and lipoprotein profile.\n                Copyright 2004 Diabetes UK",

Patients were randomly assigned to pioglitazone (30-45 mg\/day, n = 38), metformin (750 mg\/day, n = 39), or glimepiride (1.0-2.0 mg\/day, n = 37). The effect of treatment on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5AG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA), and fasting plasma insulin levels was monitored monthly. Body weight and safety data were also collected.\n                Eight patients withdrew from the study (three in the pioglitazone group, two in the metformin group, and three in the glimepiride group). The rate of reduction of HbA(1c) was fastest in patients receiving glimepiride and slowest in patients receiving pioglitazone. Although there were no significant differences among the three groups in HbA(1c) levels at the end of the study, patients taking pioglitazone had relatively lower FPG and 1,5AG levels than patients taking the other two drugs. These results suggest that pioglitazone acts predominantly on nocturnal metabolism rather than at mealtimes. FFA were reduced significantly in those taking pioglitazone (542.2 microEq\/l vs. 237.3 microEq\/l; P < 0.01) before a decrease in HbA(1c) was apparent. The change in FFA levels correlated with the change in HbA(1c) (r = 0.409, P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in other lipid parameters among the groups.\n                Pioglitazone, metformin, and glimepiride are equally effective in reducing blood glucose in patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes.

Pioglitazone hydrochloride reduced fasting serum insulin levels, with low fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycohemoglobin levels, compared to the baseline, suggesting an improvement of insulin resistance.\n                As expected, glibenclamide reduced FPG levels through increased insulin secretion. Pioglitazone hydrochloride and glibenclamide were well tolerated. Pioglitazone hydrochloride improved dyslipidemia related to insulin resistance, whereas glibenclamide enhanced insulin secretion, with only a minor effect on lipid control, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract":"This study was designed to compare the efficacy of rosiglitazone and glibenclamide in individuals with type 2 diabetes over a 12-month period.\n                A total of 598 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment for 52 weeks with rosiglitazone 4 mg\/d (n=200), rosiglitazone 8 mg\/d (n=191) or glibenclamide (n=207; dose adjusted up to 15 mg\/d over the first 12 weeks according to clinical response). Changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting insulin and its precursor peptides, and lipids were measured and safety was evaluated. Significant reductions in HbA1c levels at 52 weeks compared with baseline were seen in all treatment groups (rosiglitazone 4 mg\/d=-0.3%, P=0.0003; rosiglitazone 8 mg\/d=-0.5%, P<0.0001; glibenclamide=-0.7%, P<0.0001). Mean FPG levels were also significantly reduced in all treatment groups (rosiglitazone 4 mg\/d=-1.4 mmol\/l; rosiglitazone 8 mg\/d=-2.3 mmol\/l; glibenclamide=-1.7 mmol\/l; P<0.0001 vs. baseline for all treatments). Rosiglitazone therapy reduced plasma insulin, proinsulin, split proinsulin and free fatty acid levels compared with glibenclamide. Rosiglitazone improved insulin resistance while a worsening was seen with glibenclamide. Total:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios were reduced with glibenclamide and unchanged with rosiglitazone. All treatments were generally well tolerated.\n                The efficacy of rosiglitazone 8 mg\/d in improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is comparable to that of glibenclamide. However, rosiglitazone reduced insulin resistance and proinsulin levels whereas glibenclamide use was associated with an increase in fasting insulin and proinsulin. This suggests that in the long term, rosiglitazone may protect the beta-cell whereas glibenclamide is likely to increase the burden.",

        "Abstract":"This report is part of the overall evaluation of using vildagliptin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Here the results of a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of two years of monotherapy with vildagliptin 50 mg bid and gliclazide up to 320 mg\/day in drug-na\u00efve patients with type 2 diabetes are reported. A total of 546 patients were randomized and approximately 74% of patients completed the study in each group. HbA (1c) values were slightly higher in the gliclazide group (HbA (1c) of 8.7+\/-0.1% vs. 8.5+\/-0.1% in the vildagliptin group). The mean reduction in HbA (1c) from baseline to Week 104 was -0.5% in the vildagliptin group and -0.6% in the gliclazide group. The associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for the between-group difference (0.13%) in mean change was (-0.06%, 0.33%). Thus, noninferiority based on an upper limit of the CI of 0.3% was not met. In the vildagliptin group, weight increased by 0.8+\/-0.2 kg compared to 1.6+\/-0.2 kg in the gliclazide group (p<0.01). Mild hypoglycemia was recorded in 0.7% of patients in the vildagliptin group and in 1.7% in the gliclazide group. Both drugs were well tolerated. In summary, vildagliptin monotherapy resulted in improved glycemic control in drug-na\u00efve patients with type 2 diabetes. Although the hypothesis of noninferiority to gliclazide was not borne out statistically, the reductions in HbA (1c) were similar over a two year period and vildagliptin had significant benefits in terms of less weight gain and less hypoglycemia.\n                Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

        "Abstract":"Rosiglitazone has several properties that may affect progression of atherosclerosis. The Assessment on the Prevention of Progression by Rosiglitazone on Atherosclerosis in Diabetes Patients With Cardiovascular History (APPROACH) study was undertaken to determine the effect of the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone on coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by intravascular ultrasound compared with the sulfonylurea glipizide.\n                This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled 18-month study in 672 patients aged 30 to 80 years with established type 2 diabetes mellitus treated by lifestyle, 1 oral agent, or submaximal doses of 2 oral agents who had at least 1 atherosclerotic plaque with 10% to 50% luminal narrowing in a coronary artery that had not undergone intervention during a clinically indicated coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary outcome was change in percent atheroma volume in the longest and least angulated epicardial coronary artery that had not undergone intervention. Secondary outcomes included change in normalized total atheroma volume and change in total atheroma volume in the most diseased baseline 10-mm segment. Rosiglitazone did not significantly reduce the primary outcome of percent atheroma volume compared with glipizide (-0.64%; 95% confidence interval, -1.46 to 0.17; P=0.12). The secondary outcome of normalized total atheroma volume was significantly reduced by rosiglitazone compared with glipizide (-5.1 mm(3); 95% confidence interval, -10.0 to -0.3; P=0.04); however, no significant difference between groups was observed for the change in total atheroma volume within the most diseased baseline 10-mm segment (-1.7 mm(3); 95% confidence interval, -3.9 to 0.5; P=0.13).\n                Rosiglitazone did not significantly decrease the primary end point of progression of coronary atherosclerosis more than glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary atherosclerosis.

        "Abstract":"Early insulin treatment is considered more beneficial than anti-diabetic medication with sulphonylureas, because the latter may exert negative effects on beta-cell function, while the former may help preserve it. In a previous study, we found that C-peptide response was increased in the insulin-treated group, whereas it was decreased in the glibenclamide group. However, it was not certain whether the advantage remained in the longer term.\n                In this study, we tested whether early insulin treatment is more beneficial than glibenclamide against a 6-year follow-up perspective.\n                We designed a randomized clinical trial in subjects with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Glucagon stimulatory tests, measuring C-peptide and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), were performed after 2, and 3, days of temporary insulin and glibenclamide withdrawal.\n                18 subjects initially randomized to glibenclamide, and 16 randomized to two daily injections of insulin, participated in end-of-study investigations. C-peptide response to glucagon deteriorated (p < 0.01 vs. baseline) in initially glibenclamide-treated patients (n = 18), but not in insulin-treated patients (p < 0.05 for difference between groups, after 2 days of treatment withdrawal). The IAPP response to glucagon declined in the glibenclamide group (p < 0.001), but not in insulin-treated subjects (p = 0.05 for difference between groups).\n                Early insulin treatment preserves beta-cell secretory function better than glibenclamide even in a 6-year perspective.",

        "Abstract":"Most treatments for type 2 diabetes fail over time, necessitating combination therapy. We investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of liraglutide monotherapy compared with glimepiride monotherapy over 2 years.\n                Participants were randomized to receive once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg, liraglutide 1.8 mg or glimepiride 8 mg. Participants completing the 1-year randomized, double-blind, double-dummy period could continue open-label treatment for an additional year. Safety data were evaluated for the full population exposed to treatment, and efficacy data were evaluated for the full intention-to-treat (ITT) and 2-year completer populations. Outcome measures included change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight and frequency of nausea and hypoglycaemia.\n                For patients completing 2 years of therapy, HbA1c reductions were -0.6% with glimepiride versus -0.9% with liraglutide 1.2 mg (difference: -0.37, 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.02; p = 0.0376) and -1.1% with liraglutide 1.8 mg (difference: -0.55, 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.21; p = 0.0016). In the ITT population, HbA1c reductions were -0.3% with glimepiride versus -0.6% with liraglutide 1.2 mg (difference: -0.31, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.08; p = 0.0076) and -0.9% with liraglutide 1.8 mg (difference: -0.60, 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.38; p < 0.0001). For both ITT and completer populations, liraglutide was more effective in reducing HbA1c, FPG and weight. Over 2 years, rates of minor hypoglycaemia [self-treated plasma glucose <3.1 mmol\/l (<56 mg\/dl)] were significantly lower with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg compared with glimepiride (p < 0.0001).\n                Liraglutide monotherapy for 2 years provides significant and sustained improvements in glycaemic control and body weight compared with glimepiride monotherapy, at a lower risk of hypoglycaemia.\n                \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",
