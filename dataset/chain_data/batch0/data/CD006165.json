        "Title":"Small doses of subcutaneous insulin as a strategy for preventing slowly progressive beta-cell failure in islet cell antibody-positive patients with clinical features of NIDDM.",
        "Abstract":"We report a pilot study to determine the preventive effect of small doses of insulin injected subcutaneously on slowly progressive beta-cell damage in islet cell antibody (ICA)-positive patients with apparent NIDDM. Ten NIDDM patients who were ICA' were divided into two groups of five. In the insulin group (age: 51 +\/- 8 years [mean +\/- SD], sex: 3 men and 2 women), intermediate-type insulin (3-16 U\/day) was given once or twice daily as a subcutaneous injection. The sulfonylurea (SU) group (age: 48 +\/- 11 years, sex: 3 men and 2 women) was initially treated with a SU agent. Changes in beta-cell function, as indicated by serum C-peptide responses and blood glucose values during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test, as well as ICA and GAD antibody status, were evaluated for up to 30 months in both groups. ICA status became negative in four of five patients in the insulin group. ICA status did not become negative in any of the patients in the SU group (P = 0.047 vs. insulin group). ICA status was persistently positive in two patients whose beta-cell function eventually progressed to an insulin-dependent state and fluctuated in the remaining three patients. In the insulin group, GAD antibody status became negative in one of four initially GAD antibody-positive NIDDM patients. In the SU group, GAD antibody status was persistently positive in three NIDDM patients (NS vs. insulin group). The serum C-peptide response improved significantly within 6 and 12 months in the insulin group, whereas it decreased progressively in the SU group. The changes in C-peptide response were significantly different between the two groups at 6, 12, 24, and 30 months. Two-hour blood glucose and HbA1 values were unchanged in the insulin group, but they increased in the SU group. Subcutaneous small doses of insulin, resulting in a high rate of negative conversion of ICA and an improved serum C-peptide response, may be effective in treating ICA+ NIDDM patients who are at high risk for slowly progressive beta-cell failure.",

        "Title":"Slowly progressing type 1 diabetes: persistence of islet cell autoantibodies is related to glibenclamide treatment.",
        "Abstract":"Several experimental studies in rats have demonstrated that sulfonylurea treatment increases autoantigen expression in B-cells. This phenomenon may be deleterious for the preservation of residual beta cell function in patients with slowly progressing type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adult (LADA).\n                The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA positive type 2 diabetic patients may diminish or halt the humoral autoimmune response against B-cells as well as improve metabolic control and insulin secretion.\n                Fourteen type 2 diabetic patients with pancreatic autoimmunity (ICA+ and GABA+) and treated with insulin and glibenclamide (duration of disease 2.0 +\/- 2.2, range 0.1-7 years and age 53 +\/- 12.5, range 36-75 years) were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, Group 1: insulin monotherapy (n = 8, age 53 +\/- 6.4 years) (Exclusion of glibenclamide) and, Group 2: insulin plus glibenclamide (n = 6, age 53.5 +\/- 16.9) (Unmodified treatment). Both groups were investigated at the beginning of the study and after one year for the following parameters: ICA and anti-GAD65 antibodies, fasting glucose and fasting C-peptide.\n                In group 1, six out of eight patients became ICA negative while all patients in group 2 remained ICA positive (p = 0.0097). Fasting glucose concentrations improved in group 1 (4.6 +\/- 2.8) in relation to group 2 (11.5 +\/- 5.5, p = 0.0023) after one year of treatment. No differences were found for anti-GAD antibodies and fasting C-Peptide between the groups.\n                These data show that exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA+ type 2 diabetic patients partially decreases specific autoimmunity against endocrine pancreatic cells and improves metabolic control. This may reflect decreased expression of B-cell autoantigens suggesting that insulin monotherapy is a better choice for the treatment of LADA.",

        "Abstract":"In 1996, we designed a randomized multicenter study to assess the effects of small doses of insulin on beta cell failure in slowly progressive type 1 diabetes (the Tokyo Study). We report here the preliminary results of this study. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibody (GADA)-positive patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group received insulin (Ins group), the other a sulfonylurea (SU group). Fifty-four patients (24 Ins group, 30 SU group) were analyzed at the end of a 4-year period. All patients underwent a 75 g oral-glucose test (O-GTT) every 6-12 months. The insulin-dependent stage was defined based on an integrated value of serum C-peptide levels on O-GTT ( summation operator CPR; sum of CPR at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) below 4.0 ng\/mL. The summation operator CPR in the SU group decreased progressively from 22.0 +\/- 10.6 to 11.3 +\/- 7.5 ng\/mL over the 48-month period (p < 0.001 vs. baseline). The summation operator CPR in the Ins group was unchanged. Among the SU group, 30% of subjects (9\/30) progressed to IDDM, while 8.3% of Ins group subjects (2\/24) progressed to IDDM (p = 0.087). With regard to the subjects who had a preserved C-peptide response ( summation operator CPR >\/= 10 ng\/mL), the proportion of SU group subjects who progressed to IDDM was significantly higher than that of the Ins group (7\/28, 25% vs. 0\/21, 0%, p = 0.015). Among subjects with a high GADA titer (>\/=0 U\/mL), 9\/14 (64.3%) of the SU group, but only 2\/16 (12.5%) of the Ins group, developed IDDM (p = 0.0068). As to those with a high GADA titer and a preserved C-peptide response, SU group subjects progressed to IDDM (7\/12, 58.3%) more frequently than Ins group subjects (0\/14, 0%) (p = 0.0012). In summary, our results suggest that small doses of insulin effectively prevent beta cell failure in slowly progressive type 1 diabetes. We recommend avoiding SU treatment and instead administering insulin to NIDDM patients with high GADA titer.",

        "Abstract":"We examined the prevalence of islet autoantibodies and their relationship to glycaemic control over 10 years in patients diagnosed clinically with new-onset type 2 diabetes.\n                Patient clinical characteristics and autoantibody status were determined at entry to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) before randomisation to different glucose control policies. Patients were followed for 10 years.\n                Data available on 4,545 of the 5,102 UKPDS patients showed that 11.6% had antibodies to at least one of three antigens: islet cell cytoplasm, glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet autoantibody 2A (IA-2A). Autoantibody-positive patients were younger, more often Caucasian and leaner, with lower beta cell function and higher insulin sensitivity than autoantibody-negative patients. They also had higher HbA1c, and HDL-cholesterol levels, and lower blood pressure, total cholesterol and plasma triglyceride levels. Despite relative hyperglycaemia, autoantibody-positive patients were less likely to have the metabolic syndrome (as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Program III), reflecting a more beneficial overall risk factor profile. Of 3,867 patients with post-dietary run-in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values between 6.0 and 14.9 mmol\/l and no hyperglycaemic symptoms, 9.4% were autoantibody-positive, compared with 25.1% of 678 patients with FPG values of 15.0 mmol\/l or higher, or hyperglycaemic symptoms. In both groups, no differences were seen between those with and without autoantibodies in changes to HbA1c over time, but autoantibody-positive patients required insulin treatment earlier, irrespective of the allocated therapy (p<0.0001).\n                Autoantibody-positive patients can be treated initially with sulphonylurea, but are likely to require insulin earlier than autoantibody-negative patients.",

Sixty GADAb-positive non-insulin-requiring diabetic patients with a 5-yr duration or shorter of diabetes were assigned to either the SU group (n = 30) or the insulin group (n = 30).

Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that SigmaC-peptide values were better preserved in the insulin group than in the SU group. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that insulin treatment, a preserved C-peptide response, and a low GADAb titer at entry were independent factors in preventing progression to an insulin-dependent state. Subgroup analysis suggested that insulin intervention was highly effective for SPIDDM patients with high GADAb titers [> or =10 U\/ml (180 World Health Organization U\/ml)] and preserved beta-cell function [SigmaC-peptide > or = 10 ng\/ml (3.31 nmol\/liter)] at entry.

Seventy percent of patients treated with 1-alpha(OH)D3 maintained or increased their FCP concentrations after 1 year of treatment, while only 22% of patients treated with insulin alone maintained stable FCP levels (P < 0.01). Further analysis on LADA subgroups with different durations of diabetes demonstrated that islet beta-cell function was better preserved (as reflected by significantly higher FCP and PCP levels) in the 1-alpha(OH)D3 plus insulin group only in patients with diabetes duration no longer than 1 year. No severe side effects were observed in any group.\n                Our data suggest that 1-alpha(OH)D3 plus insulin therapy can preserve pancreatic beta-cell function in patients with LADA.",
