The study was continued until there were 24 patients with thrombi and both groups had been under observation for a mean of nearly five months. Thrombi occurred in 18 of 25 (72 per cent) of patients given placebo and 16 of 19 (32 per cent) of those given aspirin (P less than 0.01). The incidence of thrombosis was reduced from 0.46 thrombi per patient month in the placebo group to 0.16 thrombi per patient month in the aspirin group (p less than 0.005). A dose of 160 mg of aspirin per day is an effective, nontoxic antithrombotic regimen in patients on hemodialysis.",

At the base line, the half-life of 51Cr-labeled platelets was reduced in 12 of 17 patients. The platelet half-life became longer and renal function stabilized in the treated group, as compared with the placebo group, suggesting a relation between platelet consumption and the glomerulopathy. The glomerular filtration rate, determined by iothalamate clearance, was better maintained in the treated group (average decrease, 1.3 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area per 12 months) than in the placebo group (average decrease, 19.6). Fewer patients in the treated group than in the placebo group had progression to end-stage renal disease (3 of 21 after 62 months as compared with 9 of 19 after 33 months). The data suggest that dipyridamole and aspirin slowed the deterioration of renal function and the development of end-stage renal disease.",

Eighteen patients with biopsy-proven MPGN (15 type I, 3 type II) and nephrotic syndrome were randomly assigned to receive protein restriction, antihypertensive therapy (control group) or in addition aspirin and dipyridamole (treatment group). Patients were prospectively followed for a mean of 36 months. Serum creatinine remained unchanged after 36 months compared to baseline in both groups. In the treatment group proteinuria was reduced from 8.3 +\/- 1.4 to 1.6 +\/- 0.7 g\/day (P < 0.05). In control patients proteinuria decreased from 7.1 +\/- 1.6 to 4.3 +\/- 1.1 g\/day.

Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of a chimeric monoclonal-antibody Fab fragment (c7E3 Fab) directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor, in patients undergoing angioplasty who were at high risk for ischemic complications. This receptor is the final common pathway for platelet aggregation.\n                In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 2099 patients treated at 56 centers received a bolus and an infusion of placebo, a bolus of c7E3 Fab and an infusion of placebo, or a bolus and an infusion of c7E3 Fab. They were scheduled to undergo coronary angioplasty or atherectomy in high-risk clinical situations involving severe unstable angina, evolving acute myocardial infarction, or high-risk coronary morphologic characteristics. The primary study end point consisted of any of the following: death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical revascularization, unplanned repeat percutaneous procedure, unplanned implantation of a coronary stent, or insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia. The numbers of end-point events were tabulated for 30 days after randomization.\n                As compared with placebo, the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion resulted in a 35 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point (12.8 vs. 8.3 percent, P = 0.008), whereas a 10 percent reduction was observed with the c7E3 Fab bolus alone (12.8 vs. 11.5 percent, P = 0.43). The reduction in the number of events with the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion was consistent across the end points of unplanned revascularization procedures and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Bleeding episodes and transfusions were more frequent in the group given the c7E3 Fab bolus and infusion than in the other two groups.\n                Ischemic complications of coronary angioplasty and atherectomy were reduced with a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet IIb\/IIIa glycoprotein receptor, although the risk of bleeding was increased.",

Patients were assigned one of three treatments: placebo (n = 1328), a bolus of 135 micrograms\/kg eptifibatide followed by an infusion of 0.5 microgram kg-1 min-1 for 20-24 h (n = 1349), or 135 micrograms\/kg eptifibatide bolus with a 0.75 microgram kg-1 min-1 infusion (n = 1333). The coronary procedure was started within 10-60 min of the start of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the 30-day composite occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, unplanned surgical or repeat percutaneous revascularisation, or coronary stent implantation for abrupt closure (by intention to treat). The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding.\n                By 30 days, the composite endpoint had occurred in 151 (11.4%) patients in the placebo group compared with 124 (9.2%) in the 135\/0.5 eptifibatide group (p = 0.063) and 132 (9.9%) in the eptifibatide 135\/0.75 group (p = 0.22).

Eptifibatide treatment did not increase rates of major bleeding or transfusion.\n                In the 135\/0.5 group, treatment with eptifibatide during coronary intervention reduced rates of early abrupt closure and ischaemic events at 30 days. Non-significant differences were seen with the 135\/0.75 regimen. The doses studied thus appear to be at the low end of the efficacy-response curve.

Eptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide, is a selective high-affinity inhibitor of the platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor, which is involved in platelet aggregation. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of platelet aggregation with eptifibatide would have an incremental benefit beyond that of heparin and aspirin in reducing the frequency of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes who did not have persistent ST-segment elevation.\n                Patients who had presented with ischemic chest pain within the previous 24 hours and who had either electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia (but not persistent ST-segment elevation) or high serum concentrations of creatine kinase MB isoenzymes were enrolled in the study. They were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to receive a bolus and infusion of either eptifibatide or placebo, in addition to standard therapy, for up to 72 hours (or up to 96 hours, if coronary intervention was performed near the end of the 72-hour period).

As compared with the placebo group, the eptifibatide group had a 1.5 percent absolute reduction in the incidence of the primary end point (14.2 percent, vs. 15.7 percent in the placebo group; P=0.04). The benefit was apparent by 96 hours and persisted through 30 days. The effect was consistent in most major subgroups except for women (odds ratios for death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.8 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 0.9] in men, and 1.1 [0.9 to 1.31 in women).

We did a randomised controlled trial to assess the role of platelet glycoprotein-IIb\/IIIa blockade for use in elective stenting.\n                At 63 hospitals in the USA and Canada, 2399 patients with ischaemic heart disease and suitable coronary-artery lesions were randomly assigned stenting plus placebo (n=809), stenting plus abciximab, a IIb\/IIIa inhibitor (n=794), or balloon angioplasty plus abciximab (n=796). The primary endpoint was a combination of death, myocardial infarction, or need for urgent revascularisation in the first 30 days. All patients received heparin, aspirin, and standard pharmacological therapy.\n                The primary endpoint occurred in 87 (10.8%) of 809 patients in the stent plus placebo group, 42 (5.3%) of 794 in the stent plus abciximab group (hazard ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.33-0.69] p<0.001), and 55 (6.9%) of 796 in the balloon plus abciximab group (0.63 [0.45-0.88] p=0.007). The main outcomes that occurred less with abciximab were death and large myocardial infarction--7.8% in the placebo group, 3.0% for stent plus abciximab (p<0.001), and 4.7% for balloon angioplasty plus abciximab (p=0.01). Major bleeding complications occurred in 2.2% of patients assigned stent plus placebo, 1.5% assigned stent plus abciximab, and 1.4% assigned balloon angioplasty plus abciximab (p=0.38).\n                Platelet glycoprotein-IIb\/IIIa blockade with abciximab substantially improves the safety of coronary-stenting procedures. Balloon angioplasty with abciximab is safer than stenting without abciximab.",

        "Abstract":"Picotamide both inhibits thromboxane synthetase and acts as a thromboxane antagonist at the receptor level. We investigated the long-term effect of picotamide on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) at rest and induced by exercise in 30 type 2 diabetic patients who were normotensive and had microalbuminuria while at rest. The subjects of our study had a mean age of 52.5 +\/- 1.6 years, BMI of 28.5 +\/- 0.7 kg\/m2, diabetes duration of 9.1 +\/- 1.8 years, and HbA1c of 7.0 +\/- 0.8%. The study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients were randomly allocated to receive for 1 year either picotamide, 300 mg, 3 tablets\/day, or placebo, 3 tablets\/day. The patients were asked to visit our outpatient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. At all times, blood pressure, microalbuminuria at rest, blood glucose, serum creatinine, serum picotamide, and creatinine clearance were measured; at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, all patients underwent submaximal physical exercise. After 6 months of picotamide, baseline and exercise-induced microalbuminuria were significantly decreased (up to one-third) as compared with the baseline and placebo level, with no further drops at month 12 of picotamide treatment. On placebo treatment, UAE at rest and after exercise was slightly increased compared with baseline values. The effects of picotamide occurred without significant side effects or changes in either blood pressure levels or glycometabolic control. Our study is the first long-term intervention trial in type 2 diabetes showing that an antithromboxane agent is able to decrease microalbuminuria, which in this disease is a dual marker of macro- and microangiopathy. Our findings suggest an important role for thromboxane in the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria in diabetes; moreover, we hypothesize that antithromboxane agents may have a place in the treatment\/prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients.",

Platelets play a key role in the process of early infarct artery reocclusion, but inhibition of aggregation via the glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor has not been prospectively evaluated in the setting of acute MI.\n                Patients with acute MI of <12 hours' duration were randomized, on a double-blind basis, to placebo or abciximab if they were deemed candidates for primary PTCA. The primary efficacy end point was death, reinfarction, or any (urgent or elective) target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 6 months by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Other key prespecified end points were early (7 and 30 days) death, reinfarction, or urgent TVR. The baseline clinical and angiographic variables of the 483 (242 placebo and 241 abciximab) patients were balanced. There was no difference in the incidence of the primary 6-month end point (ITT analysis) in the 2 groups (28.1% and 28.2%, P=0.97, of the placebo and abciximab patients, respectively). However, abciximab significantly reduced the incidence of death, reinfarction, or urgent TVR at all time points assessed (9.9% versus 3.3%, P=0.003, at 7 days; 11.2% versus 5.8%, P=0.03, at 30 days; and 17.8% versus 11.6%, P=0.05, at 6 months). Analysis by actual treatment with PTCA and study drug demonstrated a considerable effect of abciximab with respect to death or reinfarction: 4.7% versus 1.4%, P=0.047, at 7 days; 5.8% versus 3.2%, P=0.20, at 30 days; and 12.0% versus 6.9%, P=0.07, at 6 months. The need for unplanned, \"bail-out\" stenting was reduced by 42% in the abciximab group (20.4% versus 11.9%, P=0.008). Major bleeding occurred significantly more frequently in the abciximab group (16.6% versus 9.5%, P=0.02), mostly at the arterial access site. There was no intracranial hemorrhage in either group.\n                Aggressive platelet inhibition with abciximab during primary PTCA for acute MI yielded a substantial reduction in the acute (30-day) phase for death, reinfarction, and urgent target vessel revascularization. However, the bleeding rates were excessive, and the 6-month primary end point, which included elective revascularization, was not favorably affected.",

Decreasing renal function was strongly associated with adverse outcome, increasing the risk for ischemic complications at all time points examined (all P < 0.002).

These effects seem to be mediated via mechanisms that are different from those of angiotensin II receptor blocker or thiazolidinedione.",

        "Abstract":"The arteriovenous fistula is the preferred type of vascular access for hemodialysis because of lower thrombosis and infection rates and lower health care expenditures compared with synthetic grafts or central venous catheters. Early failure of fistulas due to thrombosis or inadequate maturation is a barrier to increasing the prevalence of fistulas among patients treated with hemodialysis. Small, inconclusive trials have suggested that antiplatelet agents may reduce thrombosis of new fistulas.\n                To determine whether clopidogrel reduces early failure of hemodialysis fistulas.\n                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 9 US centers composed of academic and community nephrology practices in 2003-2007. Eight hundred seventy-seven participants with end-stage renal disease or advanced chronic kidney disease were followed up until 150 to 180 days after fistula creation or 30 days after initiation of dialysis, whichever occurred later.\n                Participants were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose followed by daily dose of 75 mg; n = 441) or placebo (n = 436) for 6 weeks starting within 1 day after fistula creation.\n                The primary outcome was fistula thrombosis, determined by physical examination at 6 weeks. The secondary outcome was failure of the fistula to become suitable for dialysis. Suitability was defined as use of the fistula at a dialysis machine blood pump rate of 300 mL\/min or more during 8 of 12 dialysis sessions.\n                Enrollment was stopped after 877 participants were randomized based on a stopping rule for intervention efficacy. Fistula thrombosis occurred in 53 (12.2%) participants assigned to clopidogrel compared with 84 (19.5%) participants assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.97; P = .018). Failure to attain suitability for dialysis did not differ between the clopidogrel and placebo groups (61.8% vs 59.5%, respectively; relative risk, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.17; P = .40).\n                Clopidogrel reduces the frequency of early thrombosis of new arteriovenous fistulas but does not increase the proportion of fistulas that become suitable for dialysis.

        "Abstract":"Arteriovenous graft stenosis leading to thrombosis is a major cause of complications in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Procedural interventions may restore patency but are costly. Although there is no proven pharmacologic therapy, dipyridamole may be promising because of its known vascular antiproliferative activity.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release dipyridamole, at a dose of 200 mg, and aspirin, at a dose of 25 mg, given twice daily after the placement of a new arteriovenous graft until the primary outcome, loss of primary unassisted patency (i.e., patency without thrombosis or requirement for intervention), was reached. Secondary outcomes were cumulative graft failure and death. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards regression with adjustment for prespecified covariates.\n                At 13 centers in the United States, 649 patients were randomly assigned to receive dipyridamole plus aspirin (321 patients) or placebo (328 patients) over a period of 4.5 years, with 6 additional months of follow-up. The incidence of primary unassisted patency at 1 year was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18 to 28) in the placebo group and 28% (95% CI, 23 to 34) in the dipyridamole-aspirin group, an absolute difference of 5 percentage points. Treatment with dipyridamole plus aspirin significantly prolonged the duration of primary unassisted patency (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98; P=0.03) and inhibited stenosis. The incidences of cumulative graft failure, death, the composite of graft failure or death, and serious adverse events (including bleeding) did not differ significantly between study groups.\n                Treatment with dipyridamole plus aspirin had a significant but modest effect in reducing the risk of stenosis and improving the duration of primary unassisted patency of newly created grafts.

        "Abstract":"The optimal vascular access for chronic maintenance hemodialysis is the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Several studies suggest a role for antiplatelet agents in the prevention of primary AVF failure. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in hemodialysis patients. Ninety three patients were randomized to receive 75 mg\/daily of clopidogrel or placebo. The treatment was initiated 7-10 days prior to scheduled access surgery and continued up to six weeks postoperatively, and then patients were monitored for six months. The primary outcome was AVF failure eight weeks after fistula creation. With a permuted block randomization schedule, 46 patients received clopidogrel and 47 patients received control placebo. The primary AVF failures at two months were 21.6% in placebo group and 5.2% in clopidogrel group (P = 0.03). The hazard ratio for the incidence of primary AVF failure was 0.72 (CI 95%, 0.41-1.01). Analysis of covariables indicated that this effect occurred principally as a result of clopidogrel administration. First hemodialysis from newly created AVF in clopidogrel group was significantly more successful than placebo group (P = 0.008). No life-threatening adverse event or severe bleeding was recorded in both groups. Clopidogrel seems to be effective and safe for prevention of primary AVF failure in hemodialysis patients.",

        "Abstract":"No prospective randomized trial has specifically examined the long-term outcomes of clopidogrel use in patients with chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to determine the risks and benefits of long-term clopidogrel administration in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the most common form of chronic kidney disease. We performed a post hoc analysis of the CHARISMA trial, which randomly assigned patients without active acute coronary syndrome, but with established atherosclerotic disease (symptomatic) or multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic disease (asymptomatic), to clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin. All CHARISMA patients (n = 15,603) were separated into the 3 groups: nondiabetic patients, diabetic patients without nephropathy, and diabetic patients with nephropathy. Within each group, outcomes of patients randomly assigned to clopidogrel were compared with those of patients randomly assigned to placebo. Outcomes in the prespecified CHARISMA subgroups of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were also compared with respect to study drug assignment and nephropathy status. Patients with nephropathy who received clopidogrel had no difference in bleeding, but experienced significantly increased cardiovascular (CV) and overall mortality compared with those randomly assigned to placebo. There were no differences in bleeding, overall mortality, or CV mortality for nondiabetic or diabetic patients without nephropathy who received clopidogrel versus placebo. In the asymptomatic cohort, patients with nephropathy randomly assigned to clopidogrel had significantly increased overall and CV mortality compared with placebo, whereas asymptomatic patients without nephropathy randomly assigned to clopidogrel had no significant mortality difference compared with placebo. In conclusion, this post hoc analysis suggested that clopidogrel may be harmful in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Additional studies are needed to investigate this possible interaction.",

The balance of benefit and harm associated with antiplatelet therapy remains uncertain.\n                The HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment) study randomly assigned participants with diastolic hypertension to aspirin (75 mg) or placebo. Study treatment effects were calculated using univariate proportional hazards regression models stratified by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with trends tested by adding interaction terms. End points included major cardiovascular events, total mortality, and major bleeding.\n                The study included 18,597 participants treated for 3.8 years. Baseline eGFR was < 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) in 3,619 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced by 9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -9% to 24%), 15% (95% CI: -17% to 39%), and 66% (95% CI: 33% to 83%) for patients with baseline eGFR of \u2265 60, 45 to 59, and < 45 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2), respectively (p trend = 0.03). Total mortality was reduced by 0% (95% CI: -20% to 17%), 11% (95% CI: -31% to 40%), and 49% (95% CI: 6% to 73%), respectively (p trend = 0.04). Major bleeding events were nonsignificantly greater with lower eGFR (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.11 to 2.08], HR: 1.70 [95% CI: 0.74 to 3.88], and HR: 2.81 [95% CI: 0.92 to 8.84], respectively; p trend = 0.30). Among every 1,000 persons with eGFR < 45 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) treated for 3.8 years, 76 major cardiovascular events and 54 all-cause deaths will be prevented while 27 excess major bleeds will occur.\n                Aspirin therapy produces greater absolute reduction in major cardiovascular events and mortality in hypertensive patients with CKD than with normal kidney function. An increased risk of major bleeding appears to be outweighed by the substantial benefits.\n                Copyright \u00a9 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel reduced the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke at 12 months but with similar major bleeding rates.\n                Central laboratory serum creatinine levels were available in 15 202 (81.9%) acute coronary syndrome patients at baseline, and creatinine clearance, estimated by the Cockcroft Gault equation, was calculated. In patients with chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min; n=3237), ticagrelor versus clopidogrel significantly reduced the primary end point to 17.3% from 22.0% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.90) with an absolute risk reduction greater than that of patients with normal renal function (n=11 965): 7.9% versus 8.9% (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.02). In patients with chronic kidney disease, ticagrelor reduced total mortality (10.0% versus 14.0%; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.89). Major bleeding rates, fatal bleedings, and non-coronary bypass-related major bleedings were not significantly different between the 2 randomized groups (15.1% versus 14.3%; HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.30; 0.34% versus 0.77%; HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.54; and 8.5% versus 7.3%; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.68). The interactions between creatinine clearance and randomized treatment on any of the outcome variables were nonsignificant.\n                In acute coronary syndrome patients with chronic kidney disease, ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel significantly reduces ischemic end points and mortality without a significant increase in major bleeding but with numerically more non-procedure-related bleeding.\n                URL:http:\/\/www.clinicatrials.gov.
