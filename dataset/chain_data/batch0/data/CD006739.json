Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg\/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52.\n                In patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +\/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +\/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +\/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +\/- 0.1%, P <0.0001). Mean prandial glucose and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +\/- 0.4 mmol\/l (P <0.0001) and 1.2 +\/- 0.4 mmol\/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +\/- 0.6 mmol\/l (P=0.0001), 40 +\/- 16 pmol\/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +\/- 0.5 mmol\/l (P=0.0312), respectively.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in HbA(1c) at week 24. Secondary efficacy end points included the change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, and proinsulin; the Homeostasis Model Assessment beta-cell function and insulin-resistance indexes; the proinsulin\/ insulin ratio; the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index; the percent changes from baseline in selected lipid parameters; the proportion of patients meeting the American Diabetes Association HbA(1c), goal of <7.0%; the proportion of patients requiring metformin rescue therapy; and the time to the initiation of rescue therapy.\n                One hundred seventy-five patients were randomized to receive sitagliptin, and 178 were randomized to receive placebo. The mean (SD) baseline HbAlc value was 8.1% (0.8) in the sitagliptin group and 8.0% (0.8) in the placebo group.

Baseline FPG averaged 10.5 mmol\/L; the between-treatment difference in AMDelta FPG was -0.6+\/-0.4 mmol\/L in patients receiving vildagliptin 50mg qd and -1.3+\/-0.4 mmol\/L (P=0.001) in both groups receiving 100mg daily. Relative to baseline, body weight did not change significantly in any of the three vildagliptin groups and decreased by 1.4+\/-0.4 kg in the placebo group. Adverse events (AEs) occurred with similar frequency in each group: 55.8%, 59.3%, 59.3%, and 57.6% of patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg qd, 50 mg bid, 100 mg qd, or placebo, respectively, experienced an AE. No confirmed hypoglycemia was reported. Conclusion: Vildagliptin is effective and well-tolerated in drug-na\u00efve patients with T2DM and 100 mg vildagliptin provides similar clinical benefit whether given as single or in divided doses.",

At end point, vildagliptin was as effective as rosiglitazone, improving A1C by -1.1 +\/- 0.1% (P < 0.001) and -1.3 +\/- 0.1% (P < 0.001), respectively, meeting the statistical criterion for noninferiority (upper-limit 95% CI for between-treatment difference < or =0.4%). Fasting plasma glucose decreased more with rosiglitazone (-2.3 mmol\/l) than with vildagliptin (-1.3 mmol\/l).

Relative to rosiglitazone, vildagliptin significantly decreased triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL, non-HDL, and total-to-HDL cholesterol (-9 to -16%, all P < or = 0.01) but produced a smaller increase in HDL cholesterol (+4 vs. +9%, P = 0.003). The proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event was 61.4 vs. 64.0% in patients receiving vildagliptin and rosiglitazone, respectively.

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes is difficult to manage in patients with a long history of disease requiring insulin therapy. Moreover, addition of most currently available oral antidiabetic agents increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor, which improves glycaemic control by increasing pancreatic beta cell responsiveness to glucose and suppressing inappropriate glucagon secretion. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin added to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n                This was a multicentre, 24-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients with type 2 diabetes that was inadequately controlled (HbA(1c) = 7.5-11%) by insulin. Patients received vildagliptin (n = 144; 50 mg twice daily) or placebo (n = 152) while continuing insulin therapy.\n                Baseline HbA(1c) averaged 8.4 +\/- 0.1% in both groups. The adjusted mean change from baseline to endpoint (AMDelta) in HbA(1c) was -0.5 +\/- 0.1% and -0.2 +\/- 0.1% in patients receiving vildagliptin or placebo, respectively, with a significant between-treatment difference (p = 0.01). In patients aged >\/=65 years, the AMDelta HbA(1c) was -0.7 +\/- 0.1% in the vildagliptin group vs -0.1 +\/- 0.1% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the vildagliptin (81.3%) and placebo (82.9%) groups. However, hypoglycaemic events were less common (p < 0.001) and less severe (p < 0.05) in patients receiving vildagliptin than in those receiving placebo.\n                Vildagliptin decreases HbA(1c) in patients whose type 2 diabetes is poorly controlled with high doses of insulin. Addition of vildagliptin to insulin therapy is also associated with reduced confirmed and severe hypoglycaemia. ClinicalTrials.gov ID no.: NCT 00099931.",

        "Abstract":"To examine the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral sitagliptin as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n                In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 741 patients (baseline HbA(1c) [A1C] 8.0%) were randomized to sitagliptin 100 or 200 mg or placebo for 24 weeks.\n                Sitagliptin 100 and 200 mg produced significant (P < 0.001) placebo-subtracted reductions in A1C (-0.79 and -0.94%, respectively) and fasting plasma glucose (-1.0 mmol\/l [-17.1 mg\/dl] and -1.2 mmol\/l [-21.3 mg\/dl], respectively). Patients with baseline A1C >or=9% had greater reductions in placebo-subtracted A1C with sitagliptin 100 and 200 mg (-1.52 and -1.50%, respectively) than those with baseline A1C <8% (-0.57 and -0.65%) or >or=8 to <9.0% (-0.80 and -1.13%, respectively). In a meal tolerance test, sitagliptin 100 and 200 mg significantly decreased 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) (placebo-subtracted PPG -2.6 mmol\/l [-46.7 mg\/dl] and -3.0 mmol\/l [-54.1 mg\/dl], respectively). Results for the above key efficacy parameters were not significantly different between sitagliptin doses. Homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio improved with sitagliptin. The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar, and overall gastrointestinal adverse experiences were slightly higher with sitagliptin. No meaningful body weight changes from baseline were observed with sitagliptin 100 (-0.2 kg) or 200 mg (-0.1 kg). The body weight change with placebo (-1.1 kg) was significantly (P < 0.01) different from that observed with sitagliptin.\n                In this 24-week study, once-daily sitagliptin monotherapy improved glycemic control in the fasting and postprandial states, improved measures of beta-cell function, and was well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.",
