        "Abstract":"Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials.\n                To determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease.\n                Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial.\n                Outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.\n                A total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years.\n                Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.\n                The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n                Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).\n                During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.",

The investigations included gynecological history. occurrence of climacteric symptoms, quality of life evaluation, cardiac history and symptoms of angina pectoris.\n                Forty-six women (77%) completed the study during 1 year. The following cardiac events occurred in the women who completed the study: one patient was hospitalized because of congestive heart failure (patch), two patients because of angina pectoris, one patient because of coronary bypass operation (CEE) and three patients underwent balloon dilatation (placebo), all three on CEE.

        "Abstract":"Recent observational studies suggest a 2-4 fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The present study was started before publication of these studies, and the aim was to determine if HRT alters the risk of VTE in high risk women. The study was a randomized. double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial with a double-triangular sequential design. Females with previously verified VTE were randomized to 2 mg estradiol plus 1 mg norethisterone acetate, 1 tablet daily (n = 71) or placebo (n = 69). The primary outcome was recurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Between 1996 and 1998 a total of 140 women were included. The study was terminated prematurely based on the results of circumstantial evidence emerging during the trial. Eight women in the HRT group and one woman in the placebo group developed VTE. The incidence of VTE was 10.7% in the HRT group and 2.3% in the placebo group. In the HRT group, all events happened within 261 days after inclusion. The sequential design did not stop the study, but strongly indicated a difference between the two groups. Our data strongly suggests that women who have previously suffered a VTE have an increased risk of recurrence on HRT. This treatment should therefore be avoided in this patient group if possible. The results also support those of recent epidemiological studies, which also indicate increased risk of VTE in non-selected female populations during HRT.",

This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases.

Forty-five subjects completed the 42-month angiogram (20 underwent 42-month IVUS).

In contrast, HT accelerated disease progression in non-bypassed native coronary arteries (minimum lumen diameter, p=0.01). SVG disease and closure occurred in 38% subjects within 1-year post-CABG. The groups had similar frequency of cardiovascular events expect for angioplasty that occurred in eight HT compared to one placebo subject (p<0.05).

Secondary outcomes: other cancers, death from all causes, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, and quality of life.\n                The trial was prematurely closed during recruitment, after a median follow-up of 11.9 months (interquartile range 7.1-19.6, total 6498 women years) in those enrolled, after the publication of early results from the women's health initiative study. The mean age of randomised women was 62.8 (SD 4.8) years. When combined hormone therapy (n=2196) was compared with placebo (n=2189), there was a significant increase in the number of major cardiovascular events (7 v 0, P=0.016) and venous thromboembolisms (22 v 3, hazard ratio 7.36 (95% CI 2.20 to 24.60)). There were no statistically significant differences in numbers of breast or other cancers (22 v 25, hazard ratio 0.88 (0.49 to 1.56)), cerebrovascular events (14 v 19, 0.73 (0.37 to 1.46)), fractures (40 v 58, 0.69 (0.46 to 1.03)), and overall deaths (8 v 5, 1.60 (0.52 to 4.89)). Comparison of combined hormone therapy (n=815) versus oestrogen therapy (n=826) outcomes revealed no significant differences.\n                Hormone replacement therapy increases cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk when started many years after the menopause. The results are consistent with the findings of the women's health initiative study and secondary prevention studies. Research is needed to assess the long term risks and benefits of starting hormone replacement therapy near the menopause, when the effect may be different.\n                Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 63718836.",

        "Abstract":"Results of observational studies suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but those of randomised trials do not indicate a lower risk in women who use oestrogen plus progestagen. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether or not unopposed oestrogen reduces the risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women who survive a first myocardial infarction.\n                The study was a randomised, blinded, placebo controlled, secondary prevention trial of postmenopausal women, age 50-69 years (n=1017) who had survived a first myocardial infarction. Individuals were recruited from 35 hospitals in England and Wales. Women received either one tablet of oestradiol valerate (2 mg; n=513) or placebo (n=504), daily for 2 years. Primary outcomes were reinfarction or cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were uterine bleeding, endometrial cancer, stroke or other embolic events, and fractures.\n                Frequency of reinfarction or cardiac death did not differ between treatment groups at 24 months (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.70-1.41, p=0.97). Similarly, the reduction in all-cause mortality between those who took oestrogen and those on placebo was not significant (0.79, 0.50-1.27, p=0.34). The relative risk of any death (0.56, 0.23-1.33) and cardiac death (0.33, 0.11-1.01) was lowest at 3 months post-recruitment.\n                Oestradiol valerate does not reduce the overall risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women who have survived a myocardial infarction.",
