        "Abstract":"Recurrence rate is high after operation for Crohn's disease. A multicenter trial was performed to study the effect of radical or nonradical operation and of sulfasalazine prophylaxis versus placebo on postoperative recurrence rate in 232 patients with Crohn's disease. Sixteen medical and surgical centers participated in the study, 7 operating radically and 9 nonradically. The follow-up period lasted 3 years, the allocation to drug treatment was randomized and double blind. Recurrence was significantly less frequent and occurred later in patients who were operated nonradically. Patients on sulfasalazine prophylaxis had a better prognosis than on placebo. This effect was statistically significant in the first 2 years of treatment. Both strategies were additive: nonradical operation and sulfasalazine had the best prognosis, radical operation and placebo was worst. It is concluded that postoperative recurrence is best prevented by resecting nonradically and prescribing 3 g of sulfasalazine daily at least over 2 years.",

The most appropriate prophylactic treatment has not been clearly defined. This study evaluated the efficacy of 5-ASA and azathioprine in decreasing postoperative recurrence and analysed the presence of variables associated with recurrence. Thirty-nine patients (mean age 32.8 years, range 18-61) with a history of ileal or ileocecal surgical resection were studied. They received 5-ASA (3 mg\/day) or azathioprine (50 mg\/day) immediately after the operation and for 2 years thereafter. Patients were followed clinically (Crohn's disease activity index) and serologically every 3 months and by imaging methods every 6 months. The latter included colonoscopy with ileoscopy and if not available, small bowel barium or ultrasonographic study. Laboratory tests included ESR, C-reactive protein, white blood cell and platelet count, fibrinogen and albumin. The end-point evaluated included clinical recurrence (CR), serological recurrence (SR: alteration of at least three of the above-mentioned variables) and morphologic recurrence (MR: endoscopic recurrence > 1 according to Rutgeerts score or radiological or ultrasonographic recurrence). Eighteen patients received azathioprine and 21 received 5-ASA. Thirty-four patients were evaluated. The cumulative proportion of patients with recurrence was 29% (CR), 35% (SR) and 50% (MR). Statistical analysis did not show significant differences between the two groups. Twenty-seven patients completed the 2-year study (11 in the azathioprine group and 16 in the 5-ASA group).

        "Abstract":"Complications of Crohn's disease (CD) lead to surgery in about 70-90% of patients. The majority of patients suffer from relapse of the disease. Colonic bacteria are essential to the development of CD. Therefore, a rationale exists in trying to prevent relapse by manipulation of gut microflora. This is feasible by treatment with probiotics or antibiotics. Synbiotic 2000 is a cocktail containing 4 probiotic species and 4 prebiotics. It is rational to pursue that it could be effective in preventing postoperative disease. We sought to check weather treatment with Synbiotic 2000 could prevent postoperative recurrence in patients with CD. This was a prospective multicenter, randomized study. Patients were randomized to active treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Follow-up consisted of endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. Thirty patients were enrolled. No differences were found between the 2 treatment groups regarding gender, age at diagnosis, age at surgery, weight, smoking status, type of disease, length of the resected segment, or medical treatment prior to surgery. No difference in either endoscopic or clinical relapse rate was found between patients treated with once daily dose of Synbiotic 2000 or placebo. In our small study, Synbiotic 2000 had no effect on postoperative recurrence of patients with CD. Larger studies in patients with the inflammatory type of CD undergoing surgery, using higher doses of probiotics cocktail might prove effective.",

        "Abstract":"Seventy percent of Crohn's disease (CD) patients exhibit anastomotic recurrence within 1 year after ileo-caecal surgery. Recent clinical trials suggest the beneficial use of probiotics in the control of intestinal inflammation in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. This study is a multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an oral administration of the probiotic LAl on early post-operative endoscopic recurrence of CD.\n                Seventy patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was performed according to smoking status at randomization.\n                Seven and 14 patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 +\/- 1.32 versus 1.22+\/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP) analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +\/-1.31 versus 1.05 +\/- 1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70 points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4\/27) and 13.5% (3\/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank test: P = 0.79).\n                Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after ileo-caecal resection.",

        "Abstract":"More than 80% of Crohn's disease (CD) patients undergoing resection suffer recurrence of their disease. Therapy with aminosalicylates, antimetabolites, or antibiotics leads to a modest reduction in the incidence of recurrence. Goal: We sought to examine whether metronidazole for 3 months together with azathioprine (AZA) for 12 months is superior to metronidazole alone to reduce recurrence of postoperative CD in \"high-risk\" patients.\n                CD patients undergoing curative ileocecal resection with >or=1 risk factor for recurrence received metronidazole (3 months) and AZA\/placebo (12 months). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with significant endoscopic recurrence 3 and 12 months after surgery. Secondary end points included clinical recurrence, safety, and tolerability of treatment.\n                Eighty-one patients were randomized; 19 discontinued the study early. Significant endoscopic recurrence was observed in 14 of 32 (43.7%) patients in the AZA group and in 20 of 29 (69.0%) patients in the placebo group at 12 months postsurgery (P = .048). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed endoscopic recurrence in 22 of 40 (55%) in the AZA group and 32 of 41 (78%) in the placebo group at month 12 (P = .035). At month 12, 7 of 32 patients had no endoscopic lesions in the AZA group, versus 1 of 29 in the placebo group (P = .037).\n                Despite the enhanced risk of recurrence, the overall incidence of significant recurrence was rather low, probably owing to the metronidazole treatment that all patients received. Concomitant AZA resulted in lower endoscopic recurrence rates and less severe recurrences 12 months postsurgery, predicting a more favorable clinical outcome. This combined treatment seems to be recommendable to all operated CD patients with an enhanced risk for recurrence.",

        "Abstract":"Endoscopic postoperative recurrences occur early after 'curative' surgery for Crohn's disease. Pentasa has been shown to be effective in the maintenance treatment of quiescent Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a 12-week oral intake of Claversal in the prevention of endoscopic recurrences after 'curative' resection for ileal, colonic or ileocolonic Crohn's disease. We conducted a multicentre double-blind controlled trial comparing Claversal (1g tid) with placebo, starting within 15 days after surgery. The macroscopic normality of the two anastomotic segments was assessed at surgery. Patients were clinically and biologically evaluated twice (6-week interval), and colonoscopy was performed at 12 weeks. Endoscopic relapse was defined by any anastomotic ulcerations or stenosis and staged according to a four-grade score.\n                Between May 1989 and May 1991 12 centres included 126 patients, 70 women and 56 men, aged 33 +\/- 12 years (range 16-70) in the study. Disease locations were ileal, colonic and ileocolonic in 45, 6 and 49%, respectively. Claversal and placebo groups were similar at inclusion, except for ESR (37 +\/- 26 vs. 27 +\/- 23 mm\/h in the Claversal and placebo groups, respectively; P < 0.05). Nine patients were withdrawn from the study. Adverse reactions occurred only in six patients. Five patients were excluded for protocol violation. Finally, 106 patients could be evaluated at 12 weeks (55 Claversal and 51 placebo). An endoscopic relapse was observed in 50% and 63% of the Claversal and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.16), with a similar grade distribution. Claversal was well tolerated.\n                Our study confirms that a large proportion of endoscopic recurrences occur within 3 months of resection in Crohn's disease. There was a slight trend towards greater efficacy of Claversal; it could be worthwhile trying higher dosages and\/or 5-ASA compounds with different intestinal release profiles.",
