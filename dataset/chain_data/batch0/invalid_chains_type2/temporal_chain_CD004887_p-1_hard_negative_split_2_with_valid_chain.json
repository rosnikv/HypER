        "title": "Recombinant factor VIIa for variceal bleeding in patients with advanced cirrhosis: A randomized, controlled trial",
        "abstract": "A beneficial effect of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in Child\u2010Pugh class B and C patients with cirrhosis who have variceal bleeding has been suggested. This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in patients with advanced cirrhosis and active variceal bleeding. At 31 hospitals in an emergency setting, 256 patients (Child\u2010Pugh > 8; Child\u2010Pugh B = 26%, C = 74%) were randomized equally to: placebo; 600 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa (200 + 4\u00d7 100 \u03bcg/kg); or 300 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa (200 + 100 \u03bcg/kg). Dosing was intravenous at 0, 2, 8, 14, and 20 hours after endoscopy, in addition to standard vasoactive, prophylactic antibiotic, and endoscopic treatment. The primary composite endpoint consisted of failure to control 24\u2010hour bleeding, or failure to prevent rebleeding or death at day 5. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and 42\u2010day mortality. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Administration of rFVIIa had no significant effect on the composite endpoint compared with placebo (P = 0.37). There was no significant difference in 5\u2010day mortality between groups; however, 42\u2010day mortality was significantly lower with 600 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa compared with placebo (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.13\u20130.74), and bleeding\u2010related deaths were reduced from 12% (placebo) to 2% (600 \u03bcg/kg). A marked heterogeneity in the failure rate in all treatment groups was observed across participating centers. Adverse events, including overall thromboembolic events, were comparable between groups. Conclusion: Treatment with rFVIIa had no significant effect on the primary composite endpoint compared with placebo. Therefore, decision on the use of this hemostatic agent in acute variceal bleeding should be carefully considered, because results of this study do not support the routine use of rFVIIa in this setting. Adverse events were comparable across groups. (HEPATOLOGY 2008.)",

        "title": "Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia: where we are and where we are going.",
        "abstract": "I nduced therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest in adult patients may be one of the most important developments in postarrest care in the last decade. From the time of the publication of two landmark studies (1, 2), most centers now employ this therapy. TH is appealing in its relative simplicity and its ability to improve neurologically intact survival as well as its potential to extend the period of lowflow time (i.e., time receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]) that the patient can tolerate. Within the pediatric critical care community, there is keen interest in learning if postarrest hypothermia will be beneficial in children. In this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Meert and colleagues (3) have published an important study, the primary purpose of which was to describe patient characteristics, cardiac arrest events, and outcomes necessary for the design of a study of TH in pediatric patients. These observations themselves, however, add greatly to our general understanding of in-hospital cardiac arrest in children. Studying cardiac arrest is not easy. These events often occur capriciously and the underlying physiology and arrestinciting events vary widely\u2014from electrolyte derangement to progressive hypoxia to sudden arrhythmia. Despite a protocolized approach from the Pediatric Advanced Life Support training that most clinicians use, specific interventions and therapies remain at the discretion of the code team and are variable. Gathering the data to best understand an arrest event and the conditions leading up to it is challenging after the windstorm of activity that is often a cardiac arrest. The evolution of the study of cardiac arrest has been interesting. Early work varied widely in the end points examined, making studies difficult to compare. Therefore, leaders in the field met at Utstein Abby near Stavanger, Norway, in June 1990 to agree on a framework for uniform reporting in CPR (4). This initiative advanced immeasurably our ability to learn from arrest events and essentially all publications in CPR since this consensus conference have followed the \u201cUtstein Style\u201d (5). Through the American Heart Association, several member hospitals now participate in the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. This has yielded several benefits, including the ability of members to compare their institutions with the aggregate for ongoing quality improvement. In addition, the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation is a robust database on inhospital CPR available to researchers for scientific inquiry. Several important contributions to the pediatric medical literature attest to this (6\u20138). The authors of the present study note correctly that the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation database is limited in its ability to report exhaustively on all possible variables in CPR. This is not by accident as the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation balances the desire to gather as much data as possible surrounding a cardiac arrest against the workload required to do this by member hospitals. Keeping the data collection requirement manageable has been important in maintaining member participation. For the detail needed to answer difficult questions in an expanded patient population, we have PECARN. As a federally funded research network, PECARN can design and implement studies beyond the scope of other research networks, answering the most complex research questions using a full breadth of data. To this end, Meert et al have achieved a great success. The GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) phenomenon of computer programming applies here. The final results of any process can only be as good as the quality of the original data examined. During the data collection process for this study, nearly 20% of the abstracted records were reviewed by the investigators in 27 areas. They achieved an accuracy of 96%. The quality of these data should confirm our belief in the certainty of the conclusions drawn. There are several interesting findings in this study. First, CPR for pediatric inhospital cardiac arrest is not futile, despite the fact that many still believe this. In 353 cases of cardiac arrest with a sustained return of spontaneous circulation for 20 mins, 172 (48.7%) survived to hospital discharge, 124 of whom had no change in their neurologic status from their prearrest baseline. A pediatric code is not a time to despair, but rather to focus one\u2019s efforts on good-quality CPR to produce the best outcome. Second, the authors developed three elegant logistic regression models from these data to predict hospital mortality. The presence of hematologic, oncologic or immunologic disease (odds ratio 2.61) or electrolyte imbalance (odds ratio 3.35), among other factors, was positively correlated with mortality. Third, there is the question of who is at highest risk of cardiac arrest. Predicting this will be increasingly important because effective resource utilization requires us to place the patients at highest risk in the safest environments, often pediatric intensive care units. In this study, most patients were 1 yr of age with a preexisting chronic condition, often cardiac in nature, or respiratory failure. Some researchers in our community believe that any unmonitored arrest in the hospital represents an error in care, specifically patient placement, and should be reviewed as a sentinel event. One large pediatric intensive care unit in the United States is moving to a daily determination of the patients most likely to have a cardiac arrest, and training their staff to this *See also p. 544.",
