        "title": "Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEach year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.",

        "title": "Variability among nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTraditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding/perforation, but the magnitude of this effect for coxibs in the general population and the degree of variability between individual NSAIDs is still under debate. This study was undertaken to assess the risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation among users of individual NSAIDs and to analyze the correlation between this risk and the degree of inhibition of whole blood cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2 in vitro.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review of observational studies on NSAIDs and upper GI bleeding/perforation published between 2000 and 2008. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) estimates of upper GI bleeding/perforation for individual NSAIDs. Additionally, we verified whether the degree of inhibition of whole blood COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro by average circulating concentrations predicted the RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation was 4.50 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.82-5.31) for traditional NSAIDs and 1.88 (95% CI 0.96-3.71) for coxibs. RRs lower than that for NSAIDs overall were observed for ibuprofen (2.69 [95% CI 2.17-3.33]), rofecoxib (2.12 [95% CI 1.59-2.84]), aceclofenac (1.44 [95% CI 0.65-3.2]), and celecoxib (1.42 [95% CI 0.85-2.37]), while higher RRs were observed for ketorolac (14.54 [95% CI 5.87-36.04]) and piroxicam (9.94 [95% CI 5.99-16.50). Estimated RRs were 5.63 (95% CI 3.83-8.28) for naproxen, 5.57 (95% CI 3.94-7.87) for ketoprofen, 5.40 (95% CI 4.16-7.00) for indomethacin, 4.15 (95% CI 2.59-6.64) for meloxicam, and 3.98 (95% CI 3.36-4.72) for diclofenac. The degree of inhibition of whole blood COX-1 did not significantly correlate with RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation associated with individual NSAIDs (r(2) = 0.34, P = 0.058), but a profound and coincident inhibition (>80%) of both COX isozymes was associated with higher risk. NSAIDs with a long plasma half-life and with a slow-release formulation were associated with a greater risk than NSAIDs with a short half-life.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of our analysis demonstrate that risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation varies between individual NSAIDs at the doses commonly used in the general population. Drugs that have a long half-life or slow-release formulation and/or are associated with profound and coincident inhibition of both COX isozymes are associated with a greater risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate whether low-dose naproxen sodium (220 mg twice a day) interferes with aspirin's antiplatelet effect in healthy subjects.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a crossover, open-label study in 9 healthy volunteers. They received for 6 days 3 different treatments separated by 14 days of washout: 1) naproxen 2 hours before aspirin, 2) aspirin 2 hours before naproxen, and 3) aspirin alone. The primary end point was the assessment of serum thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) 24 hours after the administration of naproxen 2 hours before aspirin on day 6 of treatment. In 5 volunteers, the rate of recovery of TXB(2) generation (up to 72 hours after drug discontinuation) was assessed in serum and in platelet-rich plasma stimulated with arachidonic acid (AA) or collagen.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-four hours after the last dosing on day 6 in volunteers receiving aspirin alone or aspirin before naproxen, serum TXB(2) was almost completely inhibited (median [range] 99.1% [97.4-99.4%] and 99.1% [98.0-99.7%], respectively). Naproxen given before aspirin caused a slightly lower inhibition of serum TXB(2) (median [range] 98.0% [90.6-99.4%]) than aspirin alone (P = 0.0007) or aspirin before naproxen (P = 0.0045). All treatments produced a maximal inhibition of AA-induced platelet aggregation. At 24 hours, compared with baseline, collagen-induced platelet aggregation was still inhibited by aspirin alone (P = 0.0003), but not by aspirin given 2 hours before or after naproxen. Compared with administration of aspirin alone, the sequential administration of naproxen and aspirin caused a significant parallel upward shift of the regression lines describing the recovery of platelet TXB(2).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSequential administration of 220 mg naproxen twice a day and low-dose aspirin interferes with the irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase 1 afforded by aspirin. The interaction was smaller when giving naproxen 2 hours after aspirin. The clinical consequences of these 2 schedules of administration of aspirin with naproxen remain to be studied in randomized clinical trials.",

        "title": "High on treatment platelet reactivity against aspirin by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \u2013 pharmacological mechanisms and clinical relevance",
        "abstract": "Summary Inhibition of platelet function by aspirin results from irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. While sufficient inhibition is obtained at antiplatelet doses (75\u2013325 mg/day) in most (\u226595%) treated patients, the antiplatelet effect of aspirin and subsequent cardiovascular risk reduction is much less in clinical settings and disease-dependent. Several reasons for this \u201chigh on treatment platelet reactivity\u201d are known. This paper reviews the evidence for an interaction between aspirin and other COX inhibitors, namely non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Numerous experimental studies demonstrated a pharmacodynamic interaction between aspirin and NSAIDs. This likely occurs within the hydrophobic substrate channel of platelet COX-1 and might be explained by molecular competition between inhibitor drugs and substrate (arachidonic acid) at overlapping binding sites. This interaction is found with some compounds, notably ibuprofen and dipyrone (metamizole), but not with others, such as diclofenac and acetaminophen (paracetamol). Hence, this interaction is not a class effect of NSAIDs and/or non-steroidal analgesics but rather due to specific structural requirements which still remain to be defined. In vivo studies on healthy subjects and patients tend to confirm this type of interaction as well as large differences between NSAIDs and non-steroidal analgesics, respectively. These interactions may be clinically relevant and may increase the cardiovascular risk in long-term treatment for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in patients with chronic inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis. These patients have an elevated risk for myocardial infarctions and may require chronic antiplatelet treatment by aspirin in addition to treatment of inflammatory pain.",

        "title": "Drug\u2013drug interaction between NSAIDS and low-dose aspirin: a focus on cardiovascular and GI toxicity",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The aging of the population in the US and other countries means that a large number of people will likely take NSAIDs for the relief of pain and low-dose aspirin (LD-ASA) for cardioprotection. However, the cardioprotective value of LD-ASA can be compromised in patients who take NSAIDs concomitantly, because some NSAIDs competitively bind to critical amino-acid residues on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and interfere with the mechanism of antiplatelet activity of LD-ASA. Areas covered: A review of the literature was conducted to provide an overview of current issues surrounding the concomitant use of NSAIDs and LD-ASA, to explore potential mechanisms for this drug\u2013drug interaction and to consider current and future treatment options that may mitigate the risk associated with their concomitant use. Expert opinion: NSAIDs offer effective pain relief for the most common forms of pain, such as low back pain, musculoskeletal pain associated with arthritis, postsurgical pain, headache, acute pain syndromes, menstrual pain and dental pain. The development of NSAID formulations that offer effective pain control with fewer or less serious adverse effects due to interference with ASA would be a valuable medical advance. Several promising treatment options and regimens may be available in the future.",

        "abstract": "The development of nitric oxide (NO)\u2010 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)\u2010releasing nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has generated more potent anti\u2010inflammatory drugs with increased safety profiles. A new hybrid molecule incorporating both NO and H2S donors into aspirin (NOSH\u2010aspirin) was recently developed. In the present study, the antinociceptive activity of this novel molecule was compared with aspirin in different models of inflammatory pain. It was found that NOSH\u2010aspirin inhibits acetic acid\u2010induced writhing response and carrageenan (Cg)\u2010induced inflammatory hyperalgesia in a dose\u2010dependent (5\u2013150 \u03bcmol/kg, v.o.) manner, which was superior to the effect of the same doses of aspirin. NOSH\u2010aspirin's antinociceptive effect was also greater and longer compared to aspirin upon complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)\u2010induced inflammatory hyperalgesia. Mechanistically, NOSH\u2010aspirin, but not aspirin, was able to reduce the production/release of interleukin\u20101 beta (IL\u20101\u03b2) during Cg\u2010induced paw inflammation. Furthermore, NOSH\u2010aspirin, but not aspirin, reduced prostaglandin E2\u2010induced hyperalgesia, which was prevented by treatment with a ATP\u2010sensitive potassium channel (KATP) blocker (glibenclamide; glib.). Noteworthy, the antinociceptive effect of NOSH\u2010aspirin was not associated with motor impairment. The present results indicate that NOSH\u2010aspirin seems to present greater potency than aspirin to reduce inflammatory pain in several models. The enhanced effects of NOSH\u2010aspirin seems to be due to its ability to reduce the production of pronociceptive cytokines such as IL\u20101 \u03b2 and directly block hyperalgesia caused by a directly acting hyperalgesic mediator in a mechanism dependent on modulation of KATP channels. In conclusion, we would like to suggest that NOSH\u2010aspirin represents a prototype of a new class of analgesic drugs with more potent effects than the traditional NSAID, aspirin.",

        "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have anti-cancer (chemopreventive) properties; however, side effects preclude their long-term use. NOSH-NSAIDs, designed as safer alternatives, are novel hybrid chimaeras that release nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). NOSH-NSAIDs are gastrointestinally safe yet retain all the pharmacological properties of their native NSAID. NOSHNSAIDs are orders of magnitude more potent than their conventional counterparts in inhibiting the growth of various human cancer cell lines of different tissue origins, adenomatous, epithelial and lymphocytic. This growth inhibition is a result of a reduction in cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest, leading to increased apoptosis. In xenograft mouse models of cancer, NOSH-aspirin was better than normal aspirin as a chemopreventive agent; it dose-dependently inhibited tumour growth and tumour mass. NOSH-naproxen was significantly more efficacious than normal naproxen in reducing the growth of established tumours.",
