        "title": "Screening versus routine practice in detection of atrial fibrillation in patients aged 65 or over: cluster randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives To assess whether screening improves the detection of atrial fibrillation (cluster randomisation) and to compare systematic and opportunistic screening. Design Multicentred cluster randomised controlled trial, with subsidiary trial embedded within the intervention arm. Setting 50 primary care centres in England, with further individual randomisation of patients in the intervention practices. Participants 14\u2009802 patients aged 65 or over in 25 intervention and 25 control practices. Interventions Patients in intervention practices were randomly allocated to systematic screening (invitation for electrocardiography) or opportunistic screening (pulse taking and invitation for electrocardiography if the pulse was irregular). Screening took place over 12 months in each practice from October 2001 to February 2003. No active screening took place in control practices. Main outcome measure Newly identified atrial fibrillation. Results The detection rate of new cases of atrial fibrillation was 1.63% a year in the intervention practices and 1.04% in control practices (difference 0.59%, 95% confidence interval 0.20% to 0.98%). Systematic and opportunistic screening detected similar numbers of new cases (1.62% v 1.64%, difference 0.02%, \u22120.5% to 0.5%). Conclusion Active screening for atrial fibrillation detects additional cases over current practice. The preferred method of screening in patients aged 65 or over in primary care is opportunistic pulse taking with follow-up electrocardiography.

        "abstract": "Family Health Centers serve elderly people with a variety of health problems. Family physicians frequently encounter patients with cognitive problems during home visits or outpatient examinations. The view of accompanying person is sought to establish communication and to manage health problems appropriately. Dementia and delirium are common reasons for cognitive problems. During screening of dementia one or more cognitive domains are examined. The Mini Mental State Examination scale should be utilized and family physicians should establish a geriatric assessment if time is available. The Elderly Friendly Family Health Center Instrument is an appropriate tool for home visits and outpatient office and delirium or dementia should be ruled out after examination. Further evaluation needed to be initiated after scoring positive for dementia and delirium. The second part of the Elderly Friendly Family Health Center Instrument should be recommended for this step.

        "title": "Cognitive frailty among Malaysian older adults: baseline findings from the LRGS TUA cohort study",
        "abstract": "Purpose This study was aimed at determining the presence of cognitive frailty and its associated factors among community-dwelling older adults from the \u201cLRGS-Towards Useful Aging (TUA)\u201d longitudinal study. Patients and methods The available data related to cognitive frailty among a sub-sample of older adults aged 60 years and above (n=815) from two states in Malaysia were analysed. In the LRGS-TUA study, a comprehensive interview-based questionnaire was administered to obtain the socio-demographic information of the participants, followed by assessments to examine the cognitive function, functional status, dietary intake, lifestyle, psychosocial status and biomarkers associated with cognitive frailty. The factors associated with cognitive frailty were assessed using a bivariate logistic regression (BLR). Results The majority of the older adults were categorized as robust (68.4%), followed by cognitively pre-frail (37.4%) and cognitively frail (2.2%). The data on the cognitively frail and pre-frail groups were combined for comparison with the robust group. A hierarchical BLR indicated that advancing age (OR=1.04, 95% CI:1.01\u20131.08, p<0.05) and depression (OR=1.49, 95% CI:1.34\u20131.65, p<0.001) scored lower on the Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale (OR=0.98, 95% CI:0.96\u20130.99, p<0.05), while low social support (OR=0.98, 95% CI:0.97\u20130.99, p<0.05) and low niacin intake (OR=0.94, 95% CI:0.89\u20130.99, p<0.05) were found to be significant factors for cognitive frailty. Higher oxidative stress (MDA) and lower telomerase activity were also associated with cognitive frailty (p<0.05). Conclusion Older age, a lower niacin intake, lack of social support, depression and lower functional status were identified as significant factors associated with cognitive frailty among older Malaysian adults. MDA and telomerase activity can be used as potential biomarkers for the identification of cognitive frailty.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the risk factors of cognitive frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to establish an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Design A cross-sectional design. Setting Two tertiary hospitals in southern China. Participants 425 elderly patients aged \u226560 years with CKD. Methods Data were collected via questionnaire investigation, anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests and electronic medical records. The 425 samples were randomly divided into a training set, test set and validation set at a ratio of 5:3:2. Variables were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, then an ANN model was constructed. The accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Results Barthel Index (BI) score, albumin, education level, 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale score and Social Support Rating Scale score were the factors influencing the occurrence of cognitive frailty (p<0.05). Among them, BI score was the most important factor determining cognitive frailty, with an importance index of 0.30. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the ANN model were 86.36%, 88.61% and 80.65%, respectively, and the AUC of the constructed ANN model was 0.913. Conclusion The ANN model constructed in this study has good predictive ability, and can provide a reference tool for clinical nursing staff in the early prediction of cognitive frailty in a high-risk population.",

        "abstract": "A growing life expectancy may result in a chronic medical condition and multimorbidity because the aging process leads to a decrease in cognitive and physiological function. These risks may affect the quality of life of geriatrics. The present study aims to determine the correlation between cognitive status (in terms of SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent class III deacetylase) and metabolic function (in terms of the lipid profile, kidney function, and blood glucose) in geriatric patients. The differences in the parameters of metabolic function in the participants\u2019 cognitive status were determined by using the Indonesian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA-Ina). The elderly participants (n = 120) were recruited at three sites in Indonesia from March to October 2022. Our study demonstrated a negative correlation between the cognitive status of geriatric patients and their metabolic function, represented by the MoCA-Ina score with a linear regression equation of y = 0.27 \u2212 2.4 \u00d710\u22123 x. Higher levels of LDL-C, cystatin C, and HbA1c were found in the Severe-Moderate Cognitive Impairment group. Determining the SIRT1 levels may be beneficial in predicting both the cognitive and metabolic status of geriatrics because this protein is among numerous metabolic sensors in the hypothalamus.",
