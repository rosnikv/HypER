        "title": "Clinical and hemorheological effects of buflomedil in diabetic subjects with intermittent claudication.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nChanges in blood rheology have been described in diabetes mellitus. Buflomedil, a vasoactive substance with hemorheological properties, has been widely used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of buflomedil on clinical and hemorheological parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes and intermittent claudication.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty patients were randomly assigned to oral buflomedil or matching placebo for six months in a double-blind manner. Initial and absolute walking distances were assessed by a standard treadmill testing protocol. Erythrocyte deformability was estimated with a whole blood filtration technique. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was assessed with an aggregation profiler. beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 were measured with radioimmunoassays. All tests were performed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant increase in the mean initial (71%) and absolute (68%) walking distance was achieved only in the buflomedil group. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in the buflomedil group, while no significant changes in erythrocyte deformability, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 levels were noticed. However, beta-thromboglobulin levels increased significantly in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest the therapeutic efficacy of buflomedil in diabetic subjects with intermittent claudication. The inhibition of platelet aggregation and the influence on platelet activity exerted by the drug could play an important role in its clinical effect and may be of value in the treatment of such patients.",

        "title": "Pharmacological interventions for peripheral artery disease",
        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) encompasses the vascular diseases caused primarily by atherosclerosis and thromboembolic pathophysiological processes that alter the normal structure and function of the aorta, its visceral arterial branches and the arteries of the upper and lower extremities. PAD is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The goals for pharmacological therapy in PAD should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk, improving walking distance and preventing critical limb ischaemia. Exercise training plays a key role in the therapeutic assessment, as well stopping smoking. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) should be given to every PAD patient if there are no contraindications. Neither their combination nor anticoagulant therapy has shown additional benefit in PAD patients. Several pharmacological agents have been developed to improve the functional state of the claudicant and to relieve the symptoms. Many studied drugs have shown either no, a small or a potential benefit. With future development of new drugs for PAD, there is an absolute need for very strict well-designed protocols in order to evaluate the claudication distance, the progression of the disease and the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. New developments should focus on improvement of endothelial function, vascular repair and enhancement of collateral circulation.",

        "abstract": "risk for different vascular diseases; the risk is highest for AAAs and PAD and lowest for cerebrovascular disease and IHD. Smoking reverses the beneficial effects of primary and secondary prevention measures; in patients with IHD taking aspirin, cigarette smoking acutely increases platelet thrombus formation. Smoking also diminishes the beneficial effect of statins on the cardiovascular system, besides increasing the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Smoking cessation plays a key role in the management of patients with vascular disease, such as stroke and PAD. Smoking cessation may also inhibit AAA expansion. A recent review concluded that cigarette smoking is an independent, major vascular risk factor for the development of aortic disease, especially the formation and growth of AAAs. Even nonsmokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke (passive smokers) experience an almost 30% excess risk of IHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction. It was suggested that a higher oxidative stress (as a result of trace element imbalance) may be a contributing factor to AAA formation by promoting wall erosion. Smoking is associated with high oxidative stress; thus, it should be expected that smoking will be associated with AAA formation. Experimental studies in mice and rabbits as well as large epidemiological studies on humans have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is strongly associated with the formation and growth of AAAs. In a prospective, long-term (5-year) follow-up study, the Edinburgh Artery Study (n = 1592 patients; 55 to 74 years old), current and recent ex\u2013cigarette smokers had a 3-fold increased risk of AAA development compared with long-time ex-smokers and never Arecent study including 404 patients with an ultrasonographically detected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) demonstrated that in patients with established ischemic heart disease (IHD) smoking is not a risk factor for the development of AAA. Although smoking was a strong independent predictor of the development of AAA in noncardiac patients (P \u2264 .0001), in patients with known cardiac disease smoking was no longer a significant predictor of aneurysmal development. These findings suggest that for patients with established IHD, smoking may not be a risk factor for the development of an AAA. We discuss these interesting findings as well as the relationship between smoking and AAA risk. The association between smoking and alterations in vascular function/structure, vascular compliance, and the development of vascular disease is well documented. Smoking is an established risk factor for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, carotid artery stenosis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and erectile dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests that smoking has a variable magnitude of increased",

        "title": "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms, Peripheral Arterial Disease, and Carotid Artery Stenosis",
        "abstract": "In this issue of Angiology, Gray et al assessed the prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs); 30.4% of patients with AAA had concomitant CAS and 45.3% had PAD (resting ankle\u2013brachial pressure index [ABPI] 50%) used to define \u2018\u2018significant\u2019\u2019 carotid atherosclerosis. It was argued that severe carotid atherosclerosis is indeed a predictor of concomitant arterial disease in other vascular beds, whereas this does not apply to moderate forms of the disease. Specific factors may lead to the development of vascular disease in 1 vascular territory rather than in another. Crosssectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examinations Surveys 1999 to 2004 were pooled (total 7550 patients). Active smoking was more common among patients with PAD (30.0% vs 23.9%, respectively; P 1\u20444 .02), whereas hyperlipidemia was more prevalent among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD; 68.4% vs 54.0%, respectively; P < .001). The CHD was more prevalent than PAD in whites (84.6% vs 76.6%, respectively; P 1\u20444 .001), whereas the opposite was true for blacks (6.7% vs 15.9%, respectively; P < .001). An increased risk of CHD was observed only with very low (<15 ng/mL) serum vitamin D concentrations (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.14; P < 0.01). In contrast, there was a strong dose\u2013response relationship between serum vitamin D concentration and PAD. Even a mild reduction in serum vitamin D levels (25-30 mg/dL) was associated with an increased risk of PAD (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.06-2.07; P < .01). This association became considerably stronger at lower (<15 ng/mL) serum vitamin D concentrations (OR: 3.16; 95% CI: 2.05-4.87; P < .001). Increased age and smoking are strong risk factors for both vascular and malignant disease. Indeed, several multicenter randomized controlled trials publishing the long-term followup results of patients with AAA and PAD reported a high incidence of malignant neoplasms. Thus, a diagnosis of PAD, CAS, or AAAs should alert physicians to the possible concomitant presence, or future development, of several forms of cancer. Besides smoking cessation, another measure that should be implemented in vascular patients is statin treatment whether they are managed conservatively or undergo open surgical or endovascular procedures. Preoperative statin use is associated with lower perioperative/periprocedural death, myocardial infarction, and stroke rates. Additionally, statins may reduce postoperative complications, hospitalization rates, and associated costs. Furthermore, statins reduce the incidence of postoperative/postprocedural renal insufficiency and aid the earlier recovery of kidney function. Finally, statins reduce stroke risk in patients with CAS. Screening for AAAs and PAD is a controversial issue. The ABPI provides information not only for the peripheral circulation but also for the generalized atherosclerotic burden and the risk of cardiovascular events. Another emerging marker of",

        "abstract": "Background: We evaluated the 30-day postoperative outcome after elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the possible predictors for the 30-day postoperative outcome. Materials: Demographics, medical history, laboratory values, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day complications classified as major (major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), acute kidney injury (AKI) and death of any cause) and minor (postimplantation syndrome (PIS), postoperative delirium (POD), urinary tract infection (UTI) and technical graft failure) were documented (March 2016 to February 2019). Results: We included 322 patients. The majority were managed under general anesthesia (83%) with femoral cutdown (98.1%). Overall, 121 (37.5%) complications, mostly minor (n = 103, 31.9%), were recorded. In total, 11 patients (3.4%) developed MACEs, 5 (1.6%) experienced AKI and 2 (0.6%) died in the ICU. Moreover, 77 patients (23.9%) suffered from PIS, 11 from POD, 11 from UTI and 4 from technical graft failure. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that aneurysm diameter (p = 0.01) and past smoking (p = 0.003) were predictors for complications. PAD was an independent predictor of MACEs (p = 0.003), preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of AKI (p = 0.003) and past smoking of PIS (p = 0.008), respectively. Conclusions: Our study showed that the 30-day morbidity after EVAR exceeded 35%. However, the majority of complications were minor, and the associated mortality was low. Aneurysm diameter and past smoking were independent predictors for postoperative outcome.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) increases with age. Elective intervention for AAA is critical to prevent rupture associated with very high mortality among older males.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe aim of this study was to address the impact of post-contrast acute kidney-PC-AKI injury among patients treated with endovascular repair of ruptured AAA-EVAR on outcomes such as new onset chronic kidney disease-CKD and mortality among patients within a two-year trial.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe same study group (of n\u2009=\u2009192 patients) underwent reassessment, two years after EVAR treatment. The overall mortality rate was 16.67%, and it was higher in the AKI group - 38.89%. CKD patients had a mortality rate of 23.88% (n\u2009=\u200916). Among patients with an aneurysm diameter >67\u2009mm mortality rate reached 20% (n\u2009=\u20096), while in the previously reported diabetes mellitus group 37.93% (n\u2009=\u200911). New onset of CKD was diagnosed in 23% of cases. Preexisting CKD patients with PC- AKI contributed to a 33.33% mortality rate (n\u2009=\u20098).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study concludes that PC-AKI impacts outcomes and survival in endovascularly treated AAAs. Type 2 diabetes and preexisting chronic kidney disease are associated with higher mortality within a 2-year follow-up, however gender factor was not significant. A larger aneurysm diameter is related with a higher prevalence of PC-AKI. These factors should be taken into account during screening, qualifying patients for the treatment and treating patients with AAA. It may help to identify high-risk individuals and tailor preventive measurements and treatment options accordingly, improving treatment results and reducing mortality.",
