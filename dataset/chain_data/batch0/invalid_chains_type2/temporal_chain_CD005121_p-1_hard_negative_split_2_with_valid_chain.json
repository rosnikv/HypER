        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the potential for additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy with the selective anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent etanercept and the anti-interleukin-1 agent anakinra.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred forty-four patients in whom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was active despite methotrexate therapy were treated with subcutaneous etanercept only (25 mg twice weekly), full-dosage etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day), or half-dosage etanercept (25 mg once weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day) for 6 months in a double-blind study at 41 centers in the US. Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

        "title": "Safety of extended treatment with anakinra in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",
        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the safety profile of anakinra after extended exposure in a diverse clinical trial population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: A six month, randomised, double blind phase comparing anakinra (100 mg/day) with placebo was followed by open label anakinra treatment for up to three years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs were permitted. Results: In all 1346 patients with rheumatoid arthritis received anakinra for up to three years. Patients had varying levels of disease severity, concomitant drug use, and comorbid conditions. Cumulative, exposure adjusted event (EAE) rates for all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and deaths were similar during each year of anakinra treatment; the overall rate (0 to 3 years) was similar to that observed for controls during the blinded phase. The most frequent AEs were injection site reactions (122.26 events/100 patient-years), rheumatoid arthritis progression (67.80 events/100 patient-years), and upper respiratory infections (26.09 events/100 patient-years). The EAE rate of serious infections was higher for patients treated with anakinra for 0 to 3 years (5.37 events/100 patient-years) than for controls during the blinded phase (1.65 events/100 patient-years). However, if the patient was not receiving corticosteroid treatment at baseline, the serious infection rate was substantially lower (2.87 event/100 patient-years). The overall incidence of malignancies was consistent with expected rates reported by SEER. Neutralising antibodies developed in 25 patients, but appeared to be transient in 12; neutralising antibody status did not appear related to occurrence of malignancies or serious infections. There were no clinically significant trends in laboratory data related to anakinra. Conclusion: Anakinra is safe and well tolerated for up to three years of continuous use in a diverse population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "title": "Risk of serious infections during rituximab, abatacept and anakinra treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: meta-analyses of randomised placebo-controlled trials",
        "abstract": "Background: Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 blockers in rheumatoid arthritis are known to increase the risk of serious infections defined as life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics. Recently, new biological agents have become available. Their safety is an important issue. Purpose: To assess if biological agents, ie rituximab, abatacept and anakinra increase the risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in published randomised controlled trials. Data source: A systematic review of the literature using PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane library and abstracts databases (American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings) was performed up to October 2007. This search was completed with data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and manufacturers. Data extraction: Three fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed to compare serious infection rates between each biological agent and placebo. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method with a continuity correction. Data synthesis: Twelve randomised controlled trials with data concerning serious infections were analysed (three for rituximab, five for abatacept and four for anakinra). They included 745 patients, 1960 patients, 2062 patients and 2112 patients treated by rituximab, abatacept, anakinra and placebo respectively. The overall pooled ORs did not reveal a statistically significant increased risk of serious infection for abatacept and rituximab; this risk was increased for high doses of anakinra (\u2a7e100 mg daily) versus low dose and placebo (ORs\u200a=\u200a9.63 (95% CI, 1.31 to 70.91) and 3.40 (95% CI, 1.11 to 10.46) respectively). Conclusions: These meta-analyses did not reveal a significant increase in the risk of serious infections during rituximab or abatacept treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, high doses of anakinra may increase this risk, especially when patients have comorbidity factors. Large studies must be performed to confirm this safety profile in daily practice.",

        "abstract": "Significant advances in our understanding of RA and its management have been made in the past decade, resulting in earlier intervention with biologic DMARDs, particularly in patients with evidence of aggressive, erosive disease. Here, one such biologic therapy, the T-cell co-stimulation modulator abatacept, is discussed, exploring clinical evidence published to date on its use in patients with very early arthritis/early RA who are MTX na\u00efve, and in patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists. Data from relevant clinical trials are overviewed, discussing the clinical efficacy of abatacept in early disease, the clinical outcomes over long-term treatment in different patient populations and the effects of abatacept on structural damage. Findings from integrated safety analyses of abatacept clinical trial data, representing 10\u2009366 patient-years of exposure are described, and clinically important safety events, including serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events, are highlighted. It is concluded that abatacept represents an effective treatment option with an established safety profile across different patient populations, including patients with both early and erosive RA and those with established disease. Furthermore, efficacy data from studies in patients with early disease suggest that the risk\u2013benefit profile of abatacept may be more favourable when introduced earlier in the treatment paradigm.",

        "abstract": "The development of the biological drugs has revolutionized the therapeutic approach of the chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, particularly in patients resistant to standard treatment. These drugs are characterized by an innovative mechanism of action, based on the targeted inhibition of specific molecular or cellular targets directly involved in the pathogenesis of the diseases: pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 and 6), CTLA-4, and molecules involved in the activation, differentiation and maturation of B cells. Their use has indeed allowed for a better prognosis in several rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus) and to obtain a clinical remission. In the present review we give an overview of the biological drugs currently available for the treatment of the rheumatic diseases, analyzing the different mechanism of action, the therapeutic indications and efficacy data, and adverse events.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are used against a variety of connective tissue diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Contrarily, although rare, TNF inhibitors are known to induce autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis as a paradoxical reaction. We experienced a case of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis after introduction of certolizumab pegol. The patient was a 30-year-old woman who was previously diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in X-8. She received treatment with methotrexate (8\u2009mg/week) and infliximab (3\u2009mg/kg/8\u2009weeks), following which she showed low disease activity and remission. In September X-1, methotrexate and infliximab were discontinued and certolizumab pegol was introduced because she desired to bear children. In March X, the patient experienced renal dysfunction, and urinary protein analysis revealed positivity for myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody. Renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis, and the patient was diagnosed with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis due to TNF inhibitor-induced microscopic polyangiitis. As she desired to bear children, rituximab was introduced in addition to corticosteroids, which led to remission of the symptoms. TNF inhibitors should be discontinued in patients who develop rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and these patients should be treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as massive corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. In the present case, rituximab was useful for not only the treatment, but also for the preservation of fertility.",
