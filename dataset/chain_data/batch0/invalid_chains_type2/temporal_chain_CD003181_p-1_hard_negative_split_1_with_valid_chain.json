        "abstract": "Background. Chronic viral hepatitis averages 15% to 20% in heart transplant patients. Several studies have shown that ursodiol may improve liver biochemistry in patients with chronic hepatitis. We used a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of ursodiol in heart transplant patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Methods. Thirty heart patients with chronic viral hepatitis B, C, or non-A-G received ursodiol, 800 mg per day (group 1), and 30 received placebo (group 2) for 12 months. Endpoints were improvement in liver biochemical tests and in total Knodell score. Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Results. At entry, both groups were comparable for all of the studied parameters. During the study period, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and &ggr;-glutamyl transpeptidase variations were not different between group 1 and group 2 patients. Knodell score improved in 20% of group 1 patients and in 43% of group 2 patients (NS). Adverse events or mortality were not different in the two groups during the study period. Similar results were observed by intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Conclusions. A 12-month course of ursodiol therapy had no effect on liver enzymes or liver histology in heart transplant patients with chronic hepatitis.",

        "title": "Impact of Hepatitis C Infection on Outcomes After Heart Transplantation",
        "abstract": "Background. Prevalence of hepatitis C infection (HCV) among heart transplant (OHT) recipients ranges from 7% to 18%. Despite the paucity of data regarding the outcomes of heart transplant recipients who are HCV positive before transplant, many transplant centers are declining to perform OHT in HCV-seropositive patients. Methods. We assessed the clinical outcome of HCV-seropositive compared with HCV-seronegative heart transplant recipients using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network/the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005, 224 HCV-seropositive and 10,406 HCV-seronegative recipients who received HCV-seronegative donor organs were identified. Results. Overall patient survival rates of HCV-seropositive recipients were significantly lower than those of HCV-seronegative recipients (84.8% at 1 year, 77.1% 3 years, 68.9% 5 years for HCV-seropositive group vs. 87.9% at 1 year, 80.7% 3 years, and 74.1% 5 years for HCV-negative recipients, log rank P=0.036). However, adjusted relative risk of recipient HCV-seropositive versus HCV-seronegative status did not reach to statistical significance level (relative risk=1.23 with P=0.087) after adjusting for other donor and recipient factors. Causes of death among HCV-seropositive and HCV-seronegative groups were similar. Cumulative incidence of an acute rejection episode in the first year after transplantation among HCV-seropositive recipients was 35.7% versus 32.6% HCV-seronegative recipients (P=0.32). Conclusions. A more rational approach should be developed for the management of HCV-seropositive heart transplant candidates. Carefully selected HCV-seropositive patients should not be excluded from OHT.",

        "title": "Outcomes After Lung Transplantation and Practices of Lung Transplant Programs in the United States Regarding Hepatitis C Seropositive Recipients",
        "abstract": "Background. The estimated prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among lung transplant (LT) recipients is 1.9%. Many thoracic transplant programs are reluctant to transplant HCV-seropositive patients due to concerns of hepatic dysfunction caused by immunosuppression. The aims of this study are to survey current practices of US LT programs regarding HCV-seropositive patients and using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database and to assess the clinical outcomes of HCV-positive compared with HCV-negative LT recipients. Methods. A survey of US transplant centers that have performed more than 100 LTs was conducted. In addition, 170 HCV-seropositive and 9259 HCV-seronegative recipients who received HCV-seronegative donor organs between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, were identified from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database. Outcome variables including patient survival were compared between the two groups. Results. A total of 64.4% centers responded to the survey. Ten of 29 (34.5%) programs would not consider HCV-seropositive patients for LT. Among the 19 programs that will consider HCV-seropositive patients, only five centers would transplant actively viremic patients. Overall patient survival rates of HCV-seropositive patients were similar to HCV-seronegative patients (84.7% at 1 year, 63.9% at 3 years, 49.4% at 5 years for HCV-seropositive group vs. 82.0% at 1 year, 65.0% at 3 years, 51.4% at 5 years for HCV-seronegative group, P=0.712). Relative risk of recipients for death remained statistically insignificant after adjusting for recipient age, donor age, obesity, sensitization, serum creatinine, and medical condition at time of transplant (relative risk [RR]=1.07 [0.84\u20131.38], P=0.581). Conclusions. Since 2000, patient survival rates of HCV-positive patients are identical to those who are HCV-negative. However, most of these HCV-seropositive patients were probably nonviremic.",

        "abstract": "Use of organs from donors testing positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may safely expand the donor pool. The American Society of Transplantation convened a multidisciplinary expert panel that reviewed the existing literature and developed consensus recommendations for recipient management following the use of organs from HBV positive donors. Transmission risk is highest with liver donors and significantly lower with non\u2010liver (kidney and thoracic) donors. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of transmission to liver recipients from isolated HBV core antibody positive (anti\u2010HBc+) donors. Organs from anti\u2010HBc+ donors should be considered for all adult transplant candidates after an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits and appropriate patient consent. Indefinite antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in liver recipients with no immunity or vaccine immunity but not in liver recipients with natural immunity. Antiviral prophylaxis may be considered for up to 1 year in susceptible non\u2010liver recipients but is not recommended in immune non\u2010liver recipients. Although no longer the treatment of choice in patients with chronic HBV, lamivudine remains the most cost\u2010effective choice for prophylaxis in this setting. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is not recommended.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the longterm outcome of pediatric LT recipients of HBcAb+\u2009liver grafts under a prophylaxis regimen against DNHB using hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). From June 1996 to February 2013, 49 patients receiving pediatric LT at our center were from HBcAb+\u2009donors. Forty\u2010one patients who received DNHB prophylaxis according to our protocol were included in this analysis. Our DNHB prophylaxis protocol consists of HBV vaccine intramuscular injections given intermittently to maintain anti\u2013hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titers above 100 IU/L. HBIG was also used during the first posttransplant year with a target anti\u2010HBsAb titer level above 200 IU/L. There were 19 boys and 22 girls. Median age was 1.0 year (range, 4 months to 16 years). Median follow\u2010up time was 66 months after transplant. Median annual number of HBV vaccine injections was 0.8 per year (range, 0\u20101.8 per year). Four patients did not require any HBV vaccine injections during follow\u2010up. One patient with DNHB was encountered during the follow\u2010up period (1/41, 2.4%). DNHB was diagnosed at 3.5 years after transplant, when hepatitis B surface antigen was positive upon routine follow\u2010up serologic testing. Anti\u2010HBsAb titer was 101.5 IU/L at the time. No grafts were lost because of DNHB\u2010related events. Overall survival of the 41 recipients of HBcAb+\u2009grafts who received DNHB prophylaxis was 92.3% at 10 years after transplant. In conclusion, longterm prophylaxis against DNHB with HBV vaccine in pediatric LT recipients of HBcAb+\u2009grafts was safe and effective in terms of DNHB incidence as well as graft and patient survival.

Although many centers have protocols for transplanting organs from HBV core antibody\u2010positive (HBcAb+) donors into select recipients, in the era of direct\u2010acting antivirals (DAAs), a new focus should be placed on HCV\u2010positive donors.

        "abstract": "Under current guidelines, hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010positive livers are not transplanted into HCV\u2010negative recipients because of adverse posttransplant outcomes associated with allograft HCV infection. However, HCV can now be cured post\u2010LT (liver transplant) using direct\u2010acting antivirals (DAAs) with >90% success; therefore, HCV\u2010negative patients on the LT waiting list may benefit from accepting HCV\u2010positive organs with preemptive treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether and in which HCV\u2010negative patients the potential benefit of accepting an HCV\u2010positive (i.e., viremic) organ outweighed the risks associated with HCV allograft infection. We developed a Markov\u2010based mathematical model that simulated a virtual trial of HCV\u2010negative patients on the LT waiting list to compare long\u2010term outcomes in patients: (1) willing to accept any (HCV\u2010negative or HCV\u2010positive) liver versus (2) those willing to accept only HCV\u2010negative livers. Patients receiving HCV\u2010positive livers were treated preemptively with 12 weeks of DAA therapy and had a higher risk of graft failure than those receiving HCV\u2010negative livers. The model incorporated data from published studies and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We found that accepting any liver regardless of HCV status versus accepting only HCV\u2010negative livers resulted in an increase in life expectancy when Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease (MELD) was \u226520, and the benefit was highest at MELD 28 (0.172 additional life\u2010years). The magnitude of clinical benefit was greater in UNOS regions with higher HCV\u2010positive donor organ rates, that is, Regions 1, 2, 3, 10, and 11. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that model outcomes were robust. Conclusion: Transplanting HCV\u2010positive livers into HCV\u2010negative patients with preemptive DAA therapy could improve patient survival on the LT waiting list. Our analysis can help inform clinical trials and minimize patient harm. (Hepatology 2018;67:2085\u20102095).",

        "abstract": "Direct\u2010acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has altered the frequency and outcome of liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The high efficacy and tolerability of DAA therapy has also created a rationale for utilizing HCV\u2010viremic (HCV\u2010RNA\u2013positive) donors, including into HCV\u2010negative recipients. We examined trends in frequency of organ utilization and graft survival in recipients of HCV\u2010viremic donors (HCV\u2010RNA positive as measured by nucleic acid testing [NAT]). Data were collected from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) on adult patients who underwent a primary, single\u2010organ, deceased donor LT from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2018. Outcomes of HCV\u2010negative transplant recipients (R\u2013) who received an allograft from donors who were HCV\u2010RNA positive (DNAT+) were compared to outcomes for R\u2013 patients who received organs from donors who were HCV\u2010RNA negative (DNAT\u2013). There were 11,270 DNAT\u2013/R\u2013; 4,748 DNAT\u2013/R+; 87 DNAT+/R\u2013; and 753 DNAT+/R+ patients, with 2\u2010year graft survival similar across all groups: DNAT\u2013/R\u2013 88%; DNAT\u2013/R+ 88%; DNAT+/R\u2013 86%; and DNAT+/R+ 90%. Additionally, there were 2,635 LTs using HCV antibody\u2010positive donors (DAb+): 2,378 DAb+/R+ and 257 DAb+/R\u2013. The annual number of DAb+/R\u2013 transplants increased from seven in 2008 to 107 in 2017. In the post\u2010DAA era, graft survival improved for all recipients, with 3\u2010year survival of DAb+/R\u2013 patients and DAb+/R+ patients increasing to 88% from 79% and to 85% from 78%, respectively. Conclusion: The post\u2010DAA era has seen increased utilization of HCV\u2010viremic donor livers, including HCV\u2010viremic livers into HCV\u2010negative recipients. Early graft outcomes are similar to those of HCV\u2010negative recipients. These results support utilization of HCV\u2010viremic organs in selected recipients both with and without HCV infection.",

Between June 2018 and December 2019, 292/339 rHCV\u2212 received an LT. Forty\u2010seven patients were excluded from analysis because of recipient HCV viremia, refusal to receive DNAT+ organs, or inability to receive DAA therapy post\u2010LT.

In this case series, we present two cases of HCV\u2010negative recipients who underwent kidney transplantation from viremic donors and developed FCH. Both patients presented after transplant with abnormal liver function tests and HCV viral loads of greater than 100 000 000 IU/mL. FCH was diagnosed by histology and/or clinical data. Both patients were started on DAA therapy within 24 hours of admission with improvement in LFTs. One patient has undetectable HCV 12 weeks after completing treatment and the other patient has undetectable HCV after completing DAA treatment. The introduction of DAAs has changed the landscape of solid organ transplantation with the potential to expand the donor pool and increase access to organs. While HCV viremic organs have tremendous potential to increase access to a scarce resource, FCH is a potentially fatal complication and therefore clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for this unique complication.",

        "abstract": "Background. Transplanting hepatitis C viremic donor organs into hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative recipients is becoming increasingly common; however, practices for posttransplant direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment vary widely. Protracted insurance authorization processes for DAA therapy often lead to treatment delays. Methods. At our institution, 2 strategies for providing DAA therapy to HCV\u2013 recipients of HCV+ transplants have been used. For thoracic organ recipients, an institution-subsidized course of initial therapy was provided to ensure an early treatment initiation date. For abdominal organ recipients, insurance approval for DAA coverage was sought once viremia developed, and treatment was initiated only once the insurance-authorized supply of drug was received. To evaluate the clinical impact of these 2 strategies, we retrospectively collected data pertaining to the timing of DAA initiation, duration of recipient viremia, and monetary costs incurred by patients and the institution for patients managed under these 2 DAA coverage strategies. Results. One hundred fifty-two transplants were performed using HCV viremic donor organs. Eighty-nine patients received DAA treatment without subsidy, and 62 received DAA treatment with subsidy. One patient who never developed viremia posttransplant received no treatment. Subsidizing the initial course enabled earlier treatment initiation (median, 4 d [interquartile range (IQR), 2\u20137] vs 10 [IQR, 8\u201313]; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and shorter duration of viremia (median, 16 d [IQR, 12\u201329] vs 36 [IQR, 30\u201347]; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Institutional costs averaged $9173 per subsidized patient and $168 per nonsubsidized patient. Three needlestick exposures occurred in caregivers of viremic patients. Conclusions. Recipients and their caregivers stand to benefit from earlier DAA treatment initiation; however, institutional costs to subsidize DAA therapy before insurance authorization are substantial. Insurance authorization processes for DAAs should be revised to accommodate this unique patient group.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the effects of hepatitis C viremia on immunologic outcomes in the era of direct\u2010acting antivirals. We conducted a prospective, single\u2010arm trial of lung transplantation from hepatitis C\u2010infected donors into hepatitis C\u2010na\u00efve recipients (n = 21). Recipients were initiated on glecaprevir\u2010pibrentasvir immediately post\u2010transplant and were continued on therapy for a total of 8 weeks. A control group of recipients of hepatitis C\u2010negative lungs were matched 1:1 on baseline variables (n = 21). The primary outcome was the frequency of acute cellular rejection over 1\u2010year post\u2010transplant. Treatment with glecaprevir\u2010pibrentasvir was well tolerated and resulted in viremia clearance after a median of 16 days of therapy (IQR 10\u201324 days). At one year, there was no difference in incidence of acute cellular rejection (71.4% vs. 85.7%, P = .17) or rejection requiring treatment (33.3% vs. 57.1%, P = .12). Mean cumulative acute rejection scores were similar between groups (.46 [SD \u00b1 .53] vs. .52 [SD \u00b1 .37], P = .67). Receipt of HCV+ organs was not associated with acute rejection on unadjusted Cox regression analysis (HR .55, 95% CI .28\u20101.11, P = .09), or when adjusted for risk factors known to be associated with acute rejection (HR .57, 95% CI .27\u20101.21, P = .14). Utilization of hepatitis C infected lungs with immediate treatment leads to equivalent immunologic outcomes at 1 year.",
