        "title": "A randomized study of adefovir dipivoxil in place of HBIG in combination with lamivudine as post\u2013liver transplantation hepatitis B prophylaxis",
        "abstract": "Prior to effective prophylaxis, liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)\u2010related disease was frequently complicated by recurrence, which could be severe and rapidly progressive. Combination hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and lamivudine prophylaxis reduces this rate of recurrence to <5% at 5 years; however, HBIG administration is costly and inconvenient. We conducted a multicenter randomized study of adefovir dipivoxil substitution for low\u2010dose intramuscular (IM) HBIG in patients without HBV recurrence at least 12 months posttransplantation for HBV\u2010related disease. Thirty\u2010four patients were randomized, 16 to adefovir (1 patient withdrew consent at 3 months and is not considered in the results) and 18 to continue HBIG. All continued lamivudine. Groups were well matched by age, sex, and time since transplantation (median, 4.5 years), and background virological risk for HBV recurrence (30% of patients in the adefovir group, 24% in the HBIG group having detectable HBV DNA at transplantation). All patients were alive at study completion without recurrence. One patient in the adefovir group became hepatitis B surface antigen\u2013positive at 5 months but was persistently HBV DNA undetectable via polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 14 IU/mL) over the following 20 months. Median creatinine was not significantly changed over the course of the study in either group. One patient in the adefovir group with a background of diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy (baseline creatinine 150 \u03bcmol/L) developed increased creatinine leading to dose reduction and ultimately cessation of adefovir at 15 months. Yearly cost of combination adefovir/lamivudine prophylaxis was $8,290 versus $13,718 IM HBIG/lamivudine. Conclusion: Compared with combination HBIG plus lamivudine prophylaxis, combination adefovir plus lamivudine provides equivalent protection against recurrent HBV infection but with better tolerability and less cost.

        "title": "Current management of hepatitis B virus infection before and after liver transplantation",
        "abstract": "The progress in treatment against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has substantially improved the outcome of all HBV\u2010infected patients. We systematically reviewed the existing data in the management of HBV transplant patients in order to assess the optimal regimen in the pretransplant setting, for post\u2010transplant prophylaxis and for therapy of HBV recurrent infection. All data suggest that an effective pretransplant anti\u2010HBV therapy prevents post\u2010transplant HBV recurrence. Pretransplant therapy has been based on lamivudine with addition of adefovir upon lamivudine resistance, but the use of newer, potent high\u2010genetic barrier agents is expected to improve long\u2010term efficacy. Moreover, it may lead to improvement of liver function, which sometimes removes the need for transplantation, although more objective criteria for removal from waiting lists are required. After liver transplantation, the combination of HBV immunoglobulin and one nucleos(t)ide analogue, mostly lamivudine, is currently the best approach, almost eliminating the probability of HBV recurrence. Treatment of post\u2010transplant HBV recurrence has been mainly studied with lamivudine, but it will be most effective with entecavir and tenofovir, which have a low risk of resistance. In conclusion, the newer anti\u2010HBV agents improve the treatment of HBV both pretransplant and post\u2010transplant. HBV immunoglobulin is still used in combination with an anti\u2010HBV agent for post\u2010transplant prophylaxis. Monoprophylaxis with one of the new anti\u2010HBV agents might be possible, particularly in patients preselected as having a low risk of HBV recurrence, but further data are needed and strategies to ensure compliance must be used.",

        "title": "Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues for prophylaxis against hepatitis b virus recurrence after liver transplantation: A systematic review",
        "abstract": "A combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) is currently recommended as prophylaxis against the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (LT), but the optimal protocol is a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was the identification of factors associated with post\u2010LT HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and NUCs. We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies in English about the effectiveness of HBIG and NUCs [lamivudine (LAM) and/or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)] against post\u2010LT HBV recurrence (January 1998 to June 2010). Forty\u2010six studies, which included 2162 HBV LT recipients, met the selection criteria. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM experienced HBV recurrence more frequently than patients receiving HBIG and ADV with or without LAM [6.1% (115/1889) versus 2.0% (3/152), P = 0.024], although they also were more frequently treated with indefinite HBIG prophylaxis (90% versus 57%, P < 0.001). For patients receiving HBIG and LAM, a lower frequency of HBV recurrence was associated with a high HBIG dosage (\u226510,000 IU/day) versus a low HBIG dosage (<10,000 IU/day) during the first week after LT [3.2% (14/440) versus 6.5% (80/1233), P = 0.016], but the HBIG protocol had no impact on HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. In conclusion, in comparison with the combination of HBIG and LAM, the combination of HBIG and ADV is associated with a lower rate of HBV recurrence after LT. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM should be given a high dosage of HBIG during the first week after LT, but a lower dosage can be used safely in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. Further studies with newer and more potent anti\u2010HBV agents are definitely required. Liver Transpl 17:1176\u20131190, 2011. \u00a9 2011 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLiver transplantation is the only established, causally directed treatment for irreversible chronic or acute liver failure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis review is based on papers retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed database, the index of randomized controlled trials of the European Society of Organ Transplantation, and the Cochrane database, along with an analysis of data from the authors' own center.\n\n\nRESULTS\n1199 liver transplantations were performed in Germany in 2011. The most common indications were alcoholic cirrhosis (28%), cirrhosis of other causes (24%), and intrahepatic tumors (20%). Among recipients, the sex ratio was nearly 1:1 and the median age was just under 50. Across Europe, the 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates after liver transplantation were 82%, 71% and 61%. In our own center, the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin, the corresponding rates were 90.4%, 79.6% and 70.3%, based on an experience of 100 to 120 cases per year. The current rate of functioning transplants five years after liver transplantation is 52.6% in Germany and 66.2% internationally. Standard immunosuppression consists of a calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus or cyclosporine A, and steroids. Early complications include primary functional failure of the transplant, hemorrhage, thrombosis, acute rejection, and biliary complications. Over the long term, complications that can impair the outcome include chronic rejection, biliary strictures, cardiovascular and metabolic adverse effects, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and opportunistic infections and malignancies.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLiver transplantation is a successful and well-established form of treatment that is nonetheless endangered by a shortage of donor organs and other structural and organizational difficulties.",

        "abstract": "Secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC\u2010CIP) is a destructive cholangiopathy with a poor prognosis. Liver transplantation (LT) is an established therapeutic option in end\u2010stage liver disease but is insufficiently evaluated in patients with SSC\u2010CIP. Our aim was the retrospective analysis of the outcome and complications of patients with SSC\u2010CIP undergoing LT between 2002 and 2012. Demographic characteristics, laboratory, transplantation, and follow\u2010up data were compared to sex\u2010 and age\u2010matched patients undergoing LT because of other reasons. Quality of life (QoL) before and after LT was assessed in a retrospective telephone interview. LT was performed in 21 patients with SSC\u2010CIP. The main causes for intensive care unit admission comprised cardiothoracic surgery interventions (10/21, 48%), polytrauma (6/21, 29%), and pneumonia (3/21, 14%). Median follow\u2010up period after LT was 82 months (interquartile range [IQR], 37\u2010129) for patients with SSC\u2010CIP and 83 months (IQR, 55\u2010104) for control patients. Biopsy\u2010proven rejection episodes in patients with SSC\u2010CIP (4/21, 19%) were similar compared to control patients (12/60, 20%; P\u2009=\u20090.93). Cytomegalovirus infections were equal in both groups (10/21, 48% versus 25/60, 42%; P\u2009=\u20090.64). The 1\u2010, 3\u2010, and 5\u2010year survival rates of patients with SSC\u2010CIP versus control patients were 100% versus 98%, 86% versus 92%, and 76% versus 87%, respectively (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The QoL improved significantly after LT in SSC\u2010CIP. In conclusion, LT is a valid option for patients with SSC\u2010CIP with excellent long\u2010term outcome and improvement of QoL.

        "abstract": "Secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) is a recently identified cholestatic liver disease occurring in patients without prior history of hepatobiliary disease, after receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) in different settings, including cardiothoracic surgery, infection, trauma, and burns. It is a rare entity, being estimated to occur in 1/2,000 patients in an ICU; however, it is a dismal condition, with up to half of the patients dying during the ICU stay and with rapid progression to liver cirrhosis over weeks to months. SSC-CIP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cholestasis in the ICU, particularly when cholestasis persists after recovery from the critical event. Diagnosis is established with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showing dilations and stenoses of the intrahepatic bile ducts as well as biliary casts. No available treatment has been shown to slow the rapid progression of the disease, and liver transplant referral should be considered early after the diagnosis of SSC-CIP. Increased awareness and timely diagnosis are crucial in order to improve the current appalling outcome.",

        "abstract": "A previously well 59-year-old man required a prolonged intensive care unit stay due to severe COVID-19 symptoms. During the admission, he developed a cytokine storm, also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, and multiorgan failure. Despite recovering from his other organ failures, his liver function continued to deteriorate. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed extensive intrahepatic duct dilatation with \u2018beading\u2019 but common bile duct sparing. Given the patient had no primary liver disease prior to admission, we considered secondary causes of cholestatic liver injury; this led us to an unusual diagnosis of secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients. This case demonstrates a rare disease that has developed specifically in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A review of current literature and the underlying pathophysiology for this rare disease are discussed, particularly in relation to COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is a predominantly respiratory tract infection with the capacity to affect multiple organ systems. Abnormal liver tests, mainly transaminase elevations, have been reported in hospitalized patients. We describe a syndrome of cholangiopathy in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 characterized by marked elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) accompanied by evidence of bile duct injury on imaging. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020, on whom the hepatology service was consulted for abnormal liver tests. Bile duct injury was identified by abnormal liver tests with serum ALP > 3x upper limit of normal and abnormal findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological findings were recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture database. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, 11 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 58 years. Mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis to diagnosis of cholangiopathy was 118 days. Peak median serum alanine aminotransferase was 661 U/L and peak median serum ALP was 1855 U/L. Marked elevations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers were common. Magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography findings included beading of intrahepatic ducts (11/12, 92%), bile duct wall thickening with enhancement (7/12, 58%), and peribiliary diffusion high signal (10/12, 83%). Liver biopsy in 4 patients showed acute and/or chronic large duct obstruction without clear bile duct loss. Progressive biliary tract damage has been demonstrated radiographically. Five patients were referred for consideration of liver transplantation after experiencing persistent jaundice, hepatic insufficiency, and/or recurrent bacterial cholangitis. One patient underwent successful living donor liver transplantation. DISCUSSION: Cholangiopathy is a late complication of severe COVID-19 with the potential for progressive biliary injury and liver failure. Further studies are required to understand pathogenesis, natural history, and therapeutic interventions.",
