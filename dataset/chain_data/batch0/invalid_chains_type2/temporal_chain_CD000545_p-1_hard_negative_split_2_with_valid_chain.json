        "abstract": "To test the effectiveness of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in the treatment of Crohn's disease, we entered 83 chronically ill patients into a two-year double-blind study comparing 6-MP with placebo. Crossover data showed that improvement occurred in 26 of 39 courses of 6-MP (67%) as compared with three of 39 courses of placebo (8%) (P less than 0.001). Non-crossover data likewise confirmed the superiority of 6-MP. The drug was more effective than placebo in closing fistulas (31 vs 6%) and in permitting discontinuation or reduction of steroid dosage (75 vs. 36%) (P less than 0.001). The onset of response to 6-MP was often delayed, with 32% of patients taking longer than three months to respond, and 19% taking longer than four months. Adverse side effects to 6-MP occurred in 10% of patients and were uniformly reversible. We conclude that 6-MP is an effective and useful agent in the management of Crohn's disease.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper. The source paper investigates the treatment of Crohn's disease with azathioprine, and this paper explores the effectiveness of 6-mercaptopurine, which is a related compound. The study builds upon the idea of using immunosuppressive drugs to manage Crohn's disease, which is a concept introduced in the source paper."

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown aetiology in which colonic mucosal inflammation and ulceration result in rectal bleeding and diarrhoea. Most patients have relapses separated by long periods of disease inactivity, but a minority of patients have more chronic symptoms. The great majority of a t txks of ulcerative colitis settle with prompt medical management but in the few cases where this fails, colectomy is curative although generally leaves the patient with a permanent ileostomy. With good medical and surgical management, mortality from the disease should therefore approach zero.",
