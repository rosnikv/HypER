        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Although autoreactive T cells are thought to play a prominent role in autoimmune disease in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, it has been difficult to directly determine if autoreactive T cells escape from the thymus and react with self-antigens in the periphery. Defective expression of the Fas apoptosis antigen in MRL-lpr/lpr mice results from the insertion of the ETn retrotransposon. The fas defect can be partially corrected in CD2-fas transgenic mice in which the expression of fas is corrected in T cells. To identify a possible defect in clonal deletion or clonal anergy induction of auto-specific T cells, we have studied C57BL/6-lpr/lpr transgenic mice that express TcR genes that recognize a known self-antigen, the male H-Y antigen. In addition, we have analyzed clonal deletion and tolerance induction after neonatal tolerance induction and superantigen-induced arthritis with the class II MHC reactive superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in V beta 8 TcR transgenic and non-transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Neonatal tolerance induction to SEB was normal in lpr/lpr mice. However, over time a loss of tolerance (thymic or peripheral) was observed in lpr/lpr mice but not in +/+ TcR transgenic mice. This defect in lpr/lpr mice was thymic-dependent and was due to increased CD28/CTLA4 signaling. These results suggest that an apoptosis defect involving both thymocytes and peripheral lymphoid cells leads to autoimmune disease in lpr/lpr mice. The challenge in the future will be to determine the role of defective apoptosis in other autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "The Fas cell surface receptor belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and can initiate apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Using the Fas cytoplasmic domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated a mouse cDNA encoding a 205-amino-acid protein. Its predicted protein sequence shows 68% identity and 80% similarity with the sequence of recently described human Mort/FADD. This protein, most likely the mouse homolog of human FADD, associates with Fas in vivo only upon the induction of cell death. A fraction of this protein is highly phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues, with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms being capable of binding to FAS. Stable expression of a truncated form of the Mort/FADD protein protects cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis by interfering with the wild-type protein-Fas interaction. Thus, mouse Mort/FADD is an essential downstream component that mediates Fas-induced apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Signaling through the CD95/Fas/APO-1 death receptor plays a critical role in the homeostasis of the immune system. RICK, a novel protein kinase that regulates CD95-mediated apoptosis was identified and characterized. RICK is composed of an N-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal region containing a caspase-recruitment domain. RICK physically interacts with CLARP, a caspase-like molecule known to bind to Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8. Expression of RICK promoted the activation of caspase-8 and potentiated apoptosis induced by Fas ligand, FADD, CLARP, and caspase-8. Deletion mutant analysis revealed that both the kinase domain and caspase-recruitment domain were required for RICK to promote apoptosis. Significantly, expression of a RICK mutant in which the lysine of the putative ATP-binding site at position 38 was replaced by a methionine functioned as an inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis. Thus, RICK represents a novel kinase that may regulate apoptosis induced by the CD95/Fas receptor pathway.",

Nod-1 was found to bind to multiple caspases with long prodomains, but specifically activated caspase-9 and promoted caspase-9-induced apoptosis. As reported for Apaf-1, Nod1 required both the CARD and P-loop for function.

Nod1 mutants inhibited NF-\u03baB activity induced by RICK, but not that resulting from tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 stimulation.

The reason for the unique association of NOD2 mutations with ileal disease is unclear. To identify a possible link, we tested expression of NOD2 in intestinal tissue of CD patients and controls. Patients and methods: Fifty five specimens of ileum or colon from 21 CD patients, seven ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and five controls with pathology other than CD or UC were stained for NOD2 using an immunoperoxidase method. Results: Using a monoclonal antibody against NOD2 developed in our laboratory, we detected uniform expression of NOD2 in terminal ileum Paneth cells from controls and patients as well as in metaplastic Paneth cells in the colon. Mechanical purification showed enriched expression of NOD2 mRNA in ileal crypts. In Paneth cells, NOD2 was located in the cytosol in close proximity to the granules that contain antimicrobial peptides. We detected minimal NOD2 in the villous epithelium of the ileum or in the colonic epithelium from both CD patients and controls. Conclusions: These results suggest a role for NOD2 in the regulation of Paneth cell mediated responses against intestinal bacteria and a plausible mechanism to explain the selective association of NOD2 mutations with ileal disease. The impaired capacity of CD associated mutations to sense luminal bacteria may result in increased susceptibility to certain gut microbes.",

Here we show that Nod2 plays an essential role in controlling commensal bacterial flora in the intestine. Analysis of intestinal bacteria from the terminal ilea of Nod2-deficient mice showed that they harbor an increased load of commensal resident bacteria. Furthermore, Nod2-deficient mice had a diminished ability to prevent intestinal colonization of pathogenic bacteria. In vitro, intestinal crypts isolated from terminal ilea of Nod2-deficient mice were unable to kill bacteria effectively, suggesting an important role of Nod2 signaling in crypt function. Interestingly, the expression of Nod2 is dependent on the presence of commensal bacteria, because mice re-derived into germ-free conditions expressed significantly less Nod2 in their terminal ilea, and complementation of commensal bacteria into germ-free mice induced Nod2 expression. Therefore, Nod2 and intestinal commensal bacterial flora maintain a balance by regulating each other through a feedback mechanism. Dysfunction of Nod2 results in a break-down of this homeostasis.",

The requirement of Nod2 and ATG16L1 expression and the effects of CD-associated variants in MDP-stimulated autophagy and Nod2-dependent signaling were assessed in cell lines manipulated by RNA interference, inhibitors, or ATG16L1 or NOD2 variants and in primary macrophages and dendritic cells from healthy genotyped donors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMDP stimulation of epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells activated autophagy and nuclear factor \u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling; it also increased killing of Salmonella.

AIEC bacteria are able to replicate within epithelial cells after lysis of the endocytic vacuole and within macrophages in a large vacuole.

We previously determined that defects in autophagy impaired the ability of epithelial cells to control AIEC replication. AIEC behave differently within epithelial cells and macrophages and so we investigated the impact of defects in autophagy on AIEC intramacrophagic replication and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine response. AIEC bacteria induced the recruitment of the autophagy machinery at the site of phagocytosis, and functional autophagy limited AIEC intramacrophagic replication. Impaired ATG16L1, IRGM or NOD2 expression induced increased intramacrophagic AIEC and increased secretion of IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in response to AIEC infection. In contrast, forced induction of autophagy decreased the numbers of intramacrophagic AIEC and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine release, even in a NOD2\u2010deficient context.

Biopsy specimens from the terminal ileum of patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 20), CD (n = 20), or individuals without inflammatory bowel disease undergoing surveillance colonoscopies (controls, n = 13) were collected during endoscopic examination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAIEC infection up-regulated levels of microRNA (MIR) 30C and MIR130A in T84 cells and in mouse enterocytes by activating nuclear factor-\u03baB. Up-regulation of these microRNAs reduced the levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1 and inhibited autophagy, leading to increased numbers of intracellular AIEC and an increased inflammatory response. In ileal biopsy samples of patients with CD, there was an inverse correlation between levels of MIR30C and MIR130A and those of ATG5 and ATG16L1, supporting in vitro findings. Inhibition of MIR30C and MIR130A in cultured intestinal epithelial cells and in mouse enterocytes blocked AIEC-induced inhibition of ATG5 and ATG16L1 expression and restored functional autophagy. This resulted in more effective clearance of intracellular AIEC and reduced AIEC-induced inflammation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInfection with AIEC up-regulates microRNAs to reduce expression of proteins required for autophagy and autophagy response in intestinal epithelial cells. Ileal samples from patients with CD have increased levels of these same microRNAs and reduced levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1.",

        "title": "Autophagy Protects against Colitis by the Maintenance of Normal Gut Microflora and Secretion of Mucus*",
        "abstract": "Background: The role of autophagy in colonic homeostasis is not clear. Results: Colonic epithelial cell-specific and autophagy-deficient mice showed exacerbation of colitis and abnormal gut microflora with less abundant antimicrobial peptide production and secretion of mucus. Conclusion: Autophagy protects against colitis by the maintenance of normal gut microflora and secretion of mucus. Significance: These findings may ultimately lead to an efficient intervention for inflammatory bowel diseases. Genome-wide association studies of inflammatory bowel diseases identified susceptible loci containing an autophagy-related gene. However, the role of autophagy in the colon, a major affected area in inflammatory bowel diseases, is not clear. Here, we show that colonic epithelial cell-specific autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) conditional knock-out (cKO) mice showed exacerbation of experimental colitis with more abundant bacterial invasion into the colonic epithelium. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that cKO mice had abnormal microflora with an increase of some genera. Consistently, expression of antimicrobial or antiparasitic peptides such as angiogenin-4, Relm\u03b2, intelectin-1, and intelectin-2 as well as that of their inducer cytokines was significantly reduced in the cKO mice. Furthermore, secretion of colonic mucins that function as a mucosal barrier against bacterial invasion was also significantly diminished in cKO mice. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy in colonic epithelial cells protects against colitis by the maintenance of normal gut microflora and secretion of mucus.",

        "abstract": "We recently observed reduced autophagy in Crohn\u2019s disease patients and an anti-inflammatory effect of autophagy stimulation in murine colitis, but both anti- and pro-fibrotic effects are associated with autophagy stimulation in different tissues, and fibrosis is a frequent complication of Crohn\u2019s disease. Thus, we analyzed the effects of pharmacological modulation of autophagy in a murine model of intestinal fibrosis and detected that autophagy inhibition aggravates, while autophagy stimulation prevents, fibrosis. These effects are associated with changes in inflammation and in collagen degradation in primary fibroblasts. Thus, pharmacological stimulation of autophagy may be useful against intestinal fibrosis.",

        "title": "Curcumin Blunts IL-6 Dependent Endothelial\u2010to\u2010Mesenchymal Transition to Alleviate Renal Allograft Fibrosis Through Autophagy Activation",
        "abstract": "Fibrosis contributes to graft loss in chronic renal allograft injury. Endothelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition (EndMT) plays an important role in the development of fibrosis following kidney transplantation. Autophagy plays an important role in the homeostasis of diverse cell types including endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy by treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or by silencing autophagy-related (ATG)5 promoted interleukin (IL)-6\u2013dependent EndMT in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs), and autophagy inactivation was associated with EndMT in patients with chronic allograft dysfunction. IL-6 level was significantly higher in the culture medium of HUVECs transfected with ATG5 siRNA or treated with 3-MA compared to the respective control groups. IL-6 application induced EndMT in HUVECs and HRGECs, whereas antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-6 suppressed EndMT induced by ATG5 silencing. The protective role of curcumin (Cur) against allograft fibrosis was confirmed in a rat kidney transplantation model of F344 donors to Lewis recipients. Curcumin\u2014a natural polyphenol compound with known antifibrotic effects in various tissues\u2014alleviated IL-6\u2013induced EndMT and promoted autophagy in the allografted organ and in HUVECs. This is the first demonstration of the role of autophagy in renal allograft fibrosis; our findings indicate that curcumin can alleviate chronic renal allograft injury by suppressing IL-6\u2013dependent EndMT via activation of autophagy.",

        "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a common process of almost all the chronic kidney diseases progressing to end-stage kidney disease. As a highly conserved lysosomal protein degradation pathway, autophagy is responsible for degrading protein aggregates, damaged organelles, or invading pathogens to maintain intracellular homeostasis. Growing evidence reveals that autophagy is involved in the progression of renal fibrosis, both in the tubulointerstitial compartment and in the glomeruli. Nevertheless, the specific role of autophagy in renal fibrosis has still not been fully understood. Therefore, in this review we will describe the characteristics of autophagy and summarize the recent advances in understanding the functions of autophagy in renal fibrosis. Moreover, the problem existing in this field and the possibility of autophagy as the potential therapeutic target for renal fibrosis have also been discussed.",

        "title": "Autophagy as a Therapeutic Target for Chronic Kidney Disease and the Roles of TGF-\u03b21 in Autophagy and Kidney Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "Autophagy is a lysosomal protein degradation system that eliminates cytoplasmic components such as protein aggregates, damaged organelles, and even invading pathogens. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved homoeostatic strategy for cell survival in stressful conditions and has been linked to a variety of biological processes and disorders. It is vital for the homeostasis and survival of renal cells such as podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, as well as immune cells in the healthy kidney. Autophagy activation protects renal cells under stressed conditions, whereas autophagy deficiency increases the vulnerability of the kidney to injury, resulting in several aberrant processes that ultimately lead to renal failure. Renal fibrosis is a condition that, if chronic, will progress to end-stage kidney disease, which at this point is incurable. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is linked to significant alterations in cell signaling such as the activation of the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). While the expression of TGF-\u03b21 can promote fibrogenesis, it can also activate autophagy, which suppresses renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Autophagy has a complex variety of impacts depending on the context, cell types, and pathological circumstances, and can be profibrotic or antifibrotic. Induction of autophagy in tubular cells, particularly in the proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) protects cells against stresses such as proteinuria-induced apoptosis and ischemia-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas the loss of autophagy in renal cells scores a significant increase in sensitivity to several renal diseases. In this review, we discuss new findings that emphasize the various functions of TGF-\u03b21 in producing not just renal fibrosis but also the beneficial TGF-\u03b21 signaling mechanisms in autophagy.",

        "title": "Arsenic exposure induced renal fibrosis via regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the NLRP3\u2010TGF\u2010\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway",
        "abstract": "Environmental arsenic exposure is one of the major global public health problems. Studies have shown that arsenic exposure can cause renal fibrosis, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Integrating the in vivo and in vitro models, this study investigated the potential molecular pathways for arsenic\u2010induced renal fibrosis. In this study, SD rats were treated with 0, 5, 25, 50, and 100\u2009mg/L NaAsO2 for 8\u2009weeks via drinking water, and HK2 cells were treated with different doses of NaAsO2 for 48\u2009h. The in vivo results showed that arsenic content in the rats' kidneys increased as the dose increased. Body weight decreased and kidney coefficient increased at 100\u2009mg/L. As a response to the elevated NaAsO2 dose, inflammatory cell infiltration, renal tubular injury, glomerular atrophy, tubulointerstitial hemorrhage, and fibrosis became more obvious indicated by HE and Masson staining. The kidney transcriptome profiles further supported the protein\u2013protein interactions involved in NaAsO2\u2010induced renal fibrosis. The in vivo results, in together with the in vitro experiments, have revealed that exposure to NaAsO2 disturbed mitochondrial dynamics, promoted mitophagy, activated inflammation and the TGF\u2010\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway, and finally resulted in fibrosis. In summary, arsenic exposure contributed to renal fibrosis via regulating the mitochondrial dynamics and the NLRP3\u2010TGF\u2010\u03b21/SMAD signaling axis. This study presented an adverse outcome pathway for the development of renal fibrosis due to arsenic exposure through drinking water.",
