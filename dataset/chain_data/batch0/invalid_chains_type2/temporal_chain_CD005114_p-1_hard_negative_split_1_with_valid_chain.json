        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low dose dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in glucocorticoid treated female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Forty one women ( \u2265 5 mg prednisolone/day) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study for 6 months where DHEA was given at 30 mg/20 mg ( \u2264 45/ \u2265 46 years) daily, or placebo, followed by 6 months open DHEA treatment to all patients. HRQOL was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, using four validated questionnaires and the patients' partners completed a questionnaire assessing mood and behaviour at 6 months. DHEA treatment increased serum levels of sulphated DHEA from subnormal to normal. The DHEA group improved in SF-36 \u201crole emotional\u201d and HSCL-56 total score (both p < 0.05). During open DHEA treatment, the former placebo group improved in SF-36 \u201cmental health\u201d (p < 0.05) with a tendency for improvement in HSCL-56 total score (p = 0.10). Both groups improved in McCoy's Sex Scale during active treatment (p < 0.05). DHEA replacement decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and haematocrit. There were no effects on bone density or disease activity and no serious adverse events. Side effects were mild. We conclude that low dose DHEA treatment improves HRQOL with regard to mental well-being and sexuality and can be offered to women with SLE where mental distress and/or impaired sexuality constitutes a problem.",

        "abstract": "With improvements in mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the functional status of these patients, assessed using health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments, is increasingly being recognised as an important outcome measure in clinical research. Domains of HRQoL of particular importance to SLE patients include fatigue, ability to work, good health, independence, social and family life, learned helplessness (reflecting the unpredictability of lupus), pain and the home environment. The SF-36 currently appears to be the best available generic instrument for the assessment of HRQoL in SLE, and is likely to be complemented by several newly-developed disease-specific HRQoL instruments. It has been shown that SLE patients have poorer functional status than the general population, and that specific manifestations of SLE (disease activity, previous renal involvement and fibromyalgia) may influence HRQoL. HRQoL in SLE patients has been improved by (1) psycho-educational interventions including telephone counselling, a self-help course, group psychotherapy; (2) therapies including Riquent, belimumab, mycophenolate mofetil, dehydroepiandrosterone, oestrogen therapy and a cholesterol- lowering diet. Additional research is needed to identify strategies which can improve HRQoL in SLE patients.",

The Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment (SELENA) version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) SLE disease activity instruments, the Short Form 36 health survey, and biomarker analyses were used to create a novel SRI.

        "abstract": "Objectives Despite advances in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment, many patients suffer from the disease and side effects. Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75\u2005mg or atacicept 150\u2005mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4\u2005weeks, then weekly for 48\u2005weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively. Results Enrolment in the atacicept 150\u2005mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75\u2005mg and placebo. Analysis of patients treated with atacicept 150\u2005mg suggested beneficial effect versus placebo in flare rates (OR: 0.48, p=0.002) and time to first flare (HR: 0.56, p=0.009). Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate.

        "abstract": "Abnormalities in B cells play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). Breach in central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms generates autoreactive B cells which contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE and LN. Dysregulation of B cell transcription factors, cytokines and B cell\u2013T cell interaction can result in aberrant B cell maturation and autoantibody production. These immunological abnormalities also lead to perturbations in circulating and infiltrating B cells in SLE and LN patients. Conventional and novel immunosuppressive medications confer differential effects on B cells which have important clinical implications. While cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) showed comparable clinical efficacy in active LN, MMF induction was associated with earlier reduction in circulating plasmablasts and plasma cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that MMF maintenance is associated with lower risk of disease relapse than azathioprine, which may be explained by its more potent and selective suppression of B cell proliferation. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting the B cell repertoire include B cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies binding to cell surface markers, inhibition of B cell cytokines, and modulation of costimulatory signals in B cell\u2013T cell interaction. These biologics, despite showing improvements in serological parameters and proteinuria, did not achieve primary endpoints when used as add-on therapy to standard treatments in active LN patients. Other emerging treatments such as calcineurin inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors also show distinct inhibitory effects on the B cell repertoire. Advancement in the knowledge on B cell biology has fueled the development of new therapeutic strategies in SLE and LN. Modification in background treatments, study endpoints and selective recruitment of subjects showing aberrant B cells or its signaling pathways when designing future clinical trials may better elucidate the roles of these novel therapies for SLE and LN patients.",

Methods An observational case\u2013control study was conducted in SLE (cases) and patients without any rheumatic diseases (controls), matched for sex. Sociodemographic and cardiometabolic variables were gathered, and SLE activity was assessed through several indexes. Periodontal examination registered probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, plaque index, and tooth loss. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed by measuring the carotid\u2013femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) by Doppler velocimetry, homocysteine levels, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used to assess the association of any of the studied variables with SLE. Results Seventy\u2010one cases and 72 controls were included in the study. Thirty\u2010nine SLE patients (54.9%) were diagnosed with periodontitis, compared with 16 controls (22.2%). High levels of PWV (\u22657.7 m/s, 75th percentile) were shown by 44.3% of the cases vs. 22.4% of the controls (p = .011). Among SLE patients, those with periodontitis showed higher PWV values (8.1 \u00b1 1.52 vs. 7.16 \u00b1 1.11 m/s, p = .006) and higher homeostasis model assessment index (indicative of insulin resistance) (1.7 \u00b1 0.73 vs. 2.92 \u00b1 3.05, p = .028) compared to those with periodontal health. Logistic regression showed that waist circumference (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.12, p = .015); ESR (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.16, p = .003); and bleeding on probing (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.19, p = .018) were associated with the risk of SLE. Conclusion Systemic lupus erythematosus patients showed a higher periodontitis percentage than controls.
