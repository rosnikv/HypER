        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) are the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, the former account for about 70-80% of liability to develop AITDs. However, at least 20-30% is contributed by environmental factors, which include certainly smoking (at least for Graves' disease and orbitopathy), probably stress, iodine and selenium intake, several drugs, irradiation, pollutants, viral and bacterial infections, allergy, pregnancy, and post-partum. Evidence for the intervention of these factors is often limited, and the mechanisms whereby environmental factors may concur to the onset of AITDs are in many instances unclear. Nevertheless, gene-environment interaction seems a fundamental process for the occurrence of AITDs.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThe purpose of the present review is to describe recent insights into the pathomechanism of ocular surface impairment in the course of thyroid dysfunctions. The review focuses in particular on Graves' ophthalmopathy as the majority of the literature is published on this topic. Recent findingsMechanical factors were thought, until now, to be the indirect causes of ocular surface function failure. In particular, eyeglobe bulging and upper eyelid retraction with consequent eyelid fissure width increase were mainly considered responsible for increased exposed area and ocular surface impairment. Recent evidence demonstrated that ocular surface tissues are direct targets for autoantibodies in either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid states. A set of tear protein biomarkers were identified and shown to have high diagnostic performance. SummaryNew horizons can be displayed on the basis of these new findings, in particular, as referred earlier, Graves' ophthalmopathy diagnosis. A detailed slit-lamp examination and a careful medical history by validated questionnaires in patients with ocular surface discomfort symptoms are now recommended to investigate early manifestations of an underlying thyroid dysfunction. Ocular surface signs should also be included in professional guidelines. Autoantibody assays in tears and proteomic analysis of tear protein expression could be important further steps in early diagnosis and posttherapy control of thyroid dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSecretion of cytokines and expression of cytokine receptors have been reported in the orbital connective tissue in Graves' orbitopathy (GO). Lacrimal glands are putative autoimmune targets, and changes in tear film and ocular surface have also been described. Our aim was to characterize the cytokine profile of tears in patients with Graves' disease (GD) with and without orbitopathy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTear samples were collected from 54 eyes of GO patients (age 43.4\u00b115.2 years), 18 eyes of GD patients (age 46.8\u00b111.7 years), and 24 control eyes (age 38.6\u00b113.8 years). Patients underwent ophthalmological examination including Clinical Activity Score (CAS). The level of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted) as well as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured by multiplex bead array and release values were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, and RANTES were significantly higher in GO patients compared to controls (p<0.05). There was a 2.5-fold increase of IL-6 release. No significant differences were found in cytokine release between the GO and GD groups. In the GO group, significant positive correlation was found between CAS and the release of IL-6 and PAI-1 into tears (r=0.27, p<0.05 and r=0.24, p<0.05, respectively). PAI-1 release was significantly higher in GO than in GD patients and was increased in both the GD and GO groups compared to controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImpaired cytokine balance has been observed in tears of GO patients. Secretion of IL-6 into tears might be a useful indicator of disease activity in GO.",

        "title": "uPA binding to PAI-1 induces corneal myofibroblast differentiation on vitronectin.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nVitronectin (VN) in provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) promotes cell migration. Fibrotic ECM also includes VN and, paradoxically, strongly adherent myofibroblasts (Mfs). Because fibrotic Mfs secrete elevated amounts of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), we tested whether increased extracellular uPA promotes the persistence of Mfs on VN.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPrimary human corneal fibroblasts (HCFs) were cultured in supplemented serum-free medium on VN or collagen (CL) with 1 ng/mL transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21). Adherent cells were quantified using crystal violet. Protein expression was measured by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Transfection of short interfering RNAs was performed by nucleofection. Mfs were identified by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) stress fibers. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) levels were quantified by ELISA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTGF\u03b21-treated HCFs secreted PAI-1 (0.5 uM) that bound to VN, competing with \u03b1v\u03b23/\u03b1v\u03b25 integrin/VN binding, thus promoting cell detachment from VN. However, addition of uPA to cells on VN increased Mf differentiation (9.7-fold), cell-adhesion (2.2-fold), and binding by the VN integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and -\u03b25 (2.2-fold). Plasmin activity was not involved in promoting these changes, as treatment with the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin had no effect. A dominant negative PAI-1 mutant (PAI-1R) that binds to VN but does not inhibit uPA prevented the increase in uPA-stimulated cell adhesion and reduced uPA-stimulated integrin \u03b1v\u03b23/\u03b1v\u03b25 binding to VN by 73%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nuPA induction of TGF\u03b21-dependent Mf differentiation on VN supports the hypothesis that elevated secretion of uPA in fibrotic tissue may promote cell adhesion and the persistence of Mfs. By blocking uPA-stimulated cell adhesion, PAI-1R may be a useful agent in combating corneal scarring.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nOur previous study revealed the immunomodulatory property of the secreted lymphocyte antigen (Ly6)/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)-related protein-1 (SLURP1), abundantly expressed in the cornea and associated with the hyperkeratotic disorder Mal de Meleda. Here, we test the hypothesis that SLURP1 modulates the functions of membrane-tethered uPAR by acting as a soluble scavenger of its ligand urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nHuman corneal limbal epithelial (HCLE) and mouse corneal stromal fibroblast MK/T-1 cells were employed to examine the effect of SLURP1 on cell proliferation and migration. Human corneal limbal epithelial cell clones stably expressing SLURP1 under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were generated using lentiviral vectors. Recombinant 6\u00d7 His-mouse Slurp1 and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-mouse uPA were expressed in Escherichia coli and partially purified using nickel-ion and amylose columns, respectively. Slurp1 interaction with uPA was detected using ligand blots, ELISA, pull-down assays, and immunofluorescent staining.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStable expression of SLURP1 in HCLE cells was confirmed by immunoblots and immunofluorescent staining. Human corneal limbal epithelial and MK/T-1 cell proliferation and migration rates were suppressed by exogenous SLURP1. Ligand blots, ELISA, and pull-down assays indicated that Slurp1 efficiently interacts with uPA. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that exogenous SLURP1 decreased the amount of cell surface-bound uPA in the leading edges of migrating cells. In gap-filling assays, wild-type HCLE cells responded to uPA by increasing their velocity and closing larger area, while the SLURP1-expressing HCLE cells failed to do so.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSLURP1 modulates corneal homeostasis by serving as a soluble scavenger of uPA and regulating the uPA-dependent functions of uPAR.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAlthough secreted Ly6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-related protein-1 (Slurp1) transcript is highly abundant in the mouse cornea, corresponding protein expression remains uncharacterized. Also, SLURP1 was undetected in previous tear proteomics studies, resulting in ambiguity about its baseline levels. Here, we examine mouse corneal Slurp1 expression in different sexes, age groups, strains, and health conditions, and quantify SLURP1 in human tears from healthy or inflamed ocular surfaces.\n\n\nMETHODS\nExpression of Slurp1 in embryonic day-13 (E13), E16, postnatal day-1 (PN1), PN10, PN20, and PN70 Balb/C, FVBN, C57Bl/6, and DBA/2J mouse corneas, Klf4\u0394/\u0394CE corneas with corneal epithelial-specific ablation of Klf4, migrating cells in wild-type corneal epithelial wound edge, and in corneas exposed to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) poly(I:C), zymosan-A, or Pam3Csk4 was examined by QPCR, immunoblots, and immunofluorescent staining. Human SLURP1 levels were quantified by ELISA in tears from 34 men and women aged 18 to 80 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nExpression of Slurp1, comparable in different strains and sexes, was low in E13, E16, PN1, and PN10 mouse corneas, and increased rapidly after eyelid opening in a Klf4-dependent manner. We found Slurp1 was downregulated in corneas exposed to PAMPs, and in migrating cells at the wound edge. Human SLURP1 expression, comparable in different sexes and age groups, was significantly decreased in tears from inflamed ocular surfaces (0.34%) than those from healthy individuals (0.77%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data describe the influence of age, sex, genetic background, and ocular surface health on mouse corneal expression of Slurp1, establish the baseline for human tear SLURP1 expression, and identify SLURP1 as a useful diagnostic and/or therapeutic target for inflammatory ocular surface disorders.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To explore the impact of ocular surface insults on the immunomodulatory capacity and phenotype of corneal epithelial cells (CECs) with a focus on epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT). Methods Corneas were harvested from mice 6 days following scratch injury, ragweed pollen\u2013induced allergy, or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection and compared to healthy tissue controls. Corneas were enzymatically digested and CECs phenotypically characterized using flow cytometry. CECs were defined as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive CD45-negative cells. CECs were assessed by PCR to evaluate EMT-associated transcripts. Recombinant HSV-1 and transgenic mice were utilized to investigate the role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) on the phenotype observed. The immunomodulatory potential of CECs was assessed in coculture assays with ovalbumin-specific CD4 T cells. Results Ectopic expression of classic \u201cmyeloid\u201d antigens Ly6G, CCR2, and CX3CR1 was identified in CEC subsets from all groups with evidence supporting an underlying partial EMT event resulting from loss of cell\u2013cell contacts. Corneal HSV-1 infection induced Ly6C expression and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II upregulation in CECs through a VEGFA-linked mechanism. These Ly6C+ MHC-II+ CECs were found to function as amateur antigen-presenting cells and induced CD4 T cell proliferation in vitro. Conclusions This study characterizes a novel immunomodulatory CEC phenotype with possible implications for immune privilege, chronic inflammation, and tissue fibrosis. Moreover, the identification of CECs masquerading with multiple \u201cmyeloid\u201d antigens warrants careful evaluation of flow cytometry data involving corneal digests.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Corneal opacity and neovascularization (NV) are often described as outcomes of severe herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. The current study investigated the role of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)+ cells and soluble factors in the progression of HSV-1-induced corneal NV and opacity. Methods MaFIA mice were infected with 500 plaque-forming units of HSV-1 in the cornea following scarification. From day 10 to day 13 post-infection (pi), mice were treated with 40 \u00b5g/day of AP20187 (macrophage ablation) or vehicle intraperitoneally. For osteopontin (OPN) neutralization experiments, C57BL/6 mice were infected as above and treated with 2 \u00b5g of goat anti-mouse OPN or isotypic control IgG subconjunctivally every 2 days from day 4 to day 12 pi. Mice were euthanized on day 14 pi, and tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry to quantify NV and opacity by confocal microscopy and absorbance or detection of pro- and anti-angiogenic and inflammatory factors and cells by suspension array analysis and flow cytometry, respectively. Results In the absence of CSF1R+ cells, HSV-1-induced blood and lymphatic vessel growth was muted. These results correlated with a loss in fibroblast growth factor type 2 (FGF-2) and an increase in OPN expression in the infected cornea. However, a reduction in OPN expression in mice did not alter corneal NV but significantly reduced opacity. Conclusions Our data suggest that CSF1R+ cell depletion results in a significant reduction in HSV-1-induced corneal NV that correlates with the loss of FGF-2 expression. A reduction in OPN expression was aligned with a significant drop in opacity associated with reduced corneal collagen disruption.",

        "abstract": "Vaccines to viral pathogens in experimental animal models are often deemed successful if immunization enhances resistance of the host to virus challenge as measured by cumulative survival, reduction in virus replication and spread and/or lessen or eliminate overt tissue pathology. Furthermore, the duration of the protective response against challenge is another important consideration that drives a vaccination regimen. In the current study, we assessed the durability of two related vaccines, 0\u2206NLS and 0\u2206RING, against ocular herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) challenge in mice thirty days (short-term) and one year (long-term) following the vaccine boost. The short-term vaccine efficacy study found the 0\u2206RING vaccine to be nearly equivalent to the 0\u2206NLS vaccine in comparison to vehicle-vaccinated mice in terms of controlling virus replication and preserving the visual axis. By comparison, the long-term assessment of the two vaccines found notable differences and less efficacy overall as noted below. Specifically, the results show that in comparison to vehicle-vaccinated mice, the 0\u2206NLS and 0\u2206RING vaccinated groups were more resistant in terms of survival and virus shedding following ocular challenge. Moreover, 0\u2206NLS vaccinated mice also possessed significantly less infectious virus in the peripheral and central nervous systems but not the cornea compared to mice vaccinated with vehicle or 0\u2206RING which had similar levels. However, all vaccinated groups showed similar levels of blood and lymphatic vessel genesis into the central cornea 30 days post infection. Likewise, corneal opacity was also similar among all groups of vaccinated mice following infection. Functionally, the blink response and visual acuity were 25\u201350% lower in vaccinated mice 30 days post infection compared to measurements taken prior to infection. The results demonstrate a dichotomy between resistance to infection and functional performance of the visual axis that collectively show an overall loss in vaccine efficacy long-term in comparison to short-term studies in a conventional prime-boost protocol.",

        "abstract": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a critical role in the clearance for many viral pathogens including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Here, we compared the cellular innate and adaptive immune response in mice infected with an attenuated HSV-1 (0\u0394NLS) found to be a highly successful experimental prophylactic vaccine to parental HSV-1 virus. ABSTRACT Previous studies by our group identified a highly efficacious vaccine 0\u0394NLS (deficient in the nuclear localization signal of infected cell protein 0) against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in an experimental ocular mouse model. However, details regarding fundamental differences in the initial innate and adaptive host immune response were not explored. Here, we present a side-by-side analysis of the primary infection characterizing differences of the host immune response in mice infected with 0\u0394NLS versus the parental, GFP105. The results show that local viral infection and replication are controlled more efficiently in mice exposed to 0\u0394NLS versus GFP105 but that the clearance of infectious virus is equivalent when the two groups are compared. Moreover, the 0\u0394NLS-infected mice displayed enhanced effector CD8+ but not CD4+ T cell responses from the draining lymph nodes at day 7 postinfection measured by gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha production along with changes in cell metabolism. The increased effector function of CD8+ T cells from 0\u0394NLS-infected mice was not driven by changes in antigen presentation but lost in the absence of a functional type I IFN pathway. These results are further supported by enhanced local expression of type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes along with increased IL-12 production by CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of 0\u0394NLS-infected mice compared to the GFP105-infected animals. It was also noted the recall to HSV-1 antigen by CD8+ T cells was elevated in mice infected with HSV-1 0\u0394NLS compared to GFP105. Collectively, the results underscore the favorable qualities of HSV-1 0\u0394NLS as a candidate vaccine against HSV-1 infection. IMPORTANCE Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a critical role in the clearance for many viral pathogens including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Here, we compared the cellular innate and adaptive immune response in mice infected with an attenuated HSV-1 (0\u0394NLS) found to be a highly successful experimental prophylactic vaccine to parental HSV-1 virus. We found that CD8+ T cell effector function is elevated in 0\u0394NLS-infected mice through noncognate signals, including interleukin-12 and type I interferon pathways along with changes in CD8+ T cell metabolism, whereas other factors, including cell proliferation, costimulatory molecule expression, and antigen presentation, were dispensable. Thus, an increase in CTL activity established by exposure to HSV-1 0\u0394NLS in comparison to parental HSV-1 likely contributes to the efficacy of the vaccine and underscores the nature of the attenuated virus as a vaccine candidate for HSV-1 infection.",

        "abstract": "Ocular pathology is often associated with acute herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection of the cornea in mice. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of early T lymphocyte activation 1 protein or osteopontin (OPN) in corneal inflammation and host resistance to ocular HSV-1 infection. C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and osteopontin deficient (OPN KO) mice infected in the cornea with HSV-1 were evaluated for susceptibility to infection and cornea pathology. OPN KO mice were found to possess significantly more infectious virus in the cornea at day 3 and day 7 post infection compared to infected WT mice. Coupled with these findings, HSV-1-infected OPN KO mouse corneas were found to express less interferon (IFN)-\u03b11, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, and RNase L compared to infected WT animals early post infection that likely contributed to decreased resistance. Notably, OPN KO mice displayed significantly less corneal opacity and neovascularization compared to WT mice that paralleled a decrease in expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A within 12 hr post infection. The change in corneal pathology of the OPN KO mice aligned with a decrease in total leukocyte infiltration into the cornea and specifically, in neutrophils at day 3 post infection and in macrophage subpopulations including CCR2+CD115+CD206+ and CD115+CD183+CD206+ -expressing cells. The infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the cornea was unaltered comparing infected WT to OPN KO mice. Likewise, there was no difference in the total number of HSV-1-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells found in the draining lymph node with both sets functionally competent in response to virus antigen comparing WT to OPN KO mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate OPN deficiency directly influences the host innate immune response to ocular HSV-1 infection reducing some aspects of inflammation but at a cost with an increase in local HSV-1 replication.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are present in almost all solid tumor tissues. 16They play critical roles in immune regulation, tumor angiogenesis, tumor stem cell activation, tumor invasion and metastasis, and resistance to therapy. However, it is unclear how TAMs perform these functions. With the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it has become possible to identify TAM subpopulations associated with distinct functions. In this review, we discuss four novel TAM subpopulations in distinct solid tumors based on core gene signatures by scRNA-seq, including FCN1 +, SPP1 +, C1Q + and CCL18 + TAMs. Functional enrichment and gene expression in scRNA-seq data from different solid tumor tissues found that FCN1 + TAMs may induce inflammation; SPP1 + TAMs are potentially involved in metastasis, angiogenesis, and cancer cell stem cell activation, whereas C1Q + TAMs participate in immune regulation and suppression; And CCL18 + cells are terminal immunosuppressive macrophages that not only have a stronger immunosuppressive function but also enhance tumor metastasis. SPP1 + and C1Q + TAM subpopulations can be further divided into distinct populations with different functions. Meanwhile, we will also present emerging evidence highlighting the separating macrophage subpopulations associated with distinct functions. However, there exist the potential disconnects between cell types and subpopulations identified by scRNA-seq and their actual function.",
