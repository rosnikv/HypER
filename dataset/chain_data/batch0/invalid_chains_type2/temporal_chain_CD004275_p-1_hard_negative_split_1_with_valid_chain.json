        "title": "Acid peptic diseases: pharmacological approach to treatment",
        "abstract": "Acid peptic disorders are the result of distinctive, but overlapping pathogenic mechanisms leading to either excessive acid secretion or diminished mucosal defense. They are common entities present in daily clinical practice that, owing to their chronicity, represent a significant cost to healthcare. Key elements in the success of controlling these entities have been the development of potent and safe drugs based on physiological targets. The histamine-2 receptor antagonists revolutionized the treatment of acid peptic disorders owing to their safety and efficacy profile. The proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent a further therapeutic advance due to more potent inhibition of acid secretion. Ample data from clinical trials and observational experience have confirmed the utility of these agents in the treatment of acid peptic diseases, with differential efficacy and safety characteristics between and within drug classes. Paradigms in their speed and duration of action have underscored the need for new chemical entities that, from a single dose, would provide reliable duration of acid control, particularly at night. Moreover, PPIs reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs, reflecting untargeted physiopathologic pathways and a breach in the ability to sustain an intragastric pH of more than 4. This review provides an assessment of the current understanding of the physiology of acid production, a discussion of medications targeting gastric acid production and a review of efficacy in specific acid peptic diseases, as well as current challenges and future directions in the treatment of acid-mediated diseases.",

        "explanation": "This paper is a review of the pharmacological approach to treating acid peptic diseases, and it does not appear to have any direct connection to the source paper. It discusses the use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors in treating acid peptic disorders, but does not mention ranitidine, omeprazole, or systemic sclerosis, which are the key components of the source paper."

        "abstract": "Aims: To evaluate the symptomatic efficacy and safety of Lafaxid!\" (lafutidine 10 mg) in Indian patients with Acid Peptic disorder (APD). Study Design: An observational, prospective, uncontrolled, open -label multi-centric study. Place and Duration of Study:Patients were recruited from 12 cities across India by 61 investigators, between October 2010 and December 2011. Methodology: We included 1500 patients(973 men, 527 women; age range 15-85 years) with Acid Peptic disorder. Lafutidine (10 mg tablets) was prescribed by the physicians as once daily dose (OD) for 28 days. The efficacy was analysed based on the change in the symptom baseline score on the 100 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for individual symptoms, and the safety was determined based on adverse events reported during the study with the prescribed usage of lafutidine on day 14 and day 28 after start of the treatment. Results:Lafutidine monotherapywas given to 1378 patients. A very high reduction in the mean VAS score was observed from baseline for individual symptoms, viz. nausea,",
