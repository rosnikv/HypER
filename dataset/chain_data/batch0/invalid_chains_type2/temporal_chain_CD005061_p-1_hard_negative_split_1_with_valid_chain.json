        "title": "Mulberry leaf extract reduces postprandial hyperglycemia with few side effects by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase in normal rats.",
        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf extract (MLE) was investigated as a potent plant-derived \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor with low \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. MLE was prepared by heating in an autoclave at 121 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, and its in vitro and in vivo antihyperglycemic activities were investigated. The adverse side effects of MLE were analyzed by measuring the weight and volume of the cecum, stool color, starch content in the cecum, and the integrity of intestinal transporting capacity. The in vitro inhibitory activity of MLE on intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase was potent and that on intestinal \u03b1-amylase was very weak compared with acarbose. Sugar loading tests with starch, maltose, and sucrose showed that MLE may reduce postprandial increases in blood glucose by acting as an intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Feeding tests suggested that MLE may exhibit fewer adverse side effects than other \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, such as abdominal flatulence and meteorism, which are attributed to the impaired digestion of starch by strong inhibition of intestinal \u03b1-amylase. These results suggest that MLE could be used in the development of pharmaceutical foods to control the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients by inhibiting intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase with reduced side effects.",

        "title": "Comparison of inhibitory activities and mechanisms of five mulberry plant bioactive components against \u03b1-glucosidase.",
        "abstract": "The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of five bioactive components, namely 1-deoxynojirimycin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol contained in mulberry (Morus, Moraceae) plants have been compared. Spectroscopy methods were employed to compare their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory mechanisms. The results revealed that 1-deoxynojirimycin (competitive), resveratrol and oxyresveratrol (noncompetitive) were stronger inhibitors than acarbose, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (mix competitive and noncompetitive) showed modest activities. 1-Deoxynojirimycin, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol could quench the fluorescence spectra statically by forming stable complexes, while the quenching of cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside belonged to dynamic quenching by the collision of molecules. The interactions between ligands and \u03b1-glucosidase were mainly driven by hydrophobic force, or hydrogen bonding consequently induced conformational changes and reduced surface hydrophobicity. Docking results suggested that they could bind to \u03b1-glucosidase at different sites. This work provides useful information for the understanding of the ligands-\u03b1-glucosidase interactions and identifies oxyresveratrol as a potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nMulberry (genus Morus) is a significant source of polyphenols, which can promote positive effects on human health. China has various mulberry cultivars, however, many Chinese mulberry cultivars have been only minimally studied. To solve this lack of research, 8 mulberry cultivars (Da10, Tang10, Yueshen74, Yuefenshen, Longsang, Ningxia1hao, Taiwanguosang, and Baiyuwang) from 4 regions of China were assessed to determine their polyphenol profiles using HPLC-MS/MS and then tested for their antioxidant and anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activities in vitro. A total of 18 nonanthocyanins and 4 anthocyanins were quantified in mulberry cultivars; among these polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside were confirmed as the major phenolic acid, flavonol derivative, and anthocyanin, respectively. Two types of stilbene compounds, piceid, and piceatannol, were detected for the 1st time in all mulberry cultivars. Moreover, the methanolic extracts of different mulberry cultivars showed disparate antioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities, and this discrepancy was mainly attributed to varying the anthocyanin content. Based on our results, Taiwanguosang is proposed to be a good candidate suitable for further process due to its high level of anthocyanins.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION\nThe polyphenols of mulberry cultivars are vital for human health and are relevant to the further development of mulberry-based products. China has a wide range of mulberry cultivar resources, and many of these cultivars have not yet been studied. Our research concentrated on the polyphenol profiles, antioxidant, and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities of various mulberry cultivars from different regions of China to provide basic information for mulberry cultivar selection and mulberry-based food production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The compositions of phenolic compounds in 10 cultivars of two mulberry species (Morus atropurpurea Roxb. and Morus alba Linn.) grown in four regions of China were analysed using HPLC-TOF-MS. Results showed that a total of 27 phenolic compounds were identified in these mulberry cultivars. The Taiwan cultivar from the Jiangsu region showed the highest concentration of hydroxycinnamic acids, quercetin derivatives, and anthocyanins. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that six mulberry cultivars grown in the region of Jiangsu, Ningxia, and Guangdong were differentiated regarding their species feature and regional characteristics. Cyanidin rhamnosylglucoside, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, dihydroquercetin, and quercetin were further screened out to be the key compounds for the differentiation of these cultivars. The correlation between the regional climate feature (including rainfall, humidity, and temperature) and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in these mulberry cultivars was established.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the Chemical Composition and Antioxidant Activity of Mulberry (Morus alba L.) Fruits from Different Varieties in China",
        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) fruit is a fruit with nutritional and medicinal value. It is widely cultivated in different regions of China, which may result in differences in its chemical composition. In this research, 25 mulberry fruit samples from six provinces in China were investigated. The contents of anthocyanins were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of two main anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (C3R), ranged from 0.656 \u00b1 0.006 mg/g to 4.367 \u00b1 0.243 mg/g and from 0.226 \u00b1 0.007 mg/g to 1.649 \u00b1 0.013 mg/g, respectively. Additionally, the contents of total phenolic, total flavonoid, vitamin C, titratable acids, reducing sugars and antioxidant capacity (FRAP, DPPH, scavenging and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity) were also assessed. The results and principal component analysis showed that the Zhongsang 5801 variety from Sichuan, Dechang had the greatest health value with the highest active compound contents. Based on our analysis, the variety from Sichuan, Dechang is a high-quality plant source for mulberry fruit cultivation. This research provides a basis for the rational development and utilization of mulberry fruit resources in China.",

        "abstract": "Drought stress often leads to heavy losses in mulberry planting, especially for fruits and leaves. Application of plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPF) endows various plant beneficial traits to overcome adverse environmental conditions, but little is known about the effects on mulberry under drought stress. In the present study, we isolated 64 fungi from well-growing mulberry trees surviving periodical drought stress, and Talaromyces sp. GS1, Pseudeurotium sp. GRs12, Penicillium sp. GR19, and Trichoderma sp. GR21 were screened out due to their strong potential in plant growth promotion. Co-cultivation assay revealed that PGPF stimulated mulberry growth, exhibiting increased biomass and length of stems and roots. Exogenous application of PGPF could alter fungal community structures in the rhizosphere soils, wherein Talaromyces was obviously enhanced after inoculation of Talaromyces sp. GS1, and Peziza was increased in the other treatments. Moreover, PGPF could promote iron and phosphorus absorption of mulberry as well. Additionally, the mixed suspensions of PGPF induced the production of catalase, soluble sugar, and chlorophyll, which in turn enhanced the drought tolerance of mulberry and accelerated their growth recovery after drought. Collectively, these findings might provide new insights into improving mulberry drought tolerance and further boosting mulberry fruit yields by exploiting interactions between hosts and PGPF.",
