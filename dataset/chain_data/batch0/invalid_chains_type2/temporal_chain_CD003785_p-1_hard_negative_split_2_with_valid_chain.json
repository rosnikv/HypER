        "title": "Certolizumab pegol plus methotrexate is significantly more effective than placebo plus methotrexate in active rheumatoid arthritis: findings of a fifty-two-week, phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 dosage regimens of lyophilized certolizumab pegol (a novel PEGylated anti-tumor necrosis factor agent) as adjunctive therapy to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an inadequate response to MTX therapy alone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this 52-week, phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 982 patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive treatment with subcutaneous certolizumab pegol at an initial dosage of 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2, and 4, with a subsequent dosage of 200 mg or 400 mg given every 2 weeks, plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX. Co-primary end points were the response rate at week 24 according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% criteria for improvement (ACR20) and the mean change from baseline in the modified total Sharp score at week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 24, ACR20 response rates using nonresponder imputation for the certolizumab pegol 200-mg and 400-mg groups were 58.8% and 60.8%, respectively, as compared with 13.6% for the placebo group. Differences in ACR20 response rates versus placebo were significant at week 1 and were sustained to week 52 (P < 0.001). At week 52, mean radiographic progression from baseline was reduced in patients treated with certolizumab pegol 200 mg (0.4 Sharp units) or 400 mg (0.2 Sharp units) as compared with that in placebo-treated patients (2.8 Sharp units) (P < 0.001 by rank analysis). Improvements in all ACR core set of disease activity measures, including physical function, were observed by week 1 with both certolizumab pegol dosage regimens. Most adverse events were mild or moderate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with certolizumab pegol 200 or 400 mg plus MTX resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in RA signs and symptoms, inhibited the progression of structural joint damage, and improved physical function as compared with placebo plus MTX treatment in RA patients with an incomplete response to MTX.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates certolizumab pegol in combination with methotrexate, which is similar to the source paper's investigation of infliximab with methotrexate. The paper's findings are partially dependent on the understanding of TNF\u03b1 inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis, which includes the source paper's topic."

        "title": "The importance of the patients' experience of RA compared with clinical measures of disease activity.",
        "abstract": "Improvements in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment have led to an increased focus on specialized and validated outcome measures, resulting in a decrease in the use of subjective assessments such as patient perceptions. However, to achieve optimal outcomes in the treatment of RA, there is a need to balance clinical goals with those that may be more important to patients. Although the treatment goals of physicians and patients are generally aligned, the framework in which these goals are expressed differs widely, and there are pronounced differences in how patients and physicians view their interactions regarding the decision-making process about treatment and information sharing. Detailed discussion between the physician and the patient regarding the patient's perspectives can lead to valuable insights into the patient's unmet needs from treatment as well as enhancement of the physician-patient relationship and an overall improvement in patients' quality of life.",

        "title": "Valuation of quality of life in rheumatoid arthritis",
        "abstract": "The increased use of patient-reported outcome measures in health care, including measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), warrant the evaluation of the psychometric properties of these instruments. HRQoL instruments are frequently carried out within an economic analysis of health technologies. For this purpose, HRQoL instruments that measure valuations of health states (\u2018utilities\u2019) from a societal perspective are preferred, such as the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and the Short Form-6D (SF-6D). Although research has addressed the psychometric performance of these instruments, further research is required into the responsiveness of these instruments to improvements in patients\u2019 health. In this thesis, both the responsiveness of the EQ-5D and that of the SF-6D in RA patients with active disease treated with effective TNF-blockers were only moderate over a one-year period. \nLess research has been carried out into the psychometric properties of instruments, such as Time Trade-Off (TTO) and Standard Gamble (SG), which measure utilities from a patient perspective. Existing research in RA shows poor psychometric properties. Because patients have a unique and full knowledge of, and experience with, their own health condition and are directly affected by interventions, we believe that it is important to obtain patients\u2019 valuations. In this thesis, both the interview and computer TTO were poorly correlated with, and were poorly discriminative for, self-reported health outcome measures. The TTO asks patients about the number of life years they are willing to trade off, i.e. to die earlier, in return for perfect health. It is assumed that the more life years they are willing to trade off, the worse their health state is. An important explanation for the poor construct validity could be the fact that RA patients are less willing to trade any of their life years because they do not perceive their disease as life-threatening. Possibly, there are more realistic health-related anchors for RA patients. A qualitative and quantitative study of RA patients in this thesis showed that the scenario \u2018being dependent on others\u2019 was the most appropriate worst-case alternative. \nThis thesis has given suggestions to improve the measurement of HRQoL representing the patient perspective and the societal perspective.",
