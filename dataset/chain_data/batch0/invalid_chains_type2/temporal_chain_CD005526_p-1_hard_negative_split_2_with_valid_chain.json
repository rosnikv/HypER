        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUrsodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) therapy leads to major improvements in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The benefit of long-term treatment is uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 145 patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis to receive ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (72 patients) or placebo (73 patients). After two years of follow-up, because of the benefit from ursodiol, all patients completing the study received ursodiol in an open trial and were monitored for two more years. The end points in the assessment of efficacy were as follows: progression of disease, as defined by the presence of hyperbilirubinemia, variceal bleeding, ascites, or encephalopathy; liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure; and liver transplantation (or a referral) or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDisease progressed significantly less frequently in the ursodiol group than in the placebo group (P < 0.002; relative risk, 0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.63). The probability of liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure and the probability of transplantation or death were significantly lower in the group assigned to ursodiol than in the group assigned to placebo (for transplantation alone, P = 0.003; relative risk, 0.21; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.66; for transplantation or death, P = 0.005; relative risk, 0.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.74). High bilirubin levels and, to a lesser extent, signs of cirrhosis at entry into the trial were predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or a referral, and transplantation or death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term ursodiol therapy slows the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis and reduces the need for liver transplantation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) requires invasive procedures such as liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). Sonographic measurement of fasting gall bladder volume, which has been reported to be enlarged in PSC, could serve as a non-invasive screening test. METHODS: Fasting gall bladder volume was studied in patients with PSC (n = 24), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 13), liver cirrhosis due to other causes (n = 18), ulcerative colitis (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 23). Meal induced gall bladder emptying was studied in patients with PSC, patients with PBC, and healthy controls. RESULTS: In patients with PSC gall bladder volume was greatly enlarged (72.9 (SEM 3.7) ml) compared with healthy controls (25.4 (1.7) ml, and patients with PBC (30.9 (2.7) ml), liver cirrhosis (31.3 (4.0) ml) or ulcerative colitis (25.8 (2.0) ml) (p < 0.0005 v all). In four patients with PSC the gall bladder wall was irregularly thickened (> 4 mm) as previously described in PSC. Postprandial residual fractions (% of fasting volume) were comparable between patients with PSC (17.5 (3.7)%) and those with PBC (23.6 (7.1%) and healthy controls (12.7 (2.3)%) Although gall bladder emptying seems normal, increased biliary pressure in patients with PSC cannot be excluded. CONCLUSION: Apart from wall thickening, patients with PSC often present with enlargement of the gall bladder. Sonographic determination of fasting gall bladder volume may be a useful, non-invasive, and easy to perform tool in the evaluation of patients suspected of having PSC.",

        "abstract": "Differentiating primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) from cholangiocarcinoma (CC) can be a diagnostic challenge with major therapeutic implications. In case of advanced or symptomatic PSC, liver transplantation (OLTx) can be life saving with excellent long-term outcome. However, the outcome of CC diagnosed prior or during OLTx is dismal. PSC is a premalignant condition associated with a risk of developing cholangio- or hepatocellular carcinoma in > 15% of patients. Imaging diagnoses should be integrated into the further clinical data. It is the sudden, rapid and irreversible deterioration of the patient's condition, and the rapid progression of cholangiographic abnormalities, which may strongly point towards a malignancy or a malignant evolution in case of PSC. Brush cytology, (guided) biopsy, and tumor markers such as Ca 19.9 and CEA levels can be of some help, but confirmation of malignancy is often associated with a poor outcome and exclusion from liver transplantation. Clinical deterioration of the PSC patient and signs indicating advanced liver damage are a justification to evaluate patients for liver transplantation. Early transplantation should be considered in appropriate patients.",

Brush cytology and serum tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [CA19-9]) have been used to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma, but there are few data comparing their effectiveness.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effectiveness of brush cytology, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma was retrospectively studied by review of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Receiver operator curves were used to identify cutoff points for carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 692 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis screened, adequate follow-up was obtained in 333, 44 (13%) of whom had a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Three hundred eighteen brush cytology specimens were obtained in 151 patients; serum carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 levels were obtained in 144 and 55 patients, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity of brush cytology were, respectively, 46.4% (95% CI [27.5, 64.5]) and 100% (95% CI [97.2, 100]). A carcinoembryonic antigen >5.2 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 68.0% (95% CI [47.5, 83.9]) and specificity of 81.5% (95% CI [73.9, 87.7]). A CA19-9 >180 U/mL had a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI [34.9, 87.7]) and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI [88.2, 99.9]). In the subset of patients in which all 3 tests were obtained, (n = 45, cholangiocarcinoma = 8) the combination of an abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19-9 had the highest sensitivity: 100% (95% CI [65.1, 100.0]) with a specificity of 78.4% (95% CI [63.1, 89.7]). The combination of a positive brush cytology or an abnormal CA19-9 had a sensitivity and specificity of, respectively, 87.5% (95% CI [50.0, 99.4]) and 97.3% (95% CI [86.2, 99.9]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nScreening patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis for cholangiocarcinoma with CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen is reasonable, but the ideal intervals at which to obtain these tests and the cost-effectiveness require further study.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nThe diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma is often difficult, making management approaches problematic. A reliable serum marker for cholangiocarcinoma would be a useful diagnostic test. The aims of our study were to evaluate the usefulness of a serum CA19-9 determination in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe prospectively measured serum CA19-9 and CEA concentrations in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (n=35), benign biliary diseases (n=92), and healthy individuals (n=15). Serum CA19-9 and CEA concentrations were measured by an immunoradiometric assay without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe sensitivity of a CA19-9 value >37 KU/L(-1) and a CEA value >22 microg/L(-1) in diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma were 77.14% and 68.57%, respectively. When compared with the benign biliary diseases group, the true negative rates of serum CA19-9 and CEA were 84.78% and 81.52%, respectively. The false positive rates of serum CA19-9 and CEA were 15.22% and 18.48%, whereas the accuracy of serum CA19-9 and CEA were 82.68% and 77.95%, respectively. Serum CA19-9 and CEA concentrations were significantly elevated (P<0.001 and P<0.05) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (290.31+/-5.34 KU/L(-1) and 36.46+/-18.03 microg/L(-1)) compared with patients with benign biliary diseases (13.38+/-2.59 KU/L(-1) and 13.84+/-3.85 microg/L(-1)) and healthy individuals (12.78+/-3.69 KU/L(-1) and 11.48+/-3.37 microg/L(-1)). In 15 patients undergoing curative resection of cholangiocarcinoma, the mean serum CA19-9 concentration was decreased from a preoperative level of 286.41+/-4.36 KU/L(-1) to a postoperative level of 62.01+/-17.43 KU/L(-1) (P<0.001), and the mean serum CEA concentration from 39.41+/-24.35 microg/L(-1) to 28.69+/-11.03 microg/L(-1) (P<0.05). In patients with cholangiocarcinoma, however, no correlation was found between serum CEA and CA19-9 concentrations (r=0.036).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data suggest that the serum CA19-9 determination is a useful addition to the available tests for the differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Serum CA19-9 is an effective tumor marker in diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma, deciding whether the tumor has been radically resected and monitoring effect of treatment.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nHigh levels of serum sialyl Lewis(a) (sLea) are frequently found in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients and have been suggested to be a serum marker for CCA. However, the significance of this antigen in CCA is unknown. In this study, the clinical significance of sLea expression in CCA tissues and the possible role of sLea in vascular invasion in vitro were elucidated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nExpression of sLea in tumor tissues of 77 patients with mass-forming CCA and 33 with periductal infiltrating CCA was determined using immunohistochemistry. The in vitro assays on adhesion and transmigration of CCA cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells were compared between CCA cell lines with and without sLea expression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nsLea was aberrantly expressed in 60% of CCA tumor tissues. A significant relationship was found between the frequency of sLea expression and the mass-forming type CCA (P = 0.041), well differentiated histological grading (P = 0.029), and vascular invasion (P = 0.030). Patients with positive sLea expression had a significantly poorer prognosis (21.28 wk, 95% CI = 16.75-25.81 wk) than those negative for sLea (37.30 wk, 95% CI = 27.03-47.57 wk) (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis with adjustment for all covariates showed that patients positive for sLea possessed a 2.3-fold higher risk of death than patients negative for sLea (P<0.001). The role of sLea in vascular invasion was demonstrated using in vitro adhesion and transmigration assays. KKU-M213, a human CCA cell-line with a high expression of sLea, adhered and transmigrated to IL-1beta-activated endothelial cells of the human umbilical vein more than KKU-100, the line without sLea expression (P<0.001). These processes were significantly diminished when the antibodies specific to either sLea or E-selectin were added to the assays (P<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study demonstrates the clinical significance of sLea expression in vascular invasion, and an unfavorable outcome in CCA. The role of sLea in vascular invasion which may lead to poor prognosis is supported by the in vitro adhesion and transmigration studies.",

        "title": "DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor Zebularine Induces Human Cholangiocarcinoma Cell Death through Alteration of DNA Methylation Status",
        "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a cancer arising from the neoplastic transformation of cholangiocytes. During tumorigenesis, tumor suppressor and cancer-related genes are commonly silenced by aberrant DNA methylation in their promoter regions. Zebularine (1-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one) acts as an inhibitor of DNA methylation and exhibits chemical stability and minimal cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explore the effect and possible mechanism of action of zebularine on CCA cells. We demonstrate that zebularine exerts an antitumor effect on CCA cells. Zebularine treatment decreased the concentrations of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins, and DNMT1 knockdown led to apoptotic cell death in the CCA cell lines TFK-1 and HuCCT1. DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that zebularine induced DNA demethylation, and the GO Biological Process terms \u201chemophilic cell adhesion\u201d, \u201cregulation of transcription, DNA-dependent\u201d and \u201cWnt signaling pathway\u201d were found to be significantly enriched in association with demethylated genes. Furthermore, we observed that zebularine treatment decreased \u03b2-catenin protein levels in TFK-1 and HuCCT1 cells. These results suggest that zebularine alters DNA methylation status, and that some aspect of DNA demethylation by zebularine induces suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway, which leads to apoptotic cell death in CCA. We previously reported a novel mechanism of zebularine-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma via a DNA methylation-independent pathway. Together, our present and previous studies indicate that zebularine could function as both a DNMT inhibitor and a non-DNMT inhibitor reagent, and that, while the optimal usage of zebularine may depend on cancer type, zebularine may be useful for chemotherapy against cancer.",

        "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma is an epithelial malignancy arising in the region between the intrahepatic bile ducts and the ampulla of Vater at the distal end of the common bile duct. The effect of current chemotherapy regimens against cholangiocarcinoma is limited, and the prognosis of patients with cholangiocarcinoma is poor. Aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification induce silencing of tumor suppressor genes and chromosomal instability during carcinogenesis. Studies have shown that the tumor suppressor genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) including MLH1, p14, p16, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), miR-370 and miR-376c are frequently methylated in cholangiocarcinoma. Silencing of these tumor suppressor genes and miRNAs plays critical roles in the initiation and progression of cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation inhibitors induce expression of endogenous retroviruses and exert the anti-tumor effect of via an anti-viral immune response. Aberrant DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes and miRNAs could be a powerful biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Epigenetic therapy with DNA methylation inhibitors holds considerable promise for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma through the reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and miRNAs as well as the induction of an anti-viral immune response.",

        "abstract": "Terahertz radiation has significant potential in medical diagnosis and treatment because its frequency range corresponds to the characteristic energy of biomolecular motion. Advantageously, terahertz-specific low energy does not cause the ionization of biomolecules. In this paper, we review several state-of-the-art terahertz biomedical techniques and results and suggest potential techniques that may be applicable in real-world clinics in the near future. First, some techniques for enhancing the penetration depth into wet biological tissues are surveyed. Endoscopy and otoscopy methods for approaching internal organs are then discussed. The operation principles of sensors utilizing terahertz radiation are explained, and certain sensing examples related to blood disorders, diabetes, and breathing conditions are presented. The greatest potential of terahertz radiation in biomedical applications so far has been in cancer imaging, because terahertz radiation is ideal for measuring the superficial soft tissues in which most cancers occur. The examples presented herein include skin, oral, gastric, breast, and brain cancers. In search of a cancer-specific signal using terahertz radiation, methylated malignant DNA has been found to exhibit a characteristic resonance at approximately 1.65\u2009THz. This resonance may help treat cancer through the demethylation of malignant DNA using high-power terahertz irradiation at this specific frequency, as well as serving as a potential cancer biomarker.",

We report our design of a pair of aspheric focusing lenses using a commercially available lens-design software that resulted in about 200 \u00d7 200-\u03bcm2 focal spot size corresponding to the 1-THz frequency. The lenses are made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) obtained using a lathe fabrication and are integrated into a THz-TDS system that includes low-temperature GaAs photoconductive antennae as both a THz emitter and detector. The system is used to generate high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D) images of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded murine pancreas tissue blocks. The performance of these focusing lenses is compared to the older system based on a pair of short-focal-length, hemispherical polytetrafluoroethylene (TeflonTM) lenses and is characterized using THz-domain measurements, resulting in 2D maps of the tissue refractive index and absorption coefficient as imaging markers. For a quantitative evaluation of the lens effect on the image resolution, we formulated a lateral resolution parameter, R2080, defined as the distance required for a 20\u201380% transition of the imaging marker from the bare paraffin region to the tissue region in the same image frame. The R2080 parameter clearly demonstrates the advantage of the HDPE lenses over TeflonTM lenses. The lens-design approach presented here can be successfully implemented in other THz-TDS setups with known THz emitter and detector specifications.",
