        "title": "Effect of exercise and Cimicifuga racemosa (CR BNO 1055) on bone mineral density, 10-year coronary heart disease risk, and menopausal complaints: the randomized controlled Training and Cimicifuga racemosa Erlangen (TRACE) study",
        "abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the effect of periodized exercise training with and without Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in early postmenopausal women. Methods:A total of 128 women were randomly assigned to three subgroups: exercise (EG, n = 43), exercise and CR supplementation (EGCR, n = 43), and wellness control (control group [CG], n = 42). Both exercise groups performed a periodized exercise program with high-intensity-resistance/high-impact exercise dedicated to bone parameters interspersed by blocks of 10 weeks of training focusing on CHD parameters. In addition to the exercise program, the EGCR was supplemented with 40 mg/day of CR according to the specification of the manufacturer. A low-intensity exercise program of 60 minutes per week for a period of 10 weeks interspersed with 10-week blocks without exercise was performed in the CG. Primary endpoints were BMD and 10-year CHD risk proposed by Wilson. Secondary endpoints were body composition and menopausal symptoms. Results:BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained in both exercise groups (EG, \u22120.1% \u00b1 2.2%, P = 0.74; EGCR, \u22120.4% \u00b1 2.4%, P = 0.40) and significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the CG (2.0% \u00b1 2.0%). Both exercise groups significantly differed from the CG (P = 0.001 and 0.005 for the EG and EGCR, respectively); however, no differences between the exercise groups with and without CR was determined. Although slight increases in femoral neck BMD were determined in both exercise groups (EG, 0.5% \u00b1 3.0%, P = 0.36; EGCR, 0.4% \u00b1 3.1%, P = 0.52), a reduction was assessed in the CG (\u22120.6% \u00b1 2.7%, P = 0.29). No significant differences were determined between the groups. The 10-year CHD risk significantly increased in the EGCR (12.9% \u00b1 25.1%, P = 0.018) and in the CG (16.5% \u00b1 27.8%, P = 0.007). The EG did not show corresponding changes (\u22122.7% \u00b1 21.9%, P = 0.60). However, no significant between-group differences were observed. Conclusions:In conclusion our exercise program favorably affected bone, menopausal symptoms, lean body mass, and, to a smaller extent, 10-year CHD risk in early postmenopausal women. Adjuvant supplementation of CR did not enhance these positive effects.",

        "title": "Exercise and osteoporosis-related fractures: perspectives and recommendations of the sports and exercise scientist.",
        "abstract": "Osteoporosis-related fractures represent a major health concern, particularly in elderly populations. Direct and indirect costs (amounting to nearly $17 billion in 2005), increased morbidity, and loss of independence place substantial burden on the health care system. Observational studies have shown that a physically active lifestyle is associated with a 30% to 50% decrease in vertebral or hip fractures, and a recent meta-analysis that determined the effects of exercise on fracture incidence further confirmed these results. However, because no randomized controlled exercise trials have selected fractures as a primary endpoint, causality between a sedentary lifestyle and fractures may be potentially confounded by participants' poor health status. With regard to fall reduction and bone strength as the main surrogates for fracture risk, many randomized controlled trials and corresponding meta-analyses have reported significant positive outcomes. Interestingly, no study that has assessed fall-related injuries has focused specifically on interventions that aimed to reduce fall impact. There is ongoing debate as to which factor, osteoporosis or falls, is more important for fracture prevention. This may be dependent on the region prone to fracture and the subjects' health status. In randomized controlled trials on exercise, the type, mode, and composition of exercise parameters are predictors of study outcome. Unfortunately, many exercise trials on fall prevention have not adequately described the exercise protocol used, which makes it difficult to determine which fall prevention protocol was most effective. A recent meta-analysis recommended Tai Chi and/or a mix of balance and resistance exercises for fall prevention. More sophisticated protocols are required to impact bone strength. Corresponding state-of-the-art protocols have focused on periodized high-impact/high-intensity resistance protocols performed at least twice per week. In the frail elderly, high-frequency/high-cycle number exercise programs with low-to-moderate strain intensity may also positively affect bone strength.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the long\u2010term dose\u2013response relationship of exercise frequency on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in early post\u2010menopausal women with osteopenia. Based on the 12\u2010year results of the consequently supervised exercise group (EG) of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study, we retrospectively structured two exercise groups according to the overall exercise frequency. Changes in aBMD at lumbar spine and proximal femur as assessed by dual\u2010energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry technique were compared between a low\u2010frequency exercise group (LEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200916) with 1.5\u2013<2 sessions/week and a high\u2010frequency exercise group (HEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200925) with \u22652\u20133.5 sessions/week. Changes in aBMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur were significantly more favorable in the HEF\u2010EG compared with the LEF\u2010EG; lumbar spine: (mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7% vs \u22124.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.001, ES: d'\u2009=\u20091.26; total hip: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs \u22126.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.045, ES: d'\u2009=\u20090.70). BMD results of the LEF\u2010EG did not significantly differ from the data of the non\u2010training control group (lumbar spine: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2%, total hip: \u22126.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0%). Although this result might not be generalizable across all exercise types and cohorts, it indicates that to impact bone, an overall exercise frequency of at least 2 sessions/week may be crucial, even if exercise is applied with high intensity/impact.",

[Methods] Korean studies Information Service System (KISS) and PubMed were searched and 17 randomized control trials were selected. Changes in BMD of lumbar spine (LS), femur neck (FN), Ward\u2019s triangle (WT), and trochanter (Tro) were chosen as major outcomes. [Results] Exercise training increased BMD of LS, FN, WT, and Tro. According to the type of exercise training, combined exercise training (aerobic + resistance) showed improvements in BMD of LS, FN, WT, and Tro. However, aerobic exercise training alone and resistance exercise training alone showed inconsistent results. [Conclusion] Exercise training can improve the BMD of LS, FN, WT, and Tro in Korean postmenopausal women. The type of exercise training may be a crucial factor for maintaining or improving bone health of this population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Senior day care centers in Japan are the most commonly used insurance service for frail elderly people, and it is important to examine the factors that influence the use of walking aids at these centers. We aimed to investigate the factors affecting the use of walking aids by frail elderly patients in senior daycare centers. Methods: A total of 131 frail elderly people (mean age 82.7 \u00b1 6.4 years) formed our study population. They were divided into two groups: solo walking (n = 87) and walking aid (n = 44). Individuals with cognitive decline were excluded. All participants were assessed using Functional Independence Measure Motor (FIM-M) sub-scores. Grip strength, knee extension strength, the 10 s Chair Stand test for Frail elderly (Frail CS-10), Single Leg Standing (SLS), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests were measured and compared between the two groups. Results: The walking aid group scored significantly lower than the solo walking group for five items: FIM-M, knee extension muscle strength, Frail CS-10, SLS, and TUG (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that knee extension muscle strength was the only factor that affected the use or disuse of walking aids (p < 0.05). The cut-off value of the knee extensor muscle strength-to-weight ratio for walking alone was 28.5%. Conclusions: Knee extensor muscle strength was the most important factor in determining the use of a walking aid.",

        "abstract": "Mobility devices are crucial in enhancing activities and participation for individuals with mobility disability, particularly among the rapidly expanding population of older adults worldwide. This paper explores patterns of mobility device use among a nationally representative cohort of community\u2010dwelling older adults in the United States, using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) waves 1\u20139 (2011\u20132019). Our descriptive analysis focuses on the characteristics of incident mobility device use, its influencing factors, and related user experiences, aligning with the NHATS late\u2010life disability framework. Mobility devices were categorized into walking aids (WAs), wheeled and seated mobility devices (WSMDs), and mixed use of both. We identified 2,943 incidents of mobility device use among 2,591 participants, spanning 47,722 person\u2010years in community settings, yielding an incidence rate of 61.7 per 1,000 person\u2010years. Over half (51.3%) of mobility device use ended in 1 year, with WAs being the predominantly used (63.8%). About one\u2010third (30.5%) of these incidents involved a change in device combinations, with a notable shift towards WSMDs and mixed use over time. We found that older adults using WSMDs or changing their device combinations were in a more vulnerable state, while those using mixed devices or changing their device combinations experienced poorer user experiences. This study advocates for the implementation of rental and recycling programs, the involvement of NGOs and professional associations, and the adoption of flexible policies responding to the dynamic patterns of mobility device use among community\u2010dwelling older adults. It also recommends expanding services to better serve vulnerable subgroups.",
