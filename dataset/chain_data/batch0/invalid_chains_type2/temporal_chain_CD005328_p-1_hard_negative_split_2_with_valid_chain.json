This manuscript reviews the clinical use and scientific basis of intra-articular corticosteroid administration including catastrophic injury, articular cartilage degradation and the development of osteoarthritis (OA), as well as the timing of injection relative to racing.",

        "title": "Systemic or intrasynovial medication as singular or as combination treatment in horses with (peri-)synovial pain",
        "abstract": "Records of lame horses (2004\u20132007) with (peri-)synovial pain of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ, n = 53), digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS, n = 20), and distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ, n = 31) were evaluated (n = 104). Cases were grouped according to the following treatments: (1) systemic administration of NSAIDs (n = 40); (2) intrasynovial administration of glucocorticosteroids (n = 30); (3) combination treatment (n = 34). Outcome was defined as successful when the owner reported that the horse had returned to its previous level of performance within a period of up to six months after treatment. Statistical evaluation was performed using Fisher's Exact tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses at P < 0.05. Successful outcome was significantly higher for horses in treatment group 3 (19/34, 55.9 per cent, P = 0.021) than in treatment groups 1 (11/40, 27.5 per cent, OR 0.21, 95 per cent CI 0.06 to 0.71) and 2 (8/30, 26.6 per cent, OR 0.18, 95 per cent CI 0.06 to 0.56). A significant association was only found with regard to the affected synovial structure (P = 0.025); relative to the DIPJ, involvement of the MCPJ and DFTS was four to five times more likely to provide a successful outcome (OR 4.18 and 5.59, 95 per cent CI 1.24 to 14.08 and 1.42\u201322.22, respectively).",

However, the hypothesis in this paper is not directly inspired by or dependent on the source paper's findings."
