        "title": "Interventions to improve adherence to lipid-lowering medication.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLipid-lowering drugs are widely underused, despite strong evidence indicating they improve cardiovascular end points. Poor patient adherence to a medication regimen can affect the success of lipid-lowering treatment.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of interventions aimed at improving adherence to lipid-lowering drugs, focusing on measures of adherence and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to 3 February 2016, and clinical trials registers (ANZCTR and ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 27 July 2016. We applied no language restrictions.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe evaluated randomised controlled trials of adherence-enhancing interventions for lipid-lowering medication in adults in an ambulatory setting with a variety of measurable outcomes, such as adherence to treatment and changes to serum lipid levels. Two teams of review authors independently selected the studies.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nThree review authors extracted and assessed data, following criteria outlined by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADEPro.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nFor this updated review, we added 24 new studies meeting the eligibility criteria to the 11 studies from prior updates. We have therefore included 35 studies, randomising 925,171 participants. Seven studies including 11,204 individuals compared adherence rates of those in an intensification of a patient care intervention (e.g. electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, healthcare professional education of patients) versus usual care over the short term (six months or less), and were pooled in a meta-analysis. Participants in the intervention group had better adherence than those receiving usual care (odds ratio (OR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 2.88; 7 studies; 11,204 participants; moderate-quality evidence). A separate analysis also showed improvements in long-term adherence rates (more than six months) using intensification of care (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.91 to 4.29; 3 studies; 663 participants; high-quality evidence). Analyses of the effect on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels also showed a positive effect of intensified interventions over both short- and long-term follow-up. Over the short term, total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 17.15 mg/dL (95% CI 1.17 to 33.14; 4 studies; 430 participants; low-quality evidence) and LDL-cholesterol decreased by a mean of 19.51 mg/dL (95% CI 8.51 to 30.51; 3 studies; 333 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Over the long term (more than six months) total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 17.57 mg/dL (95% CI 14.95 to 20.19; 2 studies; 127 participants; high-quality evidence). Included studies did not report usable data for health outcome indications, adverse effects or costs/resource use, so we could not pool these outcomes. We assessed each included study for bias using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In general, the risk of bias assessment revealed a low risk of selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. There was unclear risk of bias relating to blinding for most studies.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence in our review demonstrates that intensification of patient care interventions improves short- and long-term medication adherence, as well as total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. Healthcare systems which can implement team-based intensification of patient care interventions may be successful in improving patient adherence rates to lipid-lowering medicines.",

        "abstract": "Objective Understanding the determinants of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control constitutes the basis of modelling interventions for optimal lipid control and prognosis. We aim to identify medical and psychosocial (study) factors associated with unfavourable LDL-C control in coronary patients. Methods A cross-sectional explorative study used logistic and linear regression analysis to investigate the association between study factors and LDL-C in 1095 patients, hospitalized with myocardial infarction and/or a coronary revascularization procedure. Data were collected from hospital records, a comprehensive self-report questionnaire, clinical examination and blood samples after 2\u201336 months follow-up. Results Fifty-seven per cent did not reach the LDL-C target of 1.8\u2009mmol/l at follow-up. Low socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors were not associated with failure to reach the LDL-C target. Statin specific side-effects (odds ratio 3.23), low statin adherence (odds ratio 3.07), coronary artery by-pass graft operation as index treatment (odds ratio 1.95),\u2009\u2265\u20091 coronary event prior to the index event (odds ratio 1.81), female gender (odds ratio 1.80), moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy (odds ratio 1.62) and eating fish\u2009<\u20093 times/week (odds ratio 1.56) were statistically significantly associated with failure to reach the LDL-C target, in adjusted analyses. Only side-effects (standardized \u03b2 0.180), low statin adherence (\u03b2 0.209) and moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy (\u03b2 0.228) were associated with LDL-C in continuous analyses. Conclusions Statin specific side-effects, low statin adherence and moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy were the major factors associated with unfavourable LDL-C control. Interventions to improve LDL-C should ensure adherence and prescription of sufficiently potent statins, and address side-effects appropriately.",

        "title": "Efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy beyond statins to prevent cardiovascular events: a meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Lipid-lowering therapy is a key cornerstone in secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease. Current guidelines suggest a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 70mg/dl or a reduction of at least 50% of baseline LDL-cholesterol for patients with cardiovascular disease manifestations. With statin therapy alone, a majority of patients miss these thresholds. Ezetimibe and pro-protein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are suggested as an additional treatment option. Large-scale outcome studies have been performed on different agents. We performed a meta-analysis of existing trials, evaluating how lipid-lowering therapy beyond statins impacts cardiovascular outcomes. This study was performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses (PRISMA) guidelines, in accordance with the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations and the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD 42018099610). We performed a systematic search using the Pubmed, Cochrane, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases for studies. We also reviewed scientific meetings and clinical trial registers (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Data published until 1 November 2018 were included. The search was specific and sensitive using medical subject headings terms and free text and considered studies published in the English language. Search terms used were \u2018ezetimibe\u2019 or \u2018evolocumab\u2019 or \u2018alirocumab\u2019 or \u2018bococizumab\u2019 and \u2018statin\u2019 and \u2018cardiovascular events\u2019. Only randomised controlled trials comparing ezetimibe or PCSK-9 inhibitors in addition to statin therapy versus statin therapy alone were included. At least one clinical outcome of interest within a follow-up of more than 6 months had to be reported. The primary endpoint of this meta-analysis was defined as a combination of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischaemic stroke and urgent coronary revascularisation. Data are expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. All statistical analyses were performed using Revman 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration). This initial search resulted in 450 citations. Of those, 198 articles were evaluated in full-text screening; 189 records were removed based on study design (nonrandomised studies or systematic review/metaanalyses), undesired outcomes and short follow-up duration (<6 months). Finally, nine trials enrolling 100,566 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The study characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The primary endpoint of this meta-analysis was reduced by 18% with a treatment with ezetimibe or a PCSK-9 inhibitor in addition to statins (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75\u20130.89, P< 0.0001, see Supplementary Figure 1). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial (I1\u20444 63%). In a sensitivity analysis, we stratified for trials with acute coronary syndrome as the inclusion criteria and for trials also including patients with stable angina pectoris. For trials including only acute coronary syndrome patients, the primary endpoint was reduced by 14% (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.91, P< 0.0001). For trials also including patients for other indications, the primary endpoint was reduced by 25% (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63\u20130.91, P1\u20444 0.03). For myocardial infarction, effect sizes were comparable as for the primary endpoint (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74\u20130.92, P1\u20444 0.0007, see Supplementary Figure 2(a)). For ischaemic stroke, the highest relative risk reduction of evaluated outcomes was observed with a 24% risk reduction by lipid-lowering therapy beyond statins (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68\u20130.84, P< 0.0001, see Supplementary Figure 2(b)). We observed no relevant",
