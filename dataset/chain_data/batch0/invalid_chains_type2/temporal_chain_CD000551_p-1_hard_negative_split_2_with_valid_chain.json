        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has any effect on the development of liver decompensation and on survival of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).METHODS:A total of 86 patients with compensated PBC were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (n = 43) or to remain untreated (controls, n = 43). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Mean follow-up was 7.3 \u00b1 3.0 yr in the UDCA and 8.1 \u00b1 3.1 yr in the control group. Fourteen control patients were crossed-over to UDCA therapy after a median of 3.5 yr (range 2\u20138 yr), at their own request.RESULTS:Liver decompensation developed in 41 patients (22 in the UDCA and 19 in the control group) and liver death or transplantation in 33 (19 in the UDCA and 14 in the control group) patients. There was no significant difference in the probability of development of liver decompensation, liver death, or transplantation (by log-rank test) between UDCA-treated and control patients, whether by an intention-to-treat or by treatment-as-received analysis.CONCLUSIONS:UDCA was not found to have any demonstrable effect on the long-term outcome of PBC and did not improve the survival of PBC patients.",

        "abstract": "Recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been described in liver transplant recipients. Type of immunosuppression has been reported to influence the frequency of recurrence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence and pattern of recurrent PBC in our liver transplant recipients and determine any association of immunosuppressive agents with its recurrence. Patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for PBC were identified from the University of Chicago Liver Transplant Database. Recurrent PBC was diagnosed based on specific pathological criteria. Of 46 patients who underwent OLT for PBC between 1984 and 2000, a total of 7 patients (15%) were diagnosed with recurrent PBC at a median of 78 months (range, 27 to 120 months) after OLT. Forty\u2010three percent of patients were administered cyclosporine, whereas 57% were administered tacrolimus before disease recurrence. Rates of recurrence were not different between patients maintained on cyclosporine therapy (16%) compared with those maintained on tacrolimus therapy (18%; P = 1.0). There also was no difference in frequency of rejection episodes or duration of corticosteroid therapy between those who did and did not have recurrent PBC. In conclusion, recurrent PBC developed in a small number of patients 2 years or longer after OLT. In our population, there was no difference in recurrence rates between those administered cyclosporine or tacrolimus for immunosuppression. (Liver Transpl 2003;9:733\u2010736.)",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only effective curative therapy for end\u2010stage primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Survival after OLT is excellent, although recent data have shown a recurrence rate of PBC of up to 32% after transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate the course after disease recurrence, particularly with regard to liver function and survival in a long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Between April 1989 and April 2003, 1553 liver transplantations were performed in 1415 patients at the Charit\u00e9, Virchow Clinic. Protocol liver biopsies were taken after one, three, five, seven, 10 and 13\u2003yr. One hundred (7%) patients suffered from histologically proven PBC. Primary immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (n=54) or tacrolimus (Tac) (n=46). Immediately after OLT, all patients received ursodeoxycholic acid. Corticosteroids were withdrawn three to six months after OLT. The median age of the 85 women and 15 men was 55\u2003yr (range 25\u201366\u2003yr). The median follow\u2010up after liver transplantation was 118 months (range 16\u2013187 months) and after recurrence 30 months (range 4\u201379 months). Actuarial patient survival after five, 10 and 15\u2003yr was 87, 84 and 82% respectively. Ten patients (10%) died after a median survival time of 32 months. Two of these patients developed organ dysfunction owing to recurrence of PBC. Histological recurrence was found in 14 patients (14%) after a median time of 61 months (range 36\u2013122 months). Patients with Tac immunosuppression developed PBC recurrence more often (p<0.05) and also earlier (p<0.05). Fifty\u2010seven patients developed an acute rejection and two patients a chronic rejection episode. Liver function did not alter within the first five\u2003yr after histologically proven PBC recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the investigated patients showed that the recipient's age and Tac immunosuppression were significant risk factors for PBC recurrence. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up of up to 15\u2003yr after liver transplantation, owing to PBC, in addition to maintenance of liver function, shows excellent organ and patient survival rates. Although protocol liver biopsies revealed histological recurrence in 14 (14%) patients, only two patients developed graft dysfunction. Tac\u2010treated patients showed more frequently and also earlier histologically proven PBC recurrence; however, in our population we could not observe an impact on graft dysfunction and patient's survival.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine the risk factors for de novo cancer after liver transplantation (LTx). Retrospective analyses were performed in 385 LTx patients who underwent transplantation between 1986 and 2007. In total, 50 (13.0%) recipients developed de novo malignancy. The cumulative incidence of de novo cancer at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years after LTx was 2.9% \u00b1 0.9%, 10.5% \u00b1 1.8%, 19.4% \u00b1 3.0%, and 33.6% \u00b1 6.8%, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio of malignancy in LTx patients compared to the general population was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.6\u20102.8). After excluding posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and skin cancer, patients with de novo cancer had a significantly lower survival rate compared to recipients who remained cancer\u2010free. The identified univariate risk factors for de novo cancer were cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment, time period of LTx, and recipient age. In multivariate analysis, only CsA treatment emerged as an independent risk factor for de novo cancer, which was attributed to more aggressive cancer types. A surprising finding was that CsA treatment specifically enhanced cancer risk in patients who underwent transplantation after 2004, when C2 monitoring (blood concentration at 2 hours postdose) was introduced. In addition, these patients showed a significantly lower acute rejection rate, which might reflect a more robust immunosuppressive status caused by the CsA\u2010C2 regimen. When age was considered, only patients \u226450 years had a higher cancer rate when treated with CsA compared to treatment with tacrolimus. Our data suggest that, compared to tacrolimus treatment, CsA treatment with C2 monitoring or in younger patients of \u226450 years is associated with a higher early de novo cancer risk after LTx.

Their usefulness in human liver transplantation, however, has not been addressed. The aim of this study was to investigate serum HDmiRs as markers of hepatic injury and rejection in liver transplantation. Serum samples from healthy controls and liver transplant recipients (n = 107) and peritransplant liver allograft biopsy samples (n = 45) were analyzed via the real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction quantification of HDmiRs (miR\u2010122, miR\u2010148a, and miR\u2010194). The expression of miR\u2010122 and miR\u2010148a in liver tissue was significantly reduced with prolonged graft warm ischemia times. Conversely, the serum levels of these HDmiRs were elevated in patients with liver injury and positively correlated with aminotransferase levels. HDmiRs appear to be very sensitive because patients with normal aminotransferase values (<50 IU/L) had 6\u2010 to 17\u2010fold higher HDmiR levels in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.005). During an episode of acute rejection, serum HDmiRs were elevated up to 20\u2010fold, and their levels appeared to rise earlier than aminotransferase levels. HDmiRs in serum were stable during repeated freezing and thawing. In conclusion, this study shows that liver injury is associated with the release of HDmiRs into the circulation.

        "abstract": "Background Acute rejection (AR) of an organ transplant is a life-threatening complication. Currently, there are few diagnostic biomarkers suitable for clinical application. We aim to determine the potential of plasma microRNAs as biomarkers for AR. Methods Using rat orthotopic liver transplantation model and microarrays, we compared the difference in the spectrum and levels of microRNAs in both plasma and grafts between AR rats and control. AR-related plasma microRNAs were selected and validated using real-time quantification polymerase chain reaction. Plasma from AR rats with or without tacrolimus treatment was used for microRNA dynamic monitoring. To clarify the origin of AR-related plasma microRNAs, drug-induced liver damage rat model were performed and in situ hybridization was used to detect and localize the specific microRNA in allografts. Results We found that plasma miR-122, miR-192, and miR-146a was significantly up-regulated when AR occur (fold change>2; P<0.05) and the elevation could be repressed by immunosuppression. In liver injury rat model, up-regulated plasma miR-122 (fold change=22.126; P=0.002) and miR-192 (fold change=8.833; P<0.001) rather than miR-146a (fold change=1.181; P=0.594) were observed. Further study demonstrated that miR-146a was up-regulated by sixfold in microvesicles isolated from AR plasma, whereas miR-122 and miR-192 showed no distinct change. In situ hybridization revealed that the portal areas of the AR graft were brimming with lymphocytes, which showed highly intense staining for miR-146a. Conclusions Our study provides the global fingerprint of plasma microRNAs in AR rats and suggests that plasma miR-122 and miR-192 reflect liver injury, whereas miR-146a may associate with cellular rejection.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the impact of a novel oxygenated perfusion approach on rejection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Background:Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) was designed to prevent graft failure after OLT. One of the mechanisms is downregulation of Kupffer cells (in situ macrophages). We, therefore, designed experiments to test the effects of HOPE on the immune response in an allogeneic rodent model of nonarterialized OLT. Methods:Livers from Lewis rats were transplanted into Brown Norway rats to induce liver rejection in untreated recipients within 4 weeks. Next, Brown Norway recipients were treated with tacrolimus (1 mg/kg), whereas in a third group, liver grafts from Lewis rats underwent HOPE or deoxygenated machine perfusion for 1 hour before implantation, but recipients received no immunosuppression. In a last step, low-dose tacrolimus treatment (0.3 mg/kg) was assessed with and without HOPE. Results:Allogeneic OLT without immunosuppression led to death within 3 weeks after nonarterialized OLT due to severe acute rejection. Full-dose tacrolimus prevented rejection, whereas low-dose tacrolimus led to graft fibrosis within 4 weeks. HOPE treatment without immunosuppression also protected from lethal rejection. The combination of low-dose tacrolimus and 1-hour HOPE resulted in 100% survival within 4 weeks without any signs of rejection. Conclusions:We demonstrate that allograft treatment by HOPE not only protects against preservation injury but also impressively downregulates the immune system, blunting the alloimmune response. Therefore, HOPE may offer many beneficial effects, not only to rescue marginal grafts but also by preventing rejection and the need for immunosuppression.",

Although (dual) hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion ([D]HOPE) resuscitates livers after cold storage, NMP enables assessment of hepatobiliary function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective clinical trial, nationwide declined livers were subjected to ex situ NMP (viability assessment phase), preceded by 1-hour DHOPE (resuscitation phase) and 1 hour of controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), using a perfusion fluid containing an hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. During the first 2.5\u200ahours of NMP, hepatobiliary viability was assessed, using predefined criteria: perfusate lactate <1.7 mmol/L, pH 7.35 to 7.45, bile production >10\u200amL, and bile pH >7.45. Livers meeting all criteria were accepted for transplantation. Primary endpoint was 3-month graft survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen livers underwent DHOPE-COR-NMP.

Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion of livers may reduce the incidence of biliary complications, but data from prospective, controlled studies are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who were undergoing transplantation of a liver obtained from a donor after circulatory death to receive that liver either after hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (machine-perfusion group) or after conventional static cold storage alone (control group). The primary end point was the incidence of nonanastomotic biliary strictures within 6 months after transplantation. Secondary end points included other graft-related and general complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 160 patients were enrolled, of whom 78 received a machine-perfused liver and 78 received a liver after static cold storage only (4 patients did not receive a liver in this trial). Nonanastomotic biliary strictures occurred in 6% of the patients in the machine-perfusion group and in 18% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14 to 0.94; P\u2009=\u20090.03). Postreperfusion syndrome occurred in 12% of the recipients of a machine-perfused liver and in 27% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.91). Early allograft dysfunction occurred in 26% of the machine-perfused livers, as compared with 40% of control livers (risk ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.96). The cumulative number of treatments for nonanastomotic biliary strictures was lower by a factor of almost 4 after machine perfusion, as compared with control. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion led to a lower risk of nonanastomotic biliary strictures following the transplantation of livers obtained from donors after circulatory death than conventional static cold storage.

        "abstract": "Ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is increasingly used for viability assessment of high\u2010risk donor livers, whereas dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) reduces ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury. We aimed to resuscitate and test the viability of initially\u2010discarded, high\u2010risk donor livers using sequential DHOPE and NMP with two different oxygen carriers: an artificial hemoglobin\u2010based oxygen carrier (HBOC) or red blood cells (RBC). In a prospective observational cohort study of 54 livers that underwent DHOPE\u2010NMP, the first 18 procedures were performed with a HBOC\u2010based perfusion solution and the subsequent 36 procedures were performed with an RBC\u2010based perfusion solution for the NMP phase. All but one livers were derived from extended criteria donation after circulatory death donors, with a median donor risk index of 2.84 (IQR 2.52\u20133.11). After functional assessment during NMP, 34 livers (63% utilization), met the viability criteria and were transplanted. One\u2010year graft and patient survival were 94% and 100%, respectively. Post\u2010transplant cholangiopathy occurred in 1 patient (3%). There were no significant differences in utilization rate and post\u2010transplant outcomes between the HBOC and RBC group. Ex situ machine perfusion using sequential DHOPE\u2010NMP for resuscitation and viability assessment of high\u2010risk donor livers results in excellent transplant outcomes, irrespective of the oxygen carrier used.",

        "title": "Routine End-ischemic Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion in Liver Transplantation From Donors After Brain Death",
        "abstract": "Objective: To assess whether end-ischemic hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) is superior to static cold storage (SCS) in preserving livers procured from donors after brain death (DBD). Background: There is increasing evidence of the benefits of HOPE in liver transplantation, but predominantly in the setting of high-risk donors. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, livers procured from DBDs were randomly assigned to either end-ischemic dual HOPE for at least 2 hours or SCS (1:3 allocation ratio). The Model for Early Allograft Function (MEAF) was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measure was 90-day morbidity (ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT04812054). Results: Of the 104 liver transplantations included in the study, 26 were assigned to HOPE and 78 to SCS. Mean MEAF was 4.94 and 5.49 in the HOPE and SCS groups (P=0.24), respectively, with the corresponding rates of MEAF >8 of 3.8% (1/26) and 15.4% (12/78; P=0.18). Median Comprehensive Complication Index was 20.9 after transplantations with HOPE and 21.8 after transplantations with SCS (P=0.19). Transaminase activity, bilirubin concentration, and international normalized ratio were similar in both groups. In the case of donor risk index >1.70, HOPE was associated with significantly lower mean MEAF (4.92 vs 6.31; P=0.037) and lower median Comprehensive Complication Index (4.35 vs 22.6; P=0.050). No significant differences between HOPE and SCS were observed for lower donor risk index values. Conclusion: Routine use of HOPE in DBD liver transplantations does not seem justified as the clinical benefits are limited to high-risk donors.",

        "explanation": "This paper is related to the source paper as it also discusses the use of machine perfusion in liver transplantation, but it focuses on the routine use of end-ischemic hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) in donors after brain death. The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it uses machine perfusion as a sub-hypothesis to explore its effects in this specific donor population."

        "title": "Improved outcomes after hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion in liver transplantation\u2013Long-term follow-up of a multicenter randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Background: While 4 randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed the early benefits of hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE), high-level evidence regarding long-term clinical outcomes is lacking. The aim of this follow-up study from the HOPE-ECD-DBD trial was to compare long-term outcomes in patients who underwent liver transplantation using extended criteria donor allografts from donation after brain death (ECD-DBD), randomized to either HOPE or static cold storage (SCS). Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, recipients of liver transplantation from 4 European centers receiving extended criteria donor-donation after brain death allografts were randomly assigned to HOPE or SCS (1:1). Follow-up data were available for all patients. Analyzed endpoints included the incidence of late-onset complications (occurring later than 6 months and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index) and long-term graft survival and patient survival. Results: A total of 46 patients were randomized, 23 in both arms. The median follow-up was 48 months (95% CI: 41\u201355). After excluding early perioperative morbidity, a significant reduction in late-onset morbidity was observed in the HOPE group (median reduction of 23 Comprehensive Complication Index-points [p=0.003] and lower incidence of major complications [Clavien-Dindo \u22653, 43% vs. 85%, p=0.009]). Primary graft loss occurred in 13 patients (HOPE n=3 vs. SCS n=10), resulting in a significantly lower overall graft survival (p=0.029) and adverse 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probabilities in the SCS group, which did not reach the level of significance (HOPE 0.913, 0.869, 0.869 vs. SCS 0.783, 0.606, 0.519, respectively). Conclusions: Our exploratory findings indicate that HOPE reduces late-onset morbidity and improves long-term graft survival providing clinical evidence to further support the broad implementation of HOPE in human liver transplantation.",
