        "title": "Effect of preoperative immunonutrition in patients undergoing hepatectomy; a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "No consensus has been reached concerning the effects of preoperative immunonutrition in patients undergoing hepatectomy. We evaluated the effects of immunonutrition before hepatectomy on perioperative management. This study was performed as a randomized controlled trial. Patients expected to undergo segmentectomy or more extensive hepatectomy for liver tumors were randomized to immunonutrition (IM) and control (C) groups each consisting of 13 patients. The IM group was given 750 ml of IMPACT in addition to half-size hospital meals orally from 5 days before to the day before surgery, and the C group was given conventional hospital meals. The blood level of eicosapentaenoic acid was elevated preoperatively in all patients of the IM group. The white blood cell count and interleukin 6 levels, which are indices of postoperative inflammation, were significantly lower in the IM group. As regards liver function, postoperative increases in the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransaminase levels were slightly suppressed in the IM group. No significant difference was noted in postoperative complications or duration of postoperative hospital stay. In patients undergoing hepatectomy, preoperative immunonutrition reduced inflammation and protected against liver dysfunction.",

        "title": "Peri-operative immunonutrition in patients undergoing liver transplantation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nNo consensus has been reached concerning the effects of peri-operative immunonutrition in patients undergoing liver transplantation. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of peri-operative immunonutrition on clinical outcomes and liver function in patients undergoing liver transplantation.\n\n\nMETHODS AND STUDY DESIGN\nThe Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and google scholar were searched to identify all available randomized controlled studies which compared peri-operative immunonutrition support (glutamine, \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, arginine and ribonucleic acids) with standard nutrition. The data analysis was performed using Revman 5.2 software.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 501 patients were included. Peri-operative immunonutrition significantly reduced the risk of infectious complications (RR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.98, p=0.04) and shortened the postoperative hospital stay [weighted mean difference (WMD): -3.89; 95% CI: -7.42 to -0.36; p=0.03]. Furthermore, perioperative immunonutrition improved liver function by decreasing the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the blood (WMD: -25.4; 95% CI: -39.9 to -10.9, p=0.0006). However, we did not find statistically significant differences in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB) and direct bilirubin (DB) levels. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality and rejection reaction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPeri-operative nutrition support adding immunonutrients like glutamine, \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, arginine and ribonucleic acids may improve outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Due to the limited sample size of the included trials, further large-scale and rigorously designed RCTs are needed.",

        "title": "Impact of Liver and Pancreas Diseases on Nutritional Status",
        "abstract": "Liver and pancreatic diseases have significant consequences on nutritional status, with direct effects on clinical outcomes, survival, and quality of life. Maintaining and preserving an adequate nutritional status is crucial and should be one of the goals of patients with liver or pancreatic disease. Thus, the nutritional status of such patients should be systematically assessed at follow-up. Recently, great progress has been made in this direction, and the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms have been better established. While the spectrum of these diseases is wide, and the mechanisms of the onset of malnutrition are numerous and interrelated, clinical and nutritional manifestations are common. The main consequences include an impaired dietary intake, altered macro and micronutrient metabolism, energy metabolism disturbances, an increase in energy expenditure, nutrient malabsorption, sarcopenia, and osteopathy. In this review, we summarize the factors contributing to malnutrition, and the effects on nutritional status and clinical outcomes of liver and pancreatic diseases. We explain the current knowledge on how to assess malnutrition and the efficacy of nutritional interventions in these settings.",

        "title": "Nutritional Support in Pancreatic Diseases",
        "abstract": "This review summarizes the main pancreatic diseases from a nutritional approach. Nutrition is a cornerstone of pancreatic disease and is sometimes undervalued. An early identification of malnutrition is the first step in maintaining an adequate nutritional status in acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Following a proper diet is a pillar in the treatment of pancreatic diseases and, often, nutritional counseling becomes essential. In addition, some patients will require oral nutritional supplements and fat-soluble vitamins to combat certain deficiencies. Other patients will require enteral nutrition by nasoenteric tube or total parenteral nutrition in order to maintain the requirements, depending on the pathology and its consequences. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, defined as a significant decrease in pancreatic enzymes or bicarbonate until the digestive function is impaired, is common in pancreatic diseases and is the main cause of malnutrition. Pancreatic enzymes therapy allows for the management of these patients. Nutrition can improve the nutritional status and quality of life of these patients and may even improve life expectancy in patients with pancreatic cancer. For this reason, nutrition must maintain the importance it deserves.",

        "title": "Nutritional Interventions during Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer: A Systematic Review of Prospective Studies",
        "abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancer incidence is growing, but the prognosis for survival is still poor. Patients with pancreatic cancer often suffer from malnutrition and sarcopenia, two clinical conditions that negatively impact oncological clinical outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the impact of different nutritional interventions on clinical outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer during chemotherapy. Methods: A systematic review of MedLine, EMBASE, and Web of Science was carried out in December 2022, identifying 5704 articles. Titles and abstracts of all records were screened for eligibility based on inclusion criteria, and nine articles were included. Results: All nine articles included were prospective studies, but a meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogenicity in nutritional intervention. This Systematic Review shows an improvement in Quality of Life, nutritional status, body composition, oral intake, and Karnofsky Performance Status, following nutritional interventions. Conclusions: This Systematic Review in pancreatic cancer patients during chemotherapies does not allow one to draw firm conclusions. However, nutritional support in pancreatic cancer patients is advisable to ameliorate oncological care. Further well-designed prospective studies are needed to identify nutritional support\u2019s real impact and to establish a reliable way to improve nutritional status of pancreatic cancer patients during chemotherapy.",

        "title": "Fat malabsorption in pancreatic cancer: Pathophysiology and management.",
        "abstract": "Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and may lead to significant nutrition compromise. In the setting of cancer cachexia and gastrointestinal toxicities of cancer treatments, untreated (or undertreated) EPI exacerbates weight loss, sarcopenia, micronutrient deficiencies, and malnutrition. Together, these complications contribute to poor tolerance of oncologic therapies and negatively impact survival. Treatment of EPI in PDAC involves the addition of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, with titration to improve gastrointestinal symptoms. Medical nutrition therapies may also be applicable and may include fat-soluble vitamin replacement, medium-chain triglycerides, and, in some cases, enteral nutrition. Optimizing nutrition status is an important adjunct treatment approach to improve quality of life and may also improve overall survival.",
