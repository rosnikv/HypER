        "abstract": "Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, and placebo were compared to determine their efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis of the knee. In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose, parallel-design studies, patients with osteoarthritis aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 60.6 \u00b1 12.8 years were randomized to daily doses of 660 mg naproxen sodium (440 mg naproxen sodium in patients \u226565 years), 4000 mg acetaminophen, or placebo for 7 days. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in pain at rest, on passive motion, on weight-bearing, stiffness after rest (morning), day and night pain compared with placebo, and significantly greater relief from resting pain than acetaminophen (P < 0.05). Acetaminophen provided significantly greater improvements in day pain compared with placebo. Daily evaluations showed naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided superior pain relief to acetaminophen and was significantly better than acetaminophen at reducing difficulties experienced in walking several blocks and difficulties in bending, lifting, and stooping. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) and acetaminophen (4000 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mobility level, household tasks, and walking and bending. Patient and investigator evaluation scores were significantly higher in naproxen sodium and acetaminophen groups compared with placebo; no differences were observed between active treatments. Naproxen sodium and acetaminophen had similar safety profiles to placebo. Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) effectively relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis. Naproxen sodium is an alternative in the initial treatment of osteoarthritis and may be preferred to acetaminophen as first-line therapy in patients with moderate or severe pain.",

        "title": "Acetaminophen: Dose-Dependent Drug Hepatotoxicity and Acute Liver Failure in Patients",
        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced liver injury is a rare but serious clinical problem. A number of drugs can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure at therapeutic doses in a very limited number of patients (<1:10,000). This idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, which is currently not predictable in preclinical safety studies, appears to depend on individual susceptibility and the inability to adapt to the cellular stress caused by a particular drug. In striking contrast to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, drugs with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity are mostly detected during preclinical studies and do not reach the market. One notable exception is acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol), which is a safe drug at therapeutic doses but can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure after intentional and unintentional overdoses. Key Messages: APAP overdose is responsible for more acute liver failure cases in the USA or UK than all other etiologies combined. Since APAP overdose in the mouse represents a model for the human pathophysiology, substantial progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of cell death, liver injury and recovery. More recently, emerging evidence based on mechanistic biomarker analysis in patients and studies of cell death in human hepatocytes suggests that most of the mechanisms discovered in mice also apply to patients. The rapid development of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote against APAP overdose was based on the early understanding of APAP toxicity in mice. However, despite the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in patients who present early after APAP overdose, there is a need to develop intervention strategies for late-presenting patients. Conclusions: The challenges related to APAP toxicity are to better understand the mechanisms of cell death in order to limit liver injury and prevent acute liver failure, and also to develop biomarkers that better predict as early as possible who is at risk for developing acute liver failure with poor outcome.",

        "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure worldwide, in which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released by damaged hepatocytes activates neutrophils through binding of Toll\u2010like receptor 9 (TLR9), further aggravating liver injury. Here, we demonstrated that mtDNA/TLR9 also activates a negative feedback pathway through induction of microRNA\u2010223 (miR\u2010223) to limit neutrophil overactivation and liver injury. After injection of APAP in mice, levels of miR\u2010223, the most abundant miRNAs in neutrophils, were highly elevated in neutrophils. Disruption of the miR\u2010223 gene exacerbated APAP\u2010induced hepatic neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, and injury and enhanced TLR9 ligand\u2010mediated activation of proinflammatory mediators in neutrophils. An additional deletion of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM\u20101) gene ameliorated APAP\u2010induced neutrophil infiltration and liver injury in miR\u2010223 knockout mice. In vitro experiments revealed that miR\u2010223\u2010deficient neutrophils were more susceptible to TLR9 agonist\u2010mediated induction of proinflammatory mediators and nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) signaling, whereas overexpression of miR\u2010223 attenuated these effects in neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of TLR9 signaling by either treatment with a TLR9 inhibitor or by disruption of TLR9 gene partially, but significantly, suppressed miR\u2010223 expression in neutrophils post\u2010APAP injection. In contrast, activation of TLR9 up\u2010regulated miR\u2010223 expression in neutrophils in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, activation of TLR9 up\u2010regulated miR\u2010223 by enhancing NF\u2010\u03baB binding on miR\u2010223 promoter, whereas miR\u2010223 attenuated TLR9/NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010mediated inflammation by targeting I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 expression. Collectively, up\u2010regulation of miR\u2010223 plays a key role in terminating the acute neutrophilic response and is a therapeutic target for treatment of APAP\u2010induced liver failure.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs were discovered more than 2 decades ago and have profound impact on diverse biological processes. Specific microRNAs have important roles in modulating the innate immune response and their dysregulation has been demonstrated to contribute to inflammatory diseases. MiR\u2010223 in particular, is very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It functions as key modulator for the differentiation and activation of myeloid cells. The central role of miR\u2010223 in myeloid cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage differentiation and activation has been studied extensively. MiR\u2010223 contributes to myeloid differentiation by enhancing granulopoiesis while inhibiting macrophage differentiation. Uncontrolled myeloid activation has detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. MiR\u2010223 serves as a negative feedback mechanism controlling excessive innate immune responses in the maintenance of myeloid cell homeostasis. This review summarizes several topics covering the function of miR\u2010223 in myeloid differentiation, neutrophil and macrophage functions, as well as in inflammatory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, nonmyeloid functions of miR\u2010223 are also discussed in this review. Therapeutic enhancement of miR\u2010223 to dampen inflammatory targets is also highlighted as potential treatment to control excessive innate immune responses during mucosal inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to more severe forms of liver injury including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In humans, only 20%\u201040% of patients with fatty liver progress to NASH, and mice fed a high\u2010fat diet (HFD) develop fatty liver but are resistant to NASH development. To understand how simple steatosis progresses to NASH, we examined hepatic expression of anti\u2010inflammatory microRNA\u2010223 (miR\u2010223) and found that this miRNA was highly elevated in hepatocytes in HFD\u2010fed mice and in human NASH samples. Genetic deletion of miR\u2010223 induced a full spectrum of NAFLD in long\u2010term HFD\u2010fed mice including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that, compared to wild\u2010type mice, HFD\u2010fed miR\u2010223 knockout (miR\u2010223KO) mice had greater hepatic expression of many inflammatory genes and cancer\u2010related genes, including (C\u2010X\u2010C motif) chemokine 10 (Cxcl10) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ\u2010binding motif (Taz), two well\u2010known factors that promote NASH development. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Cxcl10 and Taz are two downstream targets of miR\u2010223 and that overexpression of miR\u2010223 reduced their expression in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatic levels of miR\u2010223, CXCL10, and TAZ mRNA were elevated in human NASH samples, which positively correlated with hepatic levels of several miR\u2010223 targeted genes as well as several proinflammatory, cancer\u2010related, and fibrogenic genes. Conclusion: HFD\u2010fed miR\u2010223KO mice develop a full spectrum of NAFLD, representing a clinically relevant mouse NAFLD model; miR\u2010223 plays a key role in controlling steatosis\u2010to\u2010NASH progression by inhibiting hepatic Cxcl10 and Taz expression and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.",

        "abstract": "Background ENO3 expression is upregulated in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patient tissues, demonstrated that ENO3 might play crucial roles in NAFLD. However, the mechanism of ENO3 in NAFLD remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of ENO3 in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in vivo and vitro NASH model. Methods In vivo and vitro NASH model were established by methionine-choline deficient (MCD)-diet feeding and high free fatty acid (HFFA) induction in L02 cells. Loss and gain function of ENO3 and GPX4 was performed to study the mechanism in NASH. Western blot was used to detect the expression of ENO3 and GPX4. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), picrosirius Red and Oil Red O staining was used to evaluate histopathology of liver in NASH model. Ferroptosis indicators were measured by assay kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results NASH mouse model was successfully established induced by MCD diet with steatosis, inflammatory infiltration, ballooning and fibrosis observed in the liver tissue. The expression of ENO3 and GPX4 was significantly elevated while ferroptosis was inhibited in NASH mice and cell model. Upregulation of both ENO3 and GPX4 could promote the lipid accumulation in L02 cells. In addition, overexpressed ENO3 attenuated the status of ferroptosis. Conclusions In the present study, we demonstrate that ENO3 promoted the progression of NASH by negatively regulating ferroptosis via elevating GPX4 expression and lipid accumulation. These findings provided solid foundation for the mechanism of ferroptosis on the progression of NASH regulated by ENO3, suggesting that ENO3 may be a potential therapeutic target for NASH.",

        "abstract": "Background: The protective effect of quercetin on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Recently, quercetin was reported to be capable of inhibiting ferroptosis, which is a recognized type of regulated cell death. Moreover, hepatic ferroptosis plays an important role in the progression of NAFLD, but experimental evidence is limited. Hence, our study aimed to investigate the effect of quercetin on hepatic ferroptosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD and further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed either a normal diet (ND), an HFD, or an HFD supplemented with quercetin for 12 weeks. Hepatic lipid peroxidation, steatosis, ferroptosis and iron overload were examined. In vitro, steatotic L-02 cells was used to study the potential mechanism. Results: We found that the HFD caused lipid peroxidation, lipid accumulation and ferroptosis in the liver, which were rescued by quercetin supplementation. Consistent with the in vivo results, quercetin alleviated lipid droplet accumulation and reduced the levels of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ferroptosis in steatotic L-02 cells. Using a mitochondrial ROS (MtROS) scavenger (Mito-TEMPO) and ferroptosis specific inhibitor (Fer-1), we found that quercetin remarkably alleviated lipid droplet accumulation and lipid peroxidation by reducing MtROS-mediated ferroptosis in steatotic L-02 cells. Conclusion: Our data showed that HFD consumption induced lipid accumulation and triggered ferroptosis in liver, ultimately leading to hepatic lipotoxicity, which can be alleviated by quercetin. Findings from this study provide new insight into the mechanism by which quercetin can be used for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.",

        "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic advanced liver disease that is highly related to metabolic disorders and induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Recently, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been regarded as a protective bioactive polyphenol in green tea that has the ability to protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but the molecular mechanism remains poorly deciphered. Ferroptosis plays a vital role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but experimental evidence of ferroptosis inhibition by epigallocatechin gallate is limited. Hence, our study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of epigallocatechin gallate on hepatic ferroptosis to mitigate hepatic injury in high-fat diet-fed mice. Methods: Fifty male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a standard chow diet (SCD), a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet and administered epigallocatechin gallate or ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis-specific inhibitor) for 12 weeks. Liver injury, lipid accumulation, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, iron overload, and ferroptosis marker proteins were examined. In vitro, steatotic L-02 cells were used to explore the underlying mechanism. Results: In our research, we found that epigallocatechin gallate notably alleviated liver injury and lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, hepatic steatosis, decreased iron overload and inhibited ferroptosis in a high-fat diet-induced murine model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro experiments, using ferrostatin-1 and a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MtROS) scavenger (Mito-TEMPO), we found that epigallocatechin gallate remarkably alleviated oxidative stress and inhibited ferroptosis by reducing the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in steatotic L-02 cells.

        "abstract": "Vine tea (Ampelopsis grossedentata), a traditional Chinese tea, is rich in flavonoids with various biological activities. Our study found that Vine tea total flavonoids (TFs) treatment reduced the body mass and blood lipid levels and improved the hepatic tissue morphology in mice fed the high-fat diet (HFD). In vivo, TF treatment activated the hepatic adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, initiated autophagy, and regulated the expression levels of proteins for lipid metabolism in those HFD-fed mice. In vitro, TF treatment dramatically reduced the lipid droplets and triacylglycerol content in HepG2 and L02 cells treated with oleic acid (OA). These were associated with the activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway and autophagy initiation in OA-treated hepatocytes. This phenotype was abolished in the presence of 3-methyladenine, an autophagy inhibitor. Our results indicated that the TF activation of AMPK/mTOR leads to the stimulation of autophagy and a decrease in the buildup of intracellular lipids in hepatocytes, showing the potential of TF as a therapeutic agent for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vine tea, a tea drink, has been consumed by Chinese folk for over a thousand years. The result of this study will provide evidence that vine tea total flavonoids have potential use as a functional material for the prevention and amelioration of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",
