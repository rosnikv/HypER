        "title": "Combination therapy with etanercept and anakinra in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have been treated unsuccessfully with methotrexate.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the potential for additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy with the selective anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent etanercept and the anti-interleukin-1 agent anakinra.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred forty-four patients in whom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was active despite methotrexate therapy were treated with subcutaneous etanercept only (25 mg twice weekly), full-dosage etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day), or half-dosage etanercept (25 mg once weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day) for 6 months in a double-blind study at 41 centers in the US. Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

        "title": "[Leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis].",
        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect and safety of leflunomide (LEF) in refractory RA and to review the literature on this subject. A one year prospective study was conducted on a group of patients (n:15). Mean duration disease was 6.46 years. Rhumatoid factor was present in 12 cases. Leflunomide was administered at a dos of 20mg/day following a loading dose of 100mg/day for three days. The efficacy of LEF was evaluated on clinical and biological parameters of RA evolutivity at one, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Our mean follow up period was about 8 months (2 to 12 months). Good prognostic indicators of disease progression were observed with LEF at one month and later in eleven cases with a good safety. Non serious adverse events were observed with LEF. Our result confirm that LEF may present another therapeutic choice that is efficacious for the long term treatment of refractory RA. Nonetheless, these results must be evaluated on a larger series.",

        "abstract": "Aim of the study: Evaluation of safety and therapeutic effectiveness of leflunomide according to age of the patients and duration of rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Leflunomide therapy safety was analyzed in a group of 261 patients based on number of adverse effects responsible for treatment interruption and according to adverse effects number that allowed for continuing therapy. During six-month observation 27 patients interrupted therapy and in the group of remaining 234 persons leflunomide therapy efficacy was evaluated according to DAS-28 score. Results: Efficacy of leflunomide therapy was confirmed in every group according to patients age and no significant differences were observed between groups of patients with different age. Adverse leflunomide effects occurred in 47 (18.8%) patients and were the cause of therapy interruption in 23 (8.8%) cases. No significant differences in adverse leflunomide effects were observed to depend on patients age or rheumatoid arthritis period. Conclusions: (1) Patients\u2019 age and period of rheumatoid arthritis do not influence leflunomide therapy safety. (2) Efficacy of leflunomide was confirmed in each group of patients. (3) Patients\u2019 age does not influence leflunomide therapy outcome.",

        "title": "Use of contraception by women treated with leflunomide due to rheumatic arthritis",
        "abstract": "A total of 46 premenopausal patients treated with leflunomide (LMF) for rheumatic arthritis (RA) and 107 women of reproductive age free from chronic diseases were investigated to evaluate methods of contraception. Among 31 LMF-treated women using contraception, 48.4% chose oestrogen-progesterone hormonal contraception (E-PHC); 16.1% condoms; 3.2% had an intrauterine device and 32.0% preferred natural methods. These methods differed significantly from women in the control group, who mostly used condoms (56.8%) and E-PHC (35.3%) and rarely, natural methods (3.95%) or progesterone injections (3.95%). As many as 32.6% LMF-treated patients did not use any method of birth control. The choice of contraception among RA patients with LFM therapy was significantly dependent on the experience with methods used prior to the LFM therapy introduction (p < 0.001). Compared with women free from chronic diseases, LMF-treated patients use E-PHC significantly more often but still as many as 33% do not use any contraceptive method, despite strong recommendations.",

        "title": "Increasing contraception use among women receiving teratogenic medications in a rheumatology clinic",
        "abstract": "Teratogenic medications are often prescribed to women of childbearing age with autoimmune diseases. Literature suggests that appropriate use of contraception among these women is low, potentially resulting in high-risk unintended pregnancies. Preliminary review in our clinic showed suboptimal documentation of women\u2019s contraceptive use. We therefore designed a quality improvement initiative to target three process measures: documentation of contraception usage and type, contraception counselling and provider action after counselling. We reviewed charts of rheumatology clinic female patients aged 18\u201345 over the course of 10 months; for those who were on teratogenic medications (methotrexate, leflunomide, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide), we looked for evidence of documentation of contraception use. We executed multiple plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to develop and evaluate interventions, which centred on interprofessional provider education, modification of electronic medical record (EMR) templates, periodic provider reminders, patient screening questionnaires and frequent feedback to providers on performance. Among eligible patients (n=181), the baseline rate of documentation of contraception type was 46%, the rate of counselling was 30% and interventions after counselling occurred in 33% of cases. Averaged intervention data demonstrated increased provider performance in all three domains: documentation of contraception type increased to 64%, counselling to 45% and provider action to 46%. Of the patients with documented contraceptives, 50% used highly effective, 27% used effective and 23% used ineffective contraception methods. During this project, one unintentional pregnancy occurred in a patient on methotrexate not on contraception. Our interventions improved three measures related to contraception counselling and documentation, but there remains a need for ongoing quality improvement efforts in our clinic. This high-risk population requires increased provider engagement to improve contraception compliance, coupled with system-wide EMR changes to increase sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Objective The aim of this work is to explore patient\u2019 unmet needs of rare and complex rheumatic tissue diseases (rCTDs) patients during pregnancy and its planning by means of the narrative-based medicine (NBM) approach. Methods A panel of nine rCTDs patients\u2019 representatives was identified to codesign a survey aimed at collecting the stories of rCTD patients who had one or more pregnancies/miscarriages. The results of the survey and the stories collected were analysed and discussed with a panel of patients\u2019 representatives to identify unmet needs, challenges and possible strategies to improve the care of rCTD patients. Results 129 replies were collected, and 112 stories were analysed. Several unmet needs in the management of pregnancy in rCTDs were identified, such as fragmentation of care among different centres, lack of education and awareness on rCTD pregnancies among midwifes, obstetricians and gynaecologists. The lack of receiving appropriate information and education on rCTDs pregnancy was also highlighted by patients and their families. The need for a holistic approach and the availability specialised pregnancy clinics with a multidisciplinary organisation as well as the provision of psychological support during all the phases around pregnancy was considered also a priority. Conclusion The adoption of the NBM approach enabled a direct identification of unmet needs, and a list of possible actions was elaborated to improve the care of rCTD patients and their families in future initiatives.",
