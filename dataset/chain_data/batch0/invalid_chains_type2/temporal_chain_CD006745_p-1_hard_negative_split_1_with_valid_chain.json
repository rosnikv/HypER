        "abstract": "To assess whether ultrasound\u2010guided percutaneous acetic acid injection is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 60 patients with one to four HCCs smaller than 3 cm were entered onto a randomized controlled trial. Thirty\u2010one and 29 patients, respectively, were treated by percutaneous acetic acid injection using 50% acetic acid or by percutaneous ethanol injection using absolute ethanol. There were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, Child\u2010Pugh class, size of tumors, or number of tumors between the two groups. When there was no evidence of viable HCC from biopsy, plain and helical dynamic computed tomography, or angiography, the treatment was considered successful and was discontinued. All original tumors were treated successfully by either therapy. However, 8% of 38 tumors treated with percutaneous acetic acid injection and 37% of 35 tumors treated with percutaneous ethanol injection developed a local recurrence (P < .001) during the follow\u2010up periods of 29 \u00b1 8 months and 23 \u00b1 10 months, respectively. The 1\u2010 and 2\u2010year survival rates were 100% and 92% in percutaneous acetic acid injection and 83% and 63% in percutaneous ethanol injection (P = .0017). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed that treatment was an independent predictor of survival. The risk ratio of percutaneous acetic acid injection versus percutaneous ethanol injection was 0.120 (range, 0.027\u20100.528;P = .0050). In conclusion, percutaneous acetic acid injection is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of small HCC.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the current knowledge on the risk factors for recurrence, efficacy of adjuvant therapy in preventing recurrence, and the optimal management of recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA\nThe long-term prognosis after resection of HCC remains unsatisfactory as a result of a high incidence of recurrence. Prevention and effective management of recurrence are the most important strategies to improve the long-term survival results.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA review of relevant English articles was undertaken based on a Medline search from January 1980 to July 1999.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPathologic factors indicative of tumor invasiveness such as venous invasion, presence of satellite nodules, large tumor size, and advanced pTNM stage, are the best-established risk factors for recurrence. Active hepatitis activity in the nontumorous liver and perioperative transfusion also appear to enhance recurrence. Recent molecular research has identified tumor biologic factors such as the proliferative and angiogenic activities of the tumor as new risk factors for recurrence. There is a lack of convincing evidence for the efficacy of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in preventing recurrence. Retrospective studies suggested that postoperative hepatic arterial chemotherapy might improve disease-free survival, but results were conflicting. For the management of postoperative recurrence, studies have consistently indicated that surgical resection should be the treatment of choice for localized recurrence, be it in the liver remnant or extrahepatic organs. Transarterial chemoembolization and percutaneous ethanol injection are widely used to prolong survival in patients with unresectable intrahepatic recurrence, and combined therapy with these two modalities may offer additional benefit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nKnowledge of the risk factors for postoperative recurrence provides a basis for logical approaches to prevention. Minimal surgical manipulation of tumors to prevent tumor cell dissemination, avoidance of perioperative blood transfusion, and suppression of chronic hepatitis activity in the liver remnant are strategies that may be useful in preventing recurrence. The efficacy of postoperative adjuvant regional chemotherapy deserves further evaluation. New concepts on the influence of tumor biologic factors such as angiogenic activity on recurrence of HCC suggest a potential role of novel approaches such as antiangiogenesis for adjuvant therapy in the future. Currently, the most realistic approach in prolonging survival after resection of HCC is early detection and aggressive management of recurrence. Randomized trials are needed to define the roles of various treatment modalities for recurrence and the benefit of multimodality therapy.",

        "title": "Long-Term Survival and Pattern of Recurrence After Resection of Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Preserved Liver Function: Implications for a Strategy of Salvage Transplantation",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the survival results and pattern of recurrence after resection of potentially transplantable small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in patients with preserved liver function, with special reference to the implications for a strategy of salvage transplantation. Summary Background DataPrimary resection followed by transplantation for recurrence or deterioration of liver function has been recently suggested as a rational strategy for patients with HCC 5 cm or smaller and preserved liver function. However, there are no published data on transplantability after HCC recurrence or long-term deterioration of liver function after resection of small HCC in Child-Pugh class A patients. Such data are critical in determining the feasibility of salvage transplantation. MethodsFrom a prospective database of 473 patients with resection of HCC between 1989 and 1999, 135 patients age 65 years or younger had Child-Pugh class A chronic liver disease (chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis) and transplantable small HCC (solitary \u22645 cm or two or three tumors \u22643 cm). Survival results were analyzed and the pattern of recurrence was examined for eligibility for salvage transplantation based on the same criteria as those of primary transplantation for HCC. ResultsOverall survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 90%, 76%, 70%, and 35%, respectively, and the corresponding disease-free survival rates were 74%, 50%, 36%, and 22%. Cirrhosis and oligonodular tumors were predictive of worse disease-free survival. Patients with concomitant oligonodular tumors and cirrhosis had a 5-year overall survival rate of 48% and a disease-free survival rate of 0%, which were significantly worse compared with other subgroups. At a median follow-up of 48 months, 67 patients had recurrence and 53 (79%) of them were considered eligible for salvage transplantation. Decompensation from Child-Pugh class A to B or C without recurrence occurred in only six patients. ConclusionsFor Child-Pugh class A patients with small HCC, hepatic resection is a reasonable first-line treatment associated with a favorable 5-year overall survival rate. A considerable proportion of patients may survive without recurrence for 5 or even 10 years; among those with recurrence, the majority may be eligible for salvage transplantation. These data suggest that primary resection and salvage transplantation may be a feasible and rational strategy for patients with small HCC and preserved liver function. Primary transplantation may be a preferable option for the subset of patients with oligonodular tumors in cirrhotic liver in view of the poor survival results after resection.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and postoperative course of liver transplantation (LT) in cirrhotic patients who underwent liver resection prior to LT for HCC. Summary Background Data: Although LT provides longer survival than liver resection for treatment of small HCCs, donor shortage and long LT wait time may argue against LT. The feasibility and survival following LT after hepatic resection have not been previously examined. Methods: Between 1991 and 2001, among 107 patients who underwent LT for HCC, 88 met Mazzafero's criteria upon pathologic analysis of the explant. Of these, 70 underwent primary liver transplantation (PLT) and 18 liver resection prior to secondary liver transplantation (SLT) for recurrence (n = 11), deterioration of liver function (n = 4), or high risk for recurrence (n = 3). Perioperative and postoperative factors and long-term survival were compared. Results: Comparison of PLT and SLT groups at the time of LT revealed similar median age (53 vs. 55 years), sex, and etiology of liver disease (alcohol/viral B/C/other). In the SLT group, the mean time between liver resection and listing for LT was 20 months (range 1\u201384 months). Overall time on LT waiting list of the two groups was similar (3 vs. 5 months). Pathologic analysis after LT revealed similar tumor size (2.2 vs. 2.3 cm) and number (1.6 vs. 1.7). Perioperative and postoperative courses were not different in terms of operative time (551 vs. 530 minutes), blood loss (1191 vs. 1282 mL), transfusion (3 vs. 2 units), ICU (9 vs. 10 days) or hospital stay (32 vs. 31 days), morbidity (51% vs. 56%) or 30-day mortality (5.7% vs. 5.6%). During a median follow-up of 32 months (3 to 158 months), 3 patients recurred after PLT and one after SLT. After transplantation, 3- and 5-year overall survivals were not different between groups (82 vs. 82% and 59 vs. 61%). Conclusions: In selected patients, liver resection prior to transplantation does not increase the morbidity or impair long-term survival following LT. Therefore, liver resection prior to transplantation can be integrated in the treatment strategy for HCC.",

        "title": "High pathological risk of recurrence after surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma: An indication for salvage liver transplantation",
        "abstract": "Surgical resection and liver transplantation offer a 5\u2010year survival greater than 70% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, but the high recurrence rate impairs long\u2010term outcome after resection. Pathological data such as vascular invasion and detection of additional nodules predict recurrence and divide patients into high and low risk profile. Based on this, we proposed salvage liver transplant to resected patients in whom pathology evidenced high recurrence risk even in the absence of proven residual disease. From January 1995 to August 2003 we have evaluated 1,638 patients. Resection was indicated in 77 patients, but only 17 (22%) (all cirrhotics, 14 hepatitis C virus+) were optimal candidates for both resection and transplantation. Of them, 8 exhibited a high risk profile at pathology and were offered transplantation. Among the 8 high risk patients, 7 presented recurrence, compared with only 2 of the 9 at low risk (P = .012). Two of the high risk patients refused transplant and developed multifocal disease during follow\u2010up. The other 6 were enlisted and all but 1 had tumor foci in the explant. Only 1 presented extrahepatic dissemination early after transplant and died 4 months later. The others are free of disease after a median follow\u2010up of 45 months. Two recurrences were detected in low risk patients, 1 of them being transplanted 18 months after surgery. These data in a small series of patients confirm that pathological parameters identify patients at higher risk of recurrence, which allow them to be listed for liver transplantation without proven malignant disease. In conclusion, this policy is clinically effective and could further improve the outcome of resected patients. (Liver Transpl 2004;10:1294\u20131300.)",

The aim of this work was to compare the outcome of liver resection (LR) with that of liver transplantation (LT) for single, early HCC in Child\u2010Turcotte\u2010Pugh class A patients with cirrhosis younger than 70 years of age. Thirty\u2010seven of 134 patients who underwent LR and 36 of 125 who underwent LT for HCC in our unit fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No differences were observed in mean tumor size (3 cm); HCV cirrhosis predominated in the LT group and older age in the LR group. Postoperative mortality was higher and hospital stay longer in the LT group. Patient survival was similar in both groups. Tumor recurrence was higher in the LR group (59% vs. 11%), extrahepatic recurrences predominated after LT and hepatic recurrences after LR. Disease\u2010free survival was significantly better after LT. Eighteen patients presented hepatic recurrence after LR: 5 advanced and 13 early. Seventeen patients\u201413 with early HCC recurrence and 4 with liver failure\u2014were potential candidates for salvage LT. However, 10 of 17 patients were older than 70 years at this time. Salvage LT could only be performed in 6 patients: 5 for HCC recurrence and 1 for liver failure. Results of salvage LT were similar to those of primary LT. In conclusion, only 27.6% of resected patients were eligible for LT. LR is a good option since it offers similar survival to LT. Salvage liver transplantation was performed in 16.2% of resected patients, with older age being the main contraindication. Outcome of salvage LT was similar to that of primary LT.

        "abstract": "Backgrounds/Aims: Hepatic resection (HR) has been the standard therapy for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with preserved liver function in Child A cirrhosis. However, the underlying cirrhosis is responsible for high recurrence and long-term complications of portal hypertension and liver failure. Currently, liver transplantation (LT) has proven to be a good alternative to HR. We studied to determine whether LT could be an alternative initial therapy or not in HCC patients with less than 3 cm-sized, single nodule with Child A cirrhosis. Methods: From January 1995 to December 2005, there were 100 HR and 17 LT (living donor LT 15, deceased donor LT 2) patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were reviewed and survival rates between LT and HR groups were compared. The applicability of salvage LT at the time of recurrence was also evaluated. Results: There was no difference in age, sex, etiology and in-hospital mortality between the two groups. LTs were not performed for the patients with preserved liver function, that is, BCLC stage A1. Most initial recurrences after HR occurred in liver (37/39), but only one recurrence after LT occurred in lung. Overall survival differences between LT and HR were not significant. However, disease-free survival after LT and HR were significantly different (p = 0.047). Potential candidates for salvage LT were 37 patients including hepatic failure (n = 10), and its applicability on recurrence was 69.2% (27/39). Conclusion: HR is still a good option for the selected patients because of lower cost and no requirement of donors. However, primary LT can be a treatment of choice for single, small HCC of Child A cirrhosis in the presence of portal hypertension because of excellent disease-free survival.",

        "abstract": "This study intended to discuss the roles of hepatic resection (HR) and liver transplantation (LT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through our experience and literature review. For large HCC > 10\u2003cm, HR is regarded as the treatment of choice when hepatic function is preserved. Considering frequent extrahepatic recurrence and acceptable outcome after curative HR, LT has not been recommended. For multiple HCCs, HR has been attempted in different preferences worldwide. HR can offer acceptable survival outcome for patients with small oligo\u2010nodular HCCs and well\u2010preserved liver function. Recurrence pattern lowers the applicability of salvage LT, thus primary LT is suggested. For HCC patients with major portal vein tumor thrombus, HR with thrombus removal can be performed, in contrast LT is contraindicated. For HCC with bile duct tumor thrombus, aggressive en bloc resection can lead to prolongation of survival. There is no consensus on transplantability of HCC with bile duct tumor thrombus, but complete resection may provide survival gain after LT. In conclusion, HR and LT have complementary roles, thus they should be associated to rather than being opposed. Multi\u2010modality treatment strategy especially, for patients with advanced HCC, provides new fields of investigation for diverse indications of HR and LT.",

A microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis was used to compare miRNA expression patterns in tissue samples of 40 patients with and without HCC recurrence after LT. In a screening cohort (n = 18), the miRNA analysis identified significant differences in the expression of 13 miRNAs in patients with tumour recurrence.

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the expression of miR-124-3p in 101 HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. Additionally, the association between miR-124-3p expression and clinical parameters was also analyzed. Differentially expressed genes identified following miR-124-3p transfection, the prospective target genes predicted in silico and the key genes of HCC obtained from Natural Language Processing (NLP) were integrated to obtain potential target genes of miR-124-3p in HCC. Relevant signaling pathways were assessed with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) pathway enrichment analysis. miR-124-3p expression was significantly reduced in HCC tissues compared with expression in adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues. In HCC, miR-124-3p was demonstrated to be associated with clinical stage. The mean survival time of the low miR-124-3p expression group was reduced compared with that of the high expression group. A total of 132 genes overlapped from differentially expressed genes, miR-124-3p predicted target genes and NLP identified genes. PPI network construction revealed a total of 109 nodes and 386 edges, and 20 key genes were identified. The major enriched terms of three GO categories included regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of cellular biosynthetic processes, cell leading edge, cytosol and cell projection, protein kinase activity, transcription activator activity and enzyme binding. KEGG analysis revealed pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer as the top three terms. Angiogenesis, the endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway and the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway were identified as the most significant terms in the PANTHER pathway analysis. The present study confirmed that miR-124-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC. miR-124-3p may target multiple genes, exerting its effect spatiotemporally, or in combination with a diverse range of processes in HCC. Functional characterization of miR-124-3p targets will offer novel insight into the molecular changes that occur in HCC progression.",

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and immunoblotting analysis were performed to evaluate SIRT1 protein expression levels in tissue specimens and cell lines. Moreover, the nude-mouse transplanted tumour model was used to assess liver cancer cell growth in vivo. Results: Our results showed that SIRT1 protein levels were significantly up-regulated in liver cancer tissues and cancerous cell lines. Conversely, miR-124-3p and miR-506-3p were down-regulated in liver cancer tissues and cell lines. The protein expression of SIRT1 was significantly declined in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells after transfection with miR-124-3p or miR-506-3p mimics. miR-124-3p and miR-506-3p collaboratively caused a marked inhibition of liver cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, while the phenomena were neutralized by overexpression of SIRT1. In vivo experimental measurements also revealed that miR-124-3p and miR-506-3p synergistically inhibited SIRT1 protein expression and tumour growth in the nude-mouse transplanted tumour model. Conclusion: It was observed that miR-124-3p and miR-506-3p could cooperatively retard liver cancer cell growth via co-inhibiting SIRT1 protein expression.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the role of miR-124-3p in modulating sirtuin 1 protein expression in liver cancer, which is directly related to the source paper's findings on the effects of miR-124-3p and midazolam on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The source paper's findings on miR-124-3p's role in suppressing PIM-1 can be seen as a sub-hypothesis for this paper's investigation on miR-124-3p's role in modulating SIRT1."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been confirmed to be associated with the progression of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role and mechanism of circHIPK3 in HCC are still unclear. To investigate its function, circHIPK3 expression was first determined by RT\u2013qPCR in HCC tissues or cells. Functionally, cell proliferation and invasion were investigated by CCK-8, EdU, or Transwell assays. In terms of understanding the mechanism, the interaction of the circRNA HIPK3/micro RNA 124 (miRNA 124) or micro RNA 506 (miRNA506) /PDK2 regulatory loop was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In addition, a xenograft tumor model was established to confirm the impact of circHIPK3 on the growth of HCC cells in vivo. We found that circHIPK3 was upregulated in HCC patients and associated with clinical characteristics, while miR-124 and miR-506 were downregulated in HCC patients. Additionally, we proved that knock down of circHIPK3 remarkably suppressed the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, circHIPK3 directly bound to miR-124 or miR-506 and inhibited their expression, and PDK2 was a target gene of miR-124 or miR-506. Moreover, circHIPK3 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-124 or miR-506 on HCC progression. miR-124 or miR-506 could also suppress tumorigenesis of HCC cells by PDK2. Furthermore, in vivo evidence confirmed that knock down of circHIPK3 inhibited tumor formation. We suggest that circHIPK3 can accelerate the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells by sponging miR-124 or miR-506 to upregulate PDK2, which is the underlying mechanism of circHIPK3-induced HCC progression.",
