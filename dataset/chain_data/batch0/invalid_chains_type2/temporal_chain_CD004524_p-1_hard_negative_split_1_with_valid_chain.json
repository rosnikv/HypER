        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) compared with placebo in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis 24 week, double bind, randomized, placebo controlled trial compared the response between MTX 7.5 mg/week or placebo in patients with active AS. The primary outcome measure was a composite index of improvement in 5 of the following scales: severity of morning stiffness, physical well being, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire for Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), and physician and patient global assessment of disease activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen patients received MTX and 18 placebo. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 24 weeks, 53% of patients in the MTX group had a treatment response, compared with 17% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). We observed significant improvements with MTX in physical well being (p = 0.009), BASDAI (p = 0.02), BASFI (p = 0.02), physician global assessment (p < 0.001), patient global assessment (p = 0.03), and HAQ-S (p = 0.02). In the adjusted analysis only MTX determined the improvement in the primary outcome. At the end of the trial, one patient with MTX withdrew due to a lack of compliance, and one with placebo due to a lack of efficacy. We did not observe significant differences in rates of side effects between the 2 groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMTX is safe and effective for patients with AS. Longterm studies are needed to evaluate the permanence of its benefit.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the potential therapeutic effect of methotrexate 20 mg given weekly as subcutaneous injections to 20 patients with ankylosing spondylitis refractory to non-steriodal antirheumatic drugs. Patients and methods: 20 patients with ankylosing spondylitis, a mean Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of 5.6 (range 4\u20139.3) and predominantly axial manifestations were treated with weekly 15 mg methotrexate subcutaneously for 4 weeks, which was then increased to 20 mg subcutaneously for the next 12 weeks. Clinical outcome assessments included, among others, BASDAI score physical function, spinal mobility, patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 global assessment (visual analogue scale), peripheral joint assessment, quality of life (Short Form 36) and C reactive protein. The primary end point of the study was a 20% improvement on the ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS 20) scale. Results: Using an intention-to-treat analysis, ASAS 20 was achieved in only 25% of patients. An ASAS 40 response was achieved in 10% of patients, and no patient reached an ASAS 70 response or the ASAS criteria for partial remission. For the mean BASDAI score, no change was observed between baseline and week 16 (baseline 5.6 v week 16, 5.6). No improvement was observed in any of the clinical parameters or C reactive protein, except a small but non-significant decrease in the number of swollen joints. Conclusions: In this open study, methotrexate did not show any benefit for axial manifestations in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis beyond the expected placebo response.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewTo summarize the latest developments in outcome assessment and treatment in ankylosing spondylitis. Recent findingsA number of clinical and radiological outcome measures used in the assessment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis have recently been critically reappraised and compared, to assist in the interpretation of study results and to guide choices for outcome measures in clinical trials. Clinical tools for assessing spinal mobility, peripheral joint disease and enthesitis, and radiograph and MRI scoring methods have been reviewed for validity and test performance in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Experience with the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 therapies for ankylosing spondylitis continues to grow, and longer term data show these treatments continue to be effective and safe to 5 years of therapy. SummaryAs measurement tools for disease state and progression in ankylosing spondylitis are refined, the assessment of response to therapy improves, with the aim that real effect on structural damage in ankylosing spondylitis may be detected.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the validity of 15 standardized instruments frequently used to measure the outcome of chronic arthritis treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnalyses were performed on data collected at a rehabilitation programme (n=216). The outcome measures evaluated were health-related quality of life, global health, pain, physical function and aerobic capacity. The instrument items were linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (content validity), construct validity was analysed based on predetermined hypothesis (Spearman's correlations, rs), and responsiveness (after 18 days and 12 months) by the standardized response mean.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost instruments covered the ICF component body function and/or activity-participation, only a few covered the environmental component. The short Euroqol-5 Dimensions performed as well as the longer health-related quality of life instruments in covering the ICF and in responsiveness. The health-related quality of life instruments did not measure similar constructs as hypothesized, neither did pain measures. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis indices covered several components of the ICF often exhibiting a large responsiveness. Aerobic capacity had the largest responsiveness of all measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMany instruments are not highly correlated, although at face value they appear to measure the same construct, information also applying to content validity and responsiveness. Results from this study can assist in choosing outcome measures in the clinic and in research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEndorsed by the Outcome MEasures in Rheumatoid Arthritis in Clinical Trials (OMERACT) group, The Effective Consumer Scale (EC-17) was developed in English for patients with musculoskeletal diseases to assess the skills and perceptions important for participating in and managing health care. The objective of this study was culturally to adapt the questionnaire into Swedish and to study its psychometric properties.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter translation of the questionnaire into Swedish, two different groups of outpatients from two specialist rheumatology departments participated in the study. Face validity was assessed, together with internal consistency, test-retest and responsiveness of the questionnaire. Construct validity was assessed using the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES), and responsiveness to a five day educational intervention was analysed using the standardized response mean (SRM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalyses were based on 124 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, of whom 50 attended the intervention. Data quality met the requirements, with missing values <5%, and floor and ceiling effects <15%. Item total correlations were all >0.4, ranging from 0.49 to 0.88. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 and 0.95 for the two groups. The test-retest correlation (ICC\u2082.\u2081) was 0.94, and there was a significant improvement as a result of the intervention, with an SRM of 0.43. However, the questionnaire had a higher construct validity with the ASES subscale 'other symptoms' than hypothesized a priori (r(s) 0.75).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Swedish version of the EC-17 met the required recommendations for face validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and responsiveness. Its construct validity needs to be further established, and the questionnaire needs further testing in different groups of patients and in different interventions.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPatient education is important in the follow-up and disease management for patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis. Patients' needs for education and information varies, and it is important that the education is tailored to the individual patient. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate whether patients' educational needs change over time, and which demographic, disease-related or self-management characteristics that are associated with patients' educational needs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Mann-Whitney U-test was used to study patients' longitudinal educational needs and whether their needs change over time, while multivariable linear regression analyses were used to investigate associations between patients' educational needs and demographic variables, disease-related and self-management characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no changes in patients' educational needs in the domains of managing pain, movement, feelings, arthritis process and treatment from health professionals during the study period of seven years. A small decrease in educational needs in the domains self-help measures (p-value 0.047) and support from others (p-value 0.010) was detected. The regression analyses showed that higher educational needs were associated with being female, lower educational level, shorter disease duration, and a lower level of patient activation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with chronic inflammatory arthritis have continual needs for patient education throughout their disease trajectory. Nurses and health care professionals must therefore ask their patients what kind of education they need at every follow-up throughout the disease course.",
