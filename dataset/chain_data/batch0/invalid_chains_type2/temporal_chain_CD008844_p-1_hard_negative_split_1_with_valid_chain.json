        "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of the myocardium and its blood vessels has now been well demonstrated. The cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and stem cell factor may play a role in helping to stimulate cell regeneration under normal physiologic conditions and in patients with myocardial injury. After an ischemic insult, cytokines are released into the peripheral circulation and signal for the mobilization of stem cells. In experimental cardiac injury models, the addition of cytokines has been shown to improve myocardial function with and without the concurrent use of stem cell therapy. Preliminary studies in humans using cytokine therapy alone for treating myocardial infarction have been disappointing. Future studies in patients with myocardial injury need to examine the use of various combinations of cytokines, with and without the addition of intravascular stem cell infusions or direct stem cell injections.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction can lead to irreversible heart failure. In an attempt to restore function in the failing heart, tissue\u2010engineered cardiac constructs can be applied to repopulate scar tissue with a new pool of contractile cells. Effective engineering of viable thick complex tissue\u2010constructs requires intense vascularization. Furthermore, endothelial\u2013cardiomyocyte crosstalk plays a key role in mutually enhancing tissue functionality, which can further improve construct survival. The ability to generate an engineered, vascularized muscle tissue was demonstrated by us using the skeletal and the cardiac muscle models. In the skeletal model, we showed that prevascularization of the construct promoted perfusion of the graft. More recently, we successfully generated a beating human cardiac muscle\u2010construct, containing an endothelial network, by co\u2010culturing human embryonic stem cell\u2013derived\u2010cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells within biodegradable scaffolds. Such muscle\u2010constructs could contribute significantly to the emerging discipline of cardiovascular regenerative medicine as well as to the study of the important role of tissue vascularization.",

        "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an attractive model for designing synthetic scaffolds with a desirable environment for tissue engineering. Here, we report on the synthesis of ECM-mimetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels for inducing endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and capillary-like network formation. A collagen type I-derived peptide GPQGIAGQ (GIA)-containing PEGDA (GIA-PEGDA) was synthesized with the collagenase-sensitive GIA sequence attached in the middle of the PEGDA chain, which was then copolymerized with RGD capped-PEG monoacrylate (RGD-PEGMA) to form biomimetic hydrogels. The hydrogels degraded in vitro with the rate dependent on the concentration of collagenase and also supported the adhesion of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). Biomimetic RGD/GIA-PEGDA hydrogels with incorporation of 1% RGD-PEGDA into GIA-PEGDA hydrogels induced capillary-like organization when HUVECs were seeded on the hydrogel surface, while RGD/PEGDA and GIA-PEGDA hydrogels did not. These results indicate that both cell adhesion and biodegradability of scaffolds play important roles in the formation of capillary-like networks.",

        "title": "Fabrication and Biocompatibility Evaluation of Nanodiamonds-Gelatin Electrospun Materials Designed for Prospective Tissue Regeneration Applications",
        "abstract": "Due to the reduced ability of most harmed tissues to self-regenerate, new strategies are being developed in order to promote self-repair assisted or not by biomaterials, among these tissue engineering (TE). Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) currently represent a promising tool for tissue reconstruction, due to their low immunogenicity, high differentiation potential to multiple cell types and easy harvesting. Gelatin is a natural biocompatible polymer used for regenerative applications, while nanodiamond particles (NDs) are used as reinforcing nanomaterial that might modulate cell behavior, namely cell adhesion, viability, and proliferation. The development of electrospun microfibers loaded with NDs is expected to allow nanomechanical sensing due to local modifications of both nanostructure and stiffness. Two aqueous suspensions with 0.5 and 1% w/v NDs in gelatin from cold water fish skin (FG) were used to generate electrospun meshes. Advanced morpho- and micro-structural characterization revealed homogeneous microfibers. Nanoindentation tests confirmed the reinforcing effect of NDs. Biocompatibility assays showed an increased viability and proliferation profile of hASCs in contact with FG_NDs, correlated with very low cytotoxic effects of the materials. Moreover, hASCs developed an elongated cytoskeleton, suggesting that NDs addition to FG materials encouraged cell adhesion. This study showed the FG_NDs fibrous scaffolds potential for advanced TE applications.",

The effects of both nanofiller and protein concentration on the scaffold morphology, aqueous affinity, size modification at rehydration, and degradation are assessed. Our findings indicate that nanostructuring with low amounts of NDs may modify the fiber properties, including a certain regional parallel orientation of fiber segments. NE-4C cells form dense clusters that strongly adhere to the surface of FG50-based scaffolds, while also increasing FG concentration and adding NDs favor cellular infiltration into the flexible fibrous FG70_NDs nanocomposite. This research illustrates the potential of nanostructured NDs-FG fibers as scaffolds for nerve repair and regeneration. We also emphasize the importance of further understanding the effect of the nanofiller-protein interphase on the microstructure and properties of electrospun fibers and on cell-interactivity.",

        "title": "Polylactic Acid/Polyaniline Nanofibers Subjected to Pre- and Post-Electrospinning Plasma Treatments for Refined Scaffold-Based Nerve Tissue Engineering Applications",
        "abstract": "Composite biopolymer/conducting polymer scaffolds, such as polylactic acid (PLA)/ polyaniline (PAni) nanofibers, have emerged as popular alternative scaffolds in the electrical-sensitive nerve tissue engineering (TE). Although mimicking the extracellular matrix geometry, such scaffolds are highly hydrophobic and usually present an inhomogeneous morphology with massive beads that impede nerve cell-material interactions. Therefore, the present study launches an exclusive combinatorial strategy merging successive pre- and post-electrospinning plasma treatments to cope with these issues. Firstly, an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) treatment was applied on PLA and PLA/PAni solutions prior to electrospinning, enhancing their viscosity and conductivity. These liquid property changes largely eliminated the beaded structures on the nanofibers, leading to uniform and nicely elongated fibers having average diameters between 170 and 230 nm. After electrospinning, the conceived scaffolds were subjected to a N2 dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment, which significantly increased their surface wettability as illustrated by large decreases in water contact angles for values above 125\u00b0 to values below 25\u00b0. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that 3.3% of nitrogen was implanted on the nanofibers surface in the form of C\u2013N and N\u2013C=O functionalities upon DBD treatment. Finally, after seeding pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells on the scaffolds, a greatly enhanced cell adhesion and a more dispersive cell distribution were detected on the DBD-treated samples. Interestingly, when the APPJ treatment was additionally performed, the extension of a high number of long neurites was spotted leading to the formation of a neuronal network between PC-12 cell clusters. In addition, the presence of conducting PAni in the scaffolds further promoted the behavior of PC-12 cells as illustrated by more than a 40% increase in the neurite density without any external electrical stimulation. As such, this work presents a new strategy combining different plasma-assisted biofabrication techniques of conducting nanofibers to create promising scaffolds for electrical-sensitive TE applications.",

        "abstract": "Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS/PANI, a novel hybrid bio-composite scaffold with potential application in dental tissue engineering, was prepared by freeze drying technique. The scaffold was characterized using FT-IR and SEM methods. The effects of PANI on the physicochemical properties of the Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS scaffold were investigated, including changes in swelling ratio, mechanical behavior, density, porosity, biodegradation, and biomineralization. Compared to the Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS scaffold, adding PANI decreased the pore size, porosity, swelling ratio, and biodegradation, while increasing the mechanical strength and biomineralization. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, and adhesion of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) on the scaffolds were investigated by MTT assay and SEM. The Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS/PANI scaffold promoted hDPSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation compared to the Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS scaffold. Alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase activity, and qRT-PCR results revealed that Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS/PANI triggered osteoblast/odontoblast differentiation in hDPSCs through the up-regulation of osteogenic marker genes BGLAP, RUNX2, and SPARC. The significance of this study lies in developing a novel scaffold that synergistically combines the beneficial properties of Fe-Ca-SAPO-34, chitosan, and PANI to create an optimized microenvironment for dental tissue regeneration. These findings highlight the potential of the Fe-Ca-SAPO-34/CS/PANI scaffold as a promising biomaterial for dental tissue engineering applications, paving the way for future research and clinical translation in regenerative dentistry.",
