        "abstract": "Background: Many clinical trials have been conducted to verify the effects of interventions for prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) using different treatments and outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications (LM) with other treatments in persons at high risk of T2D by a network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods: Searches were performed of PUBMED up to January 2018 to identify randomized controlled trials. The odds ratio (OR) with onset of T2D at 1 year in the intervention group (LM, dietary, exercise, or medication) versus a control group (standard treatments or placebo) were the effect sizes. Frequentist and Bayesian NMAs were conducted. Results: Forty-seven interventions and 12 treatments (20,113 participants) were used for the analyses. The OR in the LM was approximately 0.46 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.61) times lower compared to the standard intervention by the Bayesian approach. The effects of LM compared to other treatments by indirect comparisons were not significant. Conclusions: This meta-analysis further strengthened the evidence that LM reduces the onset of T2D compared to standard and placebo interventions and appears to be at least as effective as nine other treatments in preventing T2D.",

        "title": "Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Objective To evaluate the associations between prediabetes and the risk of all cause mortality and incident cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Design Updated meta-analysis. Data sources Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) up to 25 April 2020. Review methods Prospective cohort studies or post hoc analysis of clinical trials were included for analysis if they reported adjusted relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios of all cause mortality or cardiovascular disease for prediabetes compared with normoglycaemia. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. Random effects models were used to calculate the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. The primary outcomes were all cause mortality and composite cardiovascular disease. The secondary outcomes were the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Results A total of 129 studies were included, involving 10\u2009069\u2009955 individuals for analysis. In the general population, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.17), composite cardiovascular disease (1.15, 1.11 to 1.18), coronary heart disease (1.16, 1.11 to 1.21), and stroke (1.14, 1.08 to 1.20) in a median follow-up time of 9.8 years. Compared with normoglycaemia, the absolute risk difference in prediabetes for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke was 7.36 (95% confidence interval 9.59 to 12.51), 8.75 (6.41 to 10.49), 6.59 (4.53 to 8.65), and 3.68 (2.10 to 5.26) per 10\u2009000 person years, respectively. Impaired glucose tolerance carried a higher risk of all cause mortality, coronary heart disease, and stroke than impaired fasting glucose. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.54), composite cardiovascular disease (1.37, 1.23 to 1.53), and coronary heart disease (1.15, 1.02 to 1.29) in a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, but no difference was seen for the risk of stroke (1.05, 0.81 to 1.36). Compared with normoglycaemia, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the absolute risk difference in prediabetes for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke was 66.19 (95% confidence interval 38.60 to 99.25), 189.77 (117.97 to 271.84), 40.62 (5.42 to 78.53), and 8.54 (32.43 to 61.45) per 10 000 person years, respectively. No significant heterogeneity was found for the risk of all outcomes seen for the different definitions of prediabetes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (all P>0.10). Conclusions Results indicated that prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Screening and appropriate management of prediabetes might contribute to primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

        "title": "Addressing the Continuum of Dysglycaemia and Vascular Complications in Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes: Need for Early and Intensive Treatment",
        "abstract": "Abstract The onset of type 2 diabetes increases the risk of vascular complications and death. We know now that that this risk begins long before the diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are not separate entities in practice and exist within a continuum of dysglycaemia and vascular risk that increases in severity over time. This excess risk requires early intervention with lifestyle therapy supported with pharmacologic antidiabetic therapy, intensified promptly where necessary throughout the duration of the diabetes continuum. Metformin is an evidence-based treatment for preventing prediabetes and improves cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes from diagnosis onwards. Newer agents (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists) are appropriate for people presenting with type 2 diabetes and significant cardiovascular comorbidity. Additional therapies should be used without delay to achieve patients\u2019 individualised HbA1c goals and to minimise cardiovascular risk.",

        "title": "Modern-Day Management of the Dysglycemic Continuum: An Expert Viewpoint from the Arabian Gulf",
        "abstract": "Abstract Prediabetes is the first stage of a continuum that extends through the diagnosis of clinical type 2 diabetes towards long-standing diabetes with multiple comorbidities. The diagnosis of prediabetes provides an opportunity to interrupt the diabetes continuum at an early stage to ensure long-term optimization of clinical outcomes. All people with prediabetes should receive intervention to improve their lifestyles (quality of diet and level of physical activity), as this has been proven beyond doubt to reduce substantially the risk of conversion to diabetes. Additionally, a large base of clinical evidence supports the use of metformin in preventing or delaying the transition from prediabetes to clinical type 2 diabetes, for some people with prediabetes. For many years, guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes focused on lowering blood glucose, with metformin prescribed first for those without contraindications. More recently, guidelines have shifted towards prevention of diabetes complications as the primary goal, with increased use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (or multi-agonist incretin peptides) or SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease. Access to these medications often remains challenging. Metformin remains a suitable option for initial pharmacologic intervention to manage glycemia for many people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes along with other therapy to maintain control of blood glucose or to address specific comorbidities as the patient progresses along the diabetes continuum.",
