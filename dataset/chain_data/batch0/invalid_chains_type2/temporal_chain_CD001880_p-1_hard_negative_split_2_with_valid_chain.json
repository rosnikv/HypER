        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo study appetite and food choices in lean elderly women at the time of a femoral neck fracture and after 6 months of nutritional and anabolic intervention.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nForty-five nondemented women >70 years of age (mean +/- SD: 83 +/- 5 years) with a recent hip fracture and body mass index <24 kg/m2 (mean: 20.5 +/- 2.3) were interviewed about their appetite and dietary habits prior to fracture. The patients were randomized to treatment with a protein-rich liquid supplement (PR; 200 kcal and 20 g protein day(-1)) alone or in combination with nandrolone decanoate injections (PR/N) 25 mg i.m. every third week or to a control group (C). A second interview was conducted 6 months later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReduced appetite before the fracture was reported by 60%. Half of the patients did not have dessert with any of their daily meals, one-third used low-fat margarines and one-third drank water with their meals. The estimated mean daily energy intake was 6.4 +/- 1.2 MJ (1541 +/- 304 kcal) indicating that three of four subjects did not meet their energy needs. At 6 months, 40% reported reduced appetite. There was no difference in the change of appetite between the three randomized groups. Still, half of the subjects appeared to not meet their energy needs. Protein intake increased in the PR and PR/N groups, in contrast to the controls (P = 0.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReduced appetite and insufficient energy intake was recorded in lean elderly women with a femoral neck fracture. Nutritional supplementation alone or in combination with an anabolic steroid increased protein intake without adversely affecting appetite.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine oral nutritional intake in the perioperative phase in elderly hip fracture patients treated according to a well-defined multi-modal rehabilitation program, including unselected oral nutritional supplementation, and to identify independent risk factors for insufficient nutritional intake.\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective, descriptive.\n\n\nSETTING\nA specialised hip fracture unit at the department of orthopaedic surgery in a university hospital.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nTwo hundred and sixty-two consecutive, unselected elderly hip fracture patients.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nPatients were treated according to a well-defined multi-modal care and nutrition plan comprising early surgery, short fasting period, supplementary protein drinks, epidural anaesthesia and analgesia, standardised fluid and transfusion protocols and aggressive mobilisation and physiotherapy. All nutritional intake during the first three post-operative days was recorded, as well as post-operative morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNutritional energy intake during the first three post-operative days was median 90% of BMR and 86% of recommended protein intake. The independent risk factors for an insufficient energy intake were perioperative medical complications, and no association between low nutritional intake in the perioperative phase and the commonly used predictors of low BMI or albumin on admission was found.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPerioperative medical complications and dementia restricted nutritional intake in the perioperative phase. These factors help identify hip fracture patients in whom increased nutritional support is necessary.",

However, the focus is on perioperative oral nutrition, which is a different context, but still uses the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis."

        "title": "Anaesthesia for the patient with dementia undergoing outpatient surgery",
        "abstract": "Purpose of review Dementia is common in elderly patients, and anaesthesiologists are increasingly challenged in managing these patients who are especially vulnerable. The aim of this article is to highlight some of the most important perioperative issues relating to demented patients, both regarding anaesthesia and other aspects that should be considered to ensure a quick and uncomplicated recovery. Recent findings Demented patients often receive prescribed medication that can interact with various anaesthetic drugs and cause serious side effects. The anaesthesiologist should consider this when choosing the drugs used during surgery and when relieving postoperative pain. Generally, hypnotics, opioids, and inhalational anaesthetics should be administered in lower doses and carefully titrated because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics leading to a great variability, as documented in elderly patients. Neuromuscular blocking agents, and especially rocuronium, display an increased variability in the duration of action, but the new drug sugammadex may reverse the neuromuscular block in a few minutes. Postoperative cognitive decline is more frequent in elderly patients with preexisting cognitive impairment and several preventive measurements can be provided. Summary Outpatient surgery for demented patients causes many concerns in relation to anaesthesia. Extensive drug-related problems may arise and restrictive drug usage is recommended to avoid serious complications.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the perioperative issues related to demented patients, including the importance of considering their prescribed medication and potential interactions with anaesthetic drugs. The source paper identifies dementia as a risk factor for insufficient perioperative oral nutrition, and this paper provides more in-depth information on the challenges of managing demented patients in the perioperative period. The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it builds on the idea that dementia is a significant factor in the perioperative period."

        "title": "Anesthesia for the patient with dementia.",
        "abstract": "With a growing aging population, more patients suffering from dementia are expected to undergo surgery, thus being exposed to either general or regional anesthesia. This calls for specific attention ranging from the legal aspects of obtaining informed consent in demented patients to deciding on the use of premedication, choice of anesthetics, and management of postoperative pain. This review reflects on both general considerations concerning geriatric patients but also on the specific features of perioperatively used drugs and anesthetics that might have an impact on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
