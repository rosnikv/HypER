        "abstract": "Lack of predictability in the clinical course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is but one of several factors that challenge our ability to treat this condition effectively. A further consideration is the aetiopathogenesis of the disease which, for all practical purposes, remains obscure. While several strands of evidence point to an infectious agent as a likely mediator of joint inflammation, no specific microorganisms have ever been unequivocally linked to the causation of RA.'\"2 Immune mechanisms almost certainly play a role in the initiation and perpetuation of rheumatoid synovitis, but a convincing unifying hypothesis that accounts for all of the disparate elements of the process is still awaited.2'3 The disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or slow acting antirheumatic drugs, are so named because it is thought that they modify the progression of RA by (i) favourably altering the natural history of the disease, or (ii) slowing the development ofjoint erosions or joint destruction, as measured on joint radiographs.4 These agents are a diverse group of compounds that produce a common pattern of clinical response when used to treat RA. They can be broadly divided into two groups. In group",

        "explanation": "This paper is a review of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate, and discusses their use in the management of rheumatoid arthritis. However, it does not specifically build upon the findings of the source paper, nor does it use the source paper as a sub-hypothesis."
