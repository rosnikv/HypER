        "title": "Gastrointestinal toxicity with celecoxib vs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: the CLASS study: A randomized controlled trial. Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nConventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000.\n\n\nSETTING\nThree hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nIncidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255",

        "title": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a critical review on current concepts applied to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide. Nevertheless, their intake is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects, representing still an important medical and socio-economic problem. In recent years efforts focused on the development of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors with an improved gastric tolerability profile. However, severe cardiovascular adverse reactions challenged the initial enthusiasm in this new class of anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, the market withdrawals of some coxibs led to a relative reluctance in prescribing COX-2 inhibitors in clinical practice. As a consequence, the interest for alternative approaches to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with NSAIDs has re-emerged. There are two main components of gastric damaging properties of NSAIDs: (1) the acute toxicity associated with the short-term intake of NSAIDs, which is principally caused by local irritation of the gastric mucosa (2) the chronic toxicity resulting mainly from systemic effects associated with prolonged administration of NSAIDs. Based on that background two different approaches were pursued in the search for GI sparing NSAIDs: a) modification of classical NSAIDs by associating them with phospholipids, cyclodextrins, or chemical moieties that release gastroprotective mediators and b) defining novel targets as well as developing new compounds like dual COX/5-LO or mPGES-1 inhibitors. This review provides the first comprehensive overview of all currently applied approaches taken to improve the risk-benefit ratio of NSAIDs focusing on the structure activity relationships and the respective mechanism of action underlying the individual approaches. The insight gained in this review is useful for further research activity in this field.",

        "title": "Antiplatelet Agents Do Not Impact the Hospital Course in Patients With Gastrointestinal Bleeding",
        "abstract": "Background Use of antiplatelet agents (APAs) have been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding despite their cardiovascular benefits. Aim To understand the impact of APAs, we assessed the outcomes in patients admitted with acute GI bleeding to our hospital. We hypothesized there is no difference among GI bleeders admitted to the hospital while bleeding on or off APAs. Methods In an observational prospective cohort study, 104 sequential patients admitted with a diagnosis of GI bleeding were followed. Patients were classified as either on APA or not. Results Thirty of 104 (29%) patients were on long-term aspirin and/or clopidogrel on admission and 5 were taking nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, total of 35 (34%). There was no difference between patients using APA and those not using APA with regard to admission hemoglobin, age, presentation, source of bleed, total number of units transfused, intensive care unit admission rates, and overall length of stay. There was, however, a significant difference in the presence of hemodynamic compromise on initial presentation, with a higher proportion of APA users being orthostatic (51.4% vs 26% in nonusers, with P=0.02, by Fisher exact test). Clopidogrel was safely restarted in high-risk patients with significant cardiac history. Conclusions This study demonstrated that APA use did not significantly alter the course or outcome in GI bleeders admitted to our institution during their hospital stay.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the impact of antiplatelet agents (APAs) on gastrointestinal bleeding. While APAs are related to NSAIDs, the focus of this paper is on the clinical outcomes of patients with GI bleeding, rather than on the reduction of gastrointestinal toxicity associated with NSAIDs. Therefore, the connection to the source paper is limited."
