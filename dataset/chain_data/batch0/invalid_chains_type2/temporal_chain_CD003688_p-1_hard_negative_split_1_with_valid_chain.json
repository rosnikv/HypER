        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nBecause of the unpredictability people with arthritis face on a daily basis, patient education programmes have become an effective complement to traditional medical treatment giving people with arthritis the strategies and the tools necessary to make daily decisions to cope with the disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness of patient education interventions on health status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. A selection of review articles (see references) were examined to identify further relevant publications. There was no language restriction.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCT's) evaluating patient education interventions that included an instructional component and a non-intervention control group; pre- and post-test results available separately for RA, either in the publication or from the studies' authors; and study results presented in full, end-of-study report.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThirty-one studies with relevant data were included. We found significant effects of patient education at first follow-up for scores on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status, and depression. A trend favouring patient education was found for scores on pain. Physician global assessment was not assessed in any of the included studies. The dimensions of anxiety and disease activity showed no significant effects. At final follow up no significant effects of patient education were found, although there was a trend favouring patient education for scores on disability.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nPatient education as provided in the studies reviewed here had small short-term effects on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status and depression. There was no evidence of long-term benefits in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "title": "Rehabilitation in rheumatoid arthritis: a critical review.",
        "abstract": "This article considers the evidence for effectiveness and timing of rehabilitation for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Cochrane Library, DARE, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and AMED were searched to identify systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials evaluating rehabilitation interventions for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Many trials identified had methodological limitations (e.g. short follow-up periods, small sample sizes). Evidence to date is that symptomatic relief results from thermotherapy, laser therapy, acupuncture and assistive devices. In the short-term, comprehensive occupational therapy (in established rheumatoid arthritis), orthoses, and mind-body approaches can help maintain function. Over at least a one-year period, the following are effective in reducing pain and maintaining function: patient education and joint protection training using behavioural approaches; dynamic exercise therapy, hand exercises and hydrotherapy; and cognitive-behavioural therapy (in people with poorer psychological status). Many trials have recruited people with moderate to severe, established RA and relatively little is known about the long-term effectiveness of early rehabilitation, although this is becoming much more common in practice. Despite the increased availability of guidelines and systematic reviews, most conclude there is insufficient evidence for many areas of rheumatology rehabilitation. Further well-designed clinical trials are needed recruiting people with early disease using patient-centred outcomes.",
