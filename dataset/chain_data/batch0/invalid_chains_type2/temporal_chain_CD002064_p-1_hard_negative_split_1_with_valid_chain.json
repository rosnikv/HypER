        "abstract": "Troglitazone (TGZ), an antidiabetic drug that improves insulin\u2010resistance in the peripheral tissues, was tested for neurotrophic activity in motoneurones and other neurones in culture. In rat motoneurones, TGZ had a remarkable effect on survival, which was comparable or superior to that of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor, a known potent neurotrophic factor for rat motoneurones. However, TGZ did not promote the survival of sensory, sympathetic, septal or hippocampal neurones. The effect of TGZ on motoneurones was additive to that of insulin\u2010like growth factor\u2010I and both activities were inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3\u2010kinase) inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, suggesting the involvement of the activation of PI3\u2010kinase in the activity of TGZ. Pioglitazone, another antidiabetic drug structurally similar to TGZ, did not show any activity, indicating that the agonistic activity of TGZ for peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 is not involved in the survival activity. Chromanol, an antioxidant moiety of TGZ, showed little or no survival activity. These results indicate specific neurotrophic activity of TGZ for motoneurones through the activation of PI3\u2010kinase and support the applicability of TGZ for the treatment of motor neurone diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is the target of the insulin sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glaucoma and other retinal disorders are some of the major complications in diabetes. In the present study, the role that PPAR-gamma ligands play in protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) against glutamate insult was explored.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTransformed rat RGC (RGC-5 cells) and two PPAR-gamma agonists, 15-deoxy-D(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone were used. RGC-5 cells were incubated with either of the PPAR-gamma ligands and were exposed to either L-glutamic acid or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Cell viability was determined with the neutral red dye uptake assay. Levels of PPAR-gamma receptor proteins were monitored by immunoblot analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGlutamate treatment resulted in RGC-5 cell death, and both 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone protected the RGC-5 cells from glutamate cytotoxicity. The neuroprotective concentrations of both compounds ranged from approximately 1 to 5 micro M. Troglitazone further protected against BSO toxicity, whereas 15d-PGJ2 did not. Glutamate treatment appears to exert its cytotoxicity through oxidative damage, because pretreatment of RGC-5 cells with the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and thiourea resulted in the reversal of glutamate cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the glutamate effect was not reversed by pretreatment with MK801 or DL-threo-betabenzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA), suggesting that glutamate cytotoxicity is not mediated through the NMDA receptor and/or glutamate transporter, respectively. Levels of PPAR-gamma receptor protein did not show any appreciable change in response to glutamate exposure, with or without 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTwo PPAR-gamma ligands, 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, protect RGC-5, an established transformed rat retinal ganglion cell line, against glutamate cytotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of the two compounds appear to be mediated through an antioxidant rather than a PPAR-gamma-dependent pathway. These results suggest that PPAR-gamma agonists, in addition to improving insulin sensitivity, may also provide a valuable antioxidant benefit that could prove valuable in targeting ocular complications including glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nApoptosis-related signaling pathways were investigated in a cultured rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC-5) line deprived of growth factors after serum withdrawal from the culture medium.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRGC-5 cells were subjected to serum deprivation for 2 to 6 days and compared with RGC-5 cells cultured in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell viability was determined by a neutral red dye uptake assay. Apoptosis of RGC-5 cells was established by DNA laddering. The expression of various apoptosis-related genes was investigated by immunoblot analysis, and or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The redox state of the cell was determined by biochemical methods, including NF-kappaB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) and mitochondrial damage by JC-1 (5,5', 6,6'-tetrachloro 1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide) staining, using live cell confocal microscopy and cytosolic release of cytochrome c.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty percent cell loss was evident after 2 days of serum deprivation, as demonstrated by neutral red dye uptake assay. This cell loss was due to apoptotic cell death, as established by DNA laddering. The oxidative state of serum-deprived RGC-5 cells was perturbed as suggested by the increase in malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in cell lysates. The apoptosis of the RGC-5 cells was associated with the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and increased levels of Bax with corresponding decreases in Bcl-2 levels and NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity. Serum deprivation was also associated with a loss of mitochondrial function, as revealed by cytosolic release of cytochrome c and JC-1 staining of mitochondria of dying RGC-5 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaken together, these results indicate that serum withdrawal induces apoptotic cell death in RGC-5 cells via mitochondrial pathways. These studies lead to the speculation that growth factor deprivation arising from blockade of retrograde transport of neurotrophins may involve similar mechanism(s) of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nMitochondrial fission is a cellular response to stress that has an important role in neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elevated hydrostatic pressure induces mitochondrial fission and dysfunction in cultured retinal ganglion cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRGC-5 cells were differentiated with succinyl concanavalin A (50 microg/mL) and transferred to a pressurized incubator in which 30 mm Hg of pressure was applied for 1, 2, or 3 days. As a control, differentiated cells from an identical passage were incubated simultaneously in a conventional incubator at each of the time points. Live RGC-5 cells were then labeled with a red fluorescent mitochondrial dye and mitochondrial morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. After elevated hydrostatic pressure, the cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were also measured by a luciferase-based assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMitochondrial fission, characterized by the conversion of tubular fused mitochondria into isolated small organelles, was triggered in >74.3% +/- 1.9% of mitochondria at 3 days after elevated hydrostatic pressure. Only 4.7% +/- 1.4% of nonpressurized control cells displayed mitochondrial fission after 3 days. Electron microscopy showed that elevated hydrostatic pressure for 3 days induced abnormal cristae depletion and decreased the length of the mitochondria. On elevation of hydrostatic pressure, the fission-linked protein, Drp-1 was translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Elevated hydrostatic pressure also resulted in a significant, time-dependent reduction of cellular ATP.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nElevated hydrostatic pressure triggered mitochondrial fission, abnormal cristae depletion, Drp-1 translocation, and cellular ATP reduction in differentiated RGC-5 cells. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the cellular response to elevated pressure including mitochondrial fission may provide new therapeutic targets for protecting RGCs from elevated hydrostatic pressure.",

Open angle glaucoma prevalence and incidence increase exponentially with increasing age, yet the pathophysiology underlying increasing age as a risk factor for glaucoma is not well understood. Accumulating evidence points to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction playing a key role in the etiology of other neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. The 2 major functions of mitochondria are the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and the regulation of cell death by apoptosis. This review details evidence to support our hypothesis that age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction renders RGCs susceptible to glaucomatous injury by reducing the energy available for repair processes and predisposing RGCs to apoptosis.

        "abstract": "The visual system is one of the most energetically demanding systems in the brain. The currency of energy is ATP, which is generated most efficiently from oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria. ATP supports multiple neuronal functions. Foremost is repolarization of the membrane potential after depolarization. Neuronal activity, ATP generation, blood flow, oxygen consumption, glucose utilization, and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism are all interrelated. In the retina, phototransduction, neurotransmitter utilization, and protein/organelle transport are energy-dependent, yet repolarization-after-depolarization consumes the bulk of the energy. Repolarization in photoreceptor inner segments maintains the dark current. Repolarization by all neurons along the visual pathway following depolarizing excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission preserves cellular integrity and permits reactivation. The higher metabolic activity in the magno- versus the parvo-cellular pathway, the ON- versus the OFF-pathway in some (and the reverse in other) species, and in specialized functional representations in the visual cortex all reflect a greater emphasis on the processing of specific visual attributes. Neuronal activity and energy metabolism are tightly coupled processes at the cellular and even at the molecular levels. Deficiencies in energy metabolism, such as in diabetes, mitochondrial DNA mutation, mitochondrial protein malfunction, and oxidative stress can lead to retinopathy, visual deficits, neuronal degeneration, and eventual blindness.",

        "title": "Low-level light therapy of the eye and brain.",
        "abstract": "Low-level light therapy (LLLT) using red to near-infrared light energy has gained attention in recent years as a new scientific approach with therapeutic applications in ophthalmology, neurology, and psychiatry. The ongoing therapeutic revolution spearheaded by LLLT is largely propelled by progress in the basic science fields of photobiology and bioenergetics. This paper describes the mechanisms of action of LLLT at the molecular, cellular, and nervous tissue levels. Photoneuromodulation of cytochrome oxidase activity is the most important primary mechanism of action of LLLT. Cytochrome oxidase is the primary photoacceptor of light in the red to near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is also a key mitochondrial enzyme for cellular bioenergetics, especially for nerve cells in the retina and the brain. Evidence shows that LLLT can secondarily enhance neural metabolism by regulating mitochondrial function, intraneuronal signaling systems, and redox states. Current knowledge about LLLT dosimetry relevant for its hormetic effects on nervous tissue, including noninvasive in vivo retinal and transcranial effects, is also presented. Recent research is reviewed that supports LLLT potential benefits in retinal disease, stroke, neurotrauma, neurodegeneration, and memory and mood disorders. Since mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in neurodegeneration, LLLT has potential significant applications against retinal and brain damage by counteracting the consequences of mitochondrial failure. Upon transcranial delivery in vivo, LLLT induces brain metabolic and antioxidant beneficial effects, as measured by increases in cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities. Increases in cerebral blood flow and cognitive functions induced by LLLT have also been observed in humans. Importantly, LLLT given at energy densities that exert beneficial effects does not induce adverse effects. This highlights the value of LLLT as a novel paradigm to treat visual, neurological, and psychological conditions, and supports that neuronal energy metabolism could constitute a major target for neurotherapeutics of the eye and brain.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hypometabolism characterizes mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) enhances the metabolic capacity of neurons in culture through photostimulation of cytochrome oxidase, the mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes oxygen consumption in cellular respiration. Growing evidence supports that neuronal metabolic enhancement by LLLT positively impacts neuronal function in vitro and in vivo. Based on its effects on energy metabolism, it is proposed that LLLT will also affect the cerebral cortex in vivo and modulate higher-order cognitive functions such as memory. In vivo effects of LLLT on brain and behavior are poorly characterized. We tested the hypothesis that in vivo LLLT facilitates cortical oxygenation and metabolic energy capacity and thereby improves memory retention. Specifically, we tested this hypothesis in rats using fear extinction memory, a form of memory modulated by prefrontal cortex activation. Effects of LLLT on brain metabolism were determined through measurement of prefrontal cortex oxygen concentration with fluorescent quenching oximetry and by quantitative cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Experiment 1 verified that LLLT increased the rate of oxygen consumption in the prefrontal cortex in vivo. Experiment 2 showed that LLLT-treated rats had an enhanced extinction memory as compared to controls. Experiment 3 showed that LLLT reduced fear renewal and prevented the reemergence of extinguished conditioned fear responses. Experiment 4 showed that LLLT induced hormetic dose-response effects on the metabolic capacity of the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest that LLLT can enhance cortical metabolic capacity and retention of extinction memories, and implicate LLLT as a novel intervention to improve memory.",

        "abstract": "Discovering that transcranial infrared laser stimulation produces beneficial effects on frontal cortex functions such as sustained attention, working memory, and affective state has been groundbreaking. Transcranial laser stimulation with low-power density (mW/cm2) and high-energy density (J/cm2) monochromatic light in the near-infrared wavelengths modulates brain functions and may produce neurotherapeutic effects in a nondestructive and non-thermal manner (Lampl, 2007; Hashmi et al., 2010). Barrett and Gonzalez-Lima (2013) provided the first controlled study showing that transcranial laser stimulation improves human cognitive and emotional brain functions. But for the field of low-level light/laser therapy (LLLT), development of a model of how luminous energy from red-to-near-infrared wavelengths modulates bioenergetics began with in vitro and in vivo discoveries in the last 40 years. Previous LLLT reviews have provided extensive background about historical developments, principles and applications (Rojas and Gonzalez-Lima, 2011, 2013; Chung et al., 2012). The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on LLLT's neurochemical mechanisms supporting transcranial laser stimulation for cognitive-enhancing applications. We will explain first LLLT's action on brain bioenergetics, briefly describe its bioavailability and dose-response, and finish with its beneficial effects on cognitive functions. Although our focus is on prefrontal-related cognitive functions, in principle LLLT should be able to modulate other brain functions. For example, stimulating different brain regions should affect different functions related to sensory and motor systems.",

A reliable measure of this general ability, also known as intelligence, can be derived from scores across a diverse set of cognitive tasks. There is great interest in understanding the neural underpinnings of individual differences in intelligence, since it is the single best predictor of longterm life success. The most replicated neural correlate of human intelligence to date is total brain volume; however, this coarse morphometric correlate says little about function. Here we ask whether measurements of the activity of the resting brain (resting-state fMRI) might also carry information about intelligence. We used the final release of the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (N=884 subjects after exclusions), providing a full hour of resting-state fMRI per subject; controlled for gender, age, and brain volume; and derived a reliable estimate of general intelligence from scores on multiple cognitive tasks. Using a cross-validated predictive framework, we predicted 20% of the variance in general intelligence in the sampled population from their resting-state connectivity matrices.

        "abstract": "Abstract Scores on intelligence tests are strongly predictive of various important life outcomes. However, the gender discrepancy on intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction using brain imaging variables has not been studied. To this aim, we predicted individual IQ scores for males and females separately using whole-brain functional connectivity (FC). Robust predictions of intellectual capabilities were achieved across three independent data sets (680 subjects) and two intelligence measurements (IQ and fluid intelligence) using the same model within each gender. Interestingly, we found that intelligence of males and females were underpinned by different neurobiological correlates, which are consistent with their respective superiority in cognitive domains (visuospatial vs verbal ability). In addition, the identified FC patterns are uniquely predictive on IQ and its sub-domain scores only within the same gender but neither for the opposite gender nor on the IQ-irrelevant measures such as temperament traits. Moreover, females exhibit significantly higher IQ predictability than males in the discovery cohort. This findings facilitate our understanding of the biological basis of intelligence by demonstrating that intelligence is underpinned by a variety of complex neural mechanisms that engage an interacting network of regions\u2014particularly prefrontal\u2013parietal and basal ganglia\u2014whereas the network pattern differs between genders.",

The objective of our study is to evaluate traditional and non-traditional eloquent areas in brain tumor patients using a machine-learning platform. Methods We retrospectively included patients who underwent surgery for brain tumor resection at our Institution. Preoperative MRI with T1-weighted and DTI sequences were uploaded into the Quicktome platform. We categorized the integrity of nine large-scale brain networks: language, sensorimotor, visual, ventral attention, central executive, default mode, dorsal attention, salience and limbic. Network integrity was correlated with preoperative clinical data. Results One-hundred patients were included in the study. The most affected network was the central executive network (49%), followed by the default mode network (43%) and dorsal attention network (32%). Patients with preoperative deficits showed a significantly higher number of altered networks before the surgery (3.42 vs 2.19, P < .001), compared to patients without deficits. Furthermore, we found that patients without neurologic deficits had an average 2.19 networks affected and 1.51 networks at-risk, with most of them being related to non-traditional eloquent areas (P < .001). Conclusion Our results show that large-scale brain networks are frequently affected in patients with brain tumors, even when presenting without evident neurologic deficits. In our study, the most commonly affected brain networks were related to non-traditional eloquent areas. Integrating non-invasive brain mapping machine-learning techniques into the clinical setting may help elucidate how to preserve higher-order cognitive functions associated with those networks.",

        "title": "Connectome-Based Neurosurgery in Primary Intra-Axial Neoplasms: Beyond the Traditional Modular Conception of Brain Architecture for the Preservation of Major Neurological Domains and Higher-Order Cognitive Functions",
        "abstract": "Despite the therapeutical advancements in the surgical treatment of primary intra-axial neoplasms, which determined both a significative improvement in OS and QoL and a reduction in the incidence of surgery-induced major neurological deficits, nowadays patients continue to manifest subtle post-operative neurocognitive impairments, preventing them from a full reintegration back into social life and into the workforce. The birth of connectomics paved the way for a profound reappraisal of the traditional conception of brain architecture, in favour of a model based on large-scale structural and functional interactions of a complex mosaic of cortical areas organized in a fluid network interconnected by subcortical bundles. Thanks to these advancements, neurosurgery is facing a new era of connectome-based resections, in which the core principle is still represented by the achievement of an ideal onco-functional balance, but with a closer eye on whole-brain circuitry, which constitutes the foundations of both major neurological functions, to be intended as motricity; language and visuospatial function; and higher-order cognitive functions such as cognition, conation, emotion and adaptive behaviour. Indeed, the achievement of an ideal balance between the radicality of tumoral resection and the preservation, as far as possible, of the integrity of local and global brain networks stands as a mandatory goal to be fulfilled to allow patients to resume their previous life and to make neurosurgery tailored and gentler to their individual needs.",
