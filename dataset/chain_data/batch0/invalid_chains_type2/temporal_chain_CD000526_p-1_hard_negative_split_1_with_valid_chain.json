        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of adjunctive prednisolone on morbidity, pericardial fluid resolution, and mortality in HIV seropositive patients with effusive tuberculous pericarditis. DESIGN Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial. SETTING Two medical school affiliated referral hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. PATIENTS 58 HIV seropositive patients aged 18\u201355 years with tuberculous pericarditis. INTERVENTIONS All patients received standard short course antituberculous chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to receive prednisolone or placebo for six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical improvement, echocardiographic and radiologic pericardial fluid resolution, and death. RESULTS 29 patients were assigned to prednisolone and 29 to placebo. After 18 months of follow up there were five deaths in the prednisolone treated group and 10 deaths in the placebo group. Mortality was significantly lower in the prednisolone group (log rank \u03c72\u2009=\u20098.19, df\u2009=\u20091, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Resolution of raised jugular venous pressure (p\u2009=\u20090.017), hepatomegaly (p\u2009=\u20090.007), and ascites (p\u2009=\u20090.015), and improvement in physical activity (p\u2009=\u20090.02), were significantly more rapid in the prednisolone treated patients. However, there was no difference in the rate of radiologic and echocardiographic resolution of pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive prednisolone for effusive tuberculous pericarditis produced a pronounced reduction in mortality. It is suggested prednisolone should be added to standard short course chemotherapy to treat HIV related effusive tuberculous pericarditis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is controversy regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids in tuberculous pericarditis, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised by HIV.\n\n\nAIM\nTo determine the effectiveness of adjuvant corticosteroids in tuberculous pericarditis.\n\n\nDESIGN\nSystematic review of randomized controlled trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (June 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2003), EMBASE (1980 to May 2002), and the reference lists of existing reviews, for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of adjuvant corticosteroids in the treatment of suspected tuberculous pericarditis. We also contacted organizations and individuals working in the field. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used meta-analysis with a fixed effects model to calculate the summary statistics, provided there was no statistically significant heterogeneity, and expressed results as relative risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFour trials with a total of 469 participants met our criteria. Three (total n = 411) tested adjuvant steroids in participants with suspected tuberculous pericarditis in the pre-HIV era. Fewer participants died in the intervention group, but the potentially large reduction in mortality was not statistically significant (relative risk RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.36-1.16, n = 350; p = 0.14). One trial with 58 patients that enrolled HIV-positive individuals also showed a promising but non-significant trend on mortality (RR 0.50, 95%CI 0.19-1.28; p = 0.15). There was no significant beneficial effect of steroids on re-accumulation of pericardial effusion or progression to constrictive pericarditis. Patients with pericardial effusion were significantly more likely to be alive with no functional impairment at 2 years following treatment. However, the effect was not sustained in a sensitivity analysis that included patients who were lost to follow-up.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nSteroids could have large beneficial effects on mortality and morbidity in tuberculous pericarditis, but published trials are too small to be conclusive. Large placebo-controlled trials are required, and should include sufficient numbers of HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants, and an adequate adjuvant steroid dose.",

        "title": "Tuberculous Pericarditis in Childhood: A Case Report and a Systematic Literature Review",
        "abstract": "Tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) is an important cause of pericarditis worldwide while being infrequent in childhood, especially in low-TB-incidence countries. We report a case of TBP and provide a systematic review of the literature, conducted by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane to find cases of TBP in pediatric age published in the English language between the year 1990 and the time of the search. Of the 587 search results obtained, after screening and a backward citation search, 45 studies were selected to be included in this review, accounting for a total of 125 patients. The main signs and symptoms were fever, cough, weight loss, hepatomegaly, dyspnea, and increased jugular venous pressure or jugular vein turgor. A definitive diagnosis of TBP was made in 36 patients, either thanks to microbiological investigations, histological analysis, or both. First-line antitubercular treatment (ATT) was administered in nearly all cases, and 69 children underwent surgical procedures. Only six patients died, and only two died of TBP. TBP in childhood is relatively uncommon, even in high-TB-prevalence countries. Clinical manifestations, often suggestive of right-sided cardiac failure, are subtle, and diagnosis is challenging. TBP has an excellent prognosis in childhood; however, in a significant proportion of cases, invasive surgical procedures are necessary.",
