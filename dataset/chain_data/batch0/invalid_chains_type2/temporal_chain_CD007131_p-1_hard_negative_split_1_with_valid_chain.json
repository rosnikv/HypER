        "title": "Effects of a CHANGE intervention to increase exercise maintenance following cardiac events",
        "abstract": "Background: Despite participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program, there is a downward trajectory of exercise participation during the year following a cardiac event.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of CHANGE (Change Habits by Applying New Goals and Experiences), a lifestyle modification program designedto increase exercise maintenance in the year following a cardiac rehabilitation program. The CHANGE intervention consists of 5 small-group cognitive-behavioral change counseling sessions in which participants are taught self-efficacy enhancement, problem-solving skills, and relapse prevention strategies to address exercise maintenance problems.Method: Participants (N = 250) were randomly assigned to the CHANGE intervention (supplemental to usual care) or a usual-care-only group. Exercise was measured using portable wristwatch heart rate monitors worn during exercise for 1 year. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine differences in exercise over the study year between the study groups.Results: Participants in the usual-care group were 76% more likely than those in the CHANGE group to stop exercising during the year following a cardiac rehabilitation program (hazard ratio = 1.76, 95% confidence interval = 1.08\u20132.86, p = .02) when adjusting for the significant covariates race, gender, comorbidity, muscle and joint pain, and baseline motivation. Most participants, however, had less than recommended levels of exercise amount and intensity.Conclusions: Counseling interventions that use contemporary behavior change strategies, such as theCHANGEintervention, can reduce the number of individuals who do not exercise following cardiac events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSecondary prevention is not adequately implemented after myocardial infarction (MI). We assessed the effect on quality of care and prognosis of a long-term, relatively intensive rehabilitation strategy after MI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial in patients following standard post-MI cardiac rehabilitation, comparing a long-term, reinforced, multifactorial educational and behavioral intervention with usual care. A total of 3241 patients with recent MI were randomized to a 3-year multifactorial continued educational and behavioral program (intervention group; n = 1620) or usual care (control group; n = 1621). The combination of cardiovascular (CV) mortality, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for angina pectoris, heart failure, or urgent revascularization procedure was the primary end point. Other end points were major CV events, major cardiac and cerebrovascular events, lifestyle habits, and drug prescriptions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEnd point events occurred in 556 patients (17.2%). Compared with usual care, the intensive intervention did not decrease the primary end point significantly (16.1% vs 18.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.04). However, the intensive intervention decreased several secondary end points: CV mortality plus nonfatal MI and stroke (3.2% vs 4.8%; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.95), cardiac death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.5% vs 4.0%; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.94), and nonfatal MI (1.4% vs 2.7%; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.86). A marked improvement in lifestyle habits (ie, exercise, diet, psychosocial stress, less deterioration of body weight control) and in prescription of drugs for secondary prevention was seen in the intervention group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe GOSPEL Study is the first trial to our knowledge to demonstrate that a multifactorial, continued reinforced intervention up to 3 years after rehabilitation following MI is effective in decreasing the risk of several important CV outcomes, particularly nonfatal MI, although the overall effect is small.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00421876.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess whether exercise volume during phase II rehabilitation affects long-term clinical benefits in patients with coronary artery disease. Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial with long-term follow-up. Setting: Hospital outpatient clinic. Subjects: Coronary artery disease patients (age 65 \u00b1 9 years, 82% males) attending a phase II rehabilitation programme were randomized into two groups of exercise volumes: 40- versus 60-minute training sessions. Patients exercised for three days per week for seven weeks, at 65% of baseline oxygen uptake capacity. Next, they were followed up for 18 months. Out of 165 patients with coronary artery disease who completed the exercise intervention, 119 attended the 18-month follow-up assessment. Main measurements: Body anthropometrics, resting haemodynamics, blood lipid profile, glycaemia, and C-reactive protein level, smoking behaviour, habitual physical activity, cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. Results: In total population, a significant worsening of various cardiovascular disease risk factors was found at 18 months follow-up (P<0.05), and few patients (27% of total group) adhered to the recommended minimal physical activity level. No difference in change of body anthropometrics, resting haemodynamics, blood lipid profile, glycaemia, and C-reactive protein level, and smoking behaviour was seen between different exercise volumes (P>0.05). In addition, total cardiovascular disease incidence (13% versus 22% in 40- versus 60-minute group, respectively) and habitual physical activity were not different between groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: In patients with coronary artery disease following cardiac rehabilitation, the cardiovascular disease risk profile worsened significantly during long-term follow-up. A smaller exercise volume during phase II rehabilitation generated equal long-term clinical benefits compared to a greater exercise volume.",

        "abstract": "Background Little is known about recovery of female sexual function following an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Interventions to improve sexual outcomes in women are limited. Methods and Results Semistructured, qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 17 partnered women (aged 43 to 75 years) purposively selected from the Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients\u2019 Health Status Registry to deepen knowledge of recovery of female sexual function following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and to improve sexual outcomes in women. Sixteen women had a monogamous relationship with a male spouse; 1 had a long\u2010term female partner. Most women resumed sexual activity within 4 weeks of their MI. Sexual problems and concerns were prevalent, including patient and/or partner fear of \u201ccausing another heart attack.\u201d Few women received counseling about sexual concerns or the safety of returning to sex. Most women who discussed sex with a physician initiated the discussion themselves. Inquiry about strategies to improve sexual outcomes elicited key themes: need for privacy, patient\u2010centeredness, and information about the timing and safe resumption of sexual activity. In addition, respondents felt that counseling should be initiated by the treating cardiologist, who \u201cknows whether your heart is safe,\u201d and then reinforced by the care team throughout the rehabilitation period. Conclusions Partnered women commonly resume sexual activity soon after an MI with fear but without directed counseling from their physicians. Proactive attention to women's concerns related to sexual function and the safety of sexual activity following an MI could improve post\u2010MI outcomes for women and their partners.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 United States and European cardiovascular society guidelines recommend physicians counsel patients about resuming sexual activity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but little is known about patients\u2019 experience with counseling about sexual activity after AMI. Methods and Results\u2014 The prospective, longitudinal Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study, conducted at 127 hospitals in the United States and Spain, was designed, in part, to evaluate gender differences in baseline sexual activity, function, and patient experience with physician counseling about sexual activity after an AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from the 2:1 sample of women (N=2349) and men (N=1152) ages 18 to 55 years with AMI. Median age was 48 years. Among those who reported discussing sexual activity with a physician in the month after AMI (12% of women, 19% of men), 68% were given restrictions: limit sex (35%), take a more passive role (26%), and/or keep the heart rate down (23%). In risk-adjusted analyses, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03\u20131.11), age (relative risk, 1.05 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval, 1.02\u20131.08), and sexual inactivity at baseline (relative risk, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08\u20131.15). Among patients who received counseling, women in Spain were significantly more likely to be given restrictions than U.S. women (relative risk; 1.36, 95% confidence interval, 1.11\u20131.66). Conclusions\u2014 Very few patients reported counseling for sexual activity after AMI. Those who did were commonly given restrictions not supported by evidence or guidelines.

At all time points, 637 (40.4%) of women and 437 (54.9%) of men were sexually active. Among people who were active at baseline, men were more likely than women to have resumed sexual activity by 1 month (448 [63.9%] vs 661 [54.5%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and by 1 year (662 [94.4%] vs 1107 [91.3%]; P\u2009=\u2009.01) after AMI.

The Sexual Attitudes and Beliefs Survey, along with investigator-developed questions regarding practices and perceived barriers, was administered to the nurses. The STROBE checklist was used to ensure quality reporting during this observational study (see Supporting Information Data S1).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe average age of nurses who participated was 31.81\u00a0years (SD\u00a0=\u00a07.41). The average score of Sexual Attitudes and Beliefs Survey was 47.72 (SD\u00a0=\u00a07.40), indicating moderate attitudinal barriers for nurses to discuss sexual activities with patients. Most nurses (91%) perceived that sexuality was too private to discuss with patients. Only 20% of nurses expressed that they would provide time to discuss sexual concerns with patients. Eighty per cent of nurses revealed that they felt uncomfortable discussing sexuality; moreover, they believed that hospitalised patients were too sick to be engaged in these types of conversations. Additionally, almost 85% of nurses conveyed that they have never conducted discussions regarding sexuality care in patients with cardiovascular disease. The most frequently reported perceived barriers preventing nurses from discussing sexual concerns included fear of offending patients (77.2%), uncertainty of how to communicate with patients (69.4%), feelings of embarrassment (67.5%), lack of safe and private environments (61.9%) and lack of knowledge (54.9%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNurses in this cross-sectional sample rarely discussed sexual concerns with their patients. There were several key barriers identified by nurses regarding providing sexuality care, including personal attitudes and beliefs, limited skills and knowledge, culture and organizational-related barriers.\n\n\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE\nTargeted training for nurses and creating a culturally safe environment is recommended to improve management of sexuality in patients with CVD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sexuality has an essential part in human lives and can be affected by changes in one\u2019s health status. Since the nursing profession delivers holistic care for patients, nurses must have the knowledge and skills to deliver care concerning sexuality. Evidence from the professional literature demonstrates that nurses do not address sexuality care consistently, mainly due to different factors such as lack of knowledge, skills, and cultural attitudes. This study\u2019s purpose was to learn about the factors that affect nursing students\u2019 willingness to grasp the nurse\u2019s role as a sexuality educator in practice prior to establishing a specified course in sexual education for BSN students. A quantitative study was conducted in a college at the center of Israel, with a convenience sample of nursing students in a BSN program (n\u2009=\u2009214). The research tool was a questionnaire designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and willingness of nursing students to practice sexuality education in the future. The study\u2019s approach was based on Ajzen\u2019s Theory of Planned Behavior. Results indicated that self-efficacy is the main mediator between attitudes and intentions. There is a need to reinforce nursing student\u2019s self-efficacy on the subject to increase their intention to practice it in the future.",
