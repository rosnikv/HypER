        "title": "An investigation into the need for supplementary steroids in organ transplant patients undergoing gingival surgery. A double-blind, split-mouth, cross-over study.",
        "abstract": "Organ transplant patients are frequently medicated with triple immunosuppressive therapy that includes both cyclosporin and the corticosteroid, prednisolone. Many of these patients experience gingival overgrowth that necessitates surgical intervention. Chronic dosing with corticosteroids can lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and subsequent adrenocortical suppression. To circumvent possible suppression, supplementary steroids are administered to such patients prior to so-called \"stressful events\". We have examined the need for supplementary steroids in 20 organ transplant patients undergoing gingival surgery under local anaesthesia to correct their drug-induced gingival overgrowth. All patients were operated upon in the first half of the morning. Prior to gingival surgery, resting blood pressure (BP) and serum ACTH concentrations were determined. Immediately before surgery patients received either intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg or placebo in random, double-blind order. Each patient required 2 gingivectomies and thus acted as their own placebo control. BP was measured at various time points throughout surgery and upto 2 h postoperatively. On completion of surgery, a further blood sample was taken to determine ACTH concentration. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between placebo and hydrocortisone treatments for BP and ACTH measurements. No patient experienced any symptoms that were suggestive of adrenocortical suppression. One patient did experience postural hypotension prior to gingival surgery, but this is attributed to his antidepressant medication. We can conclude from this study that immunosuppressed organ transplant patients taking the maintenance dose of prednisolone (5-10 mg/day) do not require corticosteroid cover prior to gingival surgery under local anaesthesia. We would however, advocate monitoring of their blood pressure throughout the procedure.",

        "abstract": "Periodontal disease is caused by inflammatory processes initiated by the presence of a biofilm. The management of this disease process is largely achieved by disrupting the biofilm to allow regression of inflammation and healing. As our patients are living for longer they are likely to have been exposed to systemic medications that aim to reduce inflammation. These drugs have been shown to decrease inflammation within the periodontal tissues despite not being a primary function of their use. This paper aims to review the relative effects of common systemic medications on the periodontal tissues by analyzing their modes of action and discussing current research and the implications for periodontal treatment.",

        "title": "Is there a relationship between periodontal conditions and number of medications among the elderly?",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate possible correlations of clinical attachment level and pocket depth with number of medications in elderly individuals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIntra-oral examinations for 139 patients visiting Tufts dental clinic were done. Periodontal assessments were performed with a manual UNC-15 periodontal probe to measure probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) at 6 sites. Complete lists of patients' medications were obtained during the examinations. Statistical analysis involved Kruskal-Wallis, chi square and multivariate logistic regression analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAge and health status attained statistical significance (p< 0.05), in contingency table analysis with number of medications. Number of medications had an effect on CAL: increased attachment loss was observed when 4 or more medications were being taken by the patient. Number of medications did not have any effect on periodontal PD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, 6 or more medications had a higher risk of attachment loss (>3mm) when compared to the no-medication group, in crude OR (1.20, 95% CI:0.22-6.64), and age adjusted (OR=1.16, 95% CI:0.21-6.45), but not with the multivariate model (OR=0.71, 95% CI:0.11-4.39).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCAL seems to be more sensitive to the number of medications taken, when compared to PD. However, it is not possible to discriminate at exactly what number of drug combinations the breakdown in CAL will happen. We need to do further analysis, including more subjects, to understand the possible synergistic mechanisms for different drug and periodontal responses.",

        "title": "Impact of Bisphosphonate Therapy on Oral Health in Patients with Breast and Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases: A Comprehensive Study",
        "abstract": "Simple Summary This study delves into bisphosphonate therapy\u2019s effects on oral health in 80 breast and prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. Bisphosphonates, crucial for managing skeletal complications, are linked to bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), presenting in 0.8\u201318.5% of patients with symptoms like pain, tissue swelling, and tooth mobility. Through dental and radiological assessments\u2014including DMFT and OHI-S indices, periodontal measurements, and panoramic X-rays\u2014the research uncovers a notable decline in oral hygiene post-therapy, evidenced by worsened DMFT, OHI-S, PD, and CAL scores. Additionally, radiological changes hint at bisphosphonates\u2019 impact on bone density and structure. Despite no significant changes in TMJ function, the findings underscore the need for ongoing dental care and risk mitigation strategies for BRONJ, emphasizing the vital role of regular dental monitoring and proactive oral hygiene practices in the comprehensive care of cancer patients undergoing bisphosphonate therapy. Abstract This study investigates the impact of bisphosphonate therapy on the stomatognathic system in 80 patients with cancer of the breast and prostate with bone metastases. Bisphosphonates are integral for managing skeletal complications in these malignancies but are associated with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), affecting 0.8\u201318.5% of patients. BRONJ manifests with pain, neuropathy, tissue swelling, mucosal ulceration, tooth mobility, and abscesses, yet its pathogenesis remains elusive, complicating risk prediction. The research employed comprehensive dental and radiological evaluations. Dental status was assessed using DMFT and OHI-S indices, Eichner\u2019s classification, and clinical periodontal measurements like the pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and modified Sulcus Bleeding Index (mSBI). A radiological analysis included panoramic X-rays for radiomorphometric measurements and TMJ lateral radiographs. Results indicated a significant decline in oral hygiene in patients with cancer after bisphosphonate therapy, marked by increased DMFT and OHI-S scores. Periodontal health also showed deterioration, with increased PD and CAL readings. The incidence of BRONJ symptoms was noted, although exact figures are not quantified in this abstract. The study also revealed changes in radiomorphometric parameters, suggesting bisphosphonates\u2019 impact on bone density and structure. No substantial alterations were observed in TMJ function, indicating a need for extended observation to understand bisphosphonates\u2019 long-term effects on the stomatognathic system. These findings highlight the importance of continuous dental monitoring and prophylaxis in patients undergoing bisphosphonate therapy. Implementing meticulous oral care protocols is essential for mitigating BRONJ risk and managing the complex oral health challenges in patients with cancer.",
