        "title": "Combinations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium supplements in hypertension.",
        "abstract": "Dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium have each been reported to lower blood pressure, but the extent of blood pressure reduction in epidemiological studies and clinical trials has tended to be small and inconsistent. We hypothesized that combinations of these mineral supplements would lower blood pressure and that the reductions would be greater than that usually reported in studies of each cation alone. One hundred twenty-five patients 82 men and 43 women) with untreated mild or borderline hypertension were randomly assigned to daily treatment with one of the following four regimens: 60 mmol potassium and 25 mmol (1000 mg) calcium, 60 mmol potassium and 15 mmol (360 mg) magnesium, calcium and magnesium, or placebo. Standardized clinic blood pressure measurements were obtained on 3 days at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. At baseline, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- SD) were 139 +/- 12 and 90 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, and dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were 77 +/- 32, 19 +/- 13, and 12 +/- 52 mmol/d, respectively. The mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) of the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures between the treatment and placebo groups were not significant: -0.7 (-4.3 to +2.9) and -0.4 (-2.9 to +2.1) for potassium and calcium, -1.3 (-4.4 to +1.8) and 0.4 (-2.5 to +3.3) for potassium and magnesium, and +2.1 (-1.8 to +6.0) and +2.2 (-1.0 to +5.4) for calcium and magnesium. In conclusion, this trial provides little evidence of an important role of combinations of cation supplements in the treatment of mild or borderline hypertension.",

        "abstract": "High-potassium diets have been shown to be beneficial in cardiovascular disease partly because of a blood pressure-lowering effect. The effect of potassium on inflammation has not been studied. We investigated the influence of potassium supplementation on the degree of renal inflammation and the intracellular signaling mechanisms that could mediate inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD was created in male Sprague-Dawley rats by subtotal nephrectomy. Two groups of CKD rats were pair fed with diets containing 2.1% potassium (potassium-supplemented diet) or 0.4% potassium (basal diet). Body weight, blood pressure, and blood and urine electrolytes were measured biweekly. The animals were euthanized at week 8, and the remnant kidneys were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR. In the CKD pair-fed groups, blood potassium concentration did not differ significantly, but blood pressure was lower in the potassium-supplemented group. Compared with the basal diet, potassium supplementation decreased renal tubulointerstitial injury and suppressed renal inflammation as evidenced by decreased macrophage infiltration, lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased NF-kappaB activation. These renoprotective effects were associated with downregulation of renal transforming growth facto-beta, upregulation of renal Smad7, and lower blood pressure. Our results show that potassium supplementation can reduce renal inflammation and hence, could modulate the progression of kidney injury in CKD.",

        "title": "Association of Hypo- and Hyperkalemia with Disease Progression and Mortality in Males with Chronic Kidney Disease: The Role of Race",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Abnormal serum potassium is associated with higher mortality in dialysis patients, but its impact on outcomes in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear. Furthermore, blacks with normal kidney function have lower urinary potassium excretion, but it is unclear if such differences have a bearing on race-associated outcomes in CKD. Methods: We studied predialysis mortality and slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) associated with serum potassium in 1,227 males with CKD. Mortality was examined in time-dependent Cox models, and slopes of eGFR in linear mixed effects models with adjustments for case mix and laboratory values. Results: Both hypo- and hyperkalemia were associated with mortality overall and in 933 white patients, but in 294 blacks hypokalemia was a stronger death predictor. Hypokalemia was associated with loss of kidney function independent of race: a 1 mEq/l lower potassium was associated with an adjusted difference in slopes of eGFR of -0.13 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (95% CI: -0.20 to -0.07), p < 0.001. Conclusion: Hypo- and hyperkalemia are associated with higher mortality in CKD patients. Blacks appear to better tolerate higher potassium than whites. Hypokalemia is associated with faster CKD progression independent of race. Hyperkalemia management may warrant race-specific consideration, and hypokalemia correction may slow CKD progression.

        "title": "Traditional and novel dietary interventions for preventing progression of chronic kidney disease.",
        "abstract": "Treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications remain largely unresolved. Currently used treatments include blood pressure control and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which can slow down the progression of CKD but are unable to halt or reverse it. Dietary protein restriction represents an additional therapeutic measure used to slow the progression of CKD. The putative mechanisms of action responsible for its therapeutic effects include beneficial hemodynamic effects and the limitation of absorbable protein breakdown products that could lead to the accumulation of uremic waste and consequent various deleterious effects. The practical implementation of protein restriction through dietary intervention has been hindered on multiple levels, including patient nonadherence, lack of health care resources, and concerns related to adverse effects associated with the development of protein-energy wasting (PEW). As a result, alternative interventions have been designed to address some or all of these shortcomings and concerns. One such intervention is the administration of medications that prevent the absorption of protein catabolic products from the gut. This article reviews the various interventions using such a strategy to prevent or slow the progression of CKD, with special focus on recent advances in this field.",

        "abstract": "While dietary restriction of protein intake has long been proposed as a possible kidney-protective treatment, the effects of changes in the quality of ingested proteins on the prevalence and risk of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been scarcely studied; these two aspects are reviewed in the present article. The prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which are the main causes of CKD in Western countries, is lower in vegetarian populations. Moreover, there is a negative relationship between several components of plant-based diets and numerous factors related to CKD progression such as uraemic toxins, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic acidosis, phosphate load and insulin resistance. In fact, results from different studies seem to confirm a kidney-protective effect of plant-based diets in the primary prevention of CKD and the secondary prevention of CKD progression. Various studies have determined the nutritional safety of plant-based diets in CKD patients, despite the combination of a more or less severe dietary protein restriction. As observed in the healthy population, this dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in CKD patients. We propose that plant-based diets should be included as part of the clinical recommendations for both the prevention and management of CKD.",

        "title": "Vegetable-Based Diets for Chronic Kidney Disease? It Is Time to Reconsider",
        "abstract": "Traditional dietary recommendations to renal patients limited the intake of fruits and vegetables because of their high potassium content. However, this paradigm is rapidly changing due to the multiple benefits derived from a fundamentally vegetarian diet such as, improvement in gut dysbiosis, reducing the number of pathobionts and protein-fermenting species leading to a decreased production of the most harmful uremic toxins, while the high fiber content of these diets enhances intestinal motility and short-chain fatty acid production. Metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is aggravated by the high consumption of meat and refined cereals, increasing the dietary acid load, while the intake of fruit and vegetables is able to neutralize the acidosis and its deleterious consequences. Phosphorus absorption and bioavailability is also lower in a vegetarian diet, reducing hyperphosphatemia, a known cause of cardiovascular mortality in CKD. The richness of multiple plants in magnesium and vitamin K avoids their deficiency, which is common in these patients. These beneficial effects, together with the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress observed with these diets, may explain the reduction in renal patients\u2019 complications and mortality, and may slow CKD progression. Finally, although hyperkalemia is the main concern of these diets, the use of adequate cooking techniques can minimize the amount absorbed.",

In parallel, data now exist regarding the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its most common complications with this dietary pattern. Improving the nutrient quality of patients by including a higher proportion of plant-based foods while reducing total - and animal protein - intake may reduce the need for - or complement - nephroprotective medications, improve kidney disease complications, and, perhaps, favorably affect disease progression and patient survival. In this In Practice article, we review the available evidence on plant-dominant fiber-rich diet as it relates to kidney disease prevention, CKD incidence and progression, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypertension, uremic toxins, need for kidney replacement therapy including dialysis, patient satisfaction and quality of life, and mortality. Further, concerns of hyperkalemia and protein inadequacy, which are often associated with plant-based diets, are also reviewed in the context of available evidence. It is likely that the risks of both issues may not have been as significant as previously thought while the advantages are vast. In conclusion, the risk-to-benefit ratio of plant-based diets appear to be tilting in favor of its more prevalent use.",

        "abstract": "Nutrition is one of the fundamental approaches to promoting and preventing all kinds of diseases, especially kidney diseases. Dietary fiber forms a significant aspect of renal nutrition in treating chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Understanding dietary fiber\u2019s pathogenesis and mechanistic action in modulating host and microbiome interactions provides a potential adjunct therapeutic target for preventing, controlling, and treating CKD patients. In this regard, a recommendation of adequate and appropriate dietary fiber intake to restore beneficial gut microbiota composition would reduce the risks and complications associated with CKD.

        "abstract": "Residual kidney function for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with better quality of life and outcome; thus, strategies should be implemented to preserve kidney function. Among the multiple causes that promote kidney damage, gut dysbiosis due to increased uremic toxin production and endotoxemia need attention. Several strategies have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiota in these patients, and diet has gained increasing attention in recent years since it is the primary driver of gut dysbiosis. In addition, medications and faecal transplantation may be valid strategies. Modifying gut microbiota composition may mitigate chronic kidney damage and preserve residual kidney function. Although various studies have shown the influential role of diet in modulating gut microbiota composition, the effects of this modulation on residual kidney function remain limited. This review discusses the role of gut microbiota metabolism on residual kidney function and vice versa and how we could preserve the residual kidney function by modulating the gut microbiota balance.",

        "title": "Gut Microbiota in Patients Receiving Dialysis: A Review",
        "abstract": "The human gut microbiota constitutes a complex community of microorganisms residing within the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing a vast array of species that play crucial roles in health and disease. The disease processes involved in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are now increasingly established to result in dysregulation of gut microbiota composition and function. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality in patients with ESKD, particularly individuals receiving dialysis. Prior studies highlighted various factors that affect gut microbiota dysbiosis in CKD and ESKD. These include, but are not limited to, uraemic toxin accumulation, chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, medications, and dietary restrictions and nutritional status. There is a lack of studies at present that focus on the evaluation of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the context of dialysis. Knowledge on gut microbiota changes in this context is important for determining their impact on dialysis-specific and overall outcomes for this patient cohort. More importantly, evaluating gut microbiota composition can provide information into potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Identification of specific microbial signatures may result in further development of personalised treatments to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications during dialysis. Optimising gut microbiota through various therapeutic approaches, including dietary adjustments, probiotics, prebiotics, medications, and faecal transplantation, have previously demonstrated potential in multiple medical conditions. It remains to be seen whether these therapeutic approaches are effective within the dialysis setting. Our review aims to evaluate evidence relating to alterations in the gut microbiota of patients undergoing dialysis. A growing body of evidence pointing to the complex yet significant relationship which surrounds gut microbiota and kidney health emphasises the importance of gut microbial balance to improve outcomes for individuals receiving dialysis.",
