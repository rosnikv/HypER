        "abstract": "There is no known cure for Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), but a better understanding of the evidence base of both established treatments (such as enteral nutrition, corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates and immunosuppressive agents) and emerging treatments (such as the anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (anti-TNF-\u03b1) agents, infliximab and adalimumab) provides opportunities to improve and maintain the quality of life for children with the disease. This article provides an overview of the evidence base of current medical treatments that are used to induce and maintain remission in CD. Exclusive enteral nutrition is recommended as the first line of treatment for the induction of remission in paediatric CD. Corticosteroids are also effective for inducing remission but may be associated with significant adverse events. Patients with chronically active CD may benefit from immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and methotrexate. Infliximab is effective for inducing remission in patients who continue to have significant active disease despite the use of conventional treatments. Adalimumab may be indicated for patients who develop a severe allergic reaction to infliximab or those who initially respond to infliximab but subsequently lose their response. Treatments that have been shown to be effective for the maintenance of remission include azathioprine, methotrexate, infliximab and adalimumab. Recent evidence also suggests that long-term enteral nutritional supplementation with patients taking about half of their daily calorie requirements as enteral nutrition may be an effective strategy for the maintenance of remission in CD. The available evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids or 5-aminosalicylates as maintenance therapy for CD.",

Management of CGD colitis is a challenge because standard immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of infection in already immunocompromised hosts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe report the use of infliximab in 5 patients with CGD.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInfliximab administration predisposed patients to severe infections with typical CGD pathogens but not mycobacteria, as reported with infliximab in other conditions. In addition to infections, infliximab administration led to successful closure of fistulae, sometimes with other untoward consequences. Infliximab-associated complications were associated with 2 deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInfliximab use in the treatment of CGD inflammatory bowel disease requires aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis, assiduous surveillance for infection, and vigilance for untoward gastrointestinal complications. This experience suggests that infliximab therapy is effective but has untoward consequences in patients with CGD.",

        "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections are a major threat for patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency caused by a defect in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase. Interestingly, Aspergillus (Emericella) nidulans is the second most encountered mold in CGD patients, causing almost exclusively invasive infections in this specific host, and is characterized by its aggressive behavior. A proper diagnosis is complicated by the often mild clinical presentation, the low sensitivity of the currently used diagnostic tools, and the difficulties in accurate identification of the Emericella species. According to the hitherto accepted view on the role of the NADPH-oxidase in the innate host-defense pathway, the pathogenesis of A. nidulans in CGD cannot be explained.

        "title": "Targeting Fungal Genes by Diced siRNAs: A Rapid Tool to Decipher Gene Function in Aspergillus nidulans",
        "abstract": "Background Gene silencing triggered by chemically synthesized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has become a powerful tool for deciphering gene function in many eukaryotes. However, prediction and validation of a single siRNA duplex specific to a target gene is often ineffective. RNA interference (RNAi) with synthetic siRNA suffers from lower silencing efficacy, off-target effects and is cost-intensive, especially for functional genomic studies. With the explosion of fungal genomic information, there is an increasing need to analyze gene function in a rapid manner. Therefore, studies were performed in order to investigate the efficacy of gene silencing induced by RNase III-diced-siRNAs (d-siRNA) in model filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans. Methodology/Principal Findings Stable expression of heterologous reporter gene in A. nidulans eases the examination of a new RNAi-induction route. Hence, we have optimized Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AMT) of A. nidulans for stable expression of sGFP gene. This study demonstrates that the reporter GFP gene stably introduced into A. nidulans can be effectively silenced by treatment of GFP-d-siRNAs. We have shown the down-regulation of two endogenous genes, AnrasA and AnrasB of A. nidulans by d-siRNAs. We have also elucidated the function of an uncharacterized Ras homolog, rasB gene, which was found to be involved in hyphal growth and development. Further, silencing potency of d-siRNA was higher as compared to synthetic siRNA duplex, targeting AnrasA. Silencing was shown to be sequence-specific, since expression profiles of other closely related Ras family genes in d-siRNA treated AnrasA and AnrasB silenced lines exhibited no change in gene expression. Conclusions/Significance We have developed and applied a fast, specific and efficient gene silencing approach for elucidating gene function in A. nidulans using d-siRNAs. We have also optimized an efficient AMT in A. nidulans, which is useful for stable integration of transgenes.",

        "abstract": "An increasing number of reports have described the emergence of acquired resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus to azole compounds. The primary mechanism of resistance in clinical isolates is the mutation of the azole drug target enzyme, which is encoded by the cyp51A gene. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of silencing the cyp51A gene in azole\u2010resistant A. fumigatus isolates. A 21\u2010nucleotide small\u2010interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed based on the cDNA sequence of the A. fumigatus cyp51A gene. After silencing the cyp51A gene in germinated conidia (15, 20, 25 and 50 nM), azole\u2010resistant A. fumigatus was cultured on broth media and gene expression was analysed by measuring the cyp51A mRNA level using RT\u2010PCR assay. Hyphae were successfully transfected by siRNA and expression of the cyp51A gene was significantly reduced by siRNA at the concentration of 50 nM (P \u2264 0.05). In addition, at this siRNA concentration, the minimum inhibitory concentration of itraconazole for the treated cells was decreased, compared with that for untreated control cells, from 16 to 4 \u03bcg/ml.",

        "title": "The Utilization of RNA Silencing Technology to Mitigate the Voriconazole Resistance of Aspergillus Flavus; Lipofectamine-Based Delivery",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Introducing the effect of RNAi in fungi to downregulate essential genes has made it a powerful tool to investigate gene function, with potential strategies for novel disease treatments. Thus, this study is an endeavor to delve into the silencing potentials of siRNA on cyp51A and MDR1 in voriconazole-resistant Aspergillus flavus as the target genes. Methods: In this study, we designed three cyp51A-specific siRNAs and three MDR1-specific siRNAs and after the co-transfection of siRNA into Aspergillus flavus, using lipofectamine, we investigated the effect of different siRNA concentrations (5, 15, 25, 50nM) on cyp51A and MDR1 expressions by qRT-PCR. Finally, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of voriconazole for isolates were determined by broth dilution method. Results: Cyp51A siRNA induced 9, 22, 33, 40-fold reductions in cyp51A mRNA expression in a voriconazole-resistant strain following the treatment of the cells with concentrations of 5, 15, 25, 50nM siRNA, respectively. Identically, the same procedure was applied to MDR1, even though it induced 2, 3, 4, 10-fold reductions. The results demonstrated a MIC for voriconazole in the untreated group (4\u00b5g per ml), when compared to the group treated with cyp51A-specific siRNA and MDR1-specific siRNA, both at concentrations of 25 and 50nM, yielding 2\u00b5g per ml and 1\u00b5g per ml when 25 nM was applied and 2\u00b5g per ml and 0.5\u00b5g per ml when the concentration doubled to 50 nM. Conclusion: In this study, we suggested that siRNA-mediated specific inhibition of cyp51A and MDR1 genes play roles in voriconazole-resistant A.flavus strain and these could be apt target genes for inactivation. The current study promises a bright prospect for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis through the effective deployment of RNAi and gene therapy.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Invasive and allergic infections by Aspergillus flavus are more common in tropical and subtropical countries. The emergence of voriconazole (VRC) resistance in A. flavus impacts the management of aspergillosis, as azoles are used as the first-line and empirical therapy. We screened 120 molecularly confirmed A. flavus isolates obtained from respiratory and sinonasal specimens in a chest hospital in Delhi, India, for azole resistance using the CLSI broth microdilution (CLSI-BMD) method. Overall, 2.5% (n = 3/120) of A. flavus isolates had VRC MICs above epidemiological cutoff values (>1 \u03bcg/ml). The whole-genome sequence analysis of three non-wild-type (WT) A. flavus isolates with high VRC MICs showed polymorphisms in azole target genes (cyp51A, cyp51B, and cyp51C). Further, four novel substitutions (S196F, A324P, N423D, and V465M) encoded in the cyp51C gene were found in a single non-WT isolate which also exhibited overexpression of cyp51 (cyp51A, -B, and -C) genes and transporter genes, namely, MDR1, MDR2, atrF, and mfs1. The homology model of the non-WT isolate suggests that substitutions S196F and N423D exhibited major structural and functional effects on cyp51C drug binding. The substrate (drug) may not be able to bind to binding pocket due to changes in the pocket size or closing down or narrowing of cavities in drug entry channels. Notably, the remaining two VRC-resistant A. flavus isolates, including the one which had a pan-azole resistance phenotype (itraconazole and posaconazole), did not show upregulation of any of the analyzed target genes. These results suggest that multiple target genes and mechanisms could simultaneously contribute to azole resistance in A. flavus.",

        "abstract": "Azole resistance is an emerging problem in patients with aspergillosis. The role of fungicides for resistance development and occurrence is not fully elucidated. EUCAST reference MICs of 17 fungicides (11 azoles and 6 others), five azole fungicide metabolites and four medical triazoles were examined against two reference and 28 clinical isolates of A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. terreus with (n = 12) and without (n = 16) resistance mutations. Eight/11 azole fungicides were active against wild-type A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. terreus, including four (metconazole, prothioconazole-desthio, prochloraz and imazalil) with low MIC50 (\u22642 mg/L) against all three species and epoxiconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole and difenoconazole also against wild-type A. terreus. Mefentrifluconazole, azole metabolites and non-azole fungicides MICs were >16 mg/L against A. fumigatus although partial growth inhibition was found with mefentrifluconazole. Moreover, mefentrifluconazole and axozystrobin were active against wild-type A. terreus. Increased MICs (\u22653 dilutions) were found for TR34/L98H, TR34(3)/L98H, TR46/Y121F/T289A and G432S compared to wild-type A. fumigatus for epoxiconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, prochloraz, imazalil and metconazole (except G432S), and for prothioconazole-desthio against TR46/Y121F/T289A, specifically. Increased MICs were found in A. fumigatus harbouring G54R, M220K and M220R alterations for five, one and one azole fungicides, respectively, compared to MICs against wild-type A. fumigatus. Similarly, increased MICs wer found for A. terreus with G51A, M217I and Y491H alterations for five, six and two azole fungicides, respectively. Azole fungicides showed activity against wild-type A. fumigatus, A. terreus and A. flavus, but not against all mutant isolates, suggesting the environmental route of azole resistance may have a role for all three species.",

The CAPA all-cause mortality rate is approximately 50% and may be complicated by azole resistance. Genomic epidemiology can help shed light on the genetics of A. fumigatus causing CAPA, including the prevalence of resistance-associated alleles. We present a population genomic analysis of 21 CAPA isolates from four European countries with these isolates compared against 240 non-CAPA A. fumigatus isolates from a wider population. Bioinformatic analysis and antifungal susceptibility testing were performed to quantify resistance and identify possible genetically encoded azole-resistant mechanisms. The phylogenetic analysis of the 21 CAPA isolates showed that they were representative of the wider A. fumigatus population with no obvious clustering. The prevalence of phenotypic azole resistance in CAPA was 14.3% (n = 3/21); all three CAPA isolates contained a known resistance-associated cyp51A polymorphism. The relatively high prevalence of azole resistance alleles that we document poses a probable threat to treatment success rates, warranting the enhanced surveillance of A. fumigatus genotypes in these patients. Furthermore, potential changes to antifungal first-line treatment guidelines may be needed to improve patient outcomes when CAPA is suspected.",

Methods Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre YeastOne YO10, and isolates with high minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were further confirmed using the standard broth microdilution assays established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-third edition. Whole-Genome Resequencing and RT-qPCR in azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains were performed to investigate the underlying resistance mechanisms. Results Overall, a total of 276 A. fumigatus isolates were identified from various clinical departments, showing an increasing trend in the number of isolates over the past 3 years. Two azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains (0.72%) were observed, one of which showed overexpression of cyp51A, cyp51B, cdr1B, MDR1/2, artR, srbA, erg24A, and erg4B, but no cyp51A mutation. However, the other strain harbored two alterations in the cyp51A sequences (L98H/S297T). Therefore, we first described two azole-resistant clinical A. fumigatus strains in Ningxia, China, and reported one azole-resistant strain that has the L98H/S297T mutations in the cyp51A gene without any tandem repeat (TR) sequences in the promoter region. Conclusions This study emphasizes the importance of enhancing attention and surveillance of azole-resistant A. fumigatus, particularly those with non-TR point mutations of cyp51A or non-cyp51A mutations, in order to gain a better understanding of their prevalence and spread in the region.",
