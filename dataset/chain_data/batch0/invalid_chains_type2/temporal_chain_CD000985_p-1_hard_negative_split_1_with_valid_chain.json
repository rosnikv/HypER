        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo evaluate the combination of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex receptor inhibitor and urokinase for treatment of recent (<or=6 weeks) arterial occlusion of the legs.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSeventy patients with lower extremity arterial occlusion of less than 6 weeks duration were randomly separated into two treatment groups: urokinase plus abciximab or urokinase plus placebo. Primary end points were the rate of major complications at 30 days after randomization and the rates of amputation-free survival and survival without open surgery or major amputation at follow-up of 90 days. Two readers unaware of the patients' treatment group assignments analyzed digital subtraction angiograms as they related to the study end points, with a final consensus reading.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThrombolysis relative to clot length was faster in the urokinase-plus-abciximab group (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.76; P < .001). There were no procedure-related deaths or intracranial hemorrhages, but the rate of nonfatal major bleeding was higher with urokinase plus abciximab (four of 50 patients) than with urokinase alone (none of 20 patients; P = .32). At 90 days, amputation-free survival was 96% (48 of 50 patients) in the urokinase-plus-abciximab group compared with 80% (16 of 20 patients) in the urokinase alone group. The hazard ratio for the two Kaplan-Meier curves was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.96; P = .04).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with lower extremity arterial occlusion who were undergoing urokinase thrombolysis, adjunctive abciximab treatment resulted in faster thrombus dissolution and improved amputation-free survival, despite an increase in major bleeding.",

        "title": "Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in peripheral artery occlusions: combining reteplase and abciximab.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of combination therapy consisting of the third-generation plasminogen activator reteplase and the glycoproteins IIb and IIIa platelet receptor antagonist abciximab for thrombolysis in peripheral artery occlusive disease. This two-center experience focused on immediate thrombolytic success, thrombolysis time, complication rate, and 30-day patency rate.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nFifty patients with arterial occlusive disease (age range, 40-96 years; mean age, 69 years) were prospectively enrolled at two centers. Eighteen patients (36%) had native artery thromboses, and 32 patients (64%) had graft thromboses. Catheter-directed intraarterial thrombolytic infusion of reteplase (average dose, 0.51 U/hr; range, 0.25-1 U/hr) was combined with IV infusion of abciximab (bolus, 0.25 mg/kg of body weight; 12-hr infusion, 0.125 microg/kg of body weight per minute). Nontherapeutic heparin (100-400 U/hr) was given intraarterially during the thrombolytic infusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nComplete thrombolysis was achieved in 89% of the patients with native artery occlusions and 94% of the patients with graft occlusions for an overall rate of 92%. The average thrombolysis time was 20.7 hr (range, 4-41 hr) with a mean reteplase dose of 12.1 U (range, 2-23 U). Major hematoma occurred in 12% of the patients, with an average blood transfusion of 3.1 U of packed RBC (range, 1-11 U), and correlated to increased thrombolysis time and dose. No intracranial hemorrhage occurred. The 30-day primary patency rate was 92%. Two patients (4%) underwent amputation, including one major amputation (2%), within 30 days of thrombolysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination of reteplase and abciximab in catheter-directed arterial thrombolysis is feasible and effective. Results of this combination therapy suggest acceptable thrombolysis times and doses with tolerable complication rates. Which patient group might benefit the most from combination therapy and the long-term results of combination therapy still need to be determined.",

        "title": "Clot lysis in a primate model of peripheral arterial occlusive disease with use of systemic or intraarterial reteplase: addition of abciximab results in improved vessel reperfusion.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThis study was designed to compare the ability of reteplase (a fibrinolytic agent) alone or in combination with abciximab (a monoclonal antibody antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) to achieve and sustain vessel patency in an acute model of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in cynomolgus monkeys.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTotal arterial occlusion was induced in the femoral arteries of 32 cynomolgus monkeys (eight groups of four) by endothelial injury and injection of thrombin-treated autologous blood. Reteplase was administered by intravenous bolus dose or by intraarterial infusion at the site of the clot. Abciximab was administered as a single weight-adjusted intravenous bolus dose. Platelet activity was measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation before and after abciximab treatment. Different groups of animals received sequential partial doses of reteplase with or without increasing doses of abciximab until either the weight-adjusted human dose equivalent of reteplase was reached or vessel recanalization was achieved.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnimals receiving reteplase-only regimens demonstrated variability in the times required for reperfusion and the permanence of the effect. The coadministration of abciximab at doses of the antibody that achieved near or full inhibition of platelet function generally decreased the time to reperfusion and resulted in more consistent and sustained vessel patency. In the case of systemic intravenous reteplase, the coadministration of abciximab resulted in effective reperfusion of thrombosed vessels at decreased doses of the lytic agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nReteplase administered systemically or at the site of thrombotic occlusion restored blood flow for periods of varying duration in monkeys with acute femoral artery thrombosis. The coadministration of systemic intravenous abciximab to intravenous or intraarterial reteplase allowed the use of lower doses of fibrinolytic agent with more accelerated and sustained reperfusion.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo prospectively evaluate tenecteplase (TNK) for thrombolysis in acute lower-limb ischemia.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nForty-three consecutive limbs in 37 patients (15 male, 22 female) were treated for acute lower-limb ischemia. Group 1 included 22 limbs treated with TNK infusion of 0.25 mg/h and group 2 included 21 limbs treated with TNK at 0.125 mg/h. Technical success was defined by 95% clearing of thrombus, and clinical success was defined by Society of Interventional Radiology category for acute ischemia of +1. Complications were ranked by severity and relation to TNK administration. Logistic regression, Student t test, and analysis of variance were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTNK infusions averaged 24 hours in duration (SD, 13 h), with means of 20 hours in group 1 and 27 hours in group 2 (P = .071). Technical success was achieved in 84% of limbs (36 of 43): 82% in group 1 (18 of 22) and 86% in group 2 (18 of 21; P = .827). The SIR ischemia category improved (ie, +1) in 86% of limbs (37 of 43), stayed the same (ie, category 0) in 12% of limbs (five of 43), and worsened (ie, -1) in 2% of limbs (one of 43). TNK-related complications were seen in 12% of limbs (n = 5) and were correlated with percentage decrease in fibrinogen level, initial TNK bolus, and abciximab administration (P = .001, P < .001, and P = .036, respectively). Initial TNK boluses of 1.5 mg or less were associated with fewer complications than boluses of 3-5 mg (P = .045). The percentage decrease in fibrinogen level in group 1 was 23% (SD, 29%), compared with 7% in group 2 (SD, 20%; P = .045). There was a 7% incidence of major bleeding complications (n = 3) and no intracranial hemorrhages.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment of acute lower-limb ischemia with TNK infusion at 0.25 mg/h and 0.125 mg/h is associated with similar success and complication rates. TNK-related complications correlated with initial TNK bolus, abciximab treatment, and percent decrease in fibrinogen level. The initial TNK bolus dose should be limited to 1.5 mg.",

Although both papers deal with thrombolysis, the specific context and focus of this paper are not directly related to the source paper's findings on reteplase and abciximab. However, the mention of abciximab in this paper as a correlate of TNK-related complications indicates some connection to the source paper's topic. Therefore, the relevance score is 1."
