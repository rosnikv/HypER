        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) are the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, the former account for about 70-80% of liability to develop AITDs. However, at least 20-30% is contributed by environmental factors, which include certainly smoking (at least for Graves' disease and orbitopathy), probably stress, iodine and selenium intake, several drugs, irradiation, pollutants, viral and bacterial infections, allergy, pregnancy, and post-partum. Evidence for the intervention of these factors is often limited, and the mechanisms whereby environmental factors may concur to the onset of AITDs are in many instances unclear. Nevertheless, gene-environment interaction seems a fundamental process for the occurrence of AITDs.",

        "title": "Selenium supplementation in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a systematic review and a meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEvidence suggests that selenium (Se) supplementation could be useful as an adjunctive therapy to levothyroxine (LT\u2084) in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). To summarize evidence regarding its effect on thyroid autoantibodies' titers, demands in LT\u2084 replacement therapy, ultrasonographic thyroid morphology, and mood in patients with HT under LT\u2084 treatment, a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant literature were performed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic review of prospective studies involving patients with HT under LT\u2084 treatment and meta-analysis of studies on randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded trials were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients with HT assigned to Se supplementation for 3 months demonstrated significantly lower thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOab) titers (four studies, random effects weighted mean difference: \u2212271.09, 95% confidence interval: \u2212421.98 to \u2212120.19, p< 10\u207b\u2074) and a significantly higher chance of reporting an improvement in well-being and/or mood (three studies, random effects risk ratio: 2.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.21-6.47, p= 0.016) when compared with controls. Demands in LT\u2084 replacement therapy and ultrasonographic thyroid morphology were found either unaltered or underreported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOn the basis of the best available evidence, Se supplementation is associated with a significant decrease in TPOab titers at 3 months and with improvement in mood and/or general well-being. Evidence suggests a different pattern of response to Se supplementation in HT relative to baseline TPOab titers, and this, if confirmed, could be used to identify which patients would benefit most from treatment. An improvement in thyroid function and morphology should be demonstrated before Se routine supplementation can be recommended in the treatment of HT.",

Participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 6-month treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. One hundred sixty-five patients completed the study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMonocyte and lymphocyte release of proinflammatory cytokines and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control subjects, monocytes and lymphocytes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients released greater amounts of all cytokines studied. Levothyroxine reduced monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, whereas selenomethionine inhibited lymphocyte release of IL-2, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma CRP levels. The decrease in cytokine release and in plasma CRP levels was strongest when both drugs were given together.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite affecting different types of inflammatory cells, levothyroxine and selenomethionine exhibit a similar systemic antiinflammatory effect in euthyroid females with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This action, which correlates with a reduction in thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, may be associated with clinical benefits in the prevention and management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly in subjects receiving both agents.",

        "abstract": "Summary The aim of this prospective study was to investigate for the first time whether levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, affect coagulation and fibrinolysis in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients with normal thyroid function tests. A group of 155 ambulatory women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, of whom 149 completed the study, were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to six months of treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. The control group included 39 matched healthy women. The prothrombin time ratio, the activated partial thromboplastin time, and plasma levels/activities of fibrinogen, factor VII, von Willebrand factor, factor X and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were assessed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment. Compared with the healthy subjects, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients exhibited higher plasma levels/activities of all of the parameters studied, as well as were characterised by the abnormal prothrombin time ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time. All these haemostatic disturbances were reduced or normalised by levothyroxine + selenomethionine treatment, while the effect of levothyroxine or selenomethionine was limited to fibrinogen and PAI-1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that euthyroid women with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis are characterised by abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. Levothyroxine and selenomethionine, especially if administered together, produce a beneficial effect on haemostasis in euthyroid patients with this disorder. Note: This study was in part a sub-study of another trial (ACTRN 12611000238976), which assessed the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release in Hashimoto\u201cs thyroiditis patients.

        "title": "Selenium supplementation for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is a common auto-immune disorder. The most common presenting symptoms may include anxiety, negative mood, depression, dry skin, cold intolerance, puffy eyes, muscle cramps and fatigue, deep voice, constipation, slow thinking and poor memory. Clinical manifestations of the disease are defined primarily by low levels of thyroid hormones; therefore it is treated by hormone replacement therapy, which usually consists of levothyroxine (LT4). Selenium might reduce antibody levels and result in a decreased dosage of LT4 and may provide other beneficial effects (e.g. on mood and health-related quality of life).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of selenium supplementation on Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following databases up to 2 October 2012: CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science; we also screened reference lists of included studies and searched several online trial registries for ongoing trials (5 November 2012).\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of selenium supplementation for adults diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nStudy selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses were carried out by two independent review authors. We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using GRADE. We were unable to conduct a meta-analysis because clinical heterogeneity between interventions that were investigated is substantial.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nFour studies at unclear to high risk of bias comprising 463 participants were included. The mean study duration was 7.5 months (range 3 to 18 months). One of our primary outcomes\uff0d'change from baseline in health related quality of life'\uff0dand two of our secondary outcomes\uff0d'change from baseline in LT4 replacement dosage at end of the study' and 'economic costs'\uff0dwere not assessed in any of the studies. One study at high risk of bias showed statistically significant improvement in subjective well-being with sodium selenite 200 \u03bcg plus titrated LT4 compared with placebo plus titrated LT4 (relative risk (RR) 4.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 13.50; P = 0.004; 36 participants; number needed to treat (NNT) = 2 (95% CI 2 to 3)).Selenomethionine 200 \u03bcg reduced the serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies compared with placebo in two studies (mean difference (MD) -917 U/mL, 95% CI -1056 to -778; P < 0.001; 85 participants) and (MD -345 IU/mL, 95% CI -359 to -331; P < 0.001; 169 participants). Pooling of the studies was not feasible due to marked clinical heterogeneity (I(2) = 99%). In a further comparison within the first study where selenomethionine was combined with LT4 the reduction in TPO antibodies was even more noticeable (MD -1508 U/mL, 95% CI -1671 to -1345; P < 0.001; 86 participants). In a third study, where LT4 was added to both intervention arms, a reduction in serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies favoured the selenomethionine arm as well (MD -235 IU/mL, 95% CI -374 to -95; P = 0.001; 88 participants). Although the changes from baseline were statistically significant in these three studies, their clinical relevance is unclear. Serum antibodies were not statistically significantly affected in the study comparing sodium selenite 200 \u03bcg plus titrated LT4 with placebo plus titrated LT4 (MD -25, 95% CI -181 to 131; P = 0.75; 36 participants).Adverse events were reported in two studies (1 of 85 and 1 of 88 participants, respectively). Selenium supplementation did not appear to have a statistically significant impact on the incidence of adverse events (RR 2.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 70.00; and RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.11 to 62.95).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nResults of these four studies show that evidence to support or refute the efficacy of selenium supplementation in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is incomplete. The current level of evidence for the efficacy of selenium supplementation in the management of people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is based on four randomised controlled trials assessed at unclear to high risk of bias; this does not at present allow confident decision making about the use of selenium supplementation for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This review highlights the need for randomised placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the effects of selenium in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and can ultimately provide reliable evidence to help inform clinical decision making.",

Serum samples were analyzed for thyroid function parameters and selenium concentration. Serum selenium was compared between different demographic, dietary, and lifestyle categories in the two counties. The relationship between selenium status, dietary factors, and pathological thyroid conditions was explored by logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nComplete data sets were available from 3038 adequate-selenium participants and 3114 low-selenium participants in whom median (interquartile range) selenium concentrations differed almost 2-fold (103.6 [79.7, 135.9] vs 57.4 [39.4, 82.1] \u03bcg/L; P = .001). The prevalence of pathological thyroid conditions (hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, and enlarged thyroid) was significantly lower in the adequate-selenium county than in the low-selenium county (18.0 vs 30.5%; P < .001). Higher serum selenium was associated with lower odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of autoimmune thyroiditis (0.47; 0.35, 0.65), subclinical hypothyroidism (0.68; 0.58, 0.93), hypothyroidism (0.75; 0.63, 0.90), and enlarged thyroid (0.75; 0.59, 0.97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow selenium status is associated with increased risk of thyroid disease. Increased selenium intake may reduce the risk in areas of low selenium intake that exist not only in China but also in many other parts of the world.",

        "abstract": "Introduction. Selenium is a micronutrient embedded in several proteins. In adults, the thyroid is the organ with the highest amount of selenium per gram of tissue. Selenium levels in the body depend on the characteristics of the population and its diet, geographic area, and soil composition. In the thyroid, selenium is required for the antioxidant function and for the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Methods. We performed a review of the literature on selenium's role in thyroid function using PubMed/MEDLINE. Results. Regarding thyroid pathology, selenium intake has been particularly associated with autoimmune disorders. The literature suggests that selenium supplementation of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with a reduction in antithyroperoxidase antibody levels, improved thyroid ultrasound features, and improved quality of life. Selenium supplementation in Graves' orbitopathy is associated with an improvement of quality of life and eye involvement, as well as delayed progression of ocular disorders. The organic form of selenium seems to be the preferable formulation for supplementation or treatment. Conclusion. Maintaining a physiological concentration of selenium is a prerequisite to prevent thyroid disease and preserve overall health. Supplementation with the organic form is more effective, and patients with autoimmune thyroiditis seem to have benefits in immunological mechanisms. Selenium supplementation proved to be clinically beneficial in patients with mild to moderate Graves' orbitopathy.",

        "abstract": "Inappropriate intake of key micronutrients in pregnancy is known to alter maternal endocrine status, impair placental development and induce fetal growth restriction. Selenium is an essential micronutrient required for the function of approximately 25 important proteins. However, the specific effects of selenium deficiency during pregnancy on maternal, placental and fetal outcomes are poorly understood. The present study demonstrates that maternal selenium deficiency increases maternal triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine concentrations, reduces fetal blood glucose concentrations, and induces fetal growth restriction. Placental expression of key selenium\u2010dependent thyroid hormone converting enzymes were reduced, whereas the expression of key placental nutrient transporters was dysregulated. Selenium deficiency had minimal impact on selenium\u2010dependent anti\u2010oxidants but increased placental copper concentrations and expression of superoxide dismutase 1. These results highlight the idea that selenium deficiency during pregnancy may contribute to thyroid dysfunction, causing reduced fetal growth, that may precede programmed disease outcomes in offspring.",

        "abstract": "Selenium deficiency during pregnancy can impair fetal development and predispose offspring to thyroid dysfunction. Given that key selenoproteins are highly expressed in the kidney and that poor thyroid health can lead to kidney disease, it is likely that kidney function may be impaired in offspring of selenium\u2010deficient mothers. This study utilized a mouse model of maternal selenium deficiency to investigate kidney protein glycation, mitochondrial adaptations, and urinary excretion in offspring. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed control (>190 \u00b5g selenium/kg) or low selenium (<50 \u00b5g selenium/kg) diets four weeks prior to mating, throughout gestation, and lactation. At postnatal day (PN) 170, offspring were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hr prior to tissue collection at PN180. Maternal selenium deficiency did not impact selenoprotein antioxidant activity, but increased advanced glycation end products in female kidneys. Male offspring had reduced renal Complex II and Complex IV protein levels and lower 24 hr urine flow. Although renal aquaporin 2 (Aqp2) and arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (Avpr2) mRNA were not altered by maternal selenium deficiency, a correlation between urine flow and plasma free T4 concentrations in male but not female offspring suggests that programed thyroid dysfunction may be mediating impaired urine flow. This study demonstrates that maternal selenium deficiency can lead to long\u2010term deficits in kidney parameters that may be secondary to impaired thyroid dysfunction. Considering the significant burden of renal dysfunction as a comorbidity to metabolic diseases, improving maternal selenium intake in pregnancy may be one simple measure to prevent lifelong disease.",

Se content, oxidative stress indicators, and the protein expression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were detected. GDM increased susceptibility to obesity in lactating offspring, with gender differences observed in adult offspring. The effect of Se deficiency on SOD activity only appeared in female offspring during adulthood but was shown in male offspring during weaning though it disappeared during adulthood. GDM and Se deficiency increased the risk of abnormal glucose metabolism in female offspring from weaning to adulthood but gradually decreased in male offspring. The influence on the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins showed the same trend. GDM and Se deficiency affected the growth and glucose metabolism of offspring through oxidative stress and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins, and gender differences existed.",

        "abstract": "Objective Selenium is an essential micronutrient and a type of dietary antioxidant. This study aimed to investigate the associations of dietary selenium intake with the risk of human chronic disease [cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cancer] and mortality among US general adults. Methods The dietary and demographic data in this study were collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2018. Death outcomes were determined by associating with the National Death Index (NDI) records as of December 31, 2019. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship of selenium intake with the risk of CVD, DM, and cancer. The effect of dietary selenium on all-cause and disease-specific mortality was estimated with restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves based on the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results Among the 25,801 participants, dietary selenium intake was divided into quintiles (Q1\u2013Q5). After covariate adjustment, the results showed that the participants with higher quintiles (Q4 and Q5) of selenium intake tended to have a low risk of CVD (OR\u2009=\u20090.97, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99; OR\u2009=\u20090.98, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.00, respectively). Moreover, the RCS curves showed a significant nonlinear association between selenium intake and the risk of all-cause (with a HR of 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.99) and DM-specific mortality (with the lowest HR of 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12\u20130.75). Furthermore, we conducted a subgroup analysis and found a negative correlation between the highest quartile of selenium intake and all-cause mortality among participants aged 50 and above (HR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI: 0.60\u20130.93, p\u2009=\u20090.009). Conclusion Our results indicated that a moderate dietary selenium supplement decreased the risk of CVD and displayed a nonlinear trend in association with the risk of all-cause and DM-specific mortality among US adults. In addition, we found that participants aged 50 and older may benefit from higher selenium intake. However, these findings still need to be confirmed through further mechanism exploration.",
