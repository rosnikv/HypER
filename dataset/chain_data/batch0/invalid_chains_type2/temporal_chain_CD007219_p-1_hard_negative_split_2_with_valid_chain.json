        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe mechanism by which enhanced external counterpulsation therapy exerts its beneficial effects on chronic and symptomatic stable angina is largely unknown. To clarify the mechanism of action of enhanced external counterpulsation, we used(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography to evaluate myocardial perfusion.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThis was not a randomized controlled study. Eleven patients (eight male, age: 61.6+/-9.7) with angina pectoris underwent enhanced external counterpulsation therapy for 35 1 h sessions. They underwent a treadmill exercise test and(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography, both at rest and with dipyridamole, before and after enhanced external counterpulsation therapy. Neurohumoral factors and nitric oxide were also evaluated. Myocardial perfusion increased at rest after therapy (0.69+/-0.27 to 0.85+/-0.47 ml x min(-1) x g(-1), P<0.05). In ischaemic regions, particularly the anterior region, myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and coronary flow reserve improved significantly after therapy (at rest: 0.71+/-0.26 to 0.86+/-0.31;P<0.05, with dipyridamole: 1.26+/-0.65 to 1.84+/-0.94;P<0.02, coronary flow reserve: 1.75+/-0.24 to 2.08+/-0.28;P<0.04). Exercise time was prolonged and the time to 1-mm ST depression improved markedly (P<0.01). After therapy, nitric oxide levels increased (P<0.02) and neurohumoral factors decreased.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnhanced external counterpulsation therapy improved myocardial perfusion at rest and with dipyridamole and was associated with an increased exercise tolerance with(13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography and increased nitric oxide levels. These results suggest that one of the enhanced external counterpulsation mechanisms is development and recruitment of collateral vessels.",

        "title": "Left Ventricular Systolic Unloading and Augmentation of Intracoronary Pressure and Doppler Flow During Enhanced External Counterpulsation",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a noninvasive, pneumatic technique that provides beneficial effects for patients with chronic, symptomatic angina pectoris. However, the physiological effects of EECP have not been studied directly. We examined intracoronary and left ventricular hemodynamics in the cardiac catheterization laboratory during EECP. Methods and Results\u2014Ten patients referred for diagnostic evaluation underwent left heart catheterization and coronary angiography from the radial artery. At baseline and then during EECP, central aortic pressure, intracoronary pressure, and intracoronary Doppler flow velocity were measured using a coronary catheter, a sensor-tipped high-fidelity pressure guidewire, and a Doppler flow guidewire, respectively. Similar to changes in aortic pressure, EECP resulted in a dramatic increase in diastolic (71\u00b110 mm Hg at baseline to 137\u00b121 mm Hg during EECP; +93%;P <0.0001) and mean intracoronary pressures (88\u00b19 to 102\u00b116 mm Hg; +16%;P =0.006) with a decrease in systolic pressure (116\u00b120 to 99\u00b126 mm Hg; \u221215%;P =0.002). The intracoronary Doppler measure of average peak velocity increased from 11\u00b15 cm/s at baseline to 23\u00b15 cm/s during EECP (+109%;P =0.001). The TIMI frame count, a quantitative angiographic measure of coronary flow, showed a 28% increase in coronary flow during EECP compared with baseline (P =0.001). Conclusions\u2014EECP unequivocally and significantly increases diastolic and mean pressures and reduces systolic pressure in the central aorta and the coronary artery. Coronary artery flow, determined by both Doppler and angiographic techniques, is increased during EECP. The combined effects of systolic unloading and increased coronary perfusion pressure provide evidence that EECP may serve as a potential mechanical assist device.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe hemodynamic effects of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) and its mechanism(s) were investigated in relation to neurohumoral factors in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTwenty-four patients with AMI were studied before, during and after EECP treatment for 60 min. Heart rate (HR), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) were determined. In addition, circulating concentrations of neurohumoral factors were determined at each time point. HR did not change following EECP treatment. However, RAP and PCWP increased significantly and CI was significantly elevated during EECP and thereafter. Blood atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration was significantly increased 15 and 60 min after the start of EECP treatment, but brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) did not change. Renin, aldosterone and catecholamine concentrations also did not change.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with EECP resulted in an increased preload because of increased venous return, and CI was increased thereafter. In patients with AMI, EECP increased blood ANP concentration, but not BNP, which suggests that an increase in ANP without an increase in BNP is an important mechanism for the effects of EECP treatment.",

        "title": "Predicted Hemodynamic Benefits Of Counterpulsation Therapy Using A Superficial Surgical Approach",
        "abstract": "A volume-displacement counterpulsation device (CPD) intended for chronic implantation via a superficial surgical approach is proposed. The CPD is a pneumatically driven sac that fills during native heart systole and empties during diastole through a single, valveless cannula anastomosed to the subclavian artery. Computer simulation was performed to predict and compare the physiological responses of the CPD to the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) in a clinically relevant model of early stage heart failure. The effect of device stroke volume (0\u201350 ml) and control modes (timing, duration, morphology) on landmark hemodynamic parameters and the LV pressure-volume relationship were investigated. Simulation results predicted that the CPD would provide hemodynamic benefits comparable to an IABP as evidenced by up to 25% augmentation of peak diastolic aortic pressure, which increases diastolic coronary perfusion by up to 34%. The CPD may also provide up to 34% reduction in LV end-diastolic pressure and 12% reduction in peak systolic aortic pressure, lowering LV workload by up to 26% and increasing cardiac output by up to 10%. This study demonstrated that the superficial CPD technique may be used acutely to achieve similar improvements in hemodynamic function as the IABP in early stage heart failure patients.",

        "abstract": "The acute hemodynamic efficacy of an implantable counterpulsation device (CPD) was evaluated. The CPD is a valveless single port, 32-ml stroke volume blood chamber designed to be connected to the human axillary artery using a simple surface surgical procedure. Blood is drawn into the pump during systole and ejected during diastole. The acute hemodynamic effects of the 32-ml CPD were compared to a standard clinical 40-ml intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in calves (80 kg, n = 10). The calves were treated by a single oral dose of Monensin to produce a model of diminished cardiac function (DCF). The CPD and IABP produced similar increases in cardiac output (6% CPD vs. 5% IABP, p > 0.5) and reduction in left ventricular external work (14% CPD vs. 13% IABP, p > 0.5) compared to DCF (p < 0.05). However, the ratio of diastolic coronary artery flow to left ventricular external work increase from DCF baseline (p < 0.05) was greater with the CPD compared to the IABP (15% vs. 4%, p < 0.05). The CPD also produced a greater reduction in left ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption from DCF baseline (p < 0.05) compared to the IABP (13% vs. 9%, p < 0.05) despite each device providing similar improvements in cardiac output. There was no early indication of hemolysis, thrombus formation, or vascular injury. The CPD provides hemodynamic efficacy equivalent to an IABP and may become a therapeutic option for patients who may benefit from prolonged counterpulsation.",

        "abstract": "The miniaturization of mechanical assist devices and less invasive implantation techniques may lead to earlier intervention in patients with heart failure. As such, we evaluated the effectiveness of a novel, minimally invasive, implantable counterpulsation device (CPD) in augmenting cardiac function during impaired hemodynamics. We compared the efficacy of a 32-mL stroke volume CPD with a standard 40-mL intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) over a range of clinically relevant pathophysiological conditions. Male calves were instrumented via thoracotomy, the CPD was anastomosed to the left carotid artery, and the IABP was positioned in the descending aorta. Hemodynamic conditions of hypertension, hypotension, and heart failure were pharmacologically simulated and data were recorded during CPD and IABP support (off, 1:2, 1:1 modes) for each condition. In all three pathophysiological conditions, the CPD and IABP produced similar and statistically significant (P < 0.05) increases in coronary artery blood flow normalized to the left ventricular (LV) workload. During hypotension and heart failure conditions, however, the CPD produced significantly greater reductions in LV workload and myocardial oxygen consumption as compared with the IABP. A novel 32-mL CPD connected to a peripheral artery produced equivalent or greater hemodynamic benefits than a standard 40-mL IABP during pharmacologically induced hypertension, hypotension, and heart failure conditions.",

        "abstract": "A counterpulsation device (Symphony) is being developed to provide long-term circulatory support for advanced heart failure (HF) patients. In acute animal experiments, flow waveform patterns in the aortic, carotid, and coronary arteries were compared during Symphony and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. Human data were examined for similarities. The 30-mL Symphony was compared to a 40-mL IABP in calves with cardiac dysfunction (80-100 kg, n = 8). Aortic pressures and aortic, carotid, and coronary artery flows were simultaneously recorded at baseline (devices off) and during 1:1 and 1:2 support. Forward, retrograde, and mean flows were calculated and compared for each test condition. Findings were also compared to aortic flow measurements recorded in HF patients (n = 21) supported by 40-mL IABP. IABP caused significant retrograde flows in the aorta, coronary (IABP: -24 \u00b1 8 mL/min, Symphony: -6 \u00b1 2 mL/min, baseline: -2 \u00b1 1 mL/min, P < 0.05), and carotid arteries (IABP: -30 \u00b1 5 mL/min, Symphony: -0 \u00b1 0 mL/min, baseline: -0 \u00b1 0 L/min, P < 0.05) during ventricular systole compared to the Symphony. IABP support produced higher diastolic pressure and flow augmentation compared to Symphony. Due to retrograde flows during IABP support, Symphony provided higher overall coronary, carotid, and aortic flows. Similar reduction in total aortic flows due to retrograde flow was observed in HF patients during IABP support. Counterpulsation with an IABP via aortic volume displacement produces retrograde flows during rapid balloon deflation that reduces total flow. Counterpulsation with Symphony via volume removal eliminates retrograde flow and improves total flow more than that achieved with IABP. The Symphony may provide long-term hemodynamic benefits in HF patients.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Despite progress with adult ventricular assist devices, limited options exist to support pediatric patients with life-threatening heart disease. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains the clinical standard. To characterize (patho)physiologic responses to different modes of mechanical unloading of the failing pediatric heart, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was compared to intra-aortic balloon pump, pulsatile-flow ventricular assist device, or continuous-flow ventricular assist device support in a pediatric heart failure model. Design: Experimental. Setting: Large animal laboratory operating room. Subjects: Yorkshire piglets (n = 47; 11.7 \u00b1 2.6 kg). Interventions: In piglets with coronary ligation-induced cardiac dysfunction, mechanical circulatory support devices were implanted and studied during maximum support. Measurements and Main Results: Left ventricular, right ventricular, coronary, carotid, systemic arterial, and pulmonary arterial hemodynamics were measured with pressure and flow transducers. Myocardial oxygen consumption and total-body oxygen consumption were calculated from arterial, venous, and coronary sinus blood sampling. Blood flow was measured in 17 organs with microspheres. Paired Student t tests compared baseline and heart failure conditions. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance compared heart failure, device support mode(s), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) findings included 1) an improved left ventricular blood supply/demand ratio during pulsatile-flow ventricular assist device, continuous-flow ventricular assist device, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but not intra-aortic balloon pump support, 2) an improved global myocardial blood supply/demand ratio during pulsatile-flow ventricular assist device and continuous-flow ventricular assist device but not intra-aortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and 3) diminished pulsatility during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous-flow ventricular assist device but not intra-aortic balloon pump and pulsatile-flow ventricular assist device support. A profile of systems-based responses was established for each type of support. Conclusions: Each type of pediatric ventricular assist device provided hemodynamic support by unloading the heart with a different mechanism that created a unique profile of physiological changes. These data contribute novel, clinically relevant insight into pediatric mechanical circulatory support and establish an important resource for pediatric device development and patient selection.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-associated direct hyperbilirubinemia (DHB) is likely multifactorial. The objective of this study is to assess the frequency and risk factors for developing direct hyperbilirubinemia while on ECMO, and its implication on the mortality of children. Methods: We performed a retrospective study between January 2010 and January 2020. Using Mayo Clinic electronic health record, we identified children (<18\u200ayears) who required veno-arterial (VA) ECMO support. Demographics, ECMO indication, laboratory findings, and outcomes were abstracted. Illness acuity scores, including vasoactive-ionotropic score (VIS), were used to assess disease severity at time of admission. Study cohort was divided into two groups: children who developed direct hyperbilirubinemia (DHB) on ECMO and children who did not (control). DHB was defined as direct bilirubin (DB) of >1.0\u200amg/dL. Disease acuity and mortality rates were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk of mortality independent of potential confounding variables. Results: We identified 106 children who required ECMO support during the study period. Of those, 36 (34%) children developed DHB on ECMO. Illness acuity scores were significantly higher in the DHB group on ECMO day 2 (P\u200a=\u200a0.046) and day 7 (P\u200a=\u200a0.01). Mortality rate was higher in the DHB group 72%, versus 29% in the control group (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Conclusion: DHB was associated with a higher mortality rate than the control group.",
