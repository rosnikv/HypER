HCV\u2010AbXTL68 or placebo was administered at doses from 20\u2010240 mg as 2\u20104 infusions during the first 24 hours after transplantation, followed by daily infusions for 6 days, weekly infusions for 3 weeks, and either 2 or 4 weekly infusions for 8 weeks. Serum concentrations of total anti\u2010E2 obtained during daily infusions of 120\u2010240 mg HCV\u2010AbXTL68 were 50\u2010200 \u03bcg/mL above concentrations in the placebo group. Median serum concentration of HCV RNA dropped below baseline in all groups immediately after transplantation. On day 2, median change from baseline in HCV RNA was \u22121.8 and \u22122.4 log in the 120\u2010mg and 240\u2010mg groups, respectively, compared with \u22121.5 log with placebo. The difference was lost after day 7 when the dosing frequency was reduced. The coincidence of increases in anti\u2010E2 with decreases in HCV RNA concentration indicate that the dose\u2010related changes in HCV RNA concentration were a result of HCV\u2010AbXTL68 administration in the 120\u2010 and 240\u2010mg groups. The overall incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was higher with placebo (60%) vs. all active treatments combined (42%). In conclusion, HCV\u2010AbXTL68 may decrease serum concentrations of HCV RNA in patients after liver transplantation. Studies evaluating more frequent daily dosing at doses >120 mg are necessary to investigate sustained viral suppression in this population. Liver Transpl 12:1381\u20131389. 2006. \u00a9 2006 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are attractive biologic drugs due to their exquisite specificity and well understood mechanisms of action, which results in a higher predictability and lower attrition rate compared with other drugs. Therefore, it may seem surprising that only a single mAb is presently marketed for an infectious disease indication. However, the antibiotic resistance crisis, emerging viral diseases and bioterroristic threats have recently spurred the development of anti-infective mAbs, of which more than a dozen are being tested in clinical trials. Conceptually, and validated in many preclinical models, mAbs will be most effective when used prophylactically against acute viral infections and bacterial toxins. The acute bacterial and chronic viral infections, which are medically and economically far more important, are much more difficult to control by antibodies, as the recent clinical failure of some polyclonal antibody products has shown. In these situations, the synergistic action of two or more mAbs together with a small molecule drug will most likely be required for therapeutic efficacy. This review aims to highlight the scientific and economic opportunities and obstacles that are encountered in the quest to add mAbs to the armament of anti-infective drugs.",

        "abstract": "Almost 3 decades ago, murine IgG3 was proposed to interact with a different receptor than the other IgG subclasses, but the issue remains unresolved. The question of whether a specific receptor exists for IgG3 is critically important for understanding Ab-mediated immunity against Cryptococcus neoformans, where the different isotypes manifest profound differences in protective efficacy. In this study, we revisited this question by analyzing IgG1- and IgG3-mediated phagocytosis with variable region-identical mAbs using mouse macrophages deficient in various receptors and in conditions of Fc\u03b3R and complement receptor blockage with specific Abs. IgG3 was an efficient opsonin for C. neoformans in Fc\u03b3R- and CD18-deficient cells and in the presence of blocking Abs to Fc\u03b3R and complement receptor. Like IgG1, IgG3-mediated phagocytosis was associated with fungal residence in a mature phagosome that was followed by intracellular replication and exocytosis events. We conclude that a specific receptor for IgG3 exists in mice that is structurally different from the known Fc\u03b3Rs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Autophagy is used by eukaryotes in bulk cellular material recycling and in immunity to intracellular pathogens. We evaluated the role of macrophage autophagy in the response to Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans, two important opportunistic fungal pathogens. The autophagosome marker LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha) was present in most macrophage vacuoles containing C. albicans. In contrast, LC3 was found in only a few vacuoles containing C. neoformans previously opsonized with antibody but never after complement-mediated phagocytosis. Disruption of host autophagy in vitro by RNA interference against ATG5 (autophagy-related 5) decreased the phagocytosis of C. albicans and the fungistatic activity of J774.16 macrophage-like cells against both fungi, independent of the opsonin used. ATG5-knockout bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) also had decreased fungistatic activity against C. neoformans when activated. In contrast, nonactivated ATG5-knockout BMMs actually restricted C. neoformans growth more efficiently, suggesting that macrophage autophagy plays different roles against C. neoformans, depending on the macrophage type and activation. Interference with autophagy in J774.16 cells also decreased nonlytic exocytosis of C. neoformans, increased interleukin-6 secretion, and decreased gamma interferon-induced protein 10 secretion. Mice with a conditionally knocked out ATG5 gene in myeloid cells showed increased susceptibility to intravenous C. albicans infection. In contrast, these mice manifested no increased susceptibility to C. neoformans, as measured by survival, but had fewer alternatively activated macrophages and less inflammation in the lungs after intratracheal infection than control mice. These results demonstrate the complex roles of macrophage autophagy in restricting intracellular parasitism by fungi and reveal connections with nonlytic exocytosis, humoral immunity, and cytokine signaling.",

        "abstract": "Cryptococcus is a potentially fatal fungal pathogen and a leading cause of death in immunocompromised patients. As an opportunistic and facultative intracellular pathogen of humans, Cryptococcus exhibits a complex set of interactions with the host immune system in general, and macrophages in particular. Cryptococcus is resistant to phagocytosis but is also able to survive and proliferate within the mature phagolysosome. It can cause the lysis of host cells, can be transferred between macrophages or exit non\u2010lytically via vomocytosis. Efficient phagocytosis is reliant on opsonization and Cryptococcus has a number of anti\u2010phagocytic strategies including formation of titan cells and a thick polysaccharide capsule. Following uptake, phagosome maturation appears to occur normally, but the internalized pathogen is able to survive and replicate.

        "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes cryptococccosis in immunocompromised patients as well as immunocompetent individuals. Host cell surface receptors that recognize C. neoformans have been widely studied. However, intracellular sensing of this pathogen is still poorly understood. Our previous studies have demonstrated that both biofilm and acapsular mutant of C. neoformans are able to activate the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. In the current study, it was found that opsonization-mediated internalization of encapsulated C. neoformans also activated the canonical NLRP3\u2013apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC)\u2013caspase-1 inflammasome. In addition, the internalized C. neoformans activated the noncanonical NLRP3\u2013ASC\u2013caspase-8 inflammasome as well, which resulted in robust IL-1\u03b2 secretion and cell death from caspase-1\u2013deficient primary dendritic cells. Interestingly, we found that caspase-1 was inhibitory for the activation of caspase-8 in dendritic cells upon C. neorformans challenge. Further mechanistic studies showed that both phagolysosome membrane permeabilization and potassium efflux were responsible for C. neoformans\u2013induced activation of either the canonical NLRP3\u2013ASC\u2013caspase-1 inflammasome or the noncanonical NLRP3\u2013ASC\u2013caspase-8 inflammasome. Moreover, challenge with zymosan also led to the activation of the noncanonical NLRP3\u2013ASC\u2013caspase-8 inflammasome in cells absent for caspase-1. Collectively, these findings uncover a number of novel signaling pathways for the innate immune response of host cells to C. neoformans infection and suggest that manipulating NLRP3 signaling may help to control fungal challenge.",

        "title": "Rim Pathway-Mediated Alterations in the Fungal Cell Wall Influence Immune Recognition and Inflammation",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Compared to other fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus neoformans is particularly adept at avoiding detection by innate immune cells. To explore fungal cellular features involved in immune avoidance, we characterized cell surface changes of the C. neoformans rim101\u0394 mutant, a strain that fails to organize and shield immunogenic epitopes from host detection. These cell surface changes are associated with an exaggerated, detrimental inflammatory response in mouse models of infection. We determined that the disorganized strain rim101\u0394 cell wall increases macrophage detection in a contact-dependent manner. Using biochemical and microscopy methods, we demonstrated that the rim101\u0394 strain shows a modest increase in the levels of both cell wall chitin and chitosan but that it shows a more dramatic increase in chito-oligomer exposure, as measured by wheat germ agglutinin staining. We also created a series of mutants with various levels of cell wall wheat germ agglutinin staining, and we demonstrated that the staining intensity correlates with the degree of macrophage activation in response to each strain. To explore the host receptors responsible for recognizing the rim101\u0394 mutant, we determined that both the MyD88 and CARD9 innate immune signaling proteins are involved. Finally, we characterized the immune response to the rim101\u0394 mutant in vivo, documenting a dramatic and sustained increase in Th1 and Th17 cytokine responses. These results suggest that the Rim101 transcription factor actively regulates the C. neoformans cell wall to prevent the exposure of immune stimulatory molecules within the host. These studies further explored the ways in which immune cells detect C. neoformans and other fungal pathogens by mechanisms that include sensing N-acetylglucosamine-containing structures, such as chitin and chitosan. IMPORTANCE Infectious microorganisms have developed many ways to avoid recognition by the host immune system. For example, pathogenic fungi alter their cell surfaces to mask immunogenic epitopes. We have created a fungal strain with a targeted mutation in a pH response pathway that is unable to properly organize its cell wall, resulting in a dramatic immune reaction during infection. This mutant cell wall is defective in hiding important cell wall components, such as the chito-oligomers chitin and chitosan. By creating a series of cell wall mutants, we demonstrated that the degree of chito-oligomer exposure correlates with the intensity of innate immune cell activation. This activation requires a combination of host receptors to recognize and respond to these infecting microorganisms. Therefore, these experiments explored host-pathogen interactions that determine the degree of the subsequent inflammatory response and the likely outcome of infection.

        "title": "Defects in intracellular trafficking of fungal cell wall synthases lead to aberrant host immune recognition",
        "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, dramatically alters its cell wall, both in size and composition, upon entering the host. This cell wall remodeling is essential for host immune avoidance by this pathogen. In a genetic screen for mutants with changes in their cell wall, we identified a novel protein, Mar1, that controls cell wall organization and immune evasion. Through phenotypic studies of a loss-of-function strain, we have demonstrated that the mar1\u0394 mutant has an aberrant cell surface and a defect in polysaccharide capsule attachment, resulting in attenuated virulence. Furthermore, the mar1\u0394 mutant displays increased staining for exposed cell wall chitin and chitosan when the cells are grown in host-like tissue culture conditions. However, HPLC analysis of whole cell walls and RT-PCR analysis of cell wall synthase genes demonstrated that this increased chitin exposure is likely due to decreased levels of glucans and mannans in the outer cell wall layers. We observed that the Mar1 protein differentially localizes to cellular membranes in a condition dependent manner, and we have further shown that the mar1\u0394 mutant displays defects in intracellular trafficking, resulting in a mislocalization of the \u03b2-glucan synthase catalytic subunit, Fks1. These cell surface changes influence the host-pathogen interaction, resulting in increased macrophage activation to microbial challenge in vitro. We established that several host innate immune signaling proteins are required for the observed macrophage activation, including the Card9 and MyD88 adaptor proteins, as well as the Dectin-1 and TLR2 pattern recognition receptors. These studies explore novel mechanisms by which a microbial pathogen regulates its cell surface in response to the host, as well as how dysregulation of this adaptive response leads to defective immune avoidance.",

        "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common disseminated fungal pathogen in AIDS patients, resulting in \u223c200,000 deaths each year. There is a pressing need for new treatments for this infection, as current antifungal therapy is hampered by toxicity and/or the inability of the host\u2019s immune system to aid in resolution of the disease. An ideal target for new therapies is the fungal cell wall. The cryptococcal cell wall is different from the cell walls of many other pathogenic fungi in that it contains chitosan. Strains that have decreased chitosan are less pathogenic and strains that are deficient in chitosan are avirulent and can induce protective responses. In this study, we investigated the host responses to a chs3\u0394 strain, a chitosan-deficient strain, and found that mice inoculated with the chs3\u0394 strain all died within 36\u2009h and that death was associated with an aberrant hyperinflammatory immune response driven by neutrophils, indicating that chitosan is critical in modulating the immune response to Cryptococcus. ABSTRACT Cryptococcus neoformans infections are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among AIDS patients and the third most common invasive fungal infection in organ transplant recipients. One of the main interfaces between the fungus and the host is the fungal cell wall. The cryptococcal cell wall is unusual among human-pathogenic fungi in that the chitin is predominantly deacetylated to chitosan. Chitosan-deficient strains of C. neoformans were found to be avirulent and rapidly cleared from the murine lung. Moreover, infection with a chitosan-deficient C. neoformans strain lacking three chitin deacetylases (cda1\u0394cda2\u0394cda3\u0394) was found to confer protective immunity to a subsequent challenge with a virulent wild-type counterpart. In addition to the chitin deacetylases, it was previously shown that chitin synthase 3 (Chs3) is also essential for chitin deacetylase-mediated formation of chitosan. Mice inoculated with the chs3\u0394 strain at a dose previously shown to induce protection with the cda1\u0394cda2\u0394cda3\u0394 strain die within 36\u2009h after installation of the organism. Mortality was not dependent on viable fungi, as mice inoculated with a heat-killed preparation of the chs3\u0394 strain died at the same rate as mice inoculated with a live chs3\u0394 strain, suggesting that the rapid onset of death was host mediated, likely caused by an overexuberant immune response. Histology, cytokine profiling, and flow cytometry indicate a massive neutrophil influx in the mice inoculated with the chs3\u0394 strain. Mice depleted of neutrophils survived chs3\u0394 inoculation, indicating that death was neutrophil mediated. Altogether, these studies lead us to conclude that Chs3, along with chitosan, plays critical roles in dampening cryptococcus-induced host inflammatory responses. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common disseminated fungal pathogen in AIDS patients, resulting in \u223c200,000 deaths each year. There is a pressing need for new treatments for this infection, as current antifungal therapy is hampered by toxicity and/or the inability of the host\u2019s immune system to aid in resolution of the disease.

        "abstract": "The cell wall is the interface between the fungal cell and its environment and disruption of cell wall assembly is an effective strategy for antifungal therapies. Therefore, a detailed understanding of how cell walls form is critical to identify potential drug targets and develop therapeutic strategies. ABSTRACT The polysaccharide chitosan is found in the cell wall of specific cell types in a variety of fungal species where it contributes to stress resistance, or in pathogenic fungi, virulence. Under certain growth conditions, the pathogenic yeast Candida dubliniensis forms a cell type termed a chlamydospore, which has an additional internal layer in its cell wall compared to hyphal or yeast cell types. We report that this internal layer of the chlamydospore wall is rich in chitosan. The ascospore wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae also has a distinct chitosan layer. As in S. cerevisiae, formation of the chitosan layer in the C. dubliniensis wall requires the chitin synthase CHS3 and the chitin deacetylase CDA2. In addition, three lipid droplet-localized proteins\u2014Rrt8, Srt1, and Mum3\u2014identified in S. cerevisiae as important for chitosan layer assembly in the ascospore wall are required for the formation of the chitosan layer of the chlamydospore wall in C. dubliniensis. These results reveal that a conserved machinery is required for the synthesis of a distinct chitosan layer in the walls of these two yeasts and may be generally important for incorporation of chitosan into fungal walls. IMPORTANCE The cell wall is the interface between the fungal cell and its environment and disruption of cell wall assembly is an effective strategy for antifungal therapies. Therefore, a detailed understanding of how cell walls form is critical to identify potential drug targets and develop therapeutic strategies. This study shows that a set of genes required for the assembly of a chitosan layer in the cell wall of S. cerevisiae is also necessary for chitosan formation in a different cell type in a different yeast, C. dubliniensis. Because chitosan incorporation into the cell wall can be important for virulence, the conservation of this pathway suggests possible new targets for antifungals aimed at disrupting cell wall function.",

        "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida glabrata are two opportunistic human fungal pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases. During infection, both microorganisms have the ability to persist for long periods, and treatment failure can occur even if standard testing identifies the yeasts to be sensitive to antifungals. ABSTRACT Replicative aging is an underexplored field of research in medical mycology. Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) and Candida glabrata (Cg) are dreaded fungal pathogens that cause fatal invasive infections. The fungal cell wall is essential for yeast viability and pathogenesis. In this study, we provide data characterizing age-associated modifications to the cell wall of Cn and Cg. Here, we report that old yeast cells upregulate genes of cell wall biosynthesis, leading to cell wall reorganization and increased levels of all major components, including glucan, chitin, and its derivatives, as well as mannan. This results in a significant thickening of the cell wall in aged cells. Old-generation yeast cells exhibited drastic ultrastructural changes, including the presence of abundant vesicle-like particles in the cytoplasm, and enlarged vacuoles with altered pH homeostasis. Our findings suggest that the cell wall modifications could be enabled by augmented intracellular trafficking. This work furthers our understanding of the cell phenotype that emerges during aging. It highlights differences in these two fungal pathogens and elucidates mechanisms that explain the enhanced resistance of old cells to antifungals and phagocytic attacks. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida glabrata are two opportunistic human fungal pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases. During infection, both microorganisms have the ability to persist for long periods, and treatment failure can occur even if standard testing identifies the yeasts to be sensitive to antifungals. Replicative life span is a trait that is measured by the number of divisions a cell undergoes before death. Aging in fungi is associated with enhanced tolerance to antifungals and resistance to phagocytosis, and characterization of old cells may help identify novel antifungal targets. The cell wall remains an attractive target for new therapies because it is essential for fungi and is not present in humans. This study shows that the organization of the fungal cell wall changes remarkably during aging and becomes thicker and is associated with increased intracellular trafficking as well as the alteration of vacuole morphology and pH homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an invasive fungus that causes both acute and chronic infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Owing to the increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant pathogenic fungi and the limitations of current treatment strategies, drug repositioning has become a feasible strategy to accelerate the development of new drugs. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentration of vitamin D3 (VD3) against C. neoformans was found to be 0.4 mg/mL by broth microdilution assay. The antifungal activities of VD3 were further verified by solid dilution assays and \u201ctime-kill\u201d curves. The results showed that VD3 reduced fungal cell adhesion and hydrophobicity and inhibited biofilm formation at various developmental stages, as confirmed by crystal violet staining and the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay. Fluorescence staining of cellular components and a stress susceptibility assay indicated that VD3 compromised cell integrity. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR demonstrated that VD3 treatment upregulated the expression of fungal genes related to cell wall synthesis (i.e., CDA3, CHS3, FKS1, and AGS1). Moreover, VD3 enhanced cell membrane permeability and caused the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Finally, VD3 significantly reduced the tissue fungal burden and prolonged the survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with C. neoformans. These results showed that VD3 could exert significant antifungal activities both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating its potential application in the treatment of cryptococcal infections.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the antifungal effect of vitamin D3 on Cryptococcus neoformans, which is one of the fungal pathogens studied in the source paper. The source paper's findings on cell wall remodeling and aging could provide a sub-hypothesis for understanding the mechanisms of vitamin D3's antifungal activity."
