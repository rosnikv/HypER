        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nThe AIM of this study was to evaluate the effect of non-surgical therapy on clinical variables and glycemic control on type 2 diabetics with chronic periodontitis.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nForty six type 2 diabetics with chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups (group A and group B). Treatment included scaling and root planning for group A plus systematic use of doxycycline in both groups. Assessment was made prior to and 16 weeks following the therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of data showed that both groups had clinical and glycated hemoglobin (HbAlc) improvement after the treatment. Group A had a statistically significant reduction of plaque index and bleeding on probing scores compared with controls (P < 0.05) at 16 weeks.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that non-surgical therapy is of value in maintaining periodontal health and may be beneficial in reducing blood glucose level in type 2 diabetics with chronic periodontitis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe literature contains few studies regarding the relationships between receipt of regular dental care and medical outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors compared hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) levels (< 7 percent versus < 7 percent), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (< 100 milligrams/deciliter versus \u2265 100 mg/dL) and diabetes-specific hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits (one or more visits versus no visits) in 493 people with type 2 diabetes who received regular dental care (\u2265 two prophylactic visits, periodontal treatment visits or both during a 12-month period) with measures in 493 people with type 2 diabetes who did not receive any dental care. The authors matched patients, all of whom had private medical and dental insurance benefits during the study period, with regard to age, sex and previous utilization of ED visits and hospital admissions, and they followed them for three years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe authors analyzed the data by using multiple logistic regression, which showed that receipt of regular dental care was associated with lower diabetes-specific ED utilization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.40-0.92) and hospital admissions (OR = 0.61, 95 percent CI, 0.39-0.95) after they adjusted for age, sex, previous hospital admissions, previous ED utilization, race, baseline HbA(1c) values, Charlson comorbidity index score, body mass index status, periodontal risk status and primary care utilization. The authors found no significant association between receipt of dental care and control of HbA(1c) levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe study results show an association between regular receipt of dental care and reduced diabetes-specific medical care utilization (that is, ED visits and hospital admissions).\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nAlthough the results of this study could not show causality, they suggest that receipt of dental care may reduce diabetes-specific health care utilization. Prospective studies are needed to better understand the relationship of receipt of dental care with diabetes control and health care utilization measures.",

        "title": "Association of Dental Care with Adherence to HEDIS Measures.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nThe dental setting represents an unrealized opportunity to increase adherence to preventive services and improve health outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare adherence to a subset of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures among a population that received dental care with a population that did not receive dental care.\n\n\nDESIGN\nUsing a retrospective cohort design, we identified 5216 adults who received regular dental care and 5216 persons who did not. The groups were matched on propensity scores, were followed for 3 years, and retained medical and dental benefits. Receipt of dental care was defined as 1 or more dental visits in each 12-month period.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nOutcome measures were assessed in a subpopulation that qualified for 1 of 5 HEDIS denominator groups (dental = 4184 patients; nondental = 3871 patients). They included 3 preventive measures (cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer screening), 4 chronic disease management services (hemoglobin A1c and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol testing, and nephropathy and retinopathy screening among the diabetes mellitus [DM] population), and 4 health outcome measures (poor glycemic control, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control, blood pressure control in the DM population, and blood pressure control in the hypertensive population).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDental care was associated with higher adherence to all three cancer screening measures, one of four disease management services (higher retinopathy screening), and three of four health outcomes (better glycemic control in the DM population and better blood pressure control in the DM and hypertensive populations).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDental care was associated with improved adherence to 7 of 11 HEDIS measures.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical big data amasses from different sources such as electronic health records, health research, wearable devices and social media. Recent advances in data capturing, storage and analysis techniques have facilitated conversion of a wealth of knowledge in biomedical big data into evidence-based actionable plans to enhance population health and well-being. The delay in reaping the benefits of biomedical big data in dentistry is mainly due to the slow adoption of electronic health record systems, unstructured clinical records, tattered communication between data silos and perceiving oral health as a separate entity from general health. Recent recognition of the complex interplay between oral and general health has acknowledged the power of oral health big data to glean new insights on disease prevention and management. This review paper summarizes recent advances, limitations and challenges in biomedical big data in health care with emphasis on oral health and discusses the potential future applications of oral health big data to improve the quality and efficiency of personalized health care.",

        "title": "Using big data to promote precision oral health in the context of a learning healthcare system",
        "abstract": "Summary There has been a call for evidence\u2010based oral healthcare guidelines, to improve precision dentistry and oral healthcare delivery. The main challenges to this goal are the current lack of up\u2010to\u2010date evidence, the limited integrative analytical data sets, and the slow translations to routine care delivery. Overcoming these issues requires knowledge discovery pipelines based on big data and health analytics, intelligent integrative informatics approaches, and learning health systems. This article examines how this can be accomplished by utilizing big data. These data can be gathered from four major streams: patients, clinical data, biological data, and normative data sets. All these must then be uniformly combined for analysis and modelling and the meaningful findings can be implemented clinically. By executing data capture cycles and integrating the subsequent findings, practitioners are able to improve public oral health and care delivery.",

        "abstract": "The study aims to investigate the obstacles and factors influencing the adoption of big data in healthcare organizations, and its subsequent impact on patient satisfaction. Big data in healthcare refers to the collecting, analysis, and use of clinical data from patients that is too massive or complex to be grasped by standard data processing methods. Adopting big data in health care will enable manages to render services to patient and customer satisfaction. However, in the health care sector, firms must overcome several hurdles and problems by adopting new technology. A detailed literature review was undertaken to examine many obstacles associated with the use of Big Data. A well-structured questionnaire was prepared in Likert scale to find the elements that influence big data adoption and its impact on patient satisfaction. To evaluate factors, exploratory factor analysis using SPSS 21 was performed, and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed to assess key significant factors that impact patient satisfaction. The data was gathered from employees associated with the hospitals. The survey received responses from 212 participants. Following the analysis of the data, it was found that five challenging factors influences big data adoption. These are data integration, data understanding, technology and infrastructure, lack of expert and regulation barrier. These factors explained 70.36% of variance. Whereas, SEM analysis indicated that both data integration, data understanding and lack of expertise significantly affect big data adoption Furthermore, big data adoption in hospitals will help in improving patient satisfaction.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine the key socio-technical factors influencing big data analytics adoption in healthcare services. A systematic literature review was conducted using peer-reviewed scholarly publications spanning from 2013 to 2023 to illuminate the influencing factors. Twelve papers focused on the factors influencing big data analytics (BDA) adoption in healthcare services were included for review. The factors were divided into four major groups namely i) person, ii) technology, iii) organization, and iv) environment. Analytical skills define a person, whereas technology is characterized by system quality and information quality. Organization support, organization resources, training, data governance, and evidence-based decision-making are all associated with the organization. Finally, government regulations are allocated to the environment. This review presents evidence of the socio-technical factors that influence big data analytics adoption in healthcare services. The findings from this review recommend future big data analytics adoption in healthcare services to carefully evaluate the factors identified in this study.",
