        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe investigated the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GcRs) in the intrahepatic biliary epithelium and the role of corticosteroids in the regulation of cholangiocyte secretion.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGcR was studied by immunohistochemistry, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blots. The effects of dexamethasone and budesonide on biliary bicarbonate excretion and H+/HCO3- transport processes were investigated in bile fistula rats, isolated intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDUs), and purified cholangiocytes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGcRs were expressed by rat cholangiocytes. Although acute administration of corticosteroids showed no effect, treatment for 2 days with dexamethasone or budesonide increased (P < 0.05) biliary bicarbonate concentration and secretion, which were blocked by the specific GcR antagonist, RU-486. IBDUs isolated from rats treated with dexamethasone or budesonide showed an increased (P < 0.05) activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE2 member), which was blocked by RU-486. Protein expression of NHE1 and AE2 and messenger RNA for NH1 but not AE2 were increased (P < 0.05) in isolated cholangiocytes by dexamethasone treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe intrahepatic biliary epithelium expresses GcR and responds to corticosteroids by increasing bicarbonate excretion in bile. This is caused by corticosteroid-induced enhanced activities and protein expression of transport processes driving bicarbonate excretion in the biliary epithelium.",

        "title": "Variants Associated with Infantile Cholestatic Syndromes Detected in Extrahepatic Biliary Atresia by Whole Exome Studies: A 20-Case Series from Thailand",
        "abstract": "Abstract Biliary atresia (BA) is the most severe form of obstructive cholangiopathy occurring in infants. Definitive diagnosis of BA usually relies on operative findings together with supporting pathological patterns found in the extrahepatic bile duct. In infancy, overlapping clinical patterns of cholestasis can be found in other diseases including biliary hypoplasia and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. In addition, BA has been reported as a phenotype in some rare genetic syndromes. Unlike BA, other cholangiopathic phenotypes have their own established genetic markers. In this study, we used these markers to look for other cholestasis entities in cases diagnosed with BA. DNA from 20 cases of BA, diagnosed by operative findings and histopathology, were subjected to a study of 19 genes associated with infantile cholestasis syndromes, using whole exome sequencing. Variant selection focused on those with allele frequencies in dbSNP150 of less than 0.01. All selected variants were verified by polymerase chain reaction\u2013direct sequencing. Of the 20 cases studied, 13 rare variants were detected in 9 genes: 4 in JAG1 (Alagille syndrome), 2 in MYO5B (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis [PFIC] type 6), and one each in ABCC2 (Dubin\u2013Johnson syndrome), ABCB11 (PFIC type 2), UG1A1 (Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome), MLL2 (Kabuki syndrome), RFX6 (Mitchell\u2013Riley syndrome), ERCC4 (Fanconi anemia), and KCNH1 (Zimmermann\u2013Laband syndrome). Genetic lesions associated with various cholestatic syndromes detected in cases diagnosed with BA raised the hypothesis that severe inflammatory cholangiopathy in BA may not be a distinct disease entity, but a shared pathology among several infantile cholestatic syndromes.",

        "title": "Unequal Effects of Myosin 5B Mutations in Liver and Intestine Determine the Clinical Presentation of Low\u2010Gamma\u2010Glutamyltransferase Cholestasis",
        "abstract": "Mutations in the MYO5B gene cause in some patients low gamma-glutamyltransferase (low-GGT) cholestatic liver disease (CLD) and in other patients microvillus inclusion disease (MVID, a congenital diarrheal and malabsorption disorder). Overlap of symptoms occurs but more MVID patients present cholestasis than CLD patients present diarrhea. Clinical observations indicate that MYO5B mutations can cause but also protect against CLD. This complicates family counseling and therapeutic decisions. Here we have reviewed the literature on MYO5B mutations in relation to CLD. It appears that variations in the clinical presentation of low-GGT CLD can be attributed to the coincident expression but unequal effects of MYO5B mutations in hepatocytes versus enterocytes, two cell types that jointly constitute the core of the enterohepatic circulation. Therefore, contrasting other low-GGT CLDs, those associated with MYO5B mutations should be viewed as a disease of the enterohepatic circulation rather than solely of the liver.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the actin motor protein myosinVb (myo5b) cause aberrant apical cargo transport and the congenital enteropathy microvillus inclusion disease (MVID). Recently, missense mutations in myo5b were also associated with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (MYO5B-PFIC). Here, we thoroughly characterized the ultrastructural and immuno-cytochemical phenotype of hepatocytes and duodenal enterocytes from a unique case of an adult MYO5B-PFIC patient who showed constant hepatopathy but only periodic enteric symptoms. Selected data from two other patients supported the findings. Advanced methods such as cryo-fixation, freeze-substitution, immuno-gold labeling, electron tomography and immuno-fluorescence microscopy complemented the standard procedures. Liver biopsies showed mislocalization of Rab11 and bile canalicular membrane proteins. Rab11-positive vesicles clustered around bile canaliculi and resembled subapical clusters of aberrant recycling endosomes in enterocytes from MVID patients. The adult patient studied in detail showed a severe, MVID-specific enterocyte phenotype, despite only a mild clinical intestinal presentation. This included mislocalization of numerous proteins essential for apical cargo transport and morphological alterations. We characterized the heterogeneous population of large catabolic organelles regarding their complex ultrastructure and differential distribution of autophagic and lysosomal marker proteins. Finally, we generated duodenal organoids/enteroids from biopsies that recapitulated all MVID hallmarks, demonstrating the potential of this disease model for personalized medicine.",

        "title": "Case Report: MYO5B Homozygous Variant c.2090+3A>T Causes Intron Retention Related to Chronic Cholestasis and Diarrhea",
        "abstract": "Background: Biallelically mutated MYO5B is associated with microvillus inclusion disease (MVID, MIM: 251850), cholestasis, or both. This study aims at validating the splicing alteration and clinical features of an intron variant for diagnosis. Case Presentation: A homozygous variant of MYO5B, NM_001080467.2:c.2090+3A > T (NP_001073936.1:p.?) in intron 17, was identified in a patient suffering from chronic cholestasis and diarrhea. Functional validation showed that this variant caused 185 bp of intron retention in its mRNA and was predicted to present a premature translation termination site for myoVb (p.Arg697fs*47) in the head motor domain. In addition, bowel biopsy revealed decreased microvilli and local lesions of microvillus inclusion in the duodena of the patient. The patient was presented with neonatal cholestasis leading to cirrhosis, intractable diarrhea, cholelithiasis, hepatic cyst, corneal opacity, and failure to thrive. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated an intronic homozygous variant of MYO5B that affected an intron, subsequently altering splicing and leading to combined cholestasis and MVID. Our results further supported the underlying genotype\u2013phenotype correlations and extended clinical practices toward its diagnosis and management.",

        "title": "Splicing Analysis of MYO5B Noncanonical Variants in Patients with Low Gamma-Glutamyltransferase Cholestasis",
        "abstract": "Biallelic MYO5B variants have been associated with familial intrahepatic cholestasis (FIC) with low serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Intronic or synonymous variants outside of canonical splice sites (hereinafter referred to as noncanonical variants) with uncertain significance were identified in MYO5B posing a challenge in clinical interpretation. This study is aimed at assessing the effects of these variants on premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing to improve recognition of pathogenic spliceogenic variants in MYO5B and better characterize the MYO5B genetic variation spectrum. Disease-associated MYO5B noncanonical variants were collected from the literature or newly identified low GGT cholestasis patients. In silico splicing predictions were performed to prioritize potential pathogenic variants. Minigene splicing assays were performed to determine their splicing patterns, with confirmation by blood RNA analysis in one case. Eleven (five novel) noncanonical variants with uncertain significance were identified. Minigene splicing assays revealed that three variants (c.2090+3A>T, c.2414+5G>T, and c.613-11G>A) caused complete aberrations, five variants (c.2349A>G/p.(=), c.4221G>A/p.(=), c.1322+5G>A, c.1669-35A>C, and c.3045+3A>T) caused predominant aberrations, and three variants (c.4852+11A>G, c.455+8T>C, and c.2415-6C>G) had no effect on pre-mRNA splicing. Patient-derived RNA analysis showed consistent results. Based on our results, eight variants were reclassified as likely pathogenic and three as likely benign. Combining the clinical features and the above analysis, the diagnosis of MYO5B-associated FIC could be made in three new patients. In conclusion, we characterized the splicing patterns of MYO5B noncanonical variants and suggest that RNA analysis should be routinely included in clinical diagnostics to provide essential evidence for the interpretation of variants.",
