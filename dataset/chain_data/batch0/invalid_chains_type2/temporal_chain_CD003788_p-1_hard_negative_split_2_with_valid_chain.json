        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAcupuncture is commonly used by patients with chronic painful musculoskeletal disorders. There are, however, few well-designed studies of its efficacy. This paper describes a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design to evaluate acupuncture as a useful treatment adjunct in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-four patients were centrally randomized from a hospital-based rheumatology out-patient clinic. Fifty-six patients were suitable for study, all were on second-line therapy and aged 18-75 yr. There had been no change in therapy for the preceding 3 months. Patients who had previous acupuncture, anticoagulation, fear of needles or infection were excluded. Single-point (Liver 3) acupuncture or placebo was given with an intervening 6 week wash-out period. The acupuncturist, patient and statistician were blinded as far as possible. The outcome measures included the inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), visual analogue scale of pain, global patient assessment, 28 swollen and tender joint count, and a general health questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrated no significant effect of treatment or period and no significant interaction between treatment and period for any outcome variable. No adverse effects were reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcupuncture of this type cannot be considered as a useful adjunct to therapy in patients with RA. Possible reasons why this is the case are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

        "abstract": "Acupuncture has a beneficial effect when treating many diseases and painful conditions, and therefore is thought to be useful as a complementary therapy or to replace generally accepted pharmacological intervention. The attributive effect of acupuncture has been investigated in inflammatory diseases, including asthma, rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, epicondylitis, complex regional pain syndrome type 1 and vasculitis. Large randomised trials demonstrating the immediate and sustained effect of acupuncture are missing. Mechanisms underlying the ascribed immunosuppressive actions of acupuncture are reviewed in this communication. The acupuncture-controlled release of neuropeptides from nerve endings and subsequent vasodilative and anti-inflammatory effects through calcitonine gene-related peptide is hypothesised. The complex interactions with substance P, the analgesic contribution of beta-endorphin and the balance between cell-specific pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 are discussed.",

        "title": "Electroacupuncture attenuates inflammation in a rat model.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAcupuncture has traditionally been used in China and is being increasingly applied in Western countries to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammatory disease. However, clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have yielded inconsistent results, and the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture-produced anti-inflammation are unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) on inflammation in a rat model.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFour experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8-9 per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw of the rat. Experiment 1: To determine the effect of EA (10 and 100 Hz) versus sham treatment on inflammation. Experiment 2: To investigate the involvement of the adrenal glands on the effect of EA treatment using adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. Experiment 3: To determine the effects of EA on plasma levels of corticosterone. Experiment 4: To determine the effects of EA treatment versus immobilization on such stress indicators as heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 10 Hz EA significantly reduced CFA-induced hind paw edema. The effect was partially blocked in the ADX rats. EA significantly increased plasma levels of corticosterone but produced no noticeable signs of stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAt 10 Hz but not 100 Hz, EA suppresses inflammation by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), especially p38 MAPK, plays an important role in the development of central sensitization related to persistent inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is well known to relieve persistent inflammatory pain. However, little is known about relationship between EA and p38 MAPK. Inflammatory pain rat model was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into the saline group, CFA group, and CFA + EA group. EA (constant saquare wave, 2\u2009Hz and 100\u2009Hz alternating frequencies, intensities ranging from 1 to 2\u2009mA) was applied to bilateral \u201cZusanli\u201d (ST 36) and \u201cKunlun\u201d acupoints (BL 60) for 30\u2009min, once per day. The paw edema and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured at preinjection and days postinjection 1, 3, and 14. Spinal p-p38MAPK- immunoreactivty (p-p38MAPK-IR) cells were detected by immunohistochemistry at postinjection day 3 and 14. EA significantly inhibited paw edema at postinjection days 14 and increased PWT at postinjection days 3 and 14. Moreover, the increasing number of spinal p-p38MAPK-IR cells which was induced by CFA injection was suppressed by EA stimulation. These results indicate that anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of EA might be associated with its inhibition of spinal p38 MAPK activation and thereby provide a potential mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory pain by EA.",

        "title": "Electroacupuncture Promotes the Differentiation of Transplanted Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Overexpressing TrkC into Neuron-Like Cells in Transected Spinal Cord of Rats",
        "abstract": "Our previous study indicated that electroacupuncture (EA) could increase neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels in the injured spinal cord, stimulate the differentiation of transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and improve functional recovery in the injured spinal cord of rats. However, the number of neuron-like cells derived from the MSCs is limited. It is known that NT-3 promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons by preferentially binding to its receptor TrkC. In this study, we attempted to transplant TrkC gene-modified MSCs (TrkC-MSCs) into the spinal cord with transection to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the injured spinal cord and to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance transplanted MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into neuron-like cells, resulting in increased axonal regeneration and functional improvement in the injured spinal cord. Our results showed that EA increased NT-3 levels; furthermore, it promoted neuron-phenotype differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelin formation of transplanted TrkC-MSCs. In addition, TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA (the TrkC-MSCs + EA group) treatment promoted the growth of the descending BDA-labeled corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and 5-HT-positive axonal regeneration across the lesion site into the caudal cord. In addition, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and hindlimb locomotor function increased as compared to controls (treated with the LacZ-MSCs, TrkC-MSCs, and LacZ-MSCs + EA groups). In the TrkC-MSCs + EA group, the injured spinal cord also showed upregulated expression of the proneurogenic factors laminin and GAP-43 and downregulated GFAP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major inhibitors of axonal growth. Together, our data suggest that TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment spinal cord injury not only increased MSC survival and differentiation into neuron-like cells but also promoted CST regeneration across injured sites to the caudal cord and functional improvement, perhaps due to increase of NT-3 levels, upregulation of laminin and GAP-43, and downregulation of GFAP and CSPG proteins.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can be obtained from various organs and easily propagated in vitro, are one of the most extensively used types of stem cells and have been shown to be efficacious in a broad set of diseases. The unique and highly desirable properties of MSCs include high migratory capacities toward injured areas, immunomodulatory features, and the natural ability to differentiate into connective tissue phenotypes. These phenotypes include bone and cartilage, and these properties predispose MSCs to be therapeutically useful. In addition, MSCs elicit their therapeutic effects by paracrine actions, in which the metabolism of target tissues is modulated. Genetic engineering methods can greatly amplify these properties and broaden the therapeutic capabilities of MSCs, including transdifferentiation toward diverse cell lineages. However, cell engineering can also affect safety and increase the cost of therapy based on MSCs; thus, the advantages and disadvantages of these procedures should be discussed. In this review, the latest applications of genetic engineering methods for MSCs with regenerative medicine purposes are presented.",

Considerable evidence revealed their efficacy on various animal models of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and uveitis. MSCs elicit their immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting lymphocyte activation and proliferation, forbidding the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, limiting the function of antigen presenting cells, and inducing regulatory T (Treg) and B (Breg) cells. The induction of Treg and Breg cells is of particular interest since Treg and Breg cells have significant roles in maintaining immune tolerance. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding to the MSCs-mediated induction of Treg and Breg cells. Accordingly, MSCs induce regulatory lymphocytes through secretion of multiple pleiotropic cytokines, cell-to-cell contact with target cells and modulation of antigen-presenting cells. Here, we summarized how MSCs induce Treg and Breg cells to provoke immunosuppression.",

        "abstract": "Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a rare chronic disease, related to autoimmune connective tissue diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome. Although its clinical heterogeneity, main features of the disease are: extensive tissue fibrosis with increase matrix deposition in skin and internal organ, microvascular alterations and activation of the immune system with autoantibodies against various cellular antigens. In the diffuse cutaneous scleroderma subtype, the disease is rapidly progressive with a poor prognosis, leading to failure of almost any internal organ, especially lung which is the leading cause of death. Primary trigger is unknown but may involve an immune process against mesenchymal cells in a genetically receptive host. Pathophysiology reveals a pivotal role of fibrosis and inflammation alterations implicating different cell subtypes, cytokines and growth factors, autoantibodies and reactive oxygen species. Despite improvement, the overall survival of SSc patients is still lower than that of other inflammatory diseases. Recommended drugs are agents capable of modulating fibrotic and inflammatory pathways. Cellular therapy has recently emerged as a credible option. Besides autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which demonstrated remarkable improvement, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent promising therapeutic candidates. Indeed, these cells possess anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, and immunomodulary properties especially by secreting a large panel of bioactive molecules, addressing the most important key points of the SSc. In addition, these cells are very sensitive to their environment and are able to modulate their activity according to the pathophysiological context in which they are located. Autologous or allogeneic MSCs from various sources have been tested in many trials in different auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. They are characterized by a broad availability and no or low acute toxicity. However, few randomized prospective clinical trials were published and their production under ATMP regulatory procedures is complex and time-consuming. Many aspects have still to be addressed to ascertain their potential as well as the potential of their derived products in the management of SSc, probably in association with other therapies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective Cardiac involvement is the most important cause of mortality in juvenile systemic sclerosis (JSSc). Recent reports in adult patients underline that traditional techniques of imaging are inadequate to assess the subclinical cardiac involvement, while speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is able to identify ventricular dysfunctions in the early stages. The aim of our study was to assess the role of STE in JSSc. Methods Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from patients with JSSc. Cardiac investigations performed at baseline (T0) and 18 (T18) and 36\u2009months (T36) follow-up included electrocardiography, conventional echocardiography with measurement of the ejection fraction (EF) and STE with assessment of left and right ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS and RV-GLS). Cardiac parameters have been compared with demographic characteristics and disease severity, assessed by the Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis Severity Score (J4S). Results A total of 18 patients, 12 (67%) females, entered the study. At T0, electrocardiography was abnormal in three patients, EF was reduced in one, LV-GLS was abnormal in three (16.7%) and RV-GLS was abnormal in five (27.8%). At T18, EF remained stable while at T36 the result decreased in seven of nine patients. At the same time, LV-GLS also worsened (from \u221221.6% to \u221218.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.01). LV-GLS and RV-GLS at baseline showed a significant correlation with J4S (P\u2009=\u20090.012 and P\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). Conclusion STE is more sensitive than standard echocardiography to identify cardiac involvement in JSSc. Over time, we observed a gradual worsening of LV-GLS, a sign of left ventricular dysfunction, that anticipated by several months the decrease of EF.",

This study aimed to examine the recovery of affected cardiovascular parameters over a medium-term follow-up.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cohort of 69 children was studied prospectively. Assessments of left ventricular (LV) function and coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) were conducted at admission, 1.5 months, and 3 months. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody titers were assessed at these three time points. Echocardiographic and antibody parameters (rising/decreasing) were analyzed for correlation. Outcomes were assessed using logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt admission, among the 78.2% of patients who were tested, 88.9% tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A quarter of the patients had pericardial effusion, and half had valvulitis.

EF and GLS are important predictors of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay. The residual impairment of median segmental strain and persistent diastolic dysfunction at three months indicate the need for long-term follow-up.",
