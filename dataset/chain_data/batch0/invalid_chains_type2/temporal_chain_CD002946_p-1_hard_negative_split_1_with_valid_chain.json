        "title": "Factors predisposing women to chronic pelvic pain: systematic review",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been associated with substantial adverse health outcomes for both mothers and offspring, few modifiable risk factors for GDM have been identified.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study among women in the Nurses' Health Study II to assess whether the amount, type, and intensity of pregravid physical activity and sedentary behaviors are associated with GDM risk. The analysis included 21,765 women who reported at least 1 singleton pregnancy between 1990 and 1998. Physical activity and sedentary behaviors were assessed through validated questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe documented 1428 incident GDM cases. After controlling for body mass index, dietary factors, and other covariates, there was a significant inverse association between vigorous activity and the risk of GDM. The multivariate relative risk (RR) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of vigorous activity was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.94) (P = .002 for trend). Among women who did not perform vigorous activity, brisk walking pace was associated with significantly lower GDM risk (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95) compared with an easy pace. Women who spent 20 h/wk or more watching television but did not perform vigorous activity had a significantly higher GDM risk than women who spent less than 2 h/wk watching television and were physically active (multivariate RR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.06-4.97).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur prospective study provides strong evidence that regular physical activity before pregnancy is associated with lower GDM risk.",

        "title": "Gender and images of heart disease in Scandinavian drug advertising",
        "abstract": "Aims: This study examines the construction of the ``heart disease candidate'' in advertisements for cardiovascular drugs in Scandinavian medical journals. Methods: All advertisements for cardiovascular drugs (n=603) in Scandinavian medical journals (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) in 2005 were collected. Only advertisements that portray users (n=289, 48% of the advertisements) were analyzed. Results: The results show that coronary candidacy is constructed as a male condition in half of the advertisements for cardiovascular drugs. The advertisements suggest a gendering of heart disease: men are the major victims of heart failure and cardiac insufficiency, and women are in need of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The cardiovascular drug advertisements portray a restoration of men's hyperactive agency, valorized by means of sporty images, by drawing on masculinity as a fixed trait and behavior. Hypercholesterolemia as a woman's disease reproduces the tyranny of slimness for women: Only women's stoutness is medicalized, and there are no pictures of heavy men. Conclusions: The findings point to the public health implications of gendered images of coronary candidacy in medical advertising.",

        "title": "Gender bias in clinical research, pharmaceutical marketing, and the prescription of drugs",
        "abstract": "This thesis is part of the studies of gender bias in health which together with the paradigm of evidence-based medicine shares the empirical assumption that there are inaccuracies in medical practice, in addition to a lack of rigour and transparency. It worked with the distinction between the concepts of sex and gender and between the concepts of sex-related differences and gender inequalities, in terms of applying a gender perspective in the study design and the subsequent analysis. This PhD review presents the research process conducted in Spain, which can provide an example for future research. Study I described a review of 58 clinical trials (CTs) of etoricoxib to assess its compliance with the Recommendations of Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs. In Study II, key informants from professions related to different areas in drug development and pharmacovigilance held a working meeting to reach a consensus document on recommendations for the study and evaluation of gender differences in CTs in Spain. In Study III, the websites of the eight best-selling hormone replacement therapy drugs in Spain on Google first page of results were analysed. In Study IV, a logistic regression analysis was performed to compare analgesic prescription by sex in regions with a higher or lower Gender Development Index (GDI) than the Spanish average. Gender biases identified in this thesis limited the legitimacy of medicine, which is not based on the best possible evidence. The results also demonstrate the existence of inequalities between men and women that are not due merely to biological differences, but are gender inequalities stemming from the social differences that exist between both sexes.",

        "title": "Is It Important to Consider Sex and Gender in Neurocognitive Studies?",
        "abstract": "Is it important to consider sex and gender in neurocognitive, neurobiological, and clinical studies? I refer here to \u201csex\u201d as a biological variable related mainly to sex chromosomes and sex steroid hormones, while \u201cgender\u201d stands for a psychosociocultural construct related to gender role socialization, levels of masculinity and femininity, and stress related to adhesion to gender stereotypes. It is a rhetorical question and I hope that an overwhelming majority of readers would answer: \u201cyes, of course!\u201d However, despite the fact that more attention has been devoted over the past decade to delineating differences between men and women in their neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and cognitive and emotional processing (1, 2), a substantial number of researchers (basic and clinical) continue ignoring \u201cthe second sex\u201d and study exclusively males. The reasons are multiple and range from an unawareness, through a lack of sufficient funding to examine both sexes, to the argument that the studies, to date, have not found any significant sex differences in a given paradigm or disorder and therefore there is no need to include both males and females in a study. Finally, there is a group of theorists who sees this line of inquiry (i.e., investigating sex differences in the brain and cognition) as inherently biased, thus contributing to some harmful stereotypes that may lead to increasing gender inequalities [e.g., Ref. (3, 4)]. \n \nIt is hard to argue with the lack of funds and indeed there are cognitive and clinical domains where we have not seen any indication of potential sex or gender differences. Nevertheless, our technology has improved and we possess more sensitive instrumentation, which may detect subtle differences that were not previously apparent. Moreover, we must remember that men and women of today are different from men and women of two or three decades ago. We are not only socialized differently, due to changed family values and education, more competitive job market and prominence of social media, but also exposed to more environmental toxins, including endocrine disruptors, which may affect our physical and mental health (5, 6). As to the harmful effects of some studies of the neurobiological and cognitive sex differences, I agree that data are sometimes interpreted in a biased manner and may contribute to propagation of damaging gender stereotypes. However, I also believe that excluding women is much more dangerous. We have seen the harm done with several drugs released for treatment of various disorders without proper testing or consideration of women\u2019s physiology (e.g., Posicor, approved for the treatment of hypertension and angina, slowed or stopped the heart rate especially in elderly women; antihistamines such as Seldane and Hismanal induced cardiac arrhythmias disproportionally more frequently in women), but thankfully the situation is changing (7, 8). \n \nWhile it is true that men and women are much more alike than different and it actually makes more sense to talk about sex and gender similarities (be it in brain structure or cognitive function), there are those subtle differences that may provide clues to disentangling etiology of some neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, autism, mood, and anxiety disorders, or shed a new light on treatment of these conditions. In short, \u201cvive la similarite, but let\u2019s explore differences!\u201d I would like to use two clinical examples that I am most familiar with, to illustrate my point \u2013 schizophrenia and drug addiction.",

        "title": "Reactivity to addictive drugs in the methylazoxymethanol (MAM) model of schizophrenia in male and female rats",
        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Patients with schizophrenia often suffer comorbid substance abuse regardless of gender. However, the vast majority of studies are only conducted in male subjects. Therefore, the aim of these experiments is to assess addictive behaviors of both sexes in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia induced by prenatal methylazoxymethanol (MAM) acetate exposure. Methods: MAM (22 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally on gestational day 17. Two studies were performed in the offspring: (1) an alcohol-drinking procedure to assess daily intake of 20% alcohol and relapse-like behavior after a period of forced abstinence; (2) Methamphetamine (METH) intravenous self administration (IVSA) followed by forced abstinence and reinstatement phases. Results: MAM exposure during the prenatal period did not change alcohol drinking regardless of sex. However, MAM females showed higher alcohol consumption in comparison to MAM males. The METH IVSA study revealed only a modest increase of drug consumption in MAM males, while there was no difference between the female groups. Reinstatement data showed no effect of the MAM model in either sex, but suggested increased responding in female rats. Conclusions: This study suggests that female sex and schizophrenia-like phenotype may work synergistically to enhance alcohol consumption. However, future research is needed to establish paradigms in which these findings would be readily assessed to test anti-addiction treatments.",

        "title": "Nicotine self-administration is not increased in the MAM rodent model of schizophrenia.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPatients with schizophrenia (SCZ) smoke at a rate 4-5 times higher than the general population, contributing to negative health consequences in this group. One possible explanation for this increased smoking is that individuals with SCZ find nicotine more reinforcing. However, data supporting this possibility are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe present experiments examined self-administration of nicotine, alone or in combination with other reinforcers, across a range of doses in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent model of SCZ.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMAM and control animals did not differ in nicotine self-administration across a range of doses and schedules of reinforcement, in both standard 1-hr self-administration sessions and 23-hr extended access sessions. However, MAM animals responded less for sucrose or reinforcing visual stimuli alone or when paired with nicotine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo the extent that MAM-treated rats are a valid model of SCZ, these results suggest that increased nicotine reinforcement does not account for increased smoking in SCZ patients.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThis study is the first to utilize nicotine self-administration, the gold standard for studying nicotine reinforcement, in the MAM model of schizophrenia, which is arguably the most comprehensive animal model of the disease currently available. Our assessment found no evidence of increased nicotine reinforcement in MAM animals, suggesting that increased reinforcement may not perpetuate increased smoking in schizophrenia patients.",

        "title": "Schizophrenia and drug addiction comorbidity: recent advances in our understanding of behavioural susceptibility and neural mechanisms",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder which is worsened substantially by substance abuse/addiction. Substance abuse affects nearly 50% of individuals with schizophrenia, extends across several drug classes (e.g. nicotine, cannabinoids, ethanol, psychostimulants) and worsens overall functioning of patients. Prominent theories explaining schizophrenia and addiction comorbidity include the primary addiction hypothesis (i.e. schizophrenia susceptibility primes drug reward circuits, increasing drug addiction risk following drug exposure), the two-hit hypothesis (i.e. drug abuse and other genetic and/or environmental risk factors contribute to schizophrenia development) and the self-medication hypothesis (i.e. drug use alleviates schizophrenia symptoms). Animal models can be used to evaluate the utility and validity of these theories. Since this literature was last reviewed by Ng and colleagues in 2013 [Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 37(5)], significant advances have been made to our understanding of schizophrenia and substance abuse comorbidity. Here we review advances in the field since 2013, focussing on two key questions: 1) Does schizophrenia susceptibility increase susceptibility to drug addiction (assessing the primary addiction hypothesis), and 2) Do abused drugs exacerbate or ameliorate schizophrenia symptoms (assessing the two-hit hypothesis and the self-medication hypothesis). We addressed these questions using data from several schizophrenia preclinical models (e.g. genetic, lesion, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological) across drug classes (e.g. nicotine, cannabinoids, ethanol, psychostimulants). We conclude that addiction-like behaviour is present in several preclinical schizophrenia models, and drugs of abuse can exacerbate but also ameliorate schizophrenia-relevant behaviours. These behavioural changes are associated with altered receptor system function (e.g. dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic) critically implicated in schizophrenia and addiction pathology.",

        "abstract": "Substance use disorders are more prevalent in schizophrenia, worsening its course and prognosis. Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining maternal immune activation (MIA) and peripubertal stress (PUS), to study cocaine addiction and the underlying neurobehavioural alterations. We injected lipopolysaccharide or saline on gestational days 15 and 16 to pregnant rats. Their male offspring were then subjected to 5 episodes of unpredictable stress every other day during adolescence (from postnatal day 28 to 38). When rats reached adulthood, we studied cocaine addiction-like behaviour, impulsivity, conditioning processes and several aspects of brain structure and function by MRI, PET and RNAseq. MIA facilitated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration while PUS reduced cocaine intake, an effect that was reversed by MIA. MIA increased motivation for cocaine and reversed the effects of PUS during extended access. Incubation of seeking was unaffected. Neither hit alone nor their combination impacted Pavlovian or instrumental conditioning or impulsiveness. At the brain level, PUS reduced hippocampal volume and hyperactivated the dorsal subiculum. MIA+PUS altered the structure and function of the dorsal striatum increasing its volume and interfering with glutamatergic dynamics. MIA did not affect the gene expression of the nucleus accumbens but, when combined with PUS, modulated specific genes that could account for the restored cocaine intake. PUS had a profound effect on the dorsal striatal transcriptome however, this was obliterated when PUS occurred in animals with MIA. These results describe a complex interplay between MIA and stress on neurodevelopment and in the susceptibility to develop cocaine addiction.",

        "abstract": "Neurogenomic changes induced by maternal immune activation (MIA) during gestation and the social stress of weaning can alter brain plasticity in the hippocampus of offspring. The present study furthers the understanding of how these stressors impact hippocampus gene networks. The hippocampus transcriptome was profiled in pigs that were either exposed to MIA or not and were weaned or nursed. Overall, 1576 genes were differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |log2 (fold change between pig groups)| > 1.2) in response to the main and interacting effects of MIA, weaning, and sex. Functional analysis identified 17 enriched immunological and neurological pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. The enrichment of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway was characterized by genes under-expressed in MIA relative to non-MIA exposed, males relative to females, and weaned relative to nursed pigs. On the other hand, the enrichment of drug addiction pathways was characterized by gene over-expression in MIA relative to non-exposed pigs. Our results indicate that weaning and sex can modify the effects of MIA on the offspring hippocampus. This knowledge can aid in precise identification of molecular targets to reduce the prolonged effects of pre- and postnatal stressors.",

        "title": "Genes Participating in the Ensheathment of Neurons Are Affected by Postnatal Stress and Maternal Immune Activation in the Pituitary Gland",
        "abstract": "Immune challenges during gestation are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and can interact with stress later in life. The pituitary gland participates in endocrine- and immune-related processes that influence development, growth, and reproduction and can modulate physiological and behavioral responses to challenges. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of stressors at different time points on the molecular mechanisms of the pituitary gland and detect sex differences. RNA sequencing was used to profile the pituitary glands of female and male pigs exposed to weaning stress and virally induced maternal immune activation (MIA), relative to unchallenged groups. Significant effects (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05) of MIA and weaning stress were detected in 1829 and 1014 genes, respectively. Of these, 1090 genes presented significant interactions between stressors and sex. The gene ontology biological process of the ensheathment of neurons (GO:0007272), substance abuse, and immuno-related pathways, including the measles disease (ssc05162), encompasses many genes with profiles impacted by MIA and weaning stress. A gene network analysis highlighted the under-expression of myelin protein zero (Mpz) and inhibitors of DNA binding 4 (Id4) among the non-stressed males exposed to MIA, relative to the control and non-MIA males exposed to weaning stress, relative to non-stressed pigs. The detection of changes in the molecular mechanisms of the pituitary gland could advance our understanding of disruptions in the formation of the myelin sheath and the transmission of neuron-to-neuron signals in behavioral disorders associated with maternal immune activation and stress.",
