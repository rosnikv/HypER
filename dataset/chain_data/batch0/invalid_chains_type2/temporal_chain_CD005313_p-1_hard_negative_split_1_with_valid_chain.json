        "abstract": "To overcome the problem of in\u2010stent restenosis, the concept of local delivery of antiproliferative or immunosuppressive drugs has been introduced into interventional cardiology. Local drug delivery can be achieved by drug\u2010eluting stents coated with polymer surfaces used for controlled drug release. However, several polymer coatings have shown an induction of inflammatory response and increased neointima formation. In the present study, the effect of a new inorganic ceramic nanoporous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) coating on neointima proliferation and its suitability as a carrier for the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus have been investigated. 316 L stainless steel coronary stents were coated with a 500 nm thin nanoporous aluminum oxide layer. This ceramic nanolayer was used as a carrier for tacrolimus. Bare stents (n = 6), ceramic coated stents (n = 6), and ceramic coated stents loaded with 60 (n = 7) and 120 \u03bcg (n = 6) tacrolimus were implanted in the common carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. The ceramic coating caused no significant reduction of neointimal thickness after 28 days. Loading the ceramic stents with tacrolimus led to a significant reduction of neointima thickness by 52% for 60 \u03bcg (P = 0.047) and 56% for 120 \u03bcg (P = 0.036) as compared to the bare stents. The ceramic coating alone as well as in combination with tacrolimus led to a reduced infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages in the intima in response to stent implantation. Ceramic coating of coronary stents with a nanoporous layer of aluminum oxide in combination with tacrolimus resulted in a significant reduction in neointima formation and inflammatory response. The synergistic effects of the ceramic coating and tacrolimus suggest that this new approach may have a high potential to translate into clinical benefit.

        "abstract": "Polymer stent coatings may not be suitable for drug elution because of inherent proinflammatory effects. A previous study suggested a beneficial effect of a stent eluting tacrolimus from a nanoporous ceramic aluminum oxide coating in a rabbit restenosis model. We investigated whether this stent is effective in preventing in\u2010stent restenosis in a porcine restenosis model. Thirty\u2010four juvenile swine underwent balloon overstretch injury and were subjected to implantation of either stainless steel (bare) stents, bare stents coated with nanoporous aluminum oxide alone, and coated stents eluting 50 and 180 \u03bcg of tacrolimus (FK506). In\u2010stent restenosis was quantified at 1 and 3 months after stent placement by histomorphometry. A significant increase of neointimal hyperplasia was noted with the stents coated with aluminum oxide alone compared with bare stents (2.92 \u00b1 1.02 and 1.38 \u00b1 0.51 mm2, respectively; P < 0.02). In all arteries containing coated stents, particle debris was found in the media and neointima, resulting in augmented vascular inflammation. In the group of stents coated with aluminum oxide, FK506 elution at a dose 180 \u03bcg reduced neointimal hyperplasia vs. no drug elution (1.66 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 2.92 \u00b1 1.02 mm2; 180 \u03bcg vs. ceramic alone; P < 0.03). At a dose of 50 \u03bcg stent\u2010based delivery of FK506, no reduction of neointimal hyperplasia was found (2.88 \u00b1 1.31 and 2.92 \u00b1 1.02 mm2, respectively; P = NS; FK506 vs. ceramic alone). In summary, particle debris shed from a drug\u2010eluting aluminum oxide coating of a stainless steel stent counteracts potential antiproliferative effects of stent\u2010based tacrolimus delivery in a porcine model of restenosis. We propose that stent coatings eluting drugs need to be routinely tested for being tightly anchored into the stent surface. Alternatively, omission of any coating used as a drug reservoir may eliminate inflammatory particle debris after placement of drug\u2010eluting stents.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLong-term efficacy and safety of tacrolimus-eluting stent (Janus) for treatment of coronary artery disease in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) \"real world\" is uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Janus stent for treating coronary heart disease in PCI daily practice, the safety of 4-month clopidogrel therapy after Janus stent implantation and the feasibility for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for first time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom February 20, 2006 to August 26, 2006, a total of 200 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Janus stent (n = 100) or bare metal stent (Tecnic Carbostent, n = 100). All patients were administered with clopidogrel for 4 months and aspirin for life long after stenting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. AMI was present in 37% of patients with Janus and 36% with Tecnic Carbostent. At an average of 246-day follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6% with the Janus stent and 15% with the Tecnic Carbostent (P = 0.038). Primary events included 1 cardiac death, 1 myocardial infarction (MI) due to subacute stent thrombosis and 13 target lesion revascularizations (TLR) due to restenosis in patients with Tecnic Carbostent and 6 TLR due to restenosis in patients with Janus stent. Although all patients had discontinued clopidogrel for an average of 126 days, there was no additional thrombotic event in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nJanus stent is efficient in reducing MACE compared with Tecnic Carbostent at an average of 8-month follow-up. Discontinuation of clopidogrel at 4 months after PCI is safe for patients with Janus stent, including AMI patients. Long-term efficacy of Janus stent in reducing restenosis requires further study.",

Background: There are no data of Janus Flex stent (Carbostent and Implantable Devices\u2014CID, Saluggia, Italy), a polymer\u2010free, tacrolimus\u2010eluting coronary stent, followed by short\u2010term DAT, in daily practice. Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled at 12 high\u2010volume procedures centres. After stenting, four sites prescribed 2\u2010month DAT, eight sites 6\u2010month DAT. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and stent thrombosis (ST) rate was evaluated at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, for entire population, as well as for 2\u2010 and 6\u2010month DAT groups, distinctly. MACE included cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Results: From March 2007 to June 2008, 572 patients (mean age 64.91 \u00b1 11 years, 77.45% males) were enrolled. After successful stenting, 12\u2010month follow\u2010up showed a 12.74% MACE occurrence (cardiac death 0.98%; MI 3.13%; TLR 8.62%), with good Janus Flex safety profile confirmed by only two (0.39%) ST. After adjustment for potential confounding, no significant differences were noted at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up among 2\u2010 or 6\u2010month DAT groups (MACE\u20148.99% versus 12.47%, P = 0.16; cardiac death\u20140.54% versus 1.14%, P = 0.52; MI\u20142.38% versus 2.71%, P = 0.83; TLR\u20145.66% versus 10.60%, P = 0.20; ST\u20140% versus 0.55%, P = 0.99). At multivariable analysis, DAT time duration was not an independent risk factor for adverse events (adjusted HR 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.16\u20131.35, P = 0.16). Conclusions: Janus Flex coronary stenting, followed by short DAT, is safe and feasible, without differences between 2\u2010 and 6\u2010month DAT groups. A randomized trial confirming these encouraging data is needed. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Clinical evaluations have proven the efficacy of drug-elution stents (DES) in reduction of in-stent restenosis rates as compared to drug-free bare metal stents (BMS). Typically, DES are metal stents that are covered with a polymer film loaded with anti-inflammatory or antiproliferative drugs that are released in a sustained manner. However, although favorable effects of the released drugs have been observed, the polymer coating as such has been associated with several adverse clinical effects, such as late stent thrombosis. Elimination of the polymeric carrier of DES may therefore potentially lead to safer DES. Several technologies have been developed to design polymer-free DES, such as the use of microporous stents and inorganic coatings that can be drug loaded. Several drugs, including sirolimus, tacrolimus, paclitaxel, and probucol have been used in the design of carrier-free stents. Due to the function of the polymeric coating to control the release kinetics of a drug, polymer-free stents are expected to have a faster drug elution rate, which may affect the therapeutic efficacy. However, several polymer-free stents have shown similar efficacy and safety as the first-generation DES, although the superiority of polymer-free DES has not been established in clinical trials.",

Inkjet techniques are capable of depositing drugs into these reservoirs. In this study, two different geometries of micro-sized reservoirs have been laden with a drug (ASA) using a drop-on-demand inkjet printhead.

        "abstract": "The improvement in the research area of the implant by surface functionalization when correlated with the biological response is of major interest in the biomedical field. Based on the fact that the inflammatory response is directly involved in the ultimate response of the implant within the body, it is essential to study the macrophage-material interactions. Within this context, we have investigated the composite material-macrophage cell interactions and the inflammatory response to these composites with amorphous hydroxyapatite (HA), Lactoferrin (Lf), and polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone (PEG-PCL) copolymer. All materials are obtained by Matrix Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) technique and characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells proliferation and metabolic activity were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods. The secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) cytokine, in the presence and absence of the inflammatory stimuli (bacterial endotoxin; lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), was measured using an ELISA assay. Our results revealed that the cellular response depended on the physical-chemical characteristics of the coatings. Copolymer-HA-Lf coatings led to low level of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1, the increased level of anti-inflammatory IL-10, and the polarization of THP-1 cells towards an M2 pro-reparative phenotype in the presence of LPS. These findings could have important potential for the development of composite coatings in implant applications.",
