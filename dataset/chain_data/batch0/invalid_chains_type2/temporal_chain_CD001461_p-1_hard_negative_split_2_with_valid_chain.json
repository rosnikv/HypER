        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

Synovial hyperplasia was compared in SEB-injected V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA), anti-V beta 8 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, and in V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after injection of a non-V beta 8-reactive superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt day 30, increased synovial cells were observed in all SEB-treated mice, but the increase was greatest in the V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nType B fibroblastic synoviocytes are abundant in inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and can secrete cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether cell lines derived from RA type B synoviocytes could also serve as accessory cells for T lymphocyte activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCells from RA synoviocyte lines, with or without preculture in interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), were cultured with purified peripheral blood T cells, in the presence or absence of superantigens or other accessory cell-dependent T cell mitogens. T cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation, and synoviocyte surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA type B synoviocyte lines were potent accessory cells for T cell responses to bacterial superantigens or lectins, and direct cell-cell contact was required. Preculture in IFN gamma augmented synoviocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and of ligands for some T cell costimulatory receptors, but synoviocyte accessory cell function was evident even in the absence of IFN gamma. Blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies supported the notion of a role CD2, CD11a/CD18 and MHC class II molecules in synoviocyte-dependent T cell activation. Monoclonal antibodies against IFN gamma, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha failed to block the T cell proliferative responses, but anti-IL-2 was strongly inhibitory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCultured RA and type B synoviocytes can perform some of the functions of professional antigen-presenting cells. If such cells have similar properties in vivo, they may be important participants in activation of immune responses, in addition to their previously described synthetic and proinflammatory roles. If RA synovial tissue T cells, like normal peripheral blood T cells, can respond to superantigens presented by synoviocytes, this interaction could be important in the pathogenesis of RA.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

BLS is the prototype of a \"disease of gene regulation.\" The affected genes encode RFXANK, RFX5, RFXAP, and CIITA, four regulatory factors that are highly specific and essential for MHCII genes. The first three are subunits of RFX, a trimeric complex that binds to all MHCII promoters. CIITA is a non-DNA-binding coactivator that functions as the master control factor for MHCII expression.

        "abstract": "Activated human T cells express HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP on their surface, but the regulation and functioning of MHC class II molecules in T lymphocytes are poorly understood. Because the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) is essential for MHC class II expression, we have investigated transcriptional activation of CIITA in activated T cells. In this study, we show that in human activated CD4+ T cells, CIITA promoter III (CIITA-PIII) drives the expression of CIITA. The in vivo genomic footprint analysis revealed activated T cell-specific occupation of CIITA-PIII. Subsequent EMSA analysis of several promoter regions showed differences in banding pattern among activated T cells, naive T cells, primary B cells, and Raji B cells. Activating response element (ARE)-1 is shown to interact with the acute myeloid leukemia 2 transcription factor in nuclear extracts derived from both T and B cells. Interestingly, the acute myeloid leukemia 3 transcription factor was bound in nuclear extracts of T cells only. The ARE-2 sequence is able to bind CREB/activating transcription factor family members in both T and B cells. In addition, a yet unidentified Ets family member was found to interact with site C in activated T cells, whereas in B cells site C was bound by PU.1 and Pip/IFN regulatory factor 4/IFN consensus sequence binding protein for activated T cells. In Jurkat T cells, both ARE-1 and ARE-2 are crucial for CIITA-PIII activity, similar to Raji B cells. The differential banding pattern in in vivo genomic footprinting and transcription factor binding at the ARE-1 and site C between T cells and B cells probably reflects differences in CIITA-PIII activation pathways employed by these cell types.",

        "abstract": "Expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in human activated T cells is under normal circumstances regulated exclusively by the CIITA-PIII subtype of the class II transactivator (CIITA). In this study, we show that the absence of MHC class II expression in leukemic T cells was due to a lack of expression of CIITA, whereas in T-lymphoma cells, expression of CIITA correlated with expression of MHC class II. Interestingly, activation of a CIITA-promoter (P)III-reporter construct was not affected in leukemic T cells. This revealed that the absence of endogenous CIITA expression was not caused by a lack of transcription factors critical for CIITA-PIII activation but suggests the involvement of an epigenetic silencing mechanism. Subsequent analysis showed that the lack of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression correlated with hypermethylation of CIITA-PIII in leukemic T-cell lines and in primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and a T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). Treatment of leukemic T-cell lines with a demethylation agent showed re-expression of CIITA-PIII and HLA-DRA. Furthermore, in vitro methylation of CIITA-PIII and subsequent assessment of CIITA-PIII activity in Jurkat leukemic T cells resulted in reduction of constitutive and CREB-1 (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]-response element binding protein 1)-induced promoter activity. Together, these results argue for an important role of DNA hyper-methylation in the control of CIITA expression in leukemic T cells.",

Gene expression profiling data were used for correlation analyses between expression levels of MHCII genes with each other and their transcriptional regulator, CIITA. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) assessed chromosomal alterations at MHCII-related loci. Finally, a map was created of expression of genes that are telomeric, within, or centromeric to the MHCII locus. Correlation coefficients among MHCII genes ranged from 0.73 to 0.92, whereas those between adjacent and intervening genes were lower (-0.12 to 0.49).

To better understand the significance of down-regulation of HLA class II expression in relation to the homozygous and hemizygous deletions, we analyzed global gene expression patterns in a series of 26 testicular DLBCL after characterization of these deletions. Results: Low levels of HLA-DR mRNA in whole testicular DLBCL samples were associated with a strong down-regulation of numerous immune-related genes specific for T cells, macrophages, antigen presentation and processing, lymphocyte activation, chemokines and chemokine receptors, and the complement system. The number of CD3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells was also significantly lower in low expressors of HLA-DR mRNA. Interestingly, hemizygous and homozygous deletions in the MHC region did not have any additional effect on global gene expression. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that loss of HLA class II mRNA expression in testicular DLBCL is associated with a significant change in global gene expression patterns. This effect is independent of the mechanism causing the down-regulation of HLA class II genes in the lymphoma cells.",

        "abstract": "We describe a patient with a primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system who developed a localized testicular relapse after 8 years. Both tumours lacked HLA-DR expression, the relapse additionally lost HLA class I expression. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements were identical in both lymphomas with extensive and ongoing somatic hypermutations resulting in extensive idiotype modulation. We hypothesize that these immune sanctuaries initially provided a safe haven for the tumour cells. When the environment becomes more permissive for an anti-tumour response, the continuous idiotype modulation and progressive loss of HLA expression on the tumour cells facilitates further immune escape.",

        "abstract": "Primary diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphomas of different immune\u2010privileged sites (IP\u2010DLBCLs) share many clinical and biological features, such as a relatively poor prognosis, preferential dissemination to other immune\u2010privileged sites, and deletion of the HLA region, which suggests that IP\u2010DLBCL represents a separate entity. To further investigate the nature of IP\u2010DLBCL, we investigated site\u2010specific genomic aberrations in 16 testicular, nine central nervous system (CNS), and 15 nodal DLBCLs using array CGH. We also determined minimal common regions of gain and loss. Using robust algorithms including multiple testing procedures and the ACE\u2010it script, which is specifically designed for this task, the array CGH data were combined with gene expression data to explore pathways deregulated by chromosomal aberrations. Loss of 6p21.32\u2013p25.3, including the HLA genes, was associated with both types of IP\u2010DLBCL, whereas gain of 2p16.1\u2013p25.3 was associated with nodal DLBCL. Gain of 12q15\u2013q21.1 and 12q24.32\u2013q24.33 was associated with CNS DLBCL and gain of 19q13.12\u2013q13.43 with testicular DLBCL. Analysis of candidate genes in site\u2010specific regions and minimal common regions revealed two major groups of genes: one involved in the immune response, including regulation of HLA expression, and the other involved in apoptosis, including the p53 pathway. Many of these genes were also involved in homozygous deletions or high\u2010level gains. The presence of both shared and site\u2010specific aberrations in CNS and testicular DLBCLs underlines the concept of IP\u2010DLBCL but also indicates that IP\u2010DLBCLs of the CNS and testis do not form a single entity. The observed aberrations emphasize the importance of the deregulation of anti\u2010tumour immune response and apoptosis pathways.

        "abstract": "Post\u2010transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are complications of solid organ transplantation associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common form of monomorphic PTLD. We studied 44 cases of post\u2010transplant DLBCL (PT\u2010DLBCL) with high\u2010density genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism\u2010based arrays, and compared them with 105 cases of immunocompetent DLBCL (IC\u2010DLBCL) and 28 cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus\u2010associated DLBCL (HIV\u2010DLBCL). PT\u2010DLBCL showed a genomic profile with specific features, although their genomic complexity was overall similar to that observed in IC\u2010 and HIV\u2010DLBCL. Among the loci more frequently deleted in PT\u2010DLBCL there were small interstitial deletions targeting known fragile sites, such as FRA1B, FRA2E and FRA3B. Deletions at 2p16.1 (FRA2E) were the most common lesions in PT\u2010DLBCL, occurring at a frequency that was significantly higher than in IC\u2010DLBCL. Genetic lesions that characterized post\u2010germinal center IC\u2010DLBCL were under\u2010represented in our series of PT\u2010DLBCL. Two other differences between IC\u2010DLBCL and PT\u2010DLBCL were the lack of del(13q14.3) (MIR15/MIR16) and of copy neutral LOH affecting 6p [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus] in the latter group. In conclusion, PT\u2010DLBCL presented unique features when compared with IC\u2010DLBCL. Changes in PT\u2010DLBCL were partially different to those in HIV\u2010DLBCL, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms in the two conditions linked to immunodeficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of genomic regions in a series of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (HIV-DLBCLs) and post-transplant DLBCLs (PT-DLBCLs) analyzed by genome-wide DNA profiling. Minimal common regions (MCRs) were estimated on genomic profiles obtained using Affymetrix Human Mapping 250k Nsp I arrays and tested for their impact on clinical outcome by univariate analysis on 36 PT-DLBCLs, 19 HIV-DLBCLs and, as a control group, 149 DLBCLs arising in immunocompetent individuals (IC-DLBCLs). PT-DLBCL and HIV-DLBCL presented a similar outcome. Immunodeficiency-related DLBCL (ID-DLBCL) had a worse overall survival (OS) than IC-DLBCL. Seven MCRs showed a statistical impact on OS in PT-DLBCL and four in HIV-DLBCL. Among these, the presence of gains at 1q or at 18q defined a group of patients with PT-DLBCL with a very poor outcome (p < 0.0001). The presence of del(3p14.2) or of + 2p23.1 identified a group of HIV-DLBCLs with a very poor outcome (p = 0.0072). It was concluded that genomic aberrations affecting outcome differ between ID-DLBCL and IC-DLBCL and are also dependent on the type of acquired immunodeficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Numerous studies have focused on lymphoma among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, little is known about the treatment options and survival rate of lymphoma in the Chinese people living with HIV (PLHIV). Our study aimed to investigate the prognosis and compare outcome of dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) with standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab(R-CHOP) as front line therapy for PLHIV with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving modern combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods: A retrospective analysis evaluating PLHIV with DLBCL was performed in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from July 2012 to September 2019. The demographic and clinical data were collected, and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) analyses of patients receiving R-CHOP or DA-EPOCH-R therapy were performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, a Cox multiple regression model was constructed to identify related factors for OS. Results: A total of 54 eligible patients were included in the final analysis with a median follow-up of 14 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 8\u201329 months). The proportion of high international prognostic index (IPI) patients was much larger in the DA-EPOCH-R group (n\u200a=\u200a29) than that in the R-CHOP group (n\u200a=\u200a25). The CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels were not significantly different between the two groups. The 2-year OS for all patients was 73%. However, OS was not significantly different between the two groups, with a 2-year OS rate of 78% for the DA-EPOCH-R group and 66% for the R-CHOP group. Only an IPI greater than 3 was associated with a decrease in OS, with a hazard ratio of 5.0. The occurrence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events of chemotherapy was not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: Outcomes of R-CHOP therapy do not differ from those of DA-EPOCH-R therapy. No HIV-related factors were found to be associated with the OS of PLHIV in the modern cART era.",

        "abstract": "\n Background: People living with HIV (PLWHIV) are at increased risk of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma compared with HIV-negative individuals. However, high-quality epidemiological data for lymphoma among PLWHIV from low-income and middle-income countries are scarce, especially in South China. This retrospective study aimed to better define the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and prognostic factors of HIV-associated lymphoma patients in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces of China in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Methods: We performed a pooled analysis from existing databases of 143 patients with HIV-positive lymphoma between January 2013 and June 2020 from three hospitals in South China. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were performed to identify the association of patient-, lymphoma- and HIV-specific variables with the outcomes progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of all 143 HIV-positive lymphoma patients, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the most common subtype identified (81.8%). The median age was 49 years (IQR 18\u201379), and 118 patients (82.5%) were male. The mean CD4 T-cell count was 185.5 cells/\u00b5L (IQR 3\u20131089), and 86 (60.1%) patients were receiving HAART at enrollment. Opportunistic infections (OIs) were reported in 40 (28.0%) patients. Seventy-seven (53.8%) patients had stage I/II lymphoma, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 or 1 in 87 (60.8%) patients. Information on elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and positive CD20 was available for 72% (103/143) and 96.0% (48/50), respectively. A total of 65.8% (77/117) of DLBCL patients received EPOCH- (dose-adjusted etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and doxorubicin) or CHOP-based (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimens. The 1-year PFS and 1-year OS were 32.98% and 43.62% in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients and 32.18% and 41.40% in DLBCL patients, respectively. Advanced age and elevated LDH were significant predictors of the outcome in both HIV-associated NHL and DLBCL, and the influence of other factors waxed and waned. A lower CD4/CD8 ratio was an independent poor predictor for 1-year OS in HIV-associated NHL but not for DLBCL. Conclusions: In our population, HIV-positive patients with lymphoma presented aggressive characteristics and exhibited poor survival outcomes, even in the modern HAART era. Effective HIV-directed therapies reduced the impact of HIV-associated prognostic factors on outcomes; however, lymphoma-related factors, such as age and LDH, were found to be key independent predictors for HIV-associated lymphoma.",

        "abstract": "Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma with increased incidence among people living with HIV-infection (PLWH). Although its frequency is reportedly attenuated by antiretroviral therapy (ART), we have previously shown a similar rate of DLBCL in the post-ART era (2017) in Johannesburg, South Africa compared with that observed when ART had only limited availability in the South Africa state-sector (2007). Here, we present a more detailed analysis of DLBCL in the pre-and post-ART eras in Johannesburg. Methods and Results: All cases of DLBCL diagnosed in the state-sector hospitals of Johannesburg in 2007 and 2017 were extracted from the laboratory information system, and factors of interest compared. Most (>85%) were observed among PLWH at both time-points; ART-coverage was significantly higher in 2017 compared with 2007, but with failed immunological recovery in 50% of cases. The immunohistochemically-defined cell of origin differed according to HIV-status; the germinal center (GC) and non-GC subtypes predominating in the PLWH and the HIV-negative group, respectively. MYC-gene rearrangement was more common than is reported elsewhere (22.1%), whereas BCL6 and BCL2 gene rearrangements were less so (14.6% and 0%, respectively). Slight improvement in survival was noted in the post-ART era, but remained poor, with bone marrow involvement and albumin levels \u226430 g/L independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: Although the frequency of DLBCL in Johannesburg has not dropped significantly in the post-ART era, a slight improvement in survival is observed. However, outcomes remain poor, indicating a need for further improvements in care.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy of B-cells frequently encountered among people living with HIV. Immunological abnormalities are common in immunocompetent individuals with DLBCL, and are often associated with poorer outcomes. Currently, data on derangements of immunological proteins, such as cytokines and acute phase reactants, and their impact on outcomes in HIV-associated DLBCL (HIV-DLBCL) is lacking. This study assessed the levels and prognostic relevance of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF\u03b2), the acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin; serum free light chains (SFLC) (elevation of which reflects a prolonged pro-inflammatory state); and the activity of the immunosuppressive enzyme Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)in South African patients with DLBCL. Methods Seventy-six patients with incident DLBCL were enrolled, and peripheral blood IL-6, IL-10, TGF\u03b2, SFLC and IDO-activity measured in selected patients. Additional clinical and laboratory findings (including ferritin and CRP) were recorded from the hospital records. Results Sixty-one (80.3%) of the included patients were people living with HIV (median CD4-count = 148 cells/ul), and survival rates were poor (12-month survival rate 30.0%). The majority of the immunological proteins, except for TGF\u03b2 and ferritin, were significantly higher among the people living with HIV. Elevation of IL-6, SFLC and IDO-activity were not associated with survival in HIV-DLBCL, while raised IL-10, CRP, ferritin and TGF\u03b2 were. On multivariate analysis, immunological proteins associated with survival independently from the International Prognostic Index (IPI) included TGF\u03b2, ferritin and IL-10. Conclusion Derangements of immunological proteins are common in HIV-DLBCL, and have a differential association with survival compared to that reported elsewhere. Elevation of TGF\u03b2, IL-10 and ferritin were associated with survival independently from the IPI. In view of the poor survival rates in this cohort, investigation of the directed targeting of these cytokines would be of interest in our setting.",
