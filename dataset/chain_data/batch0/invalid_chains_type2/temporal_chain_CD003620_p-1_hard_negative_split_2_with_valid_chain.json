        "title": "Effects of silymarin MZ-80 on oxidative stress in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe role of silymarin in the treatment of liver cirrhosis is controversial.\n\n\nAIM\nClinical outcome,biochemical profile and the antiperoxidative effects of silymarin MZ-80 during 6 months treatment were investigated in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty consecutive patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis were randomized to receive either silymarin MZ-80 (S) (150 mg t.i.d. per day) or placebo (P) for periods of 6 months. Erythrocyte total glutathione (GSH) content, platelet malondialdehyde (MDA) and serum amino-terminal propeptide of procollagen Type III (PIIINP) were determined at baseline and at the end of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-nine patients completed the study (24 S and 25 P). The 2 groups were well-matched for demographic as well as baseline clinical and laboratory parameters. Silymarin increased total GSH at 6 months (4.5 +/- 3.4 to 5.8 +/- 4.0 micromol/g Hb) whereas, in the placebo group, GSH remained unchanged (4.1 +/- 3.9 to 4.4 +/- 4.1 micromol/gHb) (p < 0.001), and platelet-derived non-induced MDA decreased by 33% (p < 0.015). A parallel decrease in PIIINP values was seen with silymarin (1.82 1.03 to 1.36 +/- 0.5 U/ml, p < 0.033) but not with placebo (1.31 +/- 0.4 to 1.27 +/- 0.6 U/ml). There were no concurrent changes on laboratory indices of the pathology.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSilymarin is well-tolerated and produces a small increase in glutathione and a decrease in lipid peroxidation in peripheral blood cells in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Despite these effects no changes in routine liver tests were observed during the course of therapy.",

        "title": "Herbal Modulation of P\u2010Glycoprotein",
        "abstract": "P\u2010glycoprotein (Pgp) is a 170 kDa phosphorylated glycoprotein encoded by human MDR1 gene. It is responsible for the systemic disposition of numerous structurally and pharmacologically unrelated lipophilic and amphipathic drugs, carcinogens, toxins, and other xenobiotics in many organs, such as the intestine, liver, kidney, and brain. Like cytochrome P450s (CYP3A4), Pgp is vulnerable to inhibition, activation, or induction by herbal constituents. This was demonstrated by using an ATPase assay, purified Pgp protein or intact Pgp\u2010expressing cells, and proper probe substrates and inhibitors. Curcumin, ginsenosides, piperine, some catechins from green tea, and silymarin from milk thistle were found to be inhibitors of Pgp, while some catechins from green tea increased Pgp\u2010mediated drug transport by heterotropic allosteric mechanism, and St. John's wort induced the intestinal expression of Pgp in vitro and in vivo. Some components (e.g., bergamottin and quercetin) from grapefruit juice were reported to modulate Pgp activity. Many of these herbal constituents, in particular flavonoids, were reported to modulate Pgp by directly interacting with the vicinal ATP\u2010binding site, the steroid\u2010binding site, or the substrate\u2010binding site. Some herbal constituents (e.g., hyperforin and kava) were shown to activate pregnane X receptor, an orphan nuclear receptor acting as a key regulator of MDR1 and many other genes. The inhibition of Pgp by herbal constituents may provide a novel approach for reversing multidrug resistance in tumor cells, whereas the stimulation of Pgp expression or activity has implication for chemoprotective enhancement by herbal medicines. Certain natural flavonols (e.g., kaempferol, quercetin, and galangin) are potent stimulators of the Pgp\u2010mediated efflux of 7,12\u2010dimethylbenz(a)\u2010anthracene (a carcinogen). The modulation of Pgp activity and expression by these herb constituents may result in altered absorption and bioavailability of drugs that are Pgp substrates. This is exemplified by increased oral bioavailability of phenytoin and rifampin by piperine and decreased bioavailability of indinavir, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, digoxin, and fexofenadine by coadministered St. John's wort. However, many of these drugs are also substrates of CYP3A4. Thus, the modulation of intestinal Pgp and CYP3A4 represents an important mechanism for many clinically important herb\u2013drug interactions. Further studies are needed to explore the relative role of Pgp and CYP3A4 modulation by herbs and the mechanism for the interplay of these two important proteins in herb\u2013drug interactions.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) of neoplastic tissues is a major obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. The predominant cause of MDR is the overexpression and drug transport activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, a product of the MDR gene). P-gp is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters family, with broad substrate specificity for several substances including anticancer drugs, linear and cyclic peptides, inhibitors of HIV protease, and several other substances. The development of P-gp-mediated MDR is often associated with several changes in cell structure and metabolism of resistant cells. In the present review are discussed the relations between glucosylceramide synthase activity, Pregnane X receptor and development of P-gp mediated MDR phenotype. Attention is also focused on the changes in protein kinase systems (mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C, Akt kinase) that are associated with the development of MDR phenotype and to the possible role of these kinase cascades in modulation of P-gp expression and function. The overexpression of P-gp may be associated with changes in metabolism of sugars as well as energy production. Structural and ultrastructural characteristics of multidrug resistant cells expressing P-gp are typical for cells engaged in a metabolically demanding process of protein synthesis and transport. P-gp mediated MDR phenotype is often also associated with alterations in cytoskeletal elements, microtubule and mitochondria distribution, Golgi apparatus, chromatin texture, vacuoles and caveolae formation. The current review also aims at bringing some state-of-the-art information on interactions of P-glycoprotein with various substances. To capture and transport the numerous unrelated substances, P-gp should contain site(s) able to bind compounds with a molecular weight of several hundreds and comprising hydrophobic and/or base regions that are protonated under physiological conditions. Drug binding sites that are able to recognize substances with different chemical structures may have a complex architecture in which different parts are responsible for binding of different drugs. For P-gp substrates and inhibitors, a pharmacophore-based model has been described. The pharmacophores have to contain parts with hydrophobic and aromatic characteristics and functional groups that can act as hydrogen-bond donors and/or acceptors. Several drugs are known to be P-glycoprotein antagonizing agents. They represent a large group of structurally unrelated substances that can act via direct interaction with P-gp and inhibition of its transport activity, or via possible modulation of processes (such as phosphorylation) regulating P-gp transport activity. Effects of MDR reversal agents on the P-gp expression have also been reported. Function and expression of P-gp can be affected indirectly as well, e.g. through cyclooxygenase-2 or carbonic anhydrase-IX expression and effects.",

        "title": "Alteration in the gene expression pattern of primary monocytes after adhesion to endothelial cells",
        "abstract": "Monocytes originate from precursors made in the bone and remain in the circulation for nearly 24 h. Much effort has been done to identify the molecules regulating transendothelial migration of monocytes during inflammatory conditions. In contrast, considerably less is known about the process of constitutive monocyte emigration although nearly 340 million monocytes leave the circulation each day in healthy individuals. Previous studies indicated that chemokines were up-regulated in monocytes cocultured with endothelial cells that induce the retraction of the latter cell type, thereby increasing vascular permeability. Thus, we hypothesized that the utilities required for efficient constitutive monocyte extravasation are generated by monocytes themselves because of adhesion to na\u00efve endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, cDNA microarray analysis was performed to determine the changes in the gene expression pattern of primary monocytes that have been attached to endothelial cells compared with monocytes that were held in suspension, and we were able to identify three major groups of genes. The first group includes genes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and tissue transglutaminase 2, which are likely required for monocyte extravasation. The second group consists of genes that are expressed in phagocytes such as caveolin-1 and CD74. Finally, the third group comprises genes that are expressed in cells of endothelial tissue and cartilage including E-selectin, fibronectin-1, matrix Gla protein, and aggrecanase-2. In summary, we conclude that adhesion of peripheral blood monocytes to na\u00efve endothelial cells has two effects: mandatory extravasation-specific genes are regulated, and the differentiation program of monocytes is initiated.",

        "abstract": "A functional collaboration between growth factor receptors such as platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and integrins is required for effective signal transduction in response to soluble growth factors. However, the mechanisms of synergistic PDGFR/integrin signaling remain poorly understood. Our previous work showed that cell surface tissue transglutaminase (tTG) induces clustering of integrins and amplifies integrin signaling by acting as an integrin binding adhesion co-receptor for fibronectin. Here we report that in fibroblasts tTG enhances PDGFR-integrin association by interacting with PDGFR and bridging the two receptors on the cell surface. The interaction between tTG and PDGFR reduces cellular levels of the receptor by accelerating its turnover. Moreover, the association of PDGFR with tTG causes receptor clustering, increases PDGF binding, promotes adhesion-mediated and growth factor-induced PDGFR activation, and up-regulates downstream signaling. Importantly, tTG is required for efficient PDGF-dependent proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for cell surface tTG in the regulation of the joint PDGFR/integrin signaling and PDGFR-dependent cell responses.",

        "abstract": "Recent observations that aberrant expression of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) promotes growth, survival, and metastasis of multiple tumor types is of great significance and could yield novel therapeutic targets for improved patient outcomes. To accomplish this, a clear understanding of how TG2 contributes to these phenotypes is essential. Using mammary epithelial cell lines (MCF10A, MCF12A, MCF7 and MCF7/RT) as a model system, we determined the impact of TG2 expression on cell growth, cell survival, invasion, and differentiation. Our results show that TG2 expression promotes drug resistance and invasive functions by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Thus, TG2 expression supported anchorage-independent growth of mammary epithelial cells in soft-agar, disrupted the apical-basal polarity, and resulted in disorganized acini structures when grown in 3D-culture. At molecular level, TG2 expression resulted in loss of E-cadherin and increased the expression of various transcriptional repressors (Snail1, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist1). Tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) failed to induce EMT in cells lacking TG2 expression, suggesting that TG2 is a downstream effector of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. Moreover, TG2 expression induced stem cell-like phenotype in mammary epithelial cells as revealed by enrichment of CD44+/CD24-/low cell populations. Overall, our studies show that aberrant expression of TG2 is sufficient for inducing EMT in epithelial cells and establish a strong link between TG2 expression and progression of metastatic breast disease.",

        "abstract": "Constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) has been linked with carcinogenesis and cancer progression, including metastasis, chemoresistance, and radiation resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms that result in constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB are poorly understood. Here we show that chronic expression of the pro-inflammatory protein tissue transglutaminase (TG2) reprograms the transcription regulatory network in epithelial cells via constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB. TG2-induced NF-\u03baB binds the functional NF-\u03baB binding site in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1\u03b1) promoter and results in its increased expression at transcription and protein levels even under normoxic conditions. TG2/NF-\u03baB-induced HIF-1 was deemed essential for increased expression of some transcription repressors, like Zeb1, Zeb2, Snail, and Twist. Unlike tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), TG2 did not require I\u03baB kinase (IKK) for NF-\u03baB activation. Our data suggest that TG2 binds with I\u03baB\u03b1 and results in its rapid degradation via a non-proteasomal pathway. Importantly, the catalytically inactive (C277S) mutant form of TG2 was as effective as was wild-type TG2 in activating NF-\u03baB and inducing HIF-1 expression. We also found that TG2 interacted with p65/RelA protein, both in the cytosolic and the nuclear compartment. The TG2/p65(NF-\u03baB) complex binds to the HIF-1 promoter and induced its transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of TG2 or p65/RelA also inhibited the HIF-1\u03b1 expression and attenuated Zeb1, Zeb2, and Twist expression. To our knowledge, these findings show for the first time a direct link between TG2, NF-\u03baB, and HIF-1\u03b1, demonstrating TG2's important role in cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant glucose metabolism characterized by high levels of glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen, is an important hallmark of cancer. This metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect is essential to the survival of tumor cells and provides them with substrates required for biomass generation. Molecular mechanisms responsible for this shift in glucose metabolism remain elusive. As described herein, we found that aberrant expression of the proinflammatory protein transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is an important regulator of the Warburg effect in mammary epithelial cells. Mechanistically, TG2 regulated metabolic reprogramming by constitutively activating nuclear factor (NF)\u2010\u03baB, which binds to the hypoxia\u2010inducible factor (HIF)\u22121\u03b1 promoter and induces its expression even under normoxic conditions. TG2/NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010induced increase in HIF\u20101\u03b1 expression was associated with increased glucose uptake, increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption by mitochondria. Experimental suppression of TG2 attenuated HIF\u20101\u03b1 expression and reversed downstream events in mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, downregulation of p65/RelA or HIF\u20101\u03b1 expression in these cells restored normal glucose uptake, lactate production, mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic protein expression. Our results suggest that aberrant expression of TG2 is a master regulator of metabolic reprogramming and facilitates metabolic alterations in epithelial cells even under normoxic conditions. A TG2\u2010induced shift in glucose metabolism helps breast cancer cells to survive under stressful conditions and promotes their metastatic competence.",

Tissue transglutaminase-2 (TG2), a multifunctional member of the transglutaminase family, has been shown to be critical for tumor initiation and progression. However, how TG2 promotes the progression of GC is unknown. We report that TG2 was highly expressed in GC tissues and positively associated with depth of tumor invasion and late TNM stage. With gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we observed that TG2 promoted GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as tumorigenesis and peritoneal metastasis in vivo. These events were associated with the ERK1/2 pathway activation and an ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by overexpression of TG2. In summary, TG2 contributes to tumorigenesis and progression of GC by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and is a potential therapeutic target of metastatic gastric cancer.",

However, the role of TGM2 in sarcoma development and metastatic progression remains largely undefined. To further investigate the role of TGM2 in OS metastasis, we performed both gain- and loss-of-function studies for TGM2 in human and mouse OS cell lines. Our data provide evidence that enhanced expression of TGM2 in metastatic OS contributes to migratory and invasive phenotypes. Besides the effects on metastatic phenotypes, we also observed that TGM2 contributes to OS stem-like properties. In addition, treatment with transglutaminase inhibitors had analogous effects on proliferation and migration to TGM2 knockdown. Finally, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated that TGM2 functionally alters metastatic potential and survival outcome. Together, these data highlight TGM2 as a pro-metastatic factor in OS and a potential avenue for future therapeutic intervention to inhibit metastatic disease.",
