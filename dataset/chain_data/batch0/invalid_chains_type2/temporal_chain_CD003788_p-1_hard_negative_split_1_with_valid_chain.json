        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAcupuncture is commonly used by patients with chronic painful musculoskeletal disorders. There are, however, few well-designed studies of its efficacy. This paper describes a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design to evaluate acupuncture as a useful treatment adjunct in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-four patients were centrally randomized from a hospital-based rheumatology out-patient clinic. Fifty-six patients were suitable for study, all were on second-line therapy and aged 18-75 yr. There had been no change in therapy for the preceding 3 months. Patients who had previous acupuncture, anticoagulation, fear of needles or infection were excluded. Single-point (Liver 3) acupuncture or placebo was given with an intervening 6 week wash-out period. The acupuncturist, patient and statistician were blinded as far as possible. The outcome measures included the inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), visual analogue scale of pain, global patient assessment, 28 swollen and tender joint count, and a general health questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrated no significant effect of treatment or period and no significant interaction between treatment and period for any outcome variable. No adverse effects were reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcupuncture of this type cannot be considered as a useful adjunct to therapy in patients with RA. Possible reasons why this is the case are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

        "abstract": "Acupuncture has a beneficial effect when treating many diseases and painful conditions, and therefore is thought to be useful as a complementary therapy or to replace generally accepted pharmacological intervention. The attributive effect of acupuncture has been investigated in inflammatory diseases, including asthma, rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, epicondylitis, complex regional pain syndrome type 1 and vasculitis. Large randomised trials demonstrating the immediate and sustained effect of acupuncture are missing. Mechanisms underlying the ascribed immunosuppressive actions of acupuncture are reviewed in this communication. The acupuncture-controlled release of neuropeptides from nerve endings and subsequent vasodilative and anti-inflammatory effects through calcitonine gene-related peptide is hypothesised. The complex interactions with substance P, the analgesic contribution of beta-endorphin and the balance between cell-specific pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAcupuncture has traditionally been used in China and is being increasingly applied in Western countries to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammatory disease. However, clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have yielded inconsistent results, and the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture-produced anti-inflammation are unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) on inflammation in a rat model.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFour experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8-9 per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw of the rat. Experiment 1: To determine the effect of EA (10 and 100 Hz) versus sham treatment on inflammation. Experiment 2: To investigate the involvement of the adrenal glands on the effect of EA treatment using adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. Experiment 3: To determine the effects of EA on plasma levels of corticosterone. Experiment 4: To determine the effects of EA treatment versus immobilization on such stress indicators as heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 10 Hz EA significantly reduced CFA-induced hind paw edema. The effect was partially blocked in the ADX rats. EA significantly increased plasma levels of corticosterone but produced no noticeable signs of stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAt 10 Hz but not 100 Hz, EA suppresses inflammation by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), especially p38 MAPK, plays an important role in the development of central sensitization related to persistent inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is well known to relieve persistent inflammatory pain. However, little is known about relationship between EA and p38 MAPK. Inflammatory pain rat model was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into the saline group, CFA group, and CFA + EA group. EA (constant saquare wave, 2\u2009Hz and 100\u2009Hz alternating frequencies, intensities ranging from 1 to 2\u2009mA) was applied to bilateral \u201cZusanli\u201d (ST 36) and \u201cKunlun\u201d acupoints (BL 60) for 30\u2009min, once per day. The paw edema and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured at preinjection and days postinjection 1, 3, and 14. Spinal p-p38MAPK- immunoreactivty (p-p38MAPK-IR) cells were detected by immunohistochemistry at postinjection day 3 and 14. EA significantly inhibited paw edema at postinjection days 14 and increased PWT at postinjection days 3 and 14. Moreover, the increasing number of spinal p-p38MAPK-IR cells which was induced by CFA injection was suppressed by EA stimulation. These results indicate that anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of EA might be associated with its inhibition of spinal p38 MAPK activation and thereby provide a potential mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory pain by EA.",

        "title": "Electroacupuncture Promotes the Differentiation of Transplanted Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Overexpressing TrkC into Neuron-Like Cells in Transected Spinal Cord of Rats",
        "abstract": "Our previous study indicated that electroacupuncture (EA) could increase neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels in the injured spinal cord, stimulate the differentiation of transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and improve functional recovery in the injured spinal cord of rats. However, the number of neuron-like cells derived from the MSCs is limited. It is known that NT-3 promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons by preferentially binding to its receptor TrkC. In this study, we attempted to transplant TrkC gene-modified MSCs (TrkC-MSCs) into the spinal cord with transection to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the injured spinal cord and to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance transplanted MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into neuron-like cells, resulting in increased axonal regeneration and functional improvement in the injured spinal cord. Our results showed that EA increased NT-3 levels; furthermore, it promoted neuron-phenotype differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelin formation of transplanted TrkC-MSCs. In addition, TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA (the TrkC-MSCs + EA group) treatment promoted the growth of the descending BDA-labeled corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and 5-HT-positive axonal regeneration across the lesion site into the caudal cord. In addition, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and hindlimb locomotor function increased as compared to controls (treated with the LacZ-MSCs, TrkC-MSCs, and LacZ-MSCs + EA groups). In the TrkC-MSCs + EA group, the injured spinal cord also showed upregulated expression of the proneurogenic factors laminin and GAP-43 and downregulated GFAP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major inhibitors of axonal growth. Together, our data suggest that TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment spinal cord injury not only increased MSC survival and differentiation into neuron-like cells but also promoted CST regeneration across injured sites to the caudal cord and functional improvement, perhaps due to increase of NT-3 levels, upregulation of laminin and GAP-43, and downregulation of GFAP and CSPG proteins.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promotes functional recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in a murine model of MS. However, there is only a modicum of information on differentiation of grafted MSCs into oligodendrocyte-like cells in MS. The purpose of this study was to transplant neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and retinoic acid (RA) preinduced MSCs (NR-MSCs) into a demyelinated spinal cord induced by ethidium bromide and to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the demyelinated spinal cord. We also sought to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance NR-MSCs overexpressing the tyrosine receptor kinase C (TrkC) to differentiate into more oligodendrocyte-like cells, resulting in increased remyelination and nerve conduction in the spinal cord. Our results showed that NT-3 and RA increased transcription of TrkC mRNA in cultured MSCs. EA increased NT-3 levels and promoted differentiation of oligodendrocyte-like cells from grafted NR-MSCs in the demyelinated spinal cord. There was evidence of myelin formation by grafted NR-MSCs. In addition, NR-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment (the NR-MSCs + EA group) reduced demyelination and promoted remyelination. Furthermore, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials has improved compared to controls. Together, our data suggest that preinduced MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment not only increased MSC differentiation into oligodendrocyte-like cells forming myelin sheaths, but also promoted remyelination and functional improvement of nerve conduction in the demyelinated spinal cord.",

        "abstract": "Promoting remyelination is crucial for patients with demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis. However, it is still a circuitous conundrum finding a practical remyelinating therapy. Electroacupuncture (EA), originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat CNS diseases all over the world, but the role of EA in demyelinating diseases is barely known. In this study, we examined the remyelinating properties and mechanisms of EA in cuprizone-induced demyelinating model, a CNS demyelinating murine model of multiple sclerosis. By feeding C57BL/6 mice with chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks, we successfully induce demyelination as proved by weight change, beam test, pole test, histomorphology, and Western Blot. EA treatment significantly improves the neurobehavioral performance at week 7 (2 weeks after withdrawing cuprizone chow). RNA-seq and RT-PCR results reveal up-regulated expression of myelin-related genes, and the expression of myelin associated protein (MBP, CNPase, and O4) are also increased after EA treatment, indicating therapeutic effect of EA on cuprizone model. It is widely acknowledged that microglia exert phagocytic effect on degraded myelin debris and clear these detrimental debris, which is a necessary process for subsequent remyelination. We found the remyelinating effect of EA is associated with enhanced clearance of degraded myelin debris as detected by dMBP staining and red oil O staining. Our further studies suggest that more microglia assemble in demyelinating area (corpus callosum) during the process of EA treatment, and cells inside corpus callosum are mostly in a plump, ameboid, and phagocytic shape, quite different from the ramified cells outside corpus callosum. RNA-seq result also unravels that most genes relating to positive regulation of phagocytosis (GO:0050766) are up-regulated, indicating enhanced phagocytic process after EA treatment. During the process of myelin debris clearance, microglia tend to change their phenotype toward M2 phenotype. Thus, we also probed into the phenotype of microglia in our study. Immuno-staining results show increased expression of CD206 and Arg1, and the ratio of CD206/CD16/32 are also higher in EA group. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time that EA enhances myelin debris removal from activated microglia after demyelination, and promotes remyelination.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMicroglia play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis in complex brain environment. They first exist as amoeboid microglial cells (AMCs) in the developing brain, but with brain maturation, they transform into ramified microglial cells (RMCs). In pathological conditions, microglia are activated and have been classified into M1 and M2 phenotypes. The roles of AMCs, RMCs and M1/M2 microglia phenotypes especially in pathological conditions have been the focus of many recent studies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHere, we review the early development of the AMCs and RMCs and discuss their specific functions with reference to their anatomic locations, immunochemical coding etc. M1 and M2 microglia phenotypes in different neuropathological conditions are also reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActivated microglia are engaged in phagocytosis, production of proinflammatory mediators, trophic factors and synaptogenesis etc. Prolonged microglia activation, however, can cause damage to neurons and oligodendrocytes. The M1 and M2 phenotypes featured prominently in pathological conditions are discussed in depth. Experimental evidence suggests that microglia phenotype is being modulated by multiple factors including external and internal stimuli, local demands, epigenetic regulation, and herbal compounds.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPrevailing views converge that M2 polarization is neuroprotective. Thus, proper therapeutic designs including the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, herbal agents may be beneficial in suppression of microglial activation, especially M1 phenotype, for amelioration of neuroinflammation in different neuropathological conditions. Finally, recent development of radioligands targeting 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in activated microglia may hold great promises clinically for early detection of brain lesion with the positron emission tomography.",

        "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of periventricular white matter (PWM) damage (PWMD) induced by neonatal sepsis. Because the complement cascade is implicated in inflammatory response, this study was carried out to determine whether C3a is involved in PWMD, and, if so, whether it would induce axonal hypomyelination. Furthermore, we explored if C3a would act through its C3a receptor (C3aR) and thence inhibit maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) via the WNT/\u03b2\u2010catenin signal pathway. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 1 day were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg/kg). C3a was upregulated in activated microglia and astrocytes in the PWM up to 7 days after LPS injection. Concomitantly, enhanced C3aR expression was observed in NG2+ oligodendrocytes (OLs). Myelin proteins including CNPase, PLP, MBP and MAG were significantly reduced in the PWM of 28\u2010day septic rats. The number of PLP+ and MBP+ cells was markedly decreased. By electron microscopy, myelin sheath thickness was thinner and the average g\u2010ratios were higher. This was coupled with an increase in number of NG2+ cells and decreased number of CC1+ cells. Olig1, Olig2 and SOX10 protein expression was significantly reduced in the PWM after LPS injection. Very strikingly, C3aRa administration for the first 7 days could reverse the above\u2010mentioned pathological alterations in the PWM of septic rats. When incubated with C3a, expression of MBP, CNPase, PLP, MAG, Olig1, Olig2, SOX10 and CC1 in primary cultured OPCs was significantly downregulated as opposed to increased NG2. Moreover, WNT/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling pathway was found to be implicated in inhibition of OPCs maturation and differentiation induced by C3a in vitro. As a corollary, it is speculated that C3a in the PWM of septic rats is closely associated with the disorder of OPCs differentiation and maturation through WNT/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling pathway, which would contribute ultimately to axonal hypomyelination.",

        "abstract": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) leads to progressive deterioration of cognitive function, especially in aged patients. Demyelination is closely associated with cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationship between PND and demyelination remains unclear. Here we showed that demyelination was related to the pathogenesis of PND. Clemastine, an antihistamine with potency in remyelination, was predicted to have a potential therapeutic effect on PND by next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics in our previous study. In the present study, it was given at 10 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks to evaluate the effects on PND in aged mice. We found that clemastine ameliorated PND and reduced the expression levels of inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). Further investigation suggested clemastine increased the expression of oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) and myelin basic protein (MBP) to enhance remyelination by inhibiting the overactivation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway. At the same time, the expression of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95, or DLG4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and neuronal nuclei (NEUN) were also improved.

        "abstract": "Background Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common central nervous system (CNS) complication that might increase the morbidity and mortality of elderly patients after anesthesia/surgery. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction are closely related to cognitive dysfunction, an important clinical feature of PND. Transcranial near-infrared laser (TNIL) is regarded as an effective treatment for cognitive-related diseases by improving mitochondrial function and alleviating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress damage. Materials and methods Aged male C57BL/6 mice underwent a carotid artery exposure procedure under isoflurane anesthesia. We treated PND-aged mice for three consecutive days (4 h post-operation, 1-laser) with 810 nm continuous wave (CW) laser 18 J/cm2 at 120 mW/cm2. The post-treatment evaluation included behavioral tests, RTq-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Results The results demonstrated that TNIL improved PND and the levels of synaptic function-associated proteins such as post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synaptophysin (SYP), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Besides, neuroinflammatory cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 as well as microglia activation and oxidative stress damage were attenuated after TNIL treatment in aged mice with PND. Further investigation suggested that TNIL relieved oxidative stress response by activating the SIRT3/AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.

        "abstract": "Background Brain lymphatic drainage impairment is a prevalent characteristic in both aging and neurodegeneration. Surgery is more likely to induce excessive neuroinflammation and postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) among patients with aging and neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that surgical trauma may aggravate PND through preexisting cerebral lymphatic drainage impairment. However, there remains limited understanding about the role of surgery in changes of neurocognitive function in the populations with preoperative brain lymphatic drainage impairment. This study aims to expand our insight into surgery-induced glymphatic dysfunction, neuroinflammation and PND in middle-aged mice with preoperative brain lymphatic drainage impairment. Materials and methods Deep cervical lymph nodes ligation (LdcLNs) was performed on middle-aged mice to establish preoperative brain lymphatic drainage impairment. A month later, laparotomy was performed on these mice with or without LdcLNs followed by analysis of brain neuroinflammation, glymphatic function, neuronal damage, and behavioral test. Results LdcLNs disrupted meningeal lymphatic drainage. In middle-aged mice with LdcLNs, surgery exacerbated more serious glymphatic dysfunction accompanied by aggravation of A1 astrocytes activation and AQP4 depolarization. Furthermore, surgery caused neuronal damage via reducing expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN), post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin (SYP), as well as impairment in exploratory behavior and spatial working memory in middle-aged mice with LdcLNs. Additionally, surgery induced neuroinflammation with elevated microglia activation and increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, as well as activated more expression of HMGB1/TLR-4/NF-\u03baB pathway in middle-aged mice with LdcLNs. Conclusion Surgery exacerbates neuroinflammation and glymphatic dysfunction, ultimately resulting in neuronal damage and neurocognitive disorder in middle-aged mice with preoperative brain lymphatic drainage impairment. These results suggest that brain lymphatic drainage impairment may be a deteriorating factor in the progression of PND, and restoring its function may serve as a potential strategy against PND.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores a new mechanism of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) through brain lymphatic drainage impairment, which is a related but distinct topic from the source paper. The source paper investigates the effect of transcranial near-infrared laser on PND, while this paper focuses on the role of surgery in inducing PND. However, both papers share a common interest in understanding the underlying mechanisms of PND, and this paper's findings could potentially inform the development of new therapeutic strategies, including the use of transcranial near-infrared laser."
