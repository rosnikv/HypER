        "title": "The effects of doxycycline on reducing symptoms in knee osteoarthritis: results from a triple-blinded randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives Evidence suggests that doxycycline might have disease-modifying properties in osteoarthritis. However, the clinically relevant question as to whether doxycycline also modifies symptoms in knee osteoarthritis is unanswered. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of doxycycline on pain and daily functioning in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Methods A 24-week, randomised, triple-blind, placebo controlled trial on the symptomatic effectiveness of doxycycline twice a day 100 mg in knee osteoarthritis patients according to the clinical and radiological American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportion of participants in both study groups achieving a clinical response defined by the OMERACT\u2013OARSI set of responder criteria. Secondary endpoints included pain, stiffness, daily functioning, patient global assessment, quality of life, osteoarthritis-related medication and side effects. Results 232 patients were randomly assigned. At study end, 31% of participants met the primary endpoint in both groups. Except for more adverse events in the doxycycline group, no differences were also found on the secondary endpoints. Conclusions Doxycycline is not effective in reducing symptoms in knee osteoarthritis patients over a 24-week study period, but is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Although a possible structure-modifying effect of doxycycline was previously suggested, this is not accompanied by symptom relief in the short and medium term. Dutch Trial Register no NTR1111.",

        "title": "Immunotherapy of Autoimmune Diseases with Nonantibiotic Properties of Tetracyclines",
        "abstract": "Tetracyclines, which have long been used as broad-spectrum antibiotics, also exhibit a variety of nonantibiotic activities including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Tetracyclines bind to the 30S ribosome of the bacteria and inhibit protein synthesis. Unlike antimicrobial activity, the primary molecular target for the nonantibiotic activity of tetracycline remains to be clarified. Nonetheless, the therapeutic efficacies of tetracyclines, particularly minocycline and doxycycline, have been demonstrated in various animal models of autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. In this study, we summarized the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of tetracyclines, focusing on the mechanisms underlying these activities. In addition, we highlighted the on-going or completed clinical trials with reported outcomes.",

        "explanation": "Although this paper discusses the nonantibiotic properties of tetracyclines, it does not specifically investigate the effects of doxycycline on knee osteoarthritis. However, the paper does mention the therapeutic efficacies of doxycycline in various animal models of autoimmune disorders. The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the understanding of tetracyclines' properties, which is related to the source paper's investigation of doxycycline's effects on knee osteoarthritis."

        "title": "Immunopathology and Immunotherapy of Inflammatory Skin Diseases",
        "abstract": "Recently, there have been impressive advancements in understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying cutaneous inflammatory diseases. To understand these diseases on a deeper level and clarify the therapeutic targets more precisely, numerous studies including in vitro experiments, animal models, and clinical trials have been conducted. This has resulted in a paradigm shift from non-specific suppression of the immune system to selective, targeted immunotherapies. These approaches target the molecular pathways and cytokines responsible for generating inflammatory conditions and reinforcing feedback mechanisms to aggravate inflammation. Among the numerous types of skin inflammation, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common chronic cutaneous inflammatory diseases. Psoriasis is a IL-17\u2013mediated disease driven by IL-23, while AD is predominantly mediated by Th2 immunity. Autoimmune bullous diseases are autoantibody-mediated blistering disorders, including pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid. Alopecia areata is an organ-specific autoimmune disease mediated by CD8+ T-cells that targets hair follicles. This review will give an updated, comprehensive summary of the pathophysiology and immune mechanisms of inflammatory skin diseases. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of current and upcoming immunotherapies will be discussed.",

        "title": "Understanding CD4+ T cells in autoimmune bullous diseases",
        "abstract": "Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are a group of life-threatening blistering diseases caused by autoantibodies that target proteins in the skin and mucosa. Autoantibodies are the most important mediator in the pathogenesis of AIBDs, and various immune mechanisms contribute to the production of these pathogenic autoantibodies. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding how CD4+ T cells drive autoantibody production in these diseases. Here, we review the critical role of CD4+ T cells in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies for the initiation and perpetuation of humoral response in AIBDs. To gain an in-depth understanding of CD4+ T-cell pathogenicity, antigen specificity, and mechanisms of immune tolerance, this review covers comprehensive mouse and human studies of pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid. Further exploration of pathogenic CD4+ T cells will potentially provide immune targets for improved treatment of AIBDs.",

        "title": "A Case of Bullous Pemphigoid with Significant Infiltration of CD4-Positive T Cells during Treatment with Pembrolizumab, Accompanied by Pembrolizumab-Induced Multi-Organ Dysfunction",
        "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activate T cells, causing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Skin manifestations are common among irAEs, but ICI-associated bullous pemphigoid (BP) is rare. Inhibiting programmed death (PD)-1 signaling, in addition to causing epitope spreading, may disrupt B and T cell balance, causing excessive autoantibody production against the skin\u2019s basement membrane, leading to BP. A 70-year-old woman developed late-onset multi-organ irAEs, including diarrhea, thyroid dysfunction, and BP, while receiving pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. This highlights the long-term risk of irAEs, which can occur 2\u20133 years after starting ICIs. In cases of multi-organ irAE, C-reactive protein levels and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio are often low. These characteristics were observed in our case. Few papers address multiple organ involvement, highlighting the need to consider irAEs in a multi-organ context. While it is known that drug-induced skin reactions worsen as blood eosinophil counts increase, in our case, the eosinophil count remained normal, suggesting that ICI-associated BP might have been controlled without discontinuing the ICI and through tapering of low-dose oral prednisone treatment. Additionally, in this case, significant CD4-positive T cell infiltration was observed in the immunostaining examination of the blisters, indicating that severe CD4-positive T cell infiltration induced by the ICI might have led to multi-organ involvement, including severe diarrhea. Few reports focus on blood eosinophil counts in BP cases or discuss CD4 and CD8 immunostaining in BP cases. Therefore, future research should explore the relationship between blood eosinophil counts, immunostaining results, and the prognosis of irAEs, including BP, in treatment courses.",
