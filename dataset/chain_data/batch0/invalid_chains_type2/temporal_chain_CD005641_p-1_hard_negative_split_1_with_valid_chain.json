        "title": "Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration in patients with previous upper abdominal operations",
        "abstract": "Backgrounds/Aims We aimed to to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) in patients with previous upper abdominal surgery. Methods Retrospective analysis was performed on data from the attempted laparoscopic common bile duct exploration in 44 patients. Among them, 5 patients with previous lower abdominal operation were excluded. 39 patients were divided into two groups according to presence of previous upper abdominal operation; Group A: patients without history of abdominal operation. (n=27), Group B: patients with history of upper abdominal operation. Both groups (n=12) were compared to each other, with respect to clinical characteristics, operation time, postoperative hospital stay, open conversion rate, postoperative complication, duct clearance and mortality. Results All of the 39 patients received laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and choledochotomy with T-tube drainage (n=38 [97.4%]) or with primary closure (n=1). These two groups were not statistically different in gender, mean age and presence of co-morbidity, mean operation time (164.5\u00b163.1 min in group A and 134.8\u00b145.2 min in group B, p=0.18) and postoperative hospital stay (12.6\u00b15.7 days in group A and 9.8\u00b12.9 days in group B, p=0.158). Duct clearance and complication rates were comparable (p>0.05). 4 cases were converted to open in group A and 1 case in group B respectively. In group A (4 of 27 (14.8%) and 1 of 12 (8.3%) in group B, p=0.312) Trocar or Veress needle related complication did not occur in either group. Conclusions LCBDE appears to be a safe and effective treatment even in the patients with previous upper abdominal operation if performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeon, and it can be the best alternative to failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for difficult cholelithiasis.",

        "abstract": "Results: The perioperative variables did not differ significantly between groups. The operating time, open conversion rate, and morbidity rate were similar in groups I and II, despite the more complicated cases in group II. Moreover, the presence of remnant bile duct stones and biliary strictures, and the postoperative hospital stay, did not differ significantly between groups. The mean time to oral intake did not differ between groups, although this diet resumption time was significantly shorter in groups I and II than in a group undergoing open choledocholithomy (p=0.04).",

        "title": "A Change in Scope: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography via a Gastroscope in Billroth II Gastrojejunostomy",
        "abstract": "Previous gastric procedures often make endoscopic interventions challenging. Our case study focuses specifically on performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) through a gastroscope (EVIS EXERA III GIF-HQ190, Olympus, Center Valley, USA) in a patient with a history of Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. Successful ERCP in Billroth II using a gastroscope with traditional ERCP instrumentation has been very rarely reported in case reports in the literature review. This case study provides an alternative method of access to the common bile duct (CBD) and treatment of obstruction to prevent the risk of morbidities from an open CBD exploration. The primary diagnosis for this patient was choledocholithiasis. He initially underwent a standard ERCP with a side-viewing duodenoscope (EVIS EXERA II, TJF-Q190V, Olympus, Center Valley, USA); however, due to the difficult anatomy from his previous Billroth II reconstruction, the CBD was very difficult to access. A gastroscope was then used instead to perform the ERCP, providing an innovative endoscopic therapy. Given the patient\u2019s multiple comorbidities, he was at high risk for morbidity and mortality with an open CBD exploration. Hence, this case report provides insight into an innovative endoscopic approach to CBD exploration with difficult anatomy.",
