        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nRimonabant, a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker, may reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in patients who are overweight or obese.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of rimonabant with placebo each in conjunction with diet and exercise for sustained changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors over 2 years.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 3045 obese (body mass index > or =30) or overweight (body mass index >27 and treated or untreated hypertension or dyslipidemia) adult patients at 64 US and 8 Canadian clinical research centers from August 2001 to April 2004.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAfter a 4-week single-blind placebo plus diet (600 kcal/d deficit) run-in period, patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg/d of rimonabant, or 20 mg/d of rimonabant for 1 year. Rimonabant-treated patients were rerandomized to receive placebo or continued to receive the same rimonabant dose while the placebo group continued to receive placebo during year 2.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBody weight change over year 1 and prevention of weight regain during year 2. Additional efficacy measures included changes in waist circumference, plasma lipid levels, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt year 1, the completion rate was 309 (51%) patients in the placebo group, 620 (51%) patients in the 5 mg of rimonabant group, and 673 (55%) patients in the 20 mg of rimonabant group. Compared with the placebo group, the 20 mg of rimonabant group produced greater mean (SEM) reductions in weight (-6.3 [0.2] kg vs -1.6 [0.2] kg; P<.001), waist circumference (-6.1 [0.2] cm vs -2.5 [0.3] cm; P<.001), and level of triglycerides (percentage change, -5.3 [1.2] vs 7.9 [2.0]; P<.001) and a greater increase in level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (percentage change, 12.6 [0.5] vs 5.4 [0.7]; P<.001). Patients who were switched from the 20 mg of rimonabant group to the placebo group during year 2 experienced weight regain while those who continued to receive 20 mg of rimonabant maintained their weight loss and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. Use of different imputation methods to account for the high rate of dropouts in all 3 groups yielded similar results. Rimonabant was generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse event was nausea (11.2% for the 20 mg of rimonabant group vs 5.8% for the placebo group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this multicenter trial, treatment with 20 mg/d of rimonabant plus diet for 2 years promoted modest but sustained reductions in weight and waist circumference and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the trial was limited by a high drop-out rate and longer-term effects of the drug require further study. Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00029861.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nAbdominal obesity is associated with metabolic abnormalities and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, no obesity management strategy has demonstrated the ability to slow progression of coronary disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether weight loss and metabolic effects of the selective cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist rimonabant reduces progression of coronary disease in patients with abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS\nRandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-group, parallel-group trial (enrollment December 2004-December 2005) comparing rimonabant with placebo in 839 patients at 112 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients received dietary counseling, were randomized to receive rimonabant (20 mg daily) or matching placebo, and underwent coronary intravascular ultrasonography at baseline (n = 839) and study completion (n = 676).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy parameter was change in percent atheroma volume (PAV); the secondary efficacy parameter was change in normalized total atheroma volume (TAV).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the rimonabant vs placebo groups, PAV (95% confidence interval [CI]) increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.54%) vs 0.51% (0.22% to 0.80%) (P = .22), respectively, and TAV decreased 2.2 mm3 (-4.09 to -0.24) vs an increase of 0.88 mm3 (-1.03 to 2.79) (P = .03). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, imputing results based on baseline characteristics for patients not completing the trial, PAV increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.55%) vs 0.57% (0.29% to 0.84%) (P = .13), and TAV decreased 1.95 mm3 (-3.8 to -0.10) vs an increase of 1.19 mm3 (-0.73 to 3.12) (P = .02). Rimonabant-treated patients had a larger reduction in body weight (4.3 kg [-5.1 to -3.5] vs 0.5 kg [-1.3 to 0.3]) and greater decrease in waist circumference (4.5 cm [-5.4 to -3.7] vs 1.0 cm [-1.9 to -0.2]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 5.8 mg/dL (4.9 to 6.8) (22.4%) vs 1.8 mg/dL (0.9 to 2.7) (6.9%) (P < .001), and median triglyceride levels decreased 24.8 mg/dL (-35.4 to -17.3) (20.5%) vs 8.9 mg/dL (-14.2 to -1.8) (6.2%) (P < .001). Rimonabant-treated patients had greater decreases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (1.3 mg/dL [-1.7 to -1.2] [50.3%] vs 0.9 mg/dL [-1.4 to -0.5] [30.9%]) and less increase in glycated hemoglobin levels (0.11% [0.02% to 0.20%] vs 0.40% [0.31% to 0.49%]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). Psychiatric adverse effects were more common in the rimonabant group (43.4% vs 28.4%, P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter 18 months of treatment, the study failed to show an effect for rimonabant on disease progression for the primary end point (PAV) but showed a favorable effect on the secondary end point (TAV). Determining whether rimonabant is useful in management of coronary disease will require additional imaging and outcomes trials, which are currently under way.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00124332.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Rimonabant, the first selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, improves cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese patients. ADAGIO-Lipids assessed the effect of rimonabant on cardiometabolic risk factors and intraabdominal and liver fat. Methods and Results\u2014803 abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides [TG] or reduced high-density lipoprotein\u2013cholesterol [HDL-C]) were randomized to placebo or rimonabant 20 mg/d for 1 year. HDL-C and TG were coprimary end points. Intraabdominal (visceral) and liver fat were measured by computed tomography in a subgroup of 231 patients. In total, 73% of rimonabant- and 70% of placebo-treated patients completed the study treatment. Rimonabant 20 mg produced significantly greater changes from baseline versus placebo in HDL-C (+7.4%) and TG levels (\u221218%; P<0.0001), as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL particle sizes, apolipoprotein A1 and B, HDL2, HDL3, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels (all P<0.05). Rimonabant decreased abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) cross-sectional area by 5.1% compared to placebo (P<0.005), with a greater reduction in visceral AT (\u221210.1% compared to placebo; P<0.0005), thereby reducing the ratio of visceral/subcutaneous AT (P<0.05). Rimonabant significantly reduced liver fat content (liver/spleen attenuation ratio; P<0.005). Systolic (\u22123.3 mm Hg) and diastolic (\u22122.4 mm Hg) blood pressure were significantly reduced with rimonabant versus placebo (P<0.0001). The safety profile of rimonabant was consistent with previous studies; gastrointestinal, nervous system, psychiatric, and general adverse events were more common with rimonabant 20 mg. Conclusions\u2014In abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia, rimonabant 20 mg significantly improved multiple cardiometabolic risk markers and induced significant reductions in both intraabdominal and liver fat.",

Special emphasis is placed on weighing the relative importance of CB1 receptors located in peripheral tissues versus the central nervous system in mediating the metabolic effects of endocannabinoids. Finally, we review recent observations that indicate that peripherally restricted CB1 receptor antagonists retain efficacy in reducing weight and improving metabolic abnormalities in mouse models of obesity without causing behavioural effects predictive of neuropsychiatric side effects in humans.",

        "abstract": "The disposition of 1-(8-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-(4-chlorophenyl)-9H- purin-6-yl)-4-(ethylamino)-piperidine-4-carboxamide (CP-945,598), an orally active antagonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, was studied after a single 25-mg oral dose of [14C]CP-945,598 to healthy human subjects. Serial blood samples and complete urine and feces were collected up to 672 h after dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity was 60.1 \u00b1 12.8 from the urine and feces, with the majority of the dose excreted in the feces. The absorption of CP-945,598 in humans was slow with Tmax at 6 h. Less than 2% of the dose was recovered as unchanged drug in the combined excreta, suggesting that CP-945,598 is extensively metabolized. The primary metabolic pathway of CP-945,598 involved N-de-ethylation to form an N-desethyl metabolite (M1), which was then subsequently metabolized by amide hydrolysis (M2), N-hydroxylation (M3), piperidine ring hydroxylation (M6), and ribose conjugation (M9). M3 was further metabolized to oxime (M4) and keto (M5) metabolites. M1, M4, and M5 were the major circulating metabolites, with AUC(0\u201348) values 4.7-, 1.5-, and 1.1-fold greater than that of CP-945,598. M1, M2, and M9 accounted for 5.6, 33.6, and 6.30% of the dose, respectively, in excreta. The results from in vitro experiments with recombinant isoforms suggested that the oxidative metabolism of CP-945,598 to M1 is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4/3A5. The molecular docking study showed that the N-ethyl moiety of CP-945,598 can access to the heme iron-oxo of CYP3A4 in an energetically favored orientation. Together, these data suggest that CP-945,598 is well absorbed and eliminated largely by CYP3A4/3A5-catalyzed metabolism.",

An in vitro and in vivo clearance data set revealed a lack of correlation; however, when compounds with <5% free fraction were excluded, a more predictable correlation was observed. Compounds with log P between 3 and 4 were likely to have significant free fraction, so we designed compounds in this range to give more predictable clearance values. This strategy produced compounds with desirable in vivo half-lives, ultimately leading to the discovery of compound 46. The progression of compound 46 was halted due to the contemporaneous marketing and clinical withdrawal of other centrally acting CB1 antagonists; however, the design strategy successfully delivered a potent CB1 antagonist with the desired pharmacokinetic properties and a clean off-target profile.",

        "abstract": "Obesity rates are increasing worldwide and there is a need for novel therapeutic treatment options. The endocannabinoid system has been linked to homeostatic processes, including metabolism, food intake, and the regulation of body weight. Rimonabant, an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, was effective at producing weight loss in obese subjects. However, due to adverse psychiatric side effects, rimonabant was removed from the market. More recently, we reported an inverse relationship between cannabis use and BMI, which has now been duplicated by several groups. As those results may appear contradictory, we review here preclinical and clinical studies that have studied the impact on body weight of various cannabinoid CB1 drugs. Notably, we will review the impact of CB1 inverse agonists, agonists, partial agonists, and neutral antagonists. Those findings clearly point out the cannabinoid CB1 as a potential effective target for the treatment of obesity. Recent preclinical studies suggest that ligands targeting the CB1 may retain the therapeutic potential of rimonabant without the negative side effect profile. Such approaches should be tested in clinical trials for validation.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. is increasingly emerging for its protective role in modulating neuroinflammation, a complex process orchestrated among others by microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Phytocannabinoids, especially cannabidiol (CBD), terpenes, and other constituents trigger several upstream and downstream microglial intracellular pathways. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of a CBD\u2010 and terpenes\u2010enriched C. sativa extract (CSE) in an in vitro model of neuroinflammation. We evaluated the effect of CSE on the inflammatory response induced by exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BV\u20102 microglial cells, compared with CBD and \u03b2\u2010caryophyllene (CAR), CB2 receptors (CB2r) inverse and full agonist, respectively.

In BV\u20102 cells, these anti\u2010inflammatory effects exerted by CSE phytocomplex were only partially dependent on CB2r modulation and they were mediated by the regulation of enzymes responsible for the endocannabinoids metabolism, by the inhibition of reactive oxygen species release and the modulation of JNK/p38 cascade with consequent NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation suppression. Our data suggest that C. sativa phytocomplex and its multitarget mechanism could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory\u2010related diseases.",

        "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a chronic disabling condition with a 7\u201310% of prevalence in the general population that is largely undertreated. Available analgesic therapies are poorly effective and are often accompanied by numerous side effects. Growing evidence indicates cannabinoids are a valuable treatment opportunity for neuropathic pain. The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of pain perception through the CB1 receptors, but CB1 agonists, while largely effective, are not always satisfactory pain-relieving agents in clinics because of their serious adverse effects. Recently, several CB2 agonists have shown analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic, and anti-allodynic activity in the absence of CB1-induced psychostimulant effects, offering promise in neuropathic pain management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-neuropathic activity of a novel selective CB2 agonist, COR167, in a preclinical model of peripheral neuropathy, the spared nerve injury (SNI). Oral COR167, in a dose-dependent manner, attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia after acute and repeated administration, showing the absence of tolerance induction. At anti-neuropathic doses, COR167 did not show any alteration in the locomotor behavior. SNI mice showed increased microglial levels of HDAC1 protein in the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord, along with NF-kB activation. COR167 treatment prevented the HDAC1 overexpression and the NF-kB activation and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 through a CB2-mediated mechanism. Oral administration of COR167 shows promising therapeutic potential in the management of neuropathic pain conditions.",
