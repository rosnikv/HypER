        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMetabolic control often deteriorates during puberty in children with type 1 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether addition of metformin for 3 Months improves metabolic control and insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwenty-six of 30 randomised adolescents with type 1 diabetes (18 females, eight males) completed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Their mean age was 16.9+/-1.6 (s.d.) Years, mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 9.5+/-1.1% and daily insulin dosage 1.2+/-0.3 U/kg. The participants were randomised to receive oral metformin or placebo for 3 Months. HbA(1c) was measured Monthly, and peripheral insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp at baseline and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHbA(1c) decreased significantly in the group treated with metformin, from 9.6 to 8.7% (P<0.05), but was unchanged in the placebo group (9.5 vs 9.2%). Peripheral glucose uptake divided by mean plasma insulin concentration was increased in the metformin group (P<0.05) but not in the placebo group. Initial insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated to changes in HbA(1c) (r=-0.62; P<0.05) and positively correlated to changes in insulin sensitivity (r=0.77; P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this double-blind placebo-controlled study we found that metformin improves metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The effect seems to be associated with an increased insulin-induced glucose uptake.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) activation up-regulates thermogenesis-related genes in rodent white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) without increasing whole-body energy expenditure. We tested here whether such dissociation is the result of a negative modulation of sympathetic activity to WAT and BAT and thyroid axis components by PPARgamma activation. Administration of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (15 mg/kg.d) for 7 d to male Sprague Dawley rats increased food intake (10%), feed efficiency (31%), weight gain (45%), spontaneous motor activity (60%), and BAT and WAT mass and reduced whole-body oxygen consumption. Consistent with an anabolic setting, rosiglitazone markedly reduced sympathetic activity to BAT and WAT (>50%) and thyroid status as evidenced by reduced levels of plasma thyroid hormones (T(4) and T(3)) and mRNA levels of BAT and liver T(3)-generating enzymes iodothyronine type 2 (-40%) and type 1 (-32%) deiodinases, respectively. Rosiglitazone also decreased mRNA levels of the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) isoforms alpha1 (-34%) and beta (-66%) in BAT and isoforms alpha1 (-20%) and alpha2 (-47%) in retroperitoneal WAT. These metabolic effects were associated with a reduction in mRNA levels of the pro-energy expenditure peptides CRH and CART in specific hypothalamic nuclei. A direct central action of rosiglitazone is, however, unlikely based on its low brain uptake and lack of metabolic effects of intracerebroventricular administration. In conclusion, a reduction in BAT sympathetic activity and thyroid status appears to, at least partly, explain the PPARgamma-induced reduction in energy expenditure and the fact that up-regulation of thermogenic gene expression does not translate into functional stimulation of whole-body thermogenesis in vivo.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the mechanisms whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonism affects glucose and lipid metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by studying the impact of PPARgamma activation on BAT glucose uptake and metabolism, lipogenesis, and mRNA levels plus activities of enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. Interscapular BAT of rats treated or not with rosiglitazone (15 mg*kg(-1).day(-1), 7 days) was evaluated in vivo for glucose uptake and lipogenesis and in vitro for glucose metabolism, gene expression, and activities of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (PAP or lipin-1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Rosiglitazone increased BAT mass without affecting whole tissue glucose uptake. BAT glycogen content (-80%), its synthesis from glucose (-50%), and mRNA levels of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (-40%), which generates UDP-linked glucose for glycogen synthesis, were all reduced by rosiglitazone. In contrast, BAT TAG-glycerol synthesis in vivo and glucose incorporation into TAG-glycerol in vitro were stimulated by the agonist along with the activities and mRNA levels of glycerol 3-phosphate-generating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycerokinase. Furthermore, rosiglitazone markedly increased the activities of GPAT and DGAT but not those of lipin-1-mediated PAP-1, enzymes involved in the sequential acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate and TAG synthesis. Because an adequate supply of fatty acids is essential for BAT nonshivering thermogenesis, the enhanced ability of BAT to synthesize TAG under PPARgamma activation may constitute an important mechanism by which lipid substrates are stored in preparation for an eventual thermogenic activation.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-mediated transcription factors, which control both lipid and energy metabolism and inflammation pathways. PPAR\u03b3 agonists are effective in the treatment of metabolic diseases and, more recently, neurodegenerative diseases, in which they show promising neuroprotective effects. We studied the effects of the pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate on tau pathology, inflammation, lipid metabolism and behavior in transgenic mice with the P301S human tau mutation, which causes familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Bezafibrate treatment significantly decreased tau hyperphosphorylation using AT8 staining and the number of MC1-positive neurons. Bezafibrate treatment also diminished microglial activation and expression of both inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2. Additionally, the drug differentially affected the brain and brown fat lipidome of control and P301S mice, preventing lipid vacuoles in brown fat. These effects were associated with behavioral improvement, as evidenced by reduced hyperactivity and disinhibition in the P301S mice. Bezafibrate therefore exerts neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of tauopathy, as shown by decreased tau pathology and behavioral improvement. Since bezafibrate was given to the mice before tau pathology had developed, our data suggest that bezafibrate exerts a preventive effect on both tau pathology and its behavioral consequences. Bezafibrate is therefore a promising agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with tau pathology.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated a therapeutic benefit of pharmaceutical PGC-1\u03b1 activation in cellular and murine model of disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. While in some cases, this effect seems to be clearly associated with boosting of mitochondrial function, additional alterations as well as tissue- and cell-type-specific effects might play an important role. We initiated a comprehensive analysis of the effects of potential PGC-1\u03b1-activating drugs and pharmaceutically targeted the PPAR (bezafibrate, rosiglitazone), AMPK (AICAR, metformin) and Sirt1 (resveratrol) pathways in HeLa cells, neuronal cells and PGC-1\u03b1-deficient MEFs to get insight into cell type specificity and PGC-1\u03b1 dependence of their working action. We used bezafibrate as a model drug to assess the effect on a tissue-specific level in a murine model. Not all analyzed drugs activate the PGC pathway or alter mitochondrial protein levels. However, they all affect supramolecular assembly of OXPHOS complexes and OXPHOS protein stability. In addition, a clear drug- and cell-type-specific influence on several cellular stress pathways as well as on post-translational modifications could be demonstrated, which might be relevant to fully understand the action of the analyzed drugs in the disease state. Importantly, the effect on the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and stress response program upon drug treatment is PGC-1\u03b1 dependent in MEFs demonstrating not only the pleiotropic effects of this molecule but points also to the working mechanism of the analyzed drugs. The definition of the action spectrum of the different drugs forms the basis for a defect-specific compensation strategy and a future personalized therapeutic approach.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients are at increased risk of many forms of malignancies, especially of the pancreas, colon and hepatocellular cancer. Unfortunately, little is known of the possible interaction between antidiabetic drugs and anticancer agents. The present study investigates the influence of metformin (MET) and sitagliptin (SITA) on the in vitro anticancer activity of the microtubule depolymerization inhibitor agent epothilone A (EpoA). Hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) viability and apoptosis were determined by the MTT test and by double staining with PO-PRO-1 and 7-aminoactinomycin D, respectively, after treatment with EpoA, metformin or sitagliptin. The levels of nuclear factor NF-\u03baB and p53 were evaluated in the presence and absence of inhibitors. While EpoA and MET inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation, SITA did not. EpoA and SITA induced higher p53 levels than MET. All tested drugs increased the level of NF-\u03baB. Only MET enhanced the proapoptotic effect of EpoA. The EpoA+MET combination evoked the highest cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells and led to apoptosis independent of p53, decreasing the level of NF-\u03baB. These findings support the link between NF-\u03baB and p53 in the modulation of apoptotic effects in HepG2 cells treated by EpoA. Our studies indicate that the combination of EpoA and MET applied in subtoxic doses has a stronger cytotoxic effect on liver cancer cells than each of the compounds alone. The therapeutic advantages of the combination of EpoA with MET may be valuable in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) and liver cancer.",

Wistar rats were treated with or without sitagliptin before DENA treatment. We detected liver weight, blood glucose, and histopathology of the liver. Serum biochemical markers like serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), gamma\u2010glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), total bilirubin (TBR), total protein (TPR), and albumin (ALB) were also evaluated. In addition, lipid profile parameters comprising total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and high\u2010density lipoprotein were also measured. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), interleukin\u20101beta (IL\u20101\u03b2), and tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1) were determined in liver homogenate. Furthermore, the activity of nuclear factor (NF\u2010\u03baB) was also measured. Our results showed that sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) in a dose\u2010dependent manner expressively decreased the DENA\u2010induced elevation of SGPT, SGOT, SALP, and GGTP. Whereas sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) in a dose\u2010dependent mode reduced the level of TBR and increased the TPR and ALB as well as improved the liver histopathology alterations in DENA\u2010exposed rats.

Assay of cytochrome C for 6c revealed an attenuation of cytochrome C level about 3.54 fold, comparable to NAC (4.13 fold). In caspases-3,8,9 assays, 6c was found to exhibit more potency and selectivity toward caspase-3 than other caspases. The testicular histopathological investigation was carried out on all targeted compounds 6a\u2013g, indicating a significant improvement in the spermatogenesis process for compounds 6a\u2013c if compared to the reference relative to the control. Finally, molecular docking studies were done at the caspase-3 active site to suggest possible binding modes. Hence, it could conceivably be hypothesized that compounds 6a\u2013c could be considered good lead candidate compounds as antiapoptotic agents.",

        "abstract": "Our investigation includes the synthesis of new naphthalene-bis-triazole-bis-quinolin-2(1H)-ones 4a\u2013e and 7a\u2013e via Cu-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloadditions of 4-azidoquinolin-2(1H)-ones 3a\u2013e with 1,5-/or 1,8-bis(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)naphthalene (2) or (6). All structures of the obtained products have been confirmed with different spectroscopic analyses. Additionally, a mild and versatile method based on copper-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition (Meldal\u2013Sharpless reaction) was developed to tether quinolinones to O-atoms of 1,5- or 1,8-dinaphthols. The triazolo linkers could be considered as anti and syn products, which are interesting precursors for functionalized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors with potential apoptotic antiproliferative action. The antiproliferative activities of the 4a\u2013e and 7a\u2013e were evaluated. Compounds 4a\u2013e and 7a\u2013e demonstrated strong antiproliferative activity against the four tested cancer cell lines, with mean GI50 ranging from 34 nM to 134 nM compared to the reference erlotinib, which had a GI50 of 33 nM. The most potent derivatives as antiproliferative agents, compounds 4a, 4b, and 7d, were investigated for their efficacy as EGFR inhibitors, with IC50 values ranging from 64 nM to 97 nM. Compounds 4a, 4b, and 7d demonstrated potent apoptotic effects via their effects on caspases 3, 8, 9, Cytochrome C, Bax, and Bcl2. Finally, docking studies show the relevance of the free amino group of the quinoline moiety for antiproliferative action via hydrogen bond formation with essential amino acids.",

        "abstract": "The reaction of 4-azido-quinolin-2(1H)-ones 1a\u2013e with the active methylene compounds pentane-2,4-dione (2a), 1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione (2b), and K2CO3 was investigated in this study. This approach afforded 4-(1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)quinolin-2(1H)-ones 3a\u2013j in high yields and purity. All newly synthesized products\u2019 structures were identified. Compounds 3a\u2013j were tested for antiproliferative activity against a panel of four cancer cell lines. In comparison to the reference erlotinib (GI50 = 33), compounds 3f\u2013j were the most potent derivatives, with GI50 values ranging from 22 nM to 31 nM. The most effective antiproliferative derivatives, 3f\u2013j, were subsequently investigated as possible multi-target inhibitors of EGFR, BRAFV600E, and EGFRT790M. Compound 3h was the most potent inhibitor of the studied molecular targets, with IC50 values of 57 nM, 68 nM, and 9.70 nM, respectively. The apoptotic assay results demonstrated that compounds 3g and 3h function as caspase-3, 8, and Bax activators as well as down-regulators of the antiapoptotic Bcl2, and hence can be classified as apoptotic inducers. Finally, compounds 3g and 3h displayed promising antioxidant activity at 10 \u00b5M, with DPPH radical scavenging of 70.6% and 73.5%, respectively, compared to Trolox (77.6%).",

        "abstract": "The current study focuses on developing a single molecule that acts as an antiproliferative agent with dual or multi-targeted action, reducing drug resistance and adverse effects. A new series of 4-pyrazolylquinolin-2-ones (5a-j) with apoptotic antiproliferative effects as dual EGFR/BRAFV600E inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Compounds 5a-j were investigated for their cell viability effect against a normal cell line (MCF-10A). Results showed that none of the compounds were cytotoxic, and all 5a-j demonstrated more than 90% cell viability at 50 \u03bcM concentration. Using erlotinib as a reference, the MTT assay investigated the antiproliferative impact of targets 5a-j against four human cancer cell lines. Compounds 5e, 5f, 5h, 5i, and 5j were the most potent antiproliferative agents with GI50 values of 42, 26, 29, 34, and 37 nM, making compounds 5f and 5h more potent than erlotinib (GI50 = 33 nM). Moreover, compounds 5e, 5f, 5h, 5i, and 5j were further investigated as dual EGFR/BRAFV600E inhibitors, and results revealed that compounds 5f, 5h, and 5i are potent antiproliferative agents that act as dual EGFR/BRAFV600E inhibitors. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection revealed that compound 5h displaying cell cycle arrest at the G1 transition could induce apoptosis with a high necrosis percentage. Docking studies revealed that compound 5f exhibited a strong affinity for EGFR and BRAFV600E, with high docking scores of -8.55 kcal mol-1 and -8.22 kcal mol-1, respectively. Furthermore, the ADME analysis of compounds 5a-j highlighted the diversity in their pharmacokinetic properties, emphasizing the importance of experimental validation.",
