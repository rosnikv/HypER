        "title": "[Sulfasalazine in ankylosing spondylitis: a prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study and comparison with other controlled studies].",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in ankylosing spondylitis including a meta-analysis of comparable trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 70 patients with established diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis and a mean disease duration of 16.7 years were investigated in two centers for 26 weeks comparing 3 g/d sulfasalazine to placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe main outcome parameters, pain score, fingers-to-floor test, and CRP, did not improve significantly in the sulfasalazine group compared to the placebo group. Altogether sulfasalazine was significantly superior to placebo only concerning the IgA levels. The dropout rate was 47% for the sulfasalazine group and 19% for the placebo group. Due to side effects, 38% and 11%, respectively, stopped treatment. Ten other prospective, double-blind, controlled studies were analyzed. Altogether 959 patients with a mean disease duration of 13.9 years were evaluated. Most parameters did not improve significantly in the sulfasalazine groups compared to the placebo groups. Spinal motility remained nearly unchanged (0.3-3.5% improvement). Pain, morning stiffness, functional index, and global assessment were slightly influenced (1.9-11.7%). Reduction of ESR, CRP, IgA, IgG, and IgM was more distinct (12.6-20.3%). In 4 studies SSZ had greater efficacy in patients with peripheral joint involvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSulfasalazine has no clinically relevant benefit in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The dropout-rate due to adverse effects is high with a daily dose of 3 g. Sulfasalazine may be beneficial in peripheral joint involvement. Only few data exist about patients with a disease duration of less than 10 years.",

        "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by back pain and progressive spinal stiffness. The prevalence of AS is 30 per 10,000 people. The patients often have complications or co-existing diseases, which may affect the choice of drugs and the treatment effects. However, the pathogenesis of AS is still controversial. Inflammation takes a key role in the occurrence and development of AS. Therefore, antiinflammation is crucial in the management of AS. The goals and principles of AS management is to achieve remission, control disease activity and improve the quality of the life of patients. What is more, drug therapy is still a primary part of AS management. Due to the heterogeneity of AS patients, the effect of conventional treatment is limited. There is evidence that multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is of great value in drug selection and reasonable combination. To conclude and reach a better understanding, we took a brief overlook of the drug treatment of AS and its related complications.",

        "title": "Anti-Osteogenic Effect of Danshensu in Ankylosing Spondylitis: An in Vitro Study Based on Integrated Network Pharmacology",
        "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by abnormal bone metabolism, with few effective treatments available. Danshensu [3-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl) lactic acid) is a bioactive compound from traditional Chinese medicine with a variety of pharmacologic effects. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacologic effect and molecular mechanism of Danshensu in AS. Potential targets of Danshensu were identified in four drugs-genes databases; and potential pharmacologic target genes in AS were identified in three diseases-genes databases. Differentially expressed genes related to AS were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Overlapping targets of Danshensu and AS were determined and a disease\u2013active ingredient\u2013target interaction network was constructed with Cytoscape software. Enrichment analyses of the common targets were performed using Bioconductor. To test the validity of the constructed network, an in vitro model was established by treating osteoblasts from newborn rats with low concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Then, the in vitro model and AS fibroblasts were treated with Danshensu (1\u201310 \u03bcM). Osteogenesis was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase staining and activity assay, alizarin red staining, quantitative PCR, and western blotting. We identified 2944 AS-related genes and 406 Danshensu targets, including 47 that were common to both datasets. The main signaling pathways associated with the targets were the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. A low concentration of TNF-\u03b1 (0.01 ng/ml) promoted the differentiation of osteoblasts; this was inhibited by Danshensu, which had the same effect on AS fibroblasts but had the opposite effect on normal osteoblasts. Danshensu also decreased the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK in AS fibroblasts. There results provide evidence that Danshensu exerts an anti-osteogenic effect via suppression of JNK and ERK signaling, highlighting its therapeutic potential for the treatment of AS.",

        "title": "Analysis of potential key ferroptosis genes in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis by bioinformatics",
        "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a disabling chronic inflammatory disease. Mechanisms of ferroptosis in AS remain unclear. Using bioinformatics analysis, we aimed to identify key molecules involved in ferroptosis, provide potential therapeutic targets for AS, and further explore mechanisms of ferroptosis in AS.GSE25101 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus and intersected with a ferroptosis gene dataset. The ferroptosis\u2010relate differentially\u2010expressed genes were further subjected to functional enrichment analysis, protein interaction network analysis, and gene\u2010miRNA interaction network analysis, from which potential key ferroptosis genes in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis were screened.A total of 20 differentially expressed genes were screened, most of which are involved in phosphoinositide 3 kinase\u2010Akt or mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways or the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The following target genes were identified through protein\u2010protein interaction network analysis and screening of key modules constructed from genes associated with PI3K\u2010Akt and MAPK signaling pathways: TP53, PTEN, TLR4, HSPB1, DDIT3, and XBP1. In addition, PI3K\u2010Akt and MAPK signaling were associated with oxidative stress, which may play a role in AS pathological ossification related to ferroptosis. Only hsa\u2010miR\u2010205\u20105p was found to target at least two genes by gene\u2010miRNA interaction network analysis.Future therapeutic drug development may intervene by modulating MAPK or PI3K\u2010Akt signaling pathways rather than directly affecting the interleukin 17 pathway. hsa\u2010miR\u2010205\u20105p may be a potential novel biomarker for AS.",
