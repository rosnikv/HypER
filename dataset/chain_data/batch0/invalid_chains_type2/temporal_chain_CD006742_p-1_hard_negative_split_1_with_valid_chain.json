        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension.\n\n\nDESIGN\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.\n\n\nSETTING\nCommunity-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\n--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPrimary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.",

After a 4-wk baseline period, 22 subjects were randomly assigned to receive fish oil and 24 to receive corn oil. For both 8-wk treatments there were no between-group differences in the change in blood pressure. There was a treatment difference for standing DBP when baseline values were compared with those after treatment 2; DBP decreased by 5.1 mm Hg in the fish-oil group vs 0.72 mm Hg in the corn-oil group (P = 0.024). Within groups during the first treatment, both fish oil and corn oil lowered all four blood pressure measures (P less than 0.05); blood pressures were not further lowered during the second treatment compared with the washout period. There were no significant between-group differences in laboratory safety tests or categorical side effects. Fish oil lowered triglycerides by 0.47 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). In elderly subjects, diet plus both omega-3 and omega-6 supplements (9 g/d) safely and effectively lower SBP and DBP.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nResearch in Western countries has shown most centenarians to be survivors with multiple comorbidities. However, Japanese centenarians' morbidity and its relationship to functional status has yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to clarify the association of morbidity with the physical and cognitive function of centenarians. We examined Tokyo-area centenarians to determine their kinds of morbidity profiles and how such morbidity related to their functional status.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 302 centenarians living in Tokyo (101.2+/-1.8 years; 65 men, 237 women), and assessed their physical status, morbidity, and use of medication. Activities of daily living and cognitive function were also assessed using the Barthel Index and the Clinical Dementia Rating.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMore than 95% of the centenarians had chronic diseases. Both the physical and cognitive functions were significantly higher in men. The present and previous illnesses most frequently included hypertension, heart disease, stroke, fractures, and cataracts. Fractures were observed significantly more frequently in women. Diabetes mellitus was uncommon. The physical and cognitive function of centenarians with a history of stroke or fracture were particularly poor, whereas those centenarians with hypertension tended to show a high level of physical and cognitive function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlmost all centenarians had chronic diseases. Stroke and fracture were correlated with poorer function; therefore, we hypothesize that prevention of stroke and fracture might improve functional status in the oldest-old.",

        "abstract": "Background. Observational studies have demonstrated similarities between the underpinning of frailty and biological features of centenarians, suggesting that adaptability to age-related multiple physiological decline may be a core component of successful aging. The aim of this study is to determine whether hormonal pathways potentially involved in energy homeostasis contribute to survival beyond 100 years of age. Methods. We assessed a total of 252 centenarians (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age, 101.5 (1.8) years, range 100\u2013 108 years) using a complete set of biomarkers of adipose endocrine function and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis. Conventional risk factors at baseline were also assessed. The participants were followed up for all-cause mortality every 12 months by telephone contact. Results. During 2253 days of follow-up, 208 centenarians (82.5%) died. The lowest tertile of leptin and the highest tertile of tumor necrosis factor-a were associated with higher mortality risk among centenarians after adjusting for age (per 6-month increase), sex, education, smoking, activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive function, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14\u20132.35; and HR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.00\u20132.08, respectively). The lowest tertiles of both IGF-1 and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) were also associated with increased mortality. The adipose risk score, indicating cumulative effects of adipokine dysregulation, was strongly associated with increased mortality risk; ADL; cognitive function; and levels of albumin, cholinesterase, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and IGF-1 at baseline. Conclusions. The results suggested that preservation of adipose endocrine function and the IGF-1 axis may be potentially important for maintaining health and function and promoting survival at an extremely old age.",

        "abstract": "Aging process is accompanied by hormonal changes characterized by an imbalance between catabolic hormones that remain stable and anabolic hormones (testosterone, insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), that decrease with age. Despite the multiple hormonal dysregulation occurring with age, the prevalent line of research in the last decades has tried to explain many age-related phenomena as consequence of one single hormonal derangement with disappointing results. In this review we will list the relationship between hormonal anabolic deficiency and frailty and mortality in older population, providing evidence to the notion that multiple hormonal dysregulation rather than change in single anabolic hormone is a powerful marker of poor health status and mortality.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nFrailty, a syndrome of multiple morbidity, weakness, and immobility in aging, is an increasingly urgent threat to public health. Single measures of low serum androgen have been associated with frailty in men, but the contributory role of hormonal changes with time is unassessed.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the study was to examine, using longitudinal measurements, the relations of serum androgens, estrogens, gonadotropins, and SHBG to the prevalence and progression of frailty in older men.\n\n\nDESIGN\nConcord Health and Ageing in Men Project is an observational cohort study of 1705 men (aged 70 yr or older) living in the suburb of Concord, Sydney, Australia. Measurements were obtained at baseline (2005-2007) and 2-yr follow-up (2007-2009). Testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and estrone were obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, whereas SHBG, LH, and FSH were measured by immunoassay.\n\n\nSETTING\nSubjects from the general community were sampled.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 1645 subjects constituting a representative sample of community-dwelling men aged 70 yr old or older participated in the study.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nThe frailty syndrome was measured according to the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) indices.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAndrogens and estrogens showed significant age-adjusted associations with concurrent frailty. Subjects in the lowest T quintile had 2.2-fold odds of exhibiting greater CHS frailty as compared with the highest T quintile (P < 0.001); results for dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, estrone, and calculated free T were similar, and were unchanged when the SOF frailty index was substituted for the CHS frailty index. A 1 sd, 2-yr decrease in T, calculated free T, or LH was associated with a 1.2- to 1.3-fold increase in the odds of progression (increase in severity) of frailty. The control for comorbid medical conditions did not affect results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAge-related changes in blood androgens and estrogens may contribute to the development or progression of frailty in men.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of IGF-1 levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods All patients with first-ever AIS from August 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013 were recruited to participate in the study. Clinical data were collected. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was assessed on admission blinded to serum IGF-1 levels. For the assessment of functional outcome at 90 days Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used. On admission, serum IGF-1 levels were determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The influence of IGF-1 levels on functional outcome and death was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Patients with an unfavorable outcomes and non-survivors had significantly decreased serum IGF-1 levels on admission (P<0.0001 for both).

        "abstract": "Introduction IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) is a hormone involved in cell growth and other important processes. In the kidney, IGF-1 has a stimulating effect, increasing the blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Although many experimental animal studies regarding the role of IGF-1 in the kidney have been conducted, few human studies are available in the literature. Obesity is a cause of renal failure, and several glomerular lesions associated with obesity have been described. However, no studies regarding the levels of IGF-1 in morbidly obese patients with renal injury associated with obesity have been conducted. Aim To determine the serum IGF-1 concentrations in morbidly obese patients with normal renal function but with different types of early obesity-related glomerular lesions and to evaluate the possible relationship between IGF-1 and the presence of renal lesions. Methods Eighty morbidly obese patients with renal biopsy, including 11 patients with no evidence of renal lesion, 17 patients with single glomerulomegaly, 21 patients with single podocyte hypertrophy, 10 patients with glomerulomegaly and podocyte hypertrophy, 5 patients with focal segmental hyalinosis, and 16 patients with increased mesangial matrix and/or mesangial proliferation, participated in this study. Biological parameters, including serum IGF-1 concentrations with the standard deviation score for age (SDS-IGF-1), were determined for all patients. Results Eighty patients (50 women and 30 men) with a mean BMI of 52.63 \u00b1 8.71 and a mean age of 42.40 \u00b1 9.45 years were included in this study. IGF-1, IGF-1 SDS and IGF-1BP3 levels according to the renal injury were compared (normal glomeruli: IGF-1 = 190.17 \u00b1 72.46; glomerulomegaly: IGF-1 = 122.3 \u00b1 50.05; podocyte hypertrophy: IGF-1 = 119.81 \u00b1 60.34; focal segmental hyalinosis: IGF-1 170.98 \u00b1 100.83, increased mesangial matrix and/or mesangial proliferation: IGF-1 117.73 \u00b1 63.87). Statistically significant differences were observed between serum levels of IGF-1 and between the levels of SDS-IGF-1 by comparing the group without glomerular lesion with the group formed by patients with any type of glomerular injury. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with the dependent variable defined as the glomerular injury. In the multivariate analysis, only SDS-IGF-1 was associated with glomerular injury, and low levels of IGF-1 SDS were a risk factor for kidney injury. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that low IGF-1 serum levels are associated with renal lesions in morbidly obese patients without overt clinical renal manifestations.",
