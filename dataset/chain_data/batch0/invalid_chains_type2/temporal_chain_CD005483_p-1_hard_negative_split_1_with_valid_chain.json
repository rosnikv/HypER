        "title": "Effect of nandrolone decanoate therapy on weight and lean body mass in HIV-infected women with weight loss: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWeight loss is associated with accelerated mortality and disease progression in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although studies have examined a variety of anabolic therapies in HIV-infected men, the safety and efficacy of such treatments in women have not been adequately studied.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase I/II study, 38 HIV-infected women with documented weight loss of 5% or greater in the preceding year or a body mass index of less than 20 kg/m(2) were randomized to receive nandrolone decanoate (100 mg) or an equivalent volume of placebo every other week by intramuscular injection. Subjects received blinded treatment for 12 weeks, followed by open-label therapy for 12 weeks. Lean body mass and fat (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and weight were measured at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Biochemical assessments of safety (hematologic analyses, liver function tests, and sex hormone measurements) were performed at these same time points. Clinical signs and symptoms were monitored biweekly.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects randomized to receive nandrolone had significant increases in weight and lean body mass during blinded treatment (4.6 kg [9.0%] and 3.5 kg [8.6%], respectively; P<.001 vs baseline and placebo in each case). Fat mass did not change statistically significantly in either group. Although there were no statistically significant differences between groups in biochemical measures, the number of grade 3 or greater toxicities, or reports of virilizing effects, a full assessment of safety cannot be made in a trial of this size.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNandrolone decanoate therapy may prove to be generally safe and beneficial in reversing weight loss and lean tissue loss in women with HIV infection and other chronic catabolic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxandrolone in promoting body weight and body cell mass (BCM) gain in HIV-associated weight loss. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred sixty-two HIV-infected men with documented 10% to 20% weight loss or body mass index \u226420 kg/m2 were randomized to placebo or to 20, 40, or 80 mg of oxandrolone daily. After 12 weeks, subjects were allowed to receive open-label oxandrolone at a dose of 20 mg for another 12 weeks. Results: Body weight increased in all groups, including the group receiving placebo, during the double-blind phase (1.1 \u00b1 2.7, 1.8 \u00b1 3.9, 2.8 \u00b1 3.3, and 2.3 \u00b1 2.9 kg in placebo and 20-, 40-, and 80-mg oxandrolone groups, respectively; all P < 0.014 vs. baseline). BCM increased from baseline in all groups (0.45 \u00b1 1.7, 0.91 \u00b1 2.2, 1.5 \u00b1 2.5, and 1.8 \u00b1 1.8 kg in placebo and 20-, 40-, and 80-mg oxandrolone groups, respectively). At 12 weeks, only the gain in weight at the 40-mg dose of oxandrolone and the gain in BCM at the 40- and 80-mg doses of oxandrolone were greater than those in the placebo group, however. Oxandrolone treatment was associated with significant suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and total and free testosterone levels. Treatment was generally well tolerated but accompanied by significant increases in transaminases and low-density lipoprotein as well as decreases in high-density lipoprotein. Conclusion: Oxandrolone administration is effective in promoting dose-dependent gains in body weight and BCM in HIV-infected men with weight loss.",

        "title": "Low sex hormone-binding globulin and testosterone levels in association with erectile dysfunction among human immunodeficiency virus-infected men receiving testosterone and oxandrolone.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nMen with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) wasting and hypogonadism are frequently treated with testosterone and oxandrolone, an orally administered anabolic-androgenic steroid hormone. We observed reductions in testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, in association with complaints of erectile dysfunction, after prolonged exposure to this therapeutic regimen.\n\n\nAIM\nFirst description of an association between long-term receipt of oxandrolone with erectile dysfunction, low SHBG and testosterone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCase report of three human immunodeficiency virus-infected hypogonadal male patients receiving treatment for wasting syndrome and hypogonadism, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. All three patients received long-term oxandrolone in addition to testosterone replacement therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTestosterone and SHBG levels for patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively: total testosterone 183, 71, and 151 ng/dL (260-1,000 ng/dL); free testosterone (not done for patient 3) 58.3 and 26.9 pg/mL (50-210 pg/mL); SHBG 6, 9, and 6 nmol/L (7-50 nmol/L). No other hormonal abnormalities were detected. Following discontinuation of oxandrolone, levels of total testosterone rose, consistent with increase in SHBG. One patient received repeat SHBG assay documenting rise in SHBG level. Patient 2 reported return of libido and early morning erections several weeks after discontinuation of oxandrolone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients had erectile dysfunction in association with low testosterone and SHBG, in spite of exogenous testosterone replacement. Discontinuation of oxandrolone led to the normalization or improvement of testosterone levels in all three patients with symptomatic improvement in one patient. First pass metabolism of orally administered oxandrolone may decrease hepatic synthesis of SHBG, allowing exogenously supplied testosterone to be excreted. Further work is necessary to elucidate the relationship.",

        "title": "Erectile dysfunction after plaque incision and grafting: short-term assessment of incidence and predictors.",
        "abstract": "We have read the article by Flores et al. entitled \u201cErectile Dysfunction after plaque incision and grafting: short-term assessment of incidence and predictors\u201d with great interest and appreciate the work of the authors [1]. They have tried to determine the incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) after plaque incision and grafting (PIG) surgery and to define predictors of ED development postoperatively. They have used both cadaveric pericardium (Tutoplast, Coloplast, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or intestinal submucosa (SIS) as the grafting material and divided the patients into two groups. The authors have concluded that almost half of men had significant reduction in their erectile rigidity after PIG and stated that this was predicted by larger baseline curvature, the Egydio plaque incision technique, older age and the presence of venous leak at baseline; and discouraged older males with a presence of venous leak at baseline and profound curvature from considering PIG surgery. We would like to make some comments about two issues. According to our experience, and as confirmed by previously published literature, severe reduction in blood flow or severe venoocclusive ED is one of the most important complications and preoperative drawbacks for grafting surgery for curvatures because of Peyronie\u2019s disease (PD) and should be considered for prosthetic surgery [2]. Flores et al. [1] contend that about 50% of their patients had cavernosal insufficiency and 21% had venous leak; 34% necessitating phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and 30% intracavernous injections to achieve penetration hardness preoperatively. These are the major risk factors for ED postoperatively that are among the exclusion criteria for grafting surgery in the literature [3]. Perhaps we would reconsider our practice if the authors made some comments about why they operated (PIG) on such high-risk patients and concluded that they will not advise grafting surgery for this group of patients while this is already known as a valid risk factor. Second, although we put strict criteria in our practice before grafting surgery about the erectile function (EF) of the patient (having no arterial or venous problems with no need for medical help for erection), we recommend PDE5 inhibitors or intracavernosal rehabilitation postoperatively to maintain and reinforce night and day erections [4], particularly to maintain EF and second to inhibit graft shrinkage. We use dermal grafts for cost effectiveness and convenience reasons. More or less every graft material to date has given similar results, and no material has proved to be superior to others [5].",

During initial consultation, a detailed sexual questionnaire was administered, which included a question on whether or not PD negatively impacted the current sexual relationship. More than half (146/242; 60.3%) of patients reported that PD negatively impacted their sexual relationship. On multivariate analysis, penile shortening, partner pain with intercourse, and shorter relationship duration were associated with a negative relationship effect. We did not identify significant differences in negative relationship effects based on objective physical examination findings including penile curvature, calcification, hourglass deformity, or penile length.",

        "abstract": "Background Limited data are available on how partners of men with Peyronie\u2019s disease (PD) are affected by the disease. We sought to characterize PD patients whose curvatures result in pain for their partners during penetrative intercourse. Methods We queried a database of all men undergoing initial evaluation for PD at a single clinic between March 2014 and June 2016. Patients were administered a questionnaire regarding sexual health concerns with domains including erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, libido, and penile curvature. In the penile curvature section, patients were specifically asked: \u201cDoes the curvature cause your partner any pain during penetrative intercourse? (Y/N).\u201d Patients\u2019 partners were not directly evaluated for conditions associated with dyspareunia. Additionally, patients interested in treatment for PD underwent objective curve assessment after intracavernosal injection of erectogenic medications along with penile duplex Doppler ultrasound. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differences in clinicopathologic variables and patient-responses to questionnaire prompts between patients who did and did not report partner pain with intercourse. Results A total of 322 patients with information available on partner pain were included in the study. Patients who reported partner pain had significantly higher subjective erectile rigidity (mean 5.9/10 vs. 4.8/10, P=0.02) and patient-reported penile curvature (47.7\u00b0 vs. 33.3\u00b0, P<0.001) compared to those who did not report pain. Ventral curvatures were more common in men with partner pain (21% vs. 9% of men without, P<0.05). Furthermore, patients complaining of partner pain were more likely to report that PD had a negative impact on relationships and were more interested in pursuing surgical corrections. Conclusions Men with superior erectile function, higher degrees of penile curvature and ventral curvatures were more likely to report partner pain during penetrative intercourse. These specific disease characteristics reported in this series may assist clinicians in identifying men who are more motivated to select more invasive therapies.",
