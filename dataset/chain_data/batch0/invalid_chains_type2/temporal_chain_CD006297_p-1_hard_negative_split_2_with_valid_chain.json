        "title": "New developments in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",
        "abstract": "Treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus has made tremendous advances within the last decades. With concern to insulin delivery there are two promising new approaches. One is the intrapulmonary insulin delivery which has become feasible by the development of new inhalation devices which provide a sufficient degree of intrapulmonary drug retention. Also oral insulin delivery seems feasible when surface active substances are used to cross the mucosal membrane in the gut. Clinical research has also focussed on coatings for the insulin molecules to solve the problem raised by the proteolytic activity of the digestive system. A very new agent produced by a fungus called Pseudomassaria has been demonstrated to reverse the clinical signs of diabetes mellitus in mice. The compound diffuses through the cell membrane, binds to the inner part of the insulin receptor and activates the insulin typical biological effects. Nowadays a variety of insulin analogs are designed and tested for their clinical use. By shifting the isoelectric point towards to a slightly acidic pH, HOE 901 precipitates at physiologic pH resulting in a constant and peakless insulin delivery. NN 304 is a 14-carbon aliphatic fatty acid acylated analog that binds to serum albumin resulting in a flatter time-action profile than NPH insulin. Also rapid acting insulin analogs are or will be launched in the near future aiming to ensure an improved postprandial glucose regulation. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) improves metabolic control by a variety of effects, e.g. the enhancement of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. Moreover, GLP-1 reduces food and water intake controlled by the brain, and inhibits gastric emptying. A disadvantage of GLP-1 is its very short half-life. Novel derivatives with the beneficial effects of GLP-1 but a better resistance against degradation have been designed. In addition substances have been developed inhibiting GLP-1 degradation or augmenting GLP-1 release from its abundant endogenous pool. Finally, there is a variety of interesting approaches aiming to improve or ease blood glucose self-monitoring. One is the development of subcutaneous catheters for continuous blood glucose control. In another system reverse iontophoresis is used for sampling interstitial fluid which reflects capillary blood glucose levels. Instead of using an electric current, a brandnew system creates micropores in the skin by a laser ablation system. Through these micropores a specific device performs a mild suction to obtain intersitial fluid. Further systems which measure blood glucose by near infrared spectroscopy are still investigated in order to improve their technical function and to reduce their weight. This article intends to give an overview over the new developments in the treatment and management of type-1-diabetes mellitus.",

        "abstract": "This article deals with the modification of medicinally important psyllium polysaccharide with acrylamide through radiation crosslinked polymerisation for the design of double potential hydrogels meant for slow release of insulin. Here the double potential is due to the inherent blood sugar lowering ability of psyllium and release of insulin in controlled manner from the drug loaded hydrogels. Synthesis of hydrogels and their characterisation by scanning electron micrography (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and swelling studies have been discussed. The release dynamics of model drug insulin from the hydrogels has been studied for the evaluation of the release mechanism. The release of the drug from the hydrogels occurred through non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. \n \n \n \nCet article traite de la modification du psyllium polysaccharide d'une importance therapeutique avec l'acrylamide par la reticulation sous rayonnement pour la conception d'hydrogels a potentiel double pour la liberation lente de l'insuline.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Present study deals with development of polymeric systems for rabeprazole sodium to accomplish a lingering therapeutic outcome. Carboxymethyl arabinoxylan exhibited variety of ideal characteristics for polymeric drug carrier. Free radical polymerization was successfully employed to prepare pH responsive polymeric network of carboxymethyl arabinoxylan with acrylic acid. FTIR, SEM, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction verified the graft copolymerization. Graft copolymers revealed highly pH responsive swelling, consequently drug release at intestinal pH.

        "title": "Formulation, In Vitro Evaluation, and Toxicity Studies of A. vulgaris-co-AAm Carrier for Vildagliptin",
        "abstract": "This study investigated the use of Artemisia vulgaris L. seed mucilage as a new excipient for sustained delivery of Vildagliptin. Copolymeric carrier of A. vulgaris seed mucilage-co-AAm was devised by using acrylamide (AAm) as a monomer, methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA) as a crosslinker, and potassium persulfate (KPS) as an initiator through free radical polymerization. Different formulations of A. vulgaris-co-AAm were devised by varying contents of polymer, monomer, crosslinking agent, initiator, and reaction temperature. Copolymeric structures were characterized through XRD analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, TGA and DSC analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Porosity, gel fraction, and Vildagliptin loading capacity of copolymers were also established. Swelling and in vitro drug release studies were conducted. XRD evaluation showed the alteration of the crystalline structure of Vildagliptin into an amorphous form. FTIR analysis confirmed the successful grafting of AAm to A. vulgaris seed mucilage backbone. Porosity was increased with increasing polymer concentration and reaction temperature while it was decreased with an increasing amount of AAm, MBA, and KPS. Gel content was decreased with increasing polymer concentration and reaction temperature while it was increased with an increasing amount of AAm, MBA, and KPS. Acute oral toxicity of copolymeric network was done in animal models to evaluate the safety. Copolymers showed the same swelling behavior at all pH\u20091.2, 4.5, 6.8, and 7.4. Vildagliptin release from copolymer showed a cumulative trend by increasing polymer content and reaction temperature, while a declining trend was observed with increasing contents of monomer, crosslinking agent, and initiator. Sustained release of Vildagliptin was observed from copolymers and release followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. From the acute oral toxicity studies, it is evident that newly synthesized copolymeric carriers are potentially safe for eyes, skin, and vital organs.",

        "title": "Formulation of pH-responsive highly swellable hydrogel scaffolds for controlled release of tramadol HCl: characterization and biocompatibility evaluation",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The objective of current project was to formulate a system for controlled delivery of Tramadol HCl (TRD), an opioid analgesic used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Methods: For this purpose, a pH responsive AvT-co-poly hydrogel network was formulated through free radical polymerization by incorporating natural polymers i.e., aloe vera gel and tamarind gum, monomer and crosslinker. Formulated hydrogels were loaded with Tramadol HCl (TRD) and evaluated for percent drug loading, sol-gel fraction, dynamic and equilibrium swelling, morphological characteristics, structural features and in-vitro release of Tramadol HCl. Results and Discussions: Hydrogels were proved to be pH sensitive as remarkable dynamic swelling response ranging within 2.94g/g-10.81g/g was noticed at pH 7.4 as compared to pH 1.2. Percent drug loading was in the range of 70.28%-90.64% for all formulations. Thermal stability and compatibility of hydrogel components were validated by DSC analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. Controlled release pattern of Tramadol HCl from the polymeric network was confirmed as maximum release of 92.22% was observed for over a period of 24 hours at pH 7.4. Moreover, oral toxicity studies were also conducted in rabbits to investigate the safety of hydrogels. No evidence of any toxicity, lesions and degeneration was reported, confirming the biocompatibility and safety of grafted system.",
