        "title": "[Mechanism of action of hyaluronic acid in gonarthrosis of both knee joints in a right/left comparison. Study with dynamometry, oxygen partial pressure, temperature and Lequesne score].",
        "abstract": "In a controlled prospective randomized study we evaluated the effectiveness of intraarticular injected hyaluronic acid regarding the changes in the parameters dynamometry, synovial oxygen partial pressure, intraarticular temperature and the knee joint function (Lequesne score). We examined 18 patients with osteoarthritis in both knee joints (Kellgren classification II or III according to x-ray) in right/left comparison. The evaluated parameters were measured before and after a 5-week treatment phase with 5 intraarticular injections (one injection per week). With regard to the efficacy results changes in dynamometric measurement for flexion and extension (for all angular velocities) and Lequesne-score indicate a marked improvement after treatment with hyaluronic acid. The differences between treated and untreated knee were significant. In extension the p-value was 0.0008 and in flexion p = 0.0015. The p-value of the Lequesne-index between the verum and control group was p = 0.0002. After treatment values for oxygen pressure were higher than at baseline and for the intraarticular temperature a small decrease at the end of the treatment phase was documented. The intraarticular injection of hyaluronic acid is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with gonarthrosis. The treatment resulted in a functional improvement of the knee joint and had a good pain-lowering effect in patients suffering from gonarthrosis.",

        "title": "Comparison of two different molecular weight intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is an incurable joint disorder, representing a major public health issue. Among options for symptom control, viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid (HA) had established usefulness in pain and function improvement of the knee. However, it is not clear which form of HA yields better results.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nWe compared two HA preparations with high (HMW) or low molecular weight (LMW) in terms of pain control and function improvement using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the visual analog scale (VAS) score in patients with knee OA. During 2013, 80 patients were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, randomized study. Each patient received a weekly injection of either preparation with a total of five injections for the LMW group and three for the HMW group. They were evaluated at baseline, five weeks, three months and one year after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both groups, HA treatment resulted in significant improvement in pain and function that begun immediately after treatment and lasted for one year. However when compared with each other, HMW and LMW groups were comparable in mean WOMAC, and VAS score at each time point. Neither preparation can interrupt disease progression as radiological findings remained constant during follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntra-articular injections using HMW or LMW HA can improve stiffness, joint function and pain in patients suffering from knee OA. However, no clear benefit seems to exist between the two preparations and neither can slow disease progression. Hippokratia 2016, 20(1): 26-31.",

        "title": "An Effective Translation: The Development of Hyaluronan-Based Medical Products From the Physicochemical, and Preclinical Aspects",
        "abstract": "This review shows the steps toward material selection focalized on the design and development of medical devices based on hyaluronan (HA). The selection is based on chemical and mechanical properties, biocompatibility, sterilization, safety, and scale-up costs. These facts play a vital role in the industrialization process. Approved medical devices containing-HA are illustrated to identify key parameters. The first part of this work involves the steps toward a complete characterization of chemical and mechanical aspects, reproducibility of the processes and scale up. In a second stage, we aimed to describe the preclinical in vitro and in vivo assays and selected examples of clinical trials. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind the regulatory affairs during the research and development (R&D) using standardization (ISO standards) to achieve the main goal, which is the functionality and safety of the final device. To keep reproducible experimental data to prepare an efficient master file for the device, based on quality and recorded manufacturing data, and a rigorous R&D process may help toward clinical translation. A strong debate is still going on because the denominated basic research in HA field does not pay attention to the purity and quality of the raw materials used during the development. So that, to achieve the next generation of devices is needed to overcome the limitations of state of art in terms of efficacy, biodegradability, and non-toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Biofabrication is enriching the tissue engineering field with new ways of producing structurally organized complex tissues. Among the numerous bioinks under investigation, hyaluronic acid (HA) and its derivatives stand out for their biological relevance, cytocompatibility, shear-thinning properties, and potential to fine-tune the desired properties with chemical modification. In this paper, we review the recent advances on bioinks containing HA. The available literature is presented based on subjects including the rheological properties in connection with printability, the chemical strategies for endowing HA with the desired properties, the clinical application, the most advanced preclinical studies, the advantages and limitations in comparison with similar biopolymer-based bioinks, and future perspectives.",

        "title": "Tunable metacrylated hyaluronic acid-based hybrid bioinks for stereolithography 3D bioprinting",
        "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid is a native extra-cellular matrix derivative that promises unique properties, such as anti-inflammatory response and cell-signaling with tissue-specific applications under its bioactive properties. Here, we investigate the importance of the duration of synthesis to obtain photocrosslinkable methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) with high degree of substitution. MeHA with high degree of substitution can result in rapid photocrosslinking and can be used as a bioink for stereolithographic (SLA) three dimensional 3D bioprinting. Increased degree of substitution results Our findings show that a ten-day synthesis results in an 88% degree of methacrylation (DM), whereas three-day and five-day syntheses result in 32% and 42% DM, respectively. The rheological characterization revealed an increased rate of photopolymerization with increasing DM. Further, we developed a hybrid bioink to overcome the non-cell-adhesive nature of MeHA by combining it with gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to fabricate 3D cell-laden hydrogel scaffolds. The hybrid bioink exhibited a 55% enhancement in stiffness compared to MeHA only and enabled cell-adhesion while maintaining high cell viability. Investigations also revealed that the hybrid bioink was a more suitable candidate for stereolithography (SLA) 3D bioprinting than MeHA because of its mechanical strength, printability, and cell-adhesive nature. This research lays out a firm foundation for the development of a stable hybrid bioink with MeHA and GelMA for first-ever use with SLA 3D bioprinting.",

        "abstract": "The development of biomaterials tailored for various tissue engineering applications has been increasingly researched in recent years; however, stimulating cells to synthesise the extracellular matrix (ECM) is still a significant challenge. In this study, we investigate the use of ECM-like hydrogel materials composed of Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG), such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS), to provide a biomimetic environment for tissue repair. These hydrogels are fully characterised in terms of physico-chemical properties, including compression, swelling behaviour, rheological behaviour and via 3D printing trials. Furthermore, porous scaffolds were developed through freeze drying, producing a scaffold morphology that better promotes cell proliferation, as shown by in vitro analysis with fibroblast cells. We show that after cell seeding, freeze-dried hydrogels resulted in significantly greater amounts of DNA by day 7 compared to the GelMA hydrogel. Furthermore, freeze-dried constructs containing HA or HA/CS were found to have a significantly higher metabolic activity than GelMA alone.",
