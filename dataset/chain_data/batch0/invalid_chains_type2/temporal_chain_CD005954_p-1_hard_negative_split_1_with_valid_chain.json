        "title": "The effects of vigorous exercise training on physical function in children with arthritis: a randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the effectiveness of high-intensity aerobic training compared with low-intensity training in terms of energy cost of locomotion, peak oxygen uptake, peak power, and self-reported physical function in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty children with JIA, ages 8-16 years, were enrolled in a randomized, single-blind controlled trial. Both groups participated in a 12-week, 3-times-weekly training program consisting of high-intensity aerobics in the experimental group and qigong in the control group. Subjects underwent exercise testing measuring submaximal oxygen uptake at 3 km/hour (VO(2submax)) as the primary outcome, maximal oxygen uptake, and peak power at the beginning and end of the program. Physical function was measured using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe exercise program was well tolerated in both groups. There was no difference in VO(2submax) or any other exercise testing measures between the groups through the study period and no indication of improvement. Both groups showed significant improvements in C-HAQ with no difference between the groups. Adherence was higher in the control group than the experimental group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings suggest that activity programs with or without an aerobic training component are safe and may result in an important improvement in physical function. The intensity of aerobic training did not seem to provide any additional benefits, but higher adherence in the qigong program may suggest that less intensive regimens are easier for children with JIA to comply with, and provide a degree of benefit equivalent to more intensive programs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExercise therapy is considered an important component of the treatment of arthritis. The efficacy of exercise therapy has been reviewed in adults with rheumatoid arthritis but not in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of exercise therapy on functional ability, quality of life and aerobic capacity in children with JIA.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2007), EMBASE (January 1966 to October 2007), PEDro (January 1966 to October 2007), SportDiscus (January 1966 to October 2007), Google Scholar (to October 2007), AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine) (January 1985 to October 2007), Health Technologies Assessment database (January 1988 to October 2007), ISI Web Science Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (January 1966 to October 2007) and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website (http://www.cps.uk.org) were searched and references tracked.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise treatment in JIA.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nPotentially relevant references were evaluated and all data were extracted by two review authors working independently.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThree out of 16 identified studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 212 participants. All the included studies fulfilled at least seven of 10 methodological criteria. The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08), quality of life (CHQ-PhS: n = 115; WMD -3.96, 95% CI -8.91 to 1.00) and aerobic capacity (n = 124; WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.19). The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant. None of the studies reported negative effects of the exercise therapy.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nOverall, based on 'silver-level' evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy can improve functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity or pain. The low number of available RCTs limits the generalisability. The included and excluded studies were all consistent about the adverse effects of exercise therapy; no short-term detrimental effects of exercise therapy were found in any study. Both included and excluded studies showed that exercise does not exacerbate arthritis. The large heterogeneity in outcome measures, as seen in this review, emphasises the need for a standardised assessment or a core set of functional and physical outcome measurements suited for health research to generate evidence about the possible benefits of exercise therapy for patients with JIA. Although the short-term effects look promising, the long-term effect of exercise therapy remains unclear.",

        "explanation": "This systematic review assesses the effects of exercise therapy on functional ability, quality of life, and aerobic capacity in children with JIA. The review's focus on exercise therapy in JIA makes it partially dependent on the source paper's hypothesis that exercise training can improve physical function in children with arthritis. However, the review's findings suggest that the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise therapy in JIA is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits."

        "abstract": "AIM\nSince 2007 we have been focusing our attention to EJPRM as the best available clinical evidence as offered by the Cochrane Collaboration. Due to the absence of a specific Rehabilitation Group (only a Field does exist), some reviews in the field of PRM are not easy to find. Consequently, the EJPRM lists and presents all these reviews systematically. The aim of the present paper is to systematically review all the new papers in the field of rehabilitation published in the 3rd Issue of 2009 from the Cochrane Library in order to provide physicians a summary of the best updated evidence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors systematically searched all the new papers of on rehabilitation from the 3rd Issue 2009 of the Cochrane Library. The retrieved papers have been divided in subgroups on the base of theirs topic and the Cochrane Groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of included papers was 18, 14 of them being new reviews, 7 new reviews dealing with neurological rehabilitation, 4 dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, 3 dealing with pain management. In addition, 4 reviews have been updated, 1 in the field of musculoskeletal disorders, 2 on neuromuscular disorders, and 1 on elderly rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Library are two important instruments to improve evidence-based medicine (EBM) in medical practice and in the field of rehabilitation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present paper can help rehabilitation specialists to retrieve the findings of the most relevant and updated reviews in order to better their clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSince 2007 we focused our attention as EJPRM to the best available clinical evidence offered by the Cochrane Collaboration. Due to the absence of a specific Rehabilitation Group (only a field exists), reviews of PRM interest are in different groups and not easy to find. Consequently, the EJPRM lists and presents all these reviews systematically.\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim of the present paper is to systematically review all the new rehabilitation papers published in the Cochrane Library 4th Issue 2009 in order to provide to physicians involved in the field a summary of the best evidence nowadays available.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe author systematically searched all the new papers of rehabilitative interest in the Cochrane Library 4th Issue 2009. The retrieved papers have been divided in subgroups on the base of the topic and the Cochrane Groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of included papers was 19: 11 were new reviews. Three new reviews deal with neurological rehabilitation, 6 with musculoskeletal disorders, 3 with pain management. Moreover, 8 reviews have been updated: 4 related to musculoskeletal disorders, 2 to neurological disorders, and 1 to respiratory rehabilitation. All these are listed at the end of the paper.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Cochrane Collaboration and its product, the Cochrane Library, are really relevant instruments to improve EBM in medical practice and thus also in the Rehabilitation Field. The present paper can help Rehabilitation Specialists to easily retrieve the conclusions of the most relevant and updated reviews in order to change their clinical practice in a more rapid and effective way.",
