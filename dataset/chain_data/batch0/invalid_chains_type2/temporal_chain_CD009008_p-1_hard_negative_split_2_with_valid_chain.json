        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is a novel combination of insulin degludec (IDeg) and liraglutide. This trial investigated the contribution of the liraglutide component of IDegLira versus IDeg alone on efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a 26-week, double-blind trial, patients with type 2 diabetes (A1C 7.5\u201310.0% [58\u201386 mmol/mol]) on basal insulin (20\u201340 units) and metformin with or without sulfonylurea/glinides were randomized (1:1) to once-daily IDegLira + metformin or IDeg + metformin with titration aiming for fasting plasma glucose between 4 and 5 mmol/L. Maximum allowed doses were 50 dose steps (equal to 50 units IDeg plus 1.8 mg liraglutide) and 50 units for IDeg. The primary end point was change in A1C from baseline. RESULTS A total of 413 patients were randomized (mean A1C 8.8% [73 mmol/mol]; BMI 33.7 kg/m2). IDeg dose, alone or as part of IDegLira, was equivalent (45 units). A1C decreased by 1.9% (21 mmol/mol) with IDegLira and by 0.9% (10 mmol/mol) with IDeg (estimated treatment difference \u22121.1% [95% CI \u22121.3, \u22120.8], \u221212 mmol/mol [95% CI \u221214, \u22129; P < 0.0001). Mean weight reduction with IDegLira was 2.7 kg vs. no weight change with IDeg, P < 0.0001. Hypoglycemia incidence was comparable (24% for IDegLira vs. 25% for IDeg). Overall adverse events were similar, and incidence of nausea was low in both groups (IDegLira 6.5% vs. IDeg 3.5%). CONCLUSIONS IDegLira achieved glycemic control superior to that of IDeg at equivalent insulin doses without higher risk of hypoglycemia and with the benefit of weight loss. These findings establish the efficacy and safety of IDegLira and the distinct contribution of the liraglutide component.",

We assessed the efficacy and safety of initiating insulin degludec/liraglutide fixed-ratio combination (IDegLira) versus basal-bolus insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A phase 3b trial examined patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on insulin glargine (IGlar U100) 20\u201350 units/day and metformin, randomized to IDegLira or IGlar U100 and insulin aspart \u22644 times per day. RESULTS Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased from 8.2% (66 mmol/mol) to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) with IDegLira and from 8.2% (67 mmol/mol) to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) with basal-bolus (estimated treatment difference [ETD] \u22120.02% [95% CI \u22120.16, 0.12]; \u22120.2 mmol/mol [95% CI \u22121.7, 1.3]), confirming IDegLira noninferiority versus basal-bolus (P < 0.0001). The number of severe or blood glucose\u2013confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia events was lower with IDegLira versus basal-bolus (risk ratio 0.39 [95% CI 0.29, 0.51]; rate ratio 0.11 [95% CI 0.08, 0.17]). Body weight decreased with IDegLira and increased with basal-bolus (ETD \u22123.6 kg [95% CI \u22124.2, \u22122.9]). Fasting plasma glucose reductions were similar; lunch, dinner, and bedtime self-monitored plasma glucose measurements were significantly lower with basal-bolus. Sixty-six percent of patients on IDegLira vs. 67.0% on basal-bolus achieved HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Total daily insulin dose was lower with IDegLira (40 units) than basal-bolus (84 units total; 52 units basal). CONCLUSIONS In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on IGlar U100 and metformin, IDegLira treatment elicited HbA1c reductions comparable to basal-bolus, with statistically superior lower hypoglycemia rates and weight loss versus weight gain.",

        "abstract": "Missing data due to loss to follow\u2010up or intercurrent events are unintended, but unfortunately inevitable in clinical trials. Since the true values of missing data are never known, it is necessary to assess the impact of untestable and unavoidable assumptions about any unobserved data in sensitivity analysis. This tutorial provides an overview of controlled multiple imputation (MI) techniques and a practical guide to their use for sensitivity analysis of trials with missing continuous outcome data. These include \u03b4\u2010 and reference\u2010based MI procedures. In \u03b4\u2010based imputation, an offset term, \u03b4, is typically added to the expected value of the missing data to assess the impact of unobserved participants having a worse or better response than those observed. Reference\u2010based imputation draws imputed values with some reference to observed data in other groups of the trial, typically in other treatment arms. We illustrate the accessibility of these methods using data from a pediatric eczema trial and a chronic headache trial and provide Stata code to facilitate adoption. We discuss issues surrounding the choice of \u03b4 in \u03b4\u2010based sensitivity analysis. We also review the debate on variance estimation within reference\u2010based analysis and justify the use of Rubin's variance estimator in this setting, since as we further elaborate on within, it provides information anchored inference.",

        "title": "A Comparison of Estimand and Estimation Strategies for Clinical Trials in Early Parkinson\u2019s Disease",
        "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder. PD cannot be prevented, slowed, or cured as of today but highly effective symptomatic treatments are available. We consider relevant estimands and treatment effect estimators for randomized trials of a novel treatment which aims to slow down disease progression versus placebo in early, untreated PD. A commonly used endpoint in PD trials is the MDS-Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), which is longitudinally assessed at scheduled visits. The most important intercurrent events (ICEs) which affect the interpretation of the MDS-UPDRS are study treatment discontinuation and initiation of symptomatic treatment. Different estimand strategies are discussed; Hypothetical or treatment policy strategies, respectively, for different types of ICEs seem most appropriate in this context. Several estimators based on multiple imputation which target these estimands are proposed and compared in terms of bias, mean-squared error, and power in a simulation study. The investigated estimators include methods based on a missing-at-random (MAR) assumption, with and without the inclusion of time-varying ICE-indicators, as well as reference-based imputation methods. Simulation parameters are motivated by data analyses of a cohort study from the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).",

        "abstract": "Many randomized controlled clinical trials compare a continuous outcome variable that is assessed longitudinally at scheduled follow-up visits between subjects assigned to a intervention treatment group and those assigned to a control group. Missing outcome measurements may occur because subjects miss an assessment or drop out from the trial altogether. Moreover, intercurrent events (ICEs) such as discontinuations of the assigned treatment or initiations of rescue medications may affect the interpretation or the existence of the outcome measurements associated with the clinical question of interest. The ICH E9(R1) addendum on estimands, a regulatory document published by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, presents a structured framework to link trial objectives to a precise description of the targeted treatment effect in the presence of ICEs and missing data (ICH E9 working group, 2019).",
