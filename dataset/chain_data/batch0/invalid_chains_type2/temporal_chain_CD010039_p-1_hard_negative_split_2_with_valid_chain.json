        "title": "Effects of skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract on frequency of gout flares: a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives Previous laboratory studies have identified two dairy fractions, glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract (G600), with anti-inflammatory effects in models of acute gout. The aim of this proof-of-concept clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that daily intake of skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with GMP and G600 can prevent gout flares. Methods This was a 3-month randomised double-blind controlled trial of milk products for prevention of gout flares. One hundred and twenty patients with recurrent gout flares were randomised to one of three arms: lactose powder control, SMP control and SMP enriched with GMP and G600 (SMP/GMP/G600). The primary end point was change in the frequency of gout flares using a daily flare diary measured monthly for 3 months. Results The frequency of gout flares reduced in all three groups over the 3-month study period compared with baseline. Over the 3-month study period there was a significantly greater reduction in gout flares in the SMP/GMP/G600 group (analysis of covariance pgroup=0.031, Tukey post hoc test compared with lactose control, p=0.044). Following treatment with SMP/GMP/G600 over the 3-month period, greater improvements were also observed in pain and fractional excretion of uric acid, with trends to greater improvement in tender joint count. Similar adverse event rates and discontinuation rates were observed between the three groups. Conclusions This is the first reported controlled trial of dietary intervention in patients with gout, and suggests that SMP enriched with GMP and G600 may reduce the frequency of gout flares.",

        "title": "2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout",
        "abstract": "Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

        "title": "New Perspectives in Rheumatology: Implications of the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities Trial and the Associated Food and Drug Administration Public Safety Alert",
        "abstract": "Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now\u2010published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all\u2010cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate\u2010lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long\u2010term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first\u2010line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first\u2010line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision\u2010making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between hyperuricemia, gout, and renal disease has been investigated for several years. From the beginning, kidney disease has been considered a complication of gout; however, the viewpoints changed, claiming that hypertension and elevated uric acid (UA) levels are caused by decreased urate excretion in patients with renal impairment. To date, several examples of evidence support the role of hyperuricemia in cardiovascular or renal diseases. Several mechanisms have been identified that explain the relationship between hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease, including the crystal effect, renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system activation, nitric oxide synthesis inhibition, and intracellular oxidative stress stimulation, and urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been proven to reduce renal disease progression in the past few years. In this comprehensive review, the source and physiology of UA are introduced, and the mechanisms that explain the reciprocal relationship between hyperuricemia and kidney disease are reviewed. Lastly, current evidence supporting the use of ULT to postpone renal disease progression in patients with hyperuricemia and gout are summarized.",

        "title": "Apigenin Ameliorates Hyperuricemia and Renal Injury through Regulation of Uric Acid Metabolism and JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway",
        "abstract": "Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a kind of metabolic disease with high incidence that still needs new countermeasures. Apigenin has uric-lowering and kidney-protective activities, but how apigenin attenuates HUA and renal injury remains largely unexploited. To this end, an acute HUA mouse model was established by intraperitoneal injection of potassium oxazinate and oral administration with hypoxanthine for 7 consecutive days. Apigenin intervention decreased serum uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-18 (IL-18), liver xanthine oxidase (XOD), and urine protein levels, and increased serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) and urine UA and CRE levels in HUA mice. Moreover, administration of apigenin to HUA mice prevented renal injury, decreased renal glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) and urate anion transporter 1 (URAT1) levels, and increased renal organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1). These alterations were associated with an inhibition of IL-6, phospho-janus kinase 2 (P-JAK2), phospho-signal transducer, and activator of transcription 3 (P-STAT3), and suppression of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression in the kidneys. Additionally, the molecular docking results showed that apigenin had strong binding capacity with UA transporters and JAK2 proteins. In summary, apigenin could improve UA metabolism and attenuate renal injury through inhibiting UA production, promoting excretion, and suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in HUA mice. The results suggest that apigenin may be a suitable drug candidate for management of HUA and its associated renal injury.",

        "title": "Emodin, a Natural Anthraquinone, Increases Uric Acid Excretion in Rats with Potassium Oxonate-Induced Hyperuricemia",
        "abstract": "The treatment of hyperuricemia and gout is mostly based on lowering serum uric acid levels using drugs, such as allopurinol, or increasing urinary excretion of uric acid. However, some patients still experience adverse reactions to allopurinol and turn to Chinese medicine as an alternative. Therefore, it is crucial to design a preclinical study to obtain more convincing data on the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout with Chinese medicine. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of emodin, a Chinese herbal extract, in a rat model of hyperuricemia and gout. In this study, we used 36 Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, which were randomly divided into six groups for experimentation. Hyperuricemia was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injections of potassium oxonate. The efficacy of emodin in reducing serum uric acid levels was demonstrated by comparing the positive control group with groups treated with three different concentrations of emodin. The inflammatory profiles, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels, were unaffected by emodin treatment. In the experimental results, it was observed that the serum uric acid concentration in the vehicle control group was 1.80 \u00b1 1.14, while the concentrations in the moderate and high concentration emodin groups were 1.18 \u00b1 0.23 and 1.12 \u00b1 0.57, resulting in no significant difference in uric acid concentration between these treatment groups and the control group, indicating that emodin has a therapeutic effect on hyperuricemia. The increase in the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) demonstrated that emodin promoted urinary uric acid excretion without significantly affecting the inflammatory profile. Thus, emodin reduced the serum uric acid concentration to achieve effective treatment of hyperuricemia and gout by increasing urinary excretion. These results were supported by the measured serum uric acid and FEUA levels. Our data have potential implications for the treatment of gout and other types of hyperuricemia in clinical practice.",
