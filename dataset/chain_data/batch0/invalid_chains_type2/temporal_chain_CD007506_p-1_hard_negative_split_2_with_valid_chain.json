        "title": "Low-frequency electroacupuncture and physical exercise decrease high muscle sympathetic nerve activity in polycystic ovary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "We have recently shown that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with high muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Animal studies support the concept that low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and physical exercise, via stimulation of ergoreceptors and somatic afferents in the muscles, may modulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of these interventions on sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. In a randomized controlled trial, 20 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to one of three groups: low-frequency EA (n = 9), physical exercise (n = 5), or untreated control (n = 6) during 16 wk. Direct recordings of multiunit efferent postganglionic MSNA in a muscle fascicle of the peroneal nerve before and following 16 wk of treatment. Biometric, hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic parameters were measured. Low-frequency EA (P = 0.036) and physical exercise (P = 0.030) decreased MSNA burst frequency compared with the untreated control group. The low-frequency EA group reduced sagittal diameter (P = 0.001), while the physical exercise group reduced body weight (P = 0.004) and body mass index (P = 0.004) compared with the untreated control group. Sagittal diameter was related to MSNA burst frequency (Rs = 0.58, P < 0.005) in the EA group. No correlation was found for body mass index and MSNA in the exercise group. There were no differences between the groups in hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic variables. For the first time we demonstrate that low-frequency EA and physical exercise lowers high sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. Thus, treatment with low-frequency EA or physical exercise with the aim to reduce MSNA may be of importance for women with PCOS.",

        "title": "Impact of electro-acupuncture and physical exercise on hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo/amenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries. We aimed to determine whether low-frequency electro-acupuncture (EA) would decrease hyperandrogenism and improve oligo/amenorrhea more effectively than physical exercise or no intervention. We randomized 84 women with PCOS, aged 18-37 yr, to 16 wk of low-frequency EA, physical exercise, or no intervention. The primary outcome measure changes in the concentration of total testosterone (T) at week 16 determined by gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was analyzed by intention to treat. Secondary outcome measures were changes in menstrual frequency; concentrations of androgens, estrogens, androgen precursors, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites; and acne and hirsutism. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 16 wk of intervention, and after a 16-wk follow-up. After 16 wk of intervention, circulating T decreased by -25%, androsterone glucuronide by -30%, and androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol-3-glucuronide by -28% in the EA group (P = 0.038, 0.030, and 0.047, respectively vs. exercise); menstrual frequency increased to 0.69/month from 0.28 at baseline in the EA group (P = 0.018 vs. exercise). After the 16-wk follow-up, the acne score decreased by -32% in the EA group (P = 0.006 vs. exercise). Both EA and exercise improved menstrual frequency and decreased the levels of several sex steroids at week 16 and at the 16-wk follow-up compared with no intervention. Low-frequency EA and physical exercise improved hyperandrogenism and menstrual frequency more effectively than no intervention in women with PCOS. Low-frequency EA was superior to physical exercise and may be useful for treating hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea.",

        "title": "The sympathetic nervous system in polycystic ovary syndrome: a novel therapeutic target?",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition associated with long\u2010term health risks, including type 2 diabetes and vascular dysfunction in addition to reproductive sequelae. Many of the common features of PCOS, such as central obesity, hyperinsulinaemia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), are associated with chronic sympathetic overactivity, suggesting that sympathoexcitation may be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. Rodent models of polycystic ovaries have shown that ovarian sympathetic outflow may be increased, accompanied by elevated intra\u2010ovarian synthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF) which may be involved in initiation of ovarian pathology. Patients with PCOS have evidence of increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), altered heart rate variability and attenuated heart rate recovery postexercise, compared with age\u2010 and BMI\u2010matched controls, suggesting a generalized increase in sympathetic nerve activity. Active weight loss can reduce MSNA and whole body noradrenaline spillover, whereas low\u2010frequency electroacupuncture decreased MSNA in overweight women with PCOS. Treatment of OSA with continuous positive airways pressure may reduce plasma noradrenaline levels and diastolic blood pressure and improve cardiac sympathovagal balance. Renal sympathetic denervation also reduced MSNA, noradrenaline spillover and blood pressure in two PCOS subjects with hypertension, accompanied by improved insulin sensitivity. The sympathetic nervous system may thus offer a new therapeutic target in PCOS but larger and longer\u2010term studies are needed before these treatments can be considered in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Whether or not blood pressure (BP) and heart function of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are altered remains unclear, albeit subtle abnormalities in the regulation of BP observed in these women might suggest a mild masculinization of their cardiovascular system. To study the influence of obesity and androgen excess on BP and echocardiographic profiles of women with the syndrome, we conducted a cross-sectional case\u2013control study comparing office and ambulatory BP monitoring, as well as echocardiographic assessments, in 63 premenopausal women with the classic phenotype, 33 nonhyperandrogenic women with regular menses, and 25 young men. Forty-nine subjects were lean and 72 had weight excess (body mass index \u226525 kg/m2). Participants had no previous history of hypertension and were nonsmokers. Men showed the highest BP readings, and the lowest readings were observed in control women, whereas women with PCOS had intermediate values. Undiagnosed hypertension was more common in subjects with weight excess irrespective of sex and hyperandrogenism. Women with PCOS and weight excess showed frequencies of previously undiagnosed hypertension that were similar to those of men with weight excess and higher than those observed in nonhyperandrogenic women. Lastly, male sex, weight excess and hypertension, the latter in men as well as in women with PCOS, increased left ventricular wall thickness. In summary, our results show that patients with classic PCOS and weight excess frequently have undiagnosed BP abnormalities, leading to target organ damage.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) seeking health care in the United States may be more obese and hyperandrogenic than those present in the general population. We aimed to assess the impact of referral bias on European women with functional androgen excess disorders.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied two groups of patients: i) 368 consecutive patients referred to our clinic for the study of functional hyperandrogenism (FH) (referral patients); ii) 57 consecutive premenopausal patients identified by screening during blood donation (unselected patients). We compared the anthropometric data from the groups of patients with those of two control populations: iii) a group of unselected premenopausal healthy female blood donors (unselected controls); and iv) data available from the local general premenopausal female population.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReferral patients with FH were more hirsute, had a higher percentage of hyperandrogenemia, and fulfilled PCOS criteria more frequently than unselected patients. The prevalence of obesity in unselected controls was similar to that observed in the general population, whereas referral patients and unselected patients were more frequently obese. The prevalence of obesity was also higher among referral patients compared to unselected patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReferral bias influences the phenotype of patients with FH. Patients studied at the clinical setting may show more severe hyperandrogenic and obese phenotypes than patients from the general population, even though PCOS appears to be associated with weight excess also in the general European population. This fact should be considered when establishing reference values and control populations for clinical and research purposes.",

        "title": "The impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on anthropometric characteristics , lipid , glucose and hormonal profile of PCOS patients : a systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Objective: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is encountered in 10\u201325% of women with PCOS. To date, it remains unclear whether this coexistence influences the severity of metabolic and hormonal profile of these patients. The purpose of our systematic review is to investigate this potential relation. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar databases together with reference lists from included studies. All prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies that investigated the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on hormonal and metabolic parameters of PCOS patients were included. The methodological quality of studies was assessed with the Ottawa\u2013Newcastle criteria. Statistical meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Twelve studies were finally included in the present review, which enrolled 2341 PCOS patients. Among them, 577 had subclinical hypothyroidism, whereas the remaining 2077 were PCOS women with normal thyroid function. The presence of SCH significantly affected HDL (MD \u20133.92 mg/dL 95% CI: \u20136.56, \u20131.29) and triglycerides levels (26.91 mg/dL 95% CI: \u20133.79, 50.02). HOMA-IR was also affected (MD 0.82 95% CI: 0.15, 1.50). On the other hand, LDL, fasting glucose and 2-h OGTT were not influenced. Similarly, prolactin, FSH, LH, LH/FSH ratio and sex hormone-binding globulin remained unaffected. Conclusion: Subclinical hypothyroidism does not influence the hormonal profile of women with PCOS. On the other hand, it results in mild metabolic abnormalities, which are not clinically important in a short-term setting.",

        "title": "Association between PCOS and autoimmune thyroid disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. PCOS has been associated with distinct metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and with autoimmune conditions, predominantly autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). AITD has been reported in 18\u201340% of PCOS women, depending on PCOS diagnostic criteria and ethnicity. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the available evidence regarding the likelihood of women with PCOS also having AITD in comparison to a reference group of non-PCOS women. We systematically searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for non-interventional case control, cross-sectional or cohort studies published until August 2017. The Ottawa\u2013Newcastle Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of studies. Statistical meta-analysis was performed with R. Thirteen studies were selected for the present analysis, including 1210 women diagnosed with PCOS and 987 healthy controls. AITD was observed in 26.03 and 9.72% of PCOS and control groups respectively. A significant association was detected between PCOS and chance of AITD (OR\u2009=\u20093.27, 95% CI 2.32\u20134.63). Notably, after geographical stratification, the higher risk of AITD in PCOS women persisted for Asians (OR\u2009=\u20094.56, 95% CI 2.47\u20138.43), Europeans (OR\u2009=\u20093.27, 95% CI 2.07\u20135.15) and South Americans (OR\u2009=\u20091.86, 95% CI 1.05\u20133.29). AIDT is a frequent condition in PCOS patients and might affect thyroid function. Thus, screening for thyroid function and thyroid-specific autoantibodies should be considered in patients with PCOS even in the absence of overt symptoms.

        "title": "Ovarian Reserve and Serum Concentration of Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies in Euthyroid Women With Different Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Phenotypes",
        "abstract": "Objective: It has been shown that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), are characterized by increased incidence of infertility. Serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), which reflects ovarian reserve, is elevated in PCOS women and is decreased in women with HT. The Rotterdam criteria recognize four clinical PCOS phenotypes, i.e., phenotypes A, B, C, and D. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between serum concentrations of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and ovarian reserve in different PCOS phenotypes. Patients and methods: We examined 141 women with PCOS [phenotype A was diagnosed in 67 (47.5%) women, phenotype B in 30 (21.3%), phenotype C in 28 (19.9%), and phenotype D in 16 (11.3%)] and 88 control subjects of similar age; all women were euthyroid. Serum concentrations of AMH, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid hormones, and TPOAbs were assessed. Results: We observed positive serum TPOAbs in 21.9% women with PCOS and in 23.9% controls (p = 0.07). We did not find differences in the frequency of detection of positive serum TPOAbs between phenotypes A, B, and C and the control group (p > 0.05). We did not observe a difference in AMH levels between TPOAbs-positive and TPOAbs-negative women, both in the control group and the PCOS women (all p > 0.05). However, serum AMH concentration was markedly higher in the whole PCOS group (p < 0.01) and in phenotype A (p < 0.01) vs. controls when the serum concentration of TPOAbs was negative. In the groups with positive serum levels of TPOAbs, serum concentration of AMH did not differ between PCOS phenotypes and controls (p = 0.23). Additionally, we observed that serum AMH concentration was related to the level of TPOAbs in the PCOS group (r = \u22120.4, p = 0.02). Conclusions: The frequency of serum detection of positive TPOAbs did not differ between PCOS phenotypes with clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism and the control group. The observation of the difference in serum AMH between the PCOS and control groups only in TPOAbs negative women together with the inverse relation of TPOAbs with serum AMH only in the PCOS group might suggest that ovarian reserve is influenced by TPOAbs in PCOS.",

The objective is to conclude whether SCH with present or absent anti-thyroid antibodies (ATA) impacts on the PCOS phenotype and alters biochemical or clinical parameters. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary reference center. Clinical and biochemical parameters of women with PCOS were analyzed. Results: A total of 367 women with PCOS were included in the study, 114 (31.1%) of whom were diagnosed with SCH and 16 (4.4%) with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). Among all parameters studied, the strongest relationship with SCH was confirmed for insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. SCH was an independent risk factor for insulin resistance. In SCH the additional presence of ATA did not exacerbate the metabolic disorders. There was no significant association of any PCOS phenotype with SCH, nor with the presence of circulating ATA. There was no significant difference in hormonal parameters and mFerriman\u2013Gallwey scale score between women with PCOS with and without SCH. Conclusions: SCH alters metabolic, but not hormonal, parameters in PCOS. The diagnosis of SCH does not exclude the diagnosis of PCOS. The potential effect of positive ATA was insignificant.",

        "abstract": "A large body of evidence indicates that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (HT) than healthy individuals. Given the strong genetic impact on both diseases, common predisposing genetic factors are possibly involved but are not fully understood. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) for 250 women with sporadic PCOS, HT, combined PCOS and HT (PCOS+HT), and healthy controls to explore the genetic background of the joint occurrence of PCOS and HT. Based on relevant comparative analyses, multivariate logistic regression prediction modeling, and the most informative feature selection using the Monte Carlo feature selection and interdependency discovery algorithm, 77 variants were selected for further validation by TaqMan genotyping in a group of 533 patients. In the allele frequency test, variants in RAB6A, GBP3, and FNDC7 genes were found to significantly (padjusted < 0.05) differentiated the PCOS+HT and PCOS groups, variant in HIF3A differentiated the PCOS+HT and HT groups, whereas variants in CDK20 and CCDC71 differentiated the PCOS+HT and both single disorder groups. TaqMan genotyping data were used to create final prediction models, which differentiated between PCOS+HT and PCOS or HT with a prediction accuracy of AUC = 0.78. Using a 70% cutoff of the prediction score improved the model parameters, increasing the AUC value to 0.87. In summary, we demonstrated the polygenic burden of both PCOS and HT, and many common and intersecting signaling pathways and biological processes whose disorders mutually predispose patients to the development of both diseases.",
