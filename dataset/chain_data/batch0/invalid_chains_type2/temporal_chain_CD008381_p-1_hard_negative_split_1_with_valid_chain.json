        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nComparing the antidepressant effects of Citalopram with Fluoxetine and their effect on glycemic control in diabetic patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty patients attending the Diabetes Research Center in Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran from September 2006 to October 2007 with type II diabetes and suffering from major depression were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n=20 per group) in a randomized controlled trial method. They received up to 40 mg/d of Fluoxetine or Citalopram. Twelve weeks after treatment, patients were reassessed in terms of severity of depression and diabetic status. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and psychiatric interview were used to measure the severity of depression and follow up the patients. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and fasting blood sugar (FBS) was obtained to monitor glycemic control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter the 12-week treatment, both groups showed significant improvement in severity of depression, FBS, and HbA1c. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of improvement in depression and diabetic status.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFluoxetine and Citalopram can effectively reduce the severity of depression in diabetic patients without an adverse effect on glycemic control.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo elucidate the differences between carotid angioplasty stent placement (CAS) and antidepressants on post-stroke depression (PSD) in high-grade carotid artery stenosis patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this prospective, controlled study, 182 cerebral ischemia stroke patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis who were admitted to the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China, between April 2004 and March 2009 were enrolled. Based on different treatments, the patients were assigned to 2 groups: the CAS group (n=104), and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) group (n=78). All patients were tested using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) before treatment, one, and 3 months after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe NIHSS score of the CAS group was significantly decreased at one (p=0.007) and 3 months (p=0.006). At one month, the HDRS score of the CAS group was significantly lower than the SSRIs group (p=0.005), and there was no significant difference between these 2 groups at 3 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe CAS relieved PSD and improved neurologic rehabilitation in high-grade carotid artery stenosis patients, and the therapeutic effect was superior to that of SSRIs after one month.",

        "explanation": "This paper compares the effectiveness of carotid angioplasty stent placement with antidepressants in treating post-stroke depression. It does not directly reference or build upon the source paper's findings, and its focus on post-stroke depression makes it less relevant to the source paper's topic of depression in diabetic patients."

        "title": "IMPACT OF CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY ON COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the impact of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on cognitive performance in patients with severe carotid disease and depressive symptoms, and to explore the possible associations between certain demographics, clinical characteristics, and cognitive function and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 48 patients, who were referred for endarterectomy. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, while depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire(PHQ-9) scale. An assessment of cognitive and depressive symptoms was performed 1\u20133 days before surgery, and then six months after. RESULTS: A paired sample t-test found that the difference in the mean MoCA score between the before (\uf7c2=23.37; SD \u00b1 3.27) and the after (\uf7c2=24.69; SD \u00b1 3.68) surgery results was 1.32 (95% CI = 0.48 \u2013 2.16; p = 0.003; Cohen\u2019s d value = 0.95). A paired sample t-test showed that a decrease in mean PHQ-9 score of > 10 for patients six months after CEA (7.5\u00b14.6) was statistically significant ( p = 0.019; Cohen\u2019s d value = 1.32) compared with the PHQ-9 scores at baseline (12.6 \u00b1 2.8). CONCLUSION: Carotid artery endarterectomy seems to have beneficial effects on the course of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis. Demographic, clinical characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities, previous stroke) did not have impact on course of cognitive and depressive symptoms. A limitation in our study was that the number of patients was relatively small, therefore we intend to perform further study with larger case volume to estimate the impact of carotid artery endarterectomy on cognitive functions and depressive symptoms.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the impact of carotid endarterectomy on cognitive performance and depressive symptoms, which is related to the source paper's investigation of carotid angioplasty stent placement for post-stroke depression. However, it does not directly build upon or utilize the findings of the source paper, but rather investigates a different surgical procedure."
