        "title": "Improving on a Coin Toss To Predict Patient Adherence to Medications",
        "abstract": "According to the father of medicine, Hippocrates, The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient cooperate (1). Although Hippocrates' paternalistic tone might affront modern physicians and patients, the challenge of promoting patient adherence to effective treatments still confounds providers 23 centuries later. Adherence has become an increasingly central aspect of patient care because of the burgeoning array of effective treatments for many chronic diseases. In the face of remarkable medical advances, it is especially distressing that evaluation of patient adherence (also called compliance or pill taking) remains an imperfect science at best. The article by Liu and colleagues in this issue [2] contributes to the field of adherence measurement by demonstrating an improvement in predictive validity after incorporation of data from several adherence measures when data from an electronic monitor were missing. In this study of 108 community-based patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy, three measures were used: 1) electronic monitoring by a special pill bottle cap with a microchip that records each time the bottle is opened (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]], 2) pill count, and 3) patient interview. The authors used data from these three measures to create yet another measure that they termed a composite adherence score (CAS). This additional measure should really have been called supplemented MEMS. When MEMS data were missing or inaccurate, the investigators replaced the data points first with pill count and then, if needed, with interview data on adherence. In an innovative move, the authors did not directly use the values from the pill count and interview measures, which seemed to overestimate adherence, to supplement the MEMS data. Instead, they calibrated pill count and interview data to adjust for this overestimate before incorporating these values when MEMS data were not evaluable. Therefore, their paper offers several interesting options for investigators to consider in improving assessment of adherence. Studies of medication adherence often fail to offer an adequate description of their measures and methods to allow replication by others (3). However, in this area of research, the devil is in the details. The study by Liu and colleagues offers scant information about such issues as how patients were instructed in the use of MEMS caps, approaches used to reduce pill dumping before pill counts, and who asked questions about adherence. In this study, adherence was calculated as the percentage of prescribed doses taken in the past 4 weeks for the MEMS and pill count measures and as the percentage of prescribed doses taken in the past week for the patient interview. Since CAS relies primarily on the MEMS adherence measure, it largely reflects adherence over 4 weeks. Such variations in the time frames covered by adherence measures are common but make comparisons of results across measures more difficult. The predictive validity of all four adherence measures was assessed by examining their associations with undetectable HIV RNA levels 8 and 24 weeks after starting treatment. The use of an outcome measure such as viral load suppression makes this study more clinically relevant than those that simply report adherence levels. Although the success of antiretroviral treatment in achieving an undetectable viral load represents a complex interaction of patient-related, virologic, and medication-related factors, the study by Liu and colleagues adds further evidence that excellent adherence plays a central role in suppressing HIV viral load (4, 5). Of all four measures, CAS (supplemented MEMS) was the most strongly predictive of viral load; the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve statistic was 0.84, where a value of 1.0 would be a perfect prediction of an outcome and a value of 0.5 would indicate a 50:50 chance of predicting the outcome. However, the ROC curves for pill count and MEMS were only slightly inferior (0.77 and 0.76, respectively). The improvement in the ROC statistic for CAS compared with the MEMS-only measure shows that missing electronic monitor data may be informative. Because the mean CAS was higher than the MEMS-only adherence value (76% vs. 63%, respectively), the missing data points seem to represent times when patient adherence was better, strengthening concerns that the unsupplemented MEMS measure underestimates adherence. Despite several innovations in the analysis of data, Liu and colleagues' study is subject to several limitations that plague community-based research. First, 40% of eligible patients declined to participate and only 80% of participants had data at just 8 weeks into the study. Thus, problems with recruitment and retention are evident. Second, although the authors measured adherence at 4-week intervals for 48 weeks, only 666 data points, not 1296, were available for the 108 participants because of dropout and other unspecified reasons. Third, substantial data were unavailable for each of the measures. Of the 666 data points, MEMS data were missing or unreliable for 16% and pill count data were unavailable for 10%. More worrisome, the authors collected interview data only at 3 of a possible 12 time points. The data from the third time point (48 weeks) were not analyzed, and, for the remaining 2 time points, more than 40% of the participants had missing data. This significant amount of missing data for patient interview makes the results in relation to this measure virtually uninterpretable. Liu and colleagues' use of electronic monitors as the backbone of their enhanced adherence measure is supported by studies of other diseases that report strong associations between adherence measured by this tool and clinical outcomes (6, 7). However, Liu and colleagues' study does not capitalize on the unique potential of electronic monitors to assess intervals between doses (8). Consideration of dose intervals may be particularly important when medications are taken several times per day (9). Yet use of electronic monitors to assess adherence is not a panacea. First, patients who are accustomed to using pillboxes and other reminder systems might decline to participate in a study that requires them to stop using these devices. Such concerns may explain the high refusal rate for participation in the study by Liu and colleagues. Second, improper use of electronic monitors by patients has resulted in the loss of substantial amounts of data (10). Bangsberg and coworkers (4) found that almost one third of patients ignored study instructions and admitted to taking out an extra pocket dose of medication when they left home. Such behaviors may explain why MEMS underestimates adherence. Fourth, as with any electronic device, adherence monitors can be damaged or lost. Fifth, the cost of these monitors obviates their use in clinical practice without special funding sources. Last, the steps required to obtain accurate data from electronic monitoring devices may act as a type of intervention that would change adherence behavior. Given the limitations of electronic monitors, what other measures should clinicians and researchers consider using? To their credit, Liu and colleagues did not even try to obtain physicians' predictions of patients' adherence levels. Clinicians would do better to toss a coin than to try to predict nonadherence (11). On the other hand, pill counts seemed to perform almost as well as the MEMS-only measure in the study by Liu and colleagues. A supplemented pill count measure could be explored, as suggested by these authors, in which missing or inaccurate data are replaced by data from patient interviews. Pill counts have been used for decades to address adherence (12), and researchers have been complaining about the logistics of obtaining this measure for nearly as long. Fletcher and associates (13) listed problems with this approach, including patients' forgetting to bring their bottles, patients' taking offense at having their pills counted, difficulties in determining the start of the current medication prescription, and patients' combining several refills in one bottle. Although pill counts without prior warning have been performed in previous studies to avoid such inaccuracies as pill dumping (14), many patients may be hesitant to agree to this approach. Despite efforts to improve the reliability of pill counts, this method still overestimates adherence (15). Liu and colleagues cursorily dismissed the use of pharmacy medication refill data to evaluate persistence with pill taking. Nonetheless, several studies have reported significant associations between HIV viral load suppression and adherence measures using pharmacy data (16, 17). This approach requires access to complete pharmacy data that have been checked for accuracy. Pharmacy-based assessments offer several advantages, including the possibility of conducting population-based analyses and avoiding a possible Hawthorne effect because patients are aware of being evaluated. Should we really give up on patient interview to evaluate adherence? Definitely not. Several studies of HIV-infected patients have shown significant associations between HIV viral load suppression and self-reported adherence (4, 18). Admittedly, careful attention must be given to a preamble before adherence questions to help the patient understand that he or she is not being judged and that honest answers are sought. Ideally, the questioner should not be a health care provider. Patient recall may limit questions about adherence during periods longer than 1 week. Although patient interview overestimates adherence, patients who admit to poor adherence are generally also nonadherent by other measures (14). This is an important group to identify because self-acknowledged nonadherent patients may be more responsive to interventions to improve adherence than those who deny any a",

        "abstract": "Objective To assess the effectiveness of the simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ) in identifying non-adherent patients. Design Prospective observational study of adherence. The six-item SMAQ was developed. The following aspects were evaluated: (i) criterion validity, comparison with electronic adherence monitoring; (ii) construct validity, association between adherence, as defined by the SMAQ, and virological outcomes; and (iii) reliability, internal consistency and reproducibility. Patients A group of 3004 unselected HIV patients who had initiated nelfinavir therapy combined with other antiretroviral drugs [21% naive, 15% protease inhibitor (PI)-naive, 64% PI-experienced] between January 1998 and December 1999 were enrolled in 69 hospitals in Spain. The SMAQ was administered at months 3, 6 and 12. Results The SMAQ showed 72% sensitivity, 91% specificity and a likelihood ratio of 7.94 to identified non-adherent patients, compared with the medication-event monitoring system (40 patients evaluated). At month 12, 1797 patients were evaluated, of whom 32.3% were defined as non-adherent; viral load < 500 copies/ml found in 68.3% of the adherent, and 46% of the non-adherent patients. A logistic regression analysis of PI-naive patients was performed, including age, sex, baseline viral load > 5 log10/ml, CD4 cell count < 200 \u00d7 106/l, and non-adherence as independent variables. Non-adherence was the only significant risk factor in failing to achieve virological suppression. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was 0.75, and overall inter-observer agreement was 88.2%. Conclusion The SMAQ appears to be an adequate instrument with which to assess adherence in HIV-infected patients, and may be applied in most clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Objective:We examined the independent effect of alcohol and combined effects of drug and alcohol use on antiretroviral (ART) utilization, adherence, and viral suppression in an urban cohort of HIV-infected individuals. Methods:In an observational clinical cohort, alcohol use, active drug use, and adherence were prospectively assessed at 6-month intervals. We classified hazardous alcohol use as >7 drinks/week or >3 drinks/occasion in women, and >14 drinks/week or >4 drinks/occasion in men and active drug use as any use in the previous 6 months. Our outcomes included ART utilization, 2-week adherence, and viral suppression. We used generalized estimating equations to analyze the association between independent variables and outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, years on ART, and clinic enrollment time. Results:Between 1998 and 2003, 1711 individuals participated in 5028 interviews. 1433 of these individuals received ART accounting for 3761 interviews. The prevalence of any alcohol use at the first interview was 45%, with 10% classified as hazardous drinkers. One-third of the sample used illicit drugs. In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, sex, race, active drug use, years on ART, and clinic enrollment time, hazardous alcohol use was independently associated with decreased ART utilization (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.82), 2-week adherence (AOR, 0.46; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.63), and viral suppression (AOR, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.99) compared to no alcohol use. Concurrent injection drug use (IDU) exacerbated this negative effect on ART use, adherence, and suppression. Conclusions:Hazardous alcohol use alone and combined with IDU was associated with decreased ART uptake, adherence, and viral suppression.

Methods:We prospectively assessed CD4 cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and alcohol consumption for up to 7 years in 595 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems recruited between 1997 and 2003. We investigated the relation of these markers of HIV disease progression to alcohol consumption using longitudinal regression models controlling for known prognostic factors, including adherence and depressive symptoms, and stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results:Among subjects who were not on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a lower CD4 cell count (adjusted mean decrease of 48.6 cells/\u03bcL compared with abstinence; P = 0.03) but not with higher log10 HIV RNA. Among subjects who were on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was not associated with a lower CD4 cell count or higher log10 HIV RNA.

        "abstract": "Background:We evaluated the longitudinal association of alcohol use with immunologic response to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected individuals. Methods:This was a prospective cohort study of individuals initiating ART. Participants underwent an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-interview querying drug and alcohol use within 6 months of treatment. Immunologic response to ART was defined by CD4 T-cell count (CD4). Primary independent variables were self-reported number of drinks consumed per drinking day (quantity) and days of alcohol consumption in a typical week (frequency). We used linear mixed effects models to quantify the association between CD4 T-cell count and alcohol quantity and frequency and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the relative hazard of an increase in 100, 150, and 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter per additional drink per drinking day. Analyses were stratified by sex. Viral suppression was examined as a time-varying covariate. Results:Between 2000 and 2008, 1107 individuals were eligible for inclusion in this study. There was no statistically significant difference in CD4 T-cell count by average drinks per drinking day at any frequency of alcohol use irrespective of sex or viral suppression. Similarly, we found no difference in the hazard ratio for drinks per drinking day within the categories of drinking frequency for time to CD4 T-cell count increase of 100, 150, and 200 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively.

Alcohol consumption was categorized as none, moderate, and alcohol misuse. Predictors included age, race/ethnicity, depressive or anxiety symptoms, illicit drug use (opioids, methamphetamines, cocaine/crack), marijuana use, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV transmission risk factor, and HIV disease progression. We estimated sex-stratified alcohol consumption trajectories and their predictors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found 7 trajectories of alcohol consumption in men: stable nondrinking and increased drinking (71% and 29% of initial nondrinking); stable moderate, reduced drinking, and increased alcohol misuse (59%, 21%, and 21% of initial moderate alcohol use); and stable alcohol misuse and reduced alcohol misuse (75% and 25% of initial alcohol misuse). Categories were similar in women, except lack of an increase to alcohol misuse trajectory among women that begin with moderate use. Older men and women were more likely to have stable nondrinking, while younger men were more likely to increase to or remain in alcohol misuse. Minorities, people with depressive or anxiety symptoms, HCV-infected individuals, and people who injected drugs were more likely to reduce use. Illicit drug use was associated with a reduction in overall drinking, while marijuana use was associated with stable moderate drinking or misuse.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLongitudinal trajectories of increasing alcohol use and stable misuse highlight the need to integrate routine screening and alcohol misuse interventions into HIV primary care.",

        "title": "Lifetime alcohol use among persons living with hiv is associated with frailty.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe average lifespan of persons living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy approximates the general population. However, PLWH are susceptible to early aging and frailty. Behaviors such as alcohol consumption may contribute to frailty among PLWH.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the relationships between recent and lifetime alcohol use and frailty among PLWH.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional, prospective cohort study of in-care PLWH (n\u200a=\u200a365) participating in the New Orleans Alcohol Use in HIV Study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRecent alcohol exposure was measured by the 30-day alcohol timeline follow-back (TLFB) assessment and by whole-blood-spot phosphatidylethanol (PEth) quantitation. Lifetime alcohol exposure (LAE) was estimated by a modified lifetime drinking history instrument. Frailty was assessed by a 58-item deficit index (DI58) and the phenotypic frailty index (PFI). The Veterans Aging Cohort Study Risk Index 2.0 was calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing generalized linear regression, LAE was positively associated with the DI58 [95%CI:(0.001,0.006)] and PFI severity [95%CI:(0.004,0.023)] after adjustment for age and other factors. Conversely, recent alcohol exposure was negatively associated with the DI58 [TLFB 95% CI: (-0.126, -0.034), PEth: (-0.163, -0.058)] and PFI severity [TLFB 95% CI: (-0.404, -0.015), PEth: (-0.406, 0.034)]. The VACS was not associated with alcohol use. Median per-decade alcohol exposure peaked in the second decade and tapered with aging thereafter. Increasing LAE and decreasing TLFB were co-associated with a specific subset of health deficits.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLifetime alcohol use is positively associated with frailty among PLWH. Specific health deficits may discourage alcohol consumption in some PLWH.",

        "title": "Alcohol Use Is Associated with Intestinal Dysbiosis and Dysfunctional CD8+ T-Cell Phenotypes in Persons with HIV.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nInflammation persists among people living with HIV (PWH) despite effective anti-retroviral therapy and may contribute to T-cell dysfunction. Alcohol use is prevalent among PWH and promotes intestinal leak, dysbiosis, and a pro-inflammatory milieu. Whether alcohol use is associated with T-cell late-differentiation remains to be investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData and samples from PWH (N=359/365) enrolled in the New Orleans Alcohol Use in HIV Study were used. Alcohol use was assessed by self-report (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT]; lifetime alcohol exposure; thirty-day Alcohol Timeline Follow Back) and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) quantitation. In a subset of participants, fecal bacterial content was assessed by ribosomal 16S marker-gene deep-sequencing and quantitative PCR. Intestinal leak was assessed by fecal-to-plasma \u03b1-1-anti-trypsin (A1AT) ELISA ratio. Peripheral T-cell populations were quantified by flow-cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAUDIT scores were positively associated with activated-senescent, exhausted, and terminal effector memory CD45RA+ CD8+ but not CD4+ T-cells (cells/\u03bcL) after confounder adjustment (p<.050). PEth was positively associated with A1AT (p<.050). PEth and activated-senescent CD8+ were associated with bacterial \u03b2-diversity (p<.050) and positively associated with the relative abundance of co-abundant Prevotellaceae members (q<.100).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nAlcohol use among PWH is associated with CD8+ T-cell late-differentiation, intestinal leak, and dysbiosis. Alcohol-associated dysbiosis is implicated in CD8+ T-cell senescence.",

        "title": "Chronic Alcohol Exposure Among People Living with HIV Is Associated with Innate Immune Activation and Alterations in Monocyte Phenotype and Plasma Cytokine Profile",
        "abstract": "Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy, chronic immune activation continues to be observed among individuals with well-controlled HIV viral loads, and is associated with non-AIDS defining morbidities among people living with HIV. Alcohol use disorder impacts a significant proportion of individuals living with HIV, and alcohol exposure is known to damage the intestinal epithelium which may increase translocation of pathogens and their molecular products, driving systemic immune activation and dysregulation. The aim of this study was to determine if adults living with HIV with well-controlled viral loads, who also suffer from alcohol use disorder with and without hepatitis C virus co-infection (n=23), exhibit evidence of advanced systemic immune activation, intestinal damage, and microbial translocation, as compared to adults living with HIV who are not exposed to chronic alcohol or other substances of abuse (n=29). The impact of a 1-month intervention to treat alcohol-use disorder was also examined. Alcohol-use disorder was associated with evidence of advanced innate immune activation, alterations in monocyte phenotype including increased expression of Toll-like receptor 4, increased burden of stimulatory ligands for Toll-like receptor 4, and alterations in plasma cytokine signature, most notably elevations in soluble CD40 ligand and transforming growth factor beta. Alcohol-associated immune activation was more pronounced among individuals with hepatitis C virus co-infection. Although the 1-month intervention to treat alcohol use disorder did not result in significant reductions in the interrogated indicators of immune activation, our findings suggest that chronic alcohol exposure is a major modifiable risk factor for chronic immune activation and dysregulation among people-living with HIV.",
