        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicyclum, a China made new hepatocyte protecting agent, in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-nine CHC patients matched demographically and clinically were randomized into two groups: bicyclum group (group A, n = 20) and placebo/bicyclum crossovergroup (group B, n = 19). Bicyclum 75mg/d or placebo was administered to these two groups respectively for 3 months. Then the patients in group A received bicyclum for further 3 months and were observed for 3 months after the treatment discontinued; and the patients in group B received bicyclum 75mg/d for six months and were observed for 3 months after the treatment discontinued. Investigation items included clinical manifestations,liver function, serum HCV RNA and anti-HCV.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn group A, the serum ALT was 120 +/- 43 U/L before treatment and was 57 +/- 32 U/L after treatment ( P < 0.01) In group B the baseline serum ALT was 126 U/L +/- 48 U/L. After the placebo administration the serum ALT was 127 U/L +/- 97 U/L (P > 0.05) and the clinical feature showed no improvement. After bicyclum treatment for 6 months, the serum ALT in group B was 68 +/- 45 U/L, significantly lower than that before bicyclum treatment ( P < 0.01) and clinical symptoms improved. The overall ALT normalization response rate were 64.1% and 48.7% at the end of bicyclum treatment and 3 months after the treatment discontinued respectively for the total 39 patients. The serum HCV-RNA became negative in 5 and 2 patients at end of treatment and 3 months after the treatment discontinued. Adverse drug reactions were mild and uncommon. Mild dizziness occurred in 1 patient in each group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBicyclum is effective in improving ALT and clinical manifestations of CHC patients. It is safe and well tolerated and shows few adverse reactions.",

        "title": "Bicyclol Attenuates Liver Inflammation Induced by Infection of Hepatitis C Virus via Repressing ROS-Mediated Activation of MAPK/NF-\u03baB Signaling Pathway",
        "abstract": "Treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cures most patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the real world. However, some patients, especially those with the underlying advanced liver disease, have a limited reduction of liver injury after achieving a sustained viral response (SVR). Bicyclol was widely used in clinics for the treatment of a variety of liver injuries but with an unknown mechanism for the treatment of hepatitis C. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of bicyclol in HCV-infected hepatocytes and further confirmed the putative results in a mouse hepatitis model induced by the coinjection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] and D-galactosamine (D-GalN). The results showed that the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and the subsequent increase of inflammatory factors were directly induced by HCV infection and were persistent after clearance of the virus in Huh7.5 cells. Bicyclol decreased the activation of NF-\u03baB and the levels of inflammatory factors in HCV-infected hepatocytes by inhibiting the activation of the ROS-MAPK-NF-\u03baB pathway, and the effect was synergistic with DAAs in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Bicyclol attenuated the ROS-MAPK-NF-\u03baB axis via recovering mitochondrial function without a dependence on dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and superoxide dismutases. The anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of bicyclol were verified in mouse hepatitis induced by the coinjection of poly(I:C)/D-GalN. Bicyclol directly ameliorates the chronic inflammation caused by HCV infection and might be used with DAAs or after DAA therapy for ultimately curing chronic hepatitis C.",

        "title": "Bicyclol Attenuates Acute Liver Injury by Activating Autophagy, Anti-Oxidative and Anti-Inflammatory Capabilities in Mice",
        "abstract": "Bicyclol, a novel synthetic antihepatitis drug, has been shown to protect against liver injury via various pharmacological activities. The purpose of the current study was to further investigate the protective effect of bicyclol against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury (ALI) and its underlying molecular mechanism, particularly autophagic machinery, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory potentials. Our results found that treatment with bicyclol significantly reduced CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity by alleviating histopathological liver changes, decreasing the alanine transaminase levels, promoting autophagic flux, attenuating the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and modulating oxidative markers. Furthermore, bicyclol efficiently induced the conversion of LC3 and enhanced the liver expressions of ATG7 and Beclin-1. Meanwhile, bicyclol induced the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and p62. These protective effects may be mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibition of mTOR or MAPK signaling pathways. Taken together, our study firstly suggests that bicyclol has protective potential against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, which might be closely associated with induction of autophagy, concomitant anti-oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory response.",

        "title": "Bicyclol Alleviates Signs of BDL-Induced Cholestasis by Regulating Bile Acids and Autophagy-Mediated HMGB1/p62/Nrf2 Pathway",
        "abstract": "Cholestasis is a liver disease characterized by the accumulation of toxic bile salts, bilirubin, and cholesterol, resulting in hepatocellular damage. Recent findings have revealed several key steps of cholestasis liver injury including the toxicity of bile acids and accumulation of proinflammatory mediator. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of bicyclol in cholestasis caused by bile duct ligation (BDL), as well as relevant mechanisms. Bicyclol attenuated liver damage in BDL mice by increasing the levels of hydrophilic bile acid such as \u03b1-MCA and \u03b2-MCA, regulating bile acid-related pathways and improving histopathological indexes. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an extracellular damage-associated molecular pattern molecule which can be used as biomarkers of cells and host defense. Bicyclol treatment decreased extracellular release of HMGB1. In addition, HMGB1 is also involved in regulating autophagy in response to oxidative stress. Bicyclol promoted the lipidation of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)-\u2161 to activate autophagy. The nuclear factor, E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its antioxidant downstream genes were also activated. Our results indicate that bicyclol is a promising therapeutic strategy for cholestasis by regulating the bile acids and autophagy-mediated HMGB1/p62/Nrf2 pathway.",

        "title": "Hepatoprotective agents in the management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: current knowledge and prospects",
        "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is characterized by unexplained distressing pruritus in the mother and poses significant risk to the fetus of perinatal mortality. Occurring in the second and third trimester, the serum bile acid and aminotransferase are usually elevated in ICP patients. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first line drug for ICP but the effectiveness for hepatoprotection is to a certain extent. In ICP patients with severe liver damage, combination use of hepatoprotective agents with UDCA is not uncommon. Herein, we reviewed the current clinical evidence on application of hepatoprotective agents in ICP patients. The underlying physiological mechanisms and their therapeutic effect in clinical practice are summarized. The basic pharmacologic functions of these hepatoprotective medications include detoxification, anti-inflammation, antioxidation and hepatocyte membrane protection. These hepatoprotective agents have versatile therapeutic effects including anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, elimination of free radicals, anti-steatohepatitis, anti-fibrosis and anti-cirrhosis. They are widely used in hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, drug induced liver injury and cholestasis. Evidence from limited clinical data in ICP patients demonstrate reliable effectiveness and safety of these medications. Currently there is still no consensus on the application of hepatoprotective agents in ICP pregnancies. Dynamic monitoring of liver biochemical parameters and fetal condition is still the key recommendation in the management of ICP pregnancies.",

        "title": "Evaluating Real-World Evidence of Effectiveness and Safety of Ursodeoxycholic Acid, Saroglitazar, and Vitamin E Monotherapies in Indian Patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Disease and Cholestasis: The ELITE Study",
        "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease, and its prevalence is increasing in India. There have been limited real-world evidence studies in India on ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), saroglitazar, and vitamin E treatments for NAFLD with cholestasis. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of UDCA, saroglitazar, and vitamin E in treating NAFLD with cholestasis. Methods: This retrospective, multicentric, real-world observational study involved adult Indian NAFLD patients with cholestasis treated with UDCA, saroglitazar, or vitamin E. Patient demographics, clinical parameters, and laboratory investigation results were retrieved from electronic medical records (EMRs) of the study sites. The effectiveness of each treatment was assessed based on the reduction in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels at 2 and 4 weeks from baseline. The adverse events associated with these monotherapies were identified to assess their safety. Results: In this study, 50 patients from three different sites in India were identified through EMR data based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (mean age, 39.22 years; 56% male). Enzyme reductions in AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT levels from baseline to 2 and 4 weeks were found in all treatment groups, However, UDCA treatment showed the highest reductions in ALT (38.36% vs. 24.83% vs. 12.42%), AST (50.05% vs. 29.69% vs. 25.63%), ALP (40.34% vs. 25.41% vs. 16.45%), and GGT (51.15% vs. 28.45% vs. 22.49%) levels compared to treatment with vitamin E and saroglitazar, respectively. One mild adverse event, acid reflux, was reported in the saroglitazar group. Conclusion: The study found that UDCA was significantly more effective than saroglitazar and vitamin E in reducing enzyme levels after 4 weeks. Further studies are needed to confirm these results, which could help to update clinical guidelines for treating NAFLD with cholestasis in India.
