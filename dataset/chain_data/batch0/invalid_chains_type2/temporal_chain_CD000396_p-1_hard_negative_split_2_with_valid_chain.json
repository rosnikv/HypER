        "abstract": "This prospective, 6-week, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized pilot study was designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of a lidocaine patch 5% in patients with low back pain (LBP). Patients with moderate to severe LBP, defined as acute/subacute (<3 months, n = 21), short-term chronic (3-12 months, n = 33), or long-term chronic (>12 months, n = 77), were recruited from 5 clinics; participants applied \u22644 patches (560 cm2 total) once daily to area of maximal LBP as add-on treatment through week 2, with the option to taper concomitant analgesics during weeks 3-6. Scores on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were obtained at weeks 2 and 6. Safety analyses included reports of adverse events (AEs) and skin sensitivity to pinprick/light touch. Significant improvements in average daily pain intensity on the BPI were noted at weeks 2 and 6 (P \u2264 0.001). Significant improvements in pain interference with quality of life (QOL) were noted for all BPI measures of QOL at weeks 2 and 6 for the acute/subacute (P \u2264 0.007) and long-term chronic LBP groups (P < 0.0001) and for 5 of 7 BPI measures for the short-term chronic LBP group (P \u2264 0.042). Fifty-eight percent of patients reported being \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with treatment. The lidocaine patch was well tolerated. Most common AEs were dizziness and rash (n = 5, 3.8%), and most AEs (80%) were mild to moderate in intensity. Significant improvement in pain intensity and QOL in this cohort of LBP patients was noted during treatment with the lidocaine patch 5%. Controlled clinical trials are warranted.",

        "title": "Use of the Lidocaine Patch 5% in the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACTDespite the availability of various treatment options, the satisfactory alleviation of painful peripheral neuropathic pain remains a challenge, due in part to the complex nature of this particular type of pain. Unlike nociceptive pain (caused by a painful stimulus in the presence of a normally functioning nervous system), neuropathic pain is typically produced in response to damage of, or pathological changes within, the peripheral and/or central nervous system. Many patients with neuropathic pain have comorbidities that result in the use of multiple pharmacotherapies, thereby causing a heightened risk of drug-drug interactions. Topically applied, peripherally acting analgesics provide a relatively safe treatment option due partly to low systemic absorption of the medication, thereby reducing the risk of drug interactions and systemic toxicity. The physiology of painful peripheral neuropathies is briefly presented along with a review of the evidence supporting the use of the lidocaine patch 5% as ...",
