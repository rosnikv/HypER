        "title": "Role of nutrition and microbiota in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases.",
        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nIncreased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26\u00a0years, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years. Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs).\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000 person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3 g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total\u00a0intake of dietary fiber (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this association.",

        "abstract": "Background:Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). Methods:This study included women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC. Results:Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23\u20130.98; Ptrend = 0.04). Specifically, greater intake of fish (Ptrend = 0.01) and fiber (Ptrend = 0.06) were associated with lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was associated with UC. Conclusions:Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD, but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic mucosal inflammation, frequent hospitalizations, adverse health economics, and compromised quality of life. Diet has been hypothesised to influence IBD activity.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of dietary interventions on IBD outcomes.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP from inception to 31 January 2019. We also scanned reference lists of included studies, relevant reviews and guidelines.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of dietary manipulations to other diets in participants with IBD. Studies that exclusively focused on enteral nutrition, oral nutrient supplementation, medical foods, probiotics, and parenteral nutrition were excluded.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently performed study selection, extracted data and assessed bias using the risk of bias tool. We conducted meta-analyses where possible using a random-effects model and calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThe review included 18 RCTs with 1878 participants. The studies assessed different dietary interventions for active CD (six studies), inactive CD (seven studies), active UC (one study) and inactive UC (four studies). Dietary interventions involved either the consumption of low amounts or complete exclusion of one or more food groups known to trigger IBD symptoms. There was limited scope for data pooling as the interventions and control diets were diverse. The studies were mostly inadequately powered. Fourteen studies were rated as high risk of bias. The other studies were rated as unclear risk of bias.The effect of high fiber, low refined carbohydrates, low microparticle diet, low calcium diet, symptoms-guided diet and highly restricted organic diet on clinical remission in active CD is uncertain. At 4 weeks, remission was induced in: 100% (4/4) of participants in the low refined carbohydrates diet group compared to 0% (0/3) of participants in the control group (RR 7.20, 95% CI 0.53 to 97.83; 7 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 16 weeks, 44% (23/52) of participants in the low microparticle diet achieved clinical remission compared to 25% (13/51) of control-group participants (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.22 to 43.84; 103 participants; 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 73%; very low certainty evidence). Fifty per cent (16/32) of participants in the symptoms-guided diet group achieved clinical remission compared to 0% (0/19) of control group participants (RR 20.00, 95% CI 1.27 to 315.40; 51 participants ; 1 study; very low certainty evidence) (follow-up unclear). At 24 weeks, 50% (4/8) of participants in the highly restricted organic diet achieved clinical remission compared to 50% (5/10) of participants in the control group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.53; 18 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 16 weeks, 37% (16/43) participants following a low calcium diet achieved clinical remission compared to 30% (12/40) in the control group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.29; 83 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence).The effect of low refined carbohydrate diets, symptoms-guided diets and low red processed meat diets on relapse in inactive CD is uncertain. At 12 to 24 months, 67% (176/264) of participants in low refined carbohydrate diet relapsed compared to 64% (193/303) in the control group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; 567 participants; 3 studies; I\u00b2 = 35%; low certainty evidence). At 6 to 24 months, 48% (24/50) of participants in the symptoms-guided diet group relapsed compared to 83% (40/48) participants in the control diet (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.01; 98 participants ; 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 54%; low certainty evidence). At 48 weeks, 66% (63/96) of participants in the low red and processed meat diet group relapsed compared to 63% (75/118) of the control group (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; 214 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, 0% (0/16) of participants on an exclusion diet comprised of low disaccharides / grains / saturated fats / red and processed meat experienced clinical relapse compared to 26% (10/38) of participants on a control group (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.76; 54 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence).The effect of a symptoms-guided diet on clinical remission in active UC is uncertain. At six weeks, 36% (4/11) of symptoms-guided diet participants achieved remission compared to 0% (0/10) of usual diet participants (RR 8.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 136.33; 21 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence).The effect of the Alberta-based anti-inflammatory diet, the Carrageenan-free diet or milk-free diet on relapse rates in inactive UC is uncertain. At 6 months, 36% (5/14) of participants in the Alberta-based anti-inflammatory diet group relapsed compared to 29% (4/14) of participants in the control group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.70; 28 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). Thirty per cent (3/10) of participants following the carrageenan-free diet for 12 months relapsed compared to 60% (3/5) of the participants in the control group (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 15 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 12 months, 59% (23/39) of milk free diet participants relapsed compared to 68% (26/38) of control diet participants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.15; 77 participants; 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence).None of the included studies reported on diet-related adverse events.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe effects of dietary interventions on CD and UC are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of dietary interventions in CD and UC can be drawn. There is need for consensus on the composition of dietary interventions in IBD and more RCTs are required to evaluate these interventions. Currently, there are at least five ongoing studies (estimated enrollment of 498 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.",

        "title": "The Role of Carrageenan in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Allergic Reactions: Where Do We Stand?",
        "abstract": "Carrageenan (CGN) is a high molecular weight polysaccharide extracted from red seaweeds, composed of D-galactose residues linked in \u03b2-1,4 and \u03b1-1,3 galactose-galactose bond, widely used as a food additive in processed foods for its properties as a thickener, gelling agent, emulsifier, and stabilizer. In recent years, with the spread of the Western diet (WD), its consumption has increased. Nonetheless, there is a debate on its safety. CGN is extensively used as an inflammatory and adjuvant agent in vitro and in animal experimental models for the investigation of immune processes or to assess the activity of anti-inflammatory drugs. CGN can activate the innate immune pathways of inflammation, alter the gut microbiota composition and the thickness of the mucus barrier. Clinical evidence suggests that CGN is involved in the pathogenesis and clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), indeed food-exclusion diets can be an effective therapy for disease remission. Moreover, specific IgE to the oligosaccharide \u03b1-Gal has been associated with allergic reactions commonly referred to as the \u201c\u03b1-Gal syndrome\u201d. This review aims to discuss the role of carrageenan in inflammatory bowel diseases and allergic reactions following the current evidence. Furthermore, as no definitive data are available on the safety and the effects of CGN, we suggest gaps to be filled and advise to limit the human exposure to CGN by reducing the consumption of ultra-processed foods.",

        "abstract": "Regulation of inflammation is a critical process for maintaining physiological homeostasis. The \u03bb-carrageenan (\u03bb-CGN) is a mucopolysaccharide extracted from the cell wall of red algae (Chondrus crispus) capable of inducing acute intestinal inflammation, which is translated into the production of acute phase reactants secreted into the blood circulation. However, the associated mechanisms in vertebrates are not well understood. Here, we investigated the crucial factors behind the inflammatory milieu of \u03bb-CGN-mediated inflammation administered at 0, 1.75, and 3.5% (v/w) by i.p. injection into the peritoneal cavity of adult zebrafish (ZF) (Danio rerio). We found that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) and lymphocytes infiltrating the ZF peritoneal cavity had short-term persistence. Nevertheless, they generate a strong pattern of inflammation that affects systemically and is enough to produce edema in the cavity. Consistent with these findings, cell infiltration, which causes notable tissue changes, resulted in the overexpression of several acute inflammatory markers at the protein level. Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography followed by a hybrid linear ion-trap mass spectrometry shotgun proteomic approach, we identified 2938 plasma proteins among the animals injected with PBS and 3.5% \u03bb-CGN. First, the bioinformatic analysis revealed the composition of the plasma proteome. Interestingly, 72 commonly expressed proteins were recorded among the treated and control groups, but, surprisingly, 2830 novel proteins were differentially expressed exclusively in the \u03bb-CGN-induced group. Furthermore, from the commonly expressed proteins, compared to the control group 62 proteins got a significant (p < 0.05) upregulation in the \u03bb-CGN-treated group, while the remaining ten proteins were downregulated. Next, we obtained the major protein-protein interaction networks between hub protein clusters in the blood plasma of the \u03bb-CGN induced group. Moreover, to understand the molecular underpinnings of these effects based on the unveiled protein sets, we performed a bioinformatic structural similarity analysis and generated overlapping 3D reconstructions between ZF and humans during acute inflammation. Biological pathway analysis pointed to the activation and abundance of diverse classical immune and acute phase reactants, several catalytic enzymes, and varied proteins supporting the immune response. Together, this information can be used for testing and finding novel pharmacological targets to treat human intestinal inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "The dysregulation of complement system activation usually results in acute or chronic inflammation and can contribute to the development of various diseases. Although the activation of complement pathways is essential for innate defense, exacerbated activity of this system may be harmful to the host. Thus, drugs with the potential to inhibit the activation of the complement system may be important tools in therapy for diseases associated with complement system activation. The synthetic peptides Cp40 and PMX205 can be highlighted in this regard, given that they selectively inhibit the C3 and block the C5a receptor (C5aR1), respectively. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a robust model for studying the complement system. The aim of the present study was to use in silico computational modeling to investigate the hypothesis that these complement system inhibitor peptides interact with their target molecules in zebrafish, for subsequent in vivo validation. For this, we analyzed molecular docking interactions between peptides and target molecules. Our study demonstrated that Cp40 and the cyclic peptide PMX205 have positive interactions with their respective zebrafish targets, thus suggesting that zebrafish can be used as an animal model for therapeutic studies on these inhibitors.",
