        "abstract": "Despite numerous studies on women's cardiac health throughout the past decade, the number of female deaths caused by cardiovascular disease still rises and remains the leading cause of death in women in most areas of the world. Novel studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease, and more specifically coronary artery disease presentations in women, are different than those in men. In addition, pathology and pathophysiology of the disease present significant gender differences, which leads to difficulties concerning diagnosis, treatment and outcome of the female population. The reason for this disparity is all steps for female cardiovascular disease evaluation, treatment and prevention are not well elucidated; and an area for future research. This review brings together the most recent studies published in the field of coronary artery disease in women and points out new directions for future investigation on some of the important issues.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo examine, in women who underwent cardiac catheterization, whether breast arterial calcifications (BACs) seen at screening mammography correlate with coronary heart disease (CHD) seen at coronary angiography.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn an institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, 172 women (mean age, 64.29 years +/- 11.97 [standard deviation]) who underwent coronary angiography were recruited, interviewed, and assigned to two groups: those with (CHD+) and those without (CHD-) CHD. The severity and location of the CHD were considered. Their mammograms were reviewed by a breast imaging specialist who was blinded to the CHD status. Student t test, chi(2), and multiple logistic regression tests were performed as appropriate. Presence of BAC was noted and correlated with presence of CHD and presence of cardiac risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 104 women with and 68 women without CHD. Thirty-seven (36%) women in the CHD+ group versus 20 (29%) in the CHD-group (P = .40) had BAC. The mean age of the patients with BAC, 72 years +/- 9.8, was significantly older than the mean age of the patients without BAC, 60.4 years +/- 11.1 (P < .001). Therefore, subjects were divided into those younger than 65 years and those 65 years and older. No correlation existed, despite the fact that BAC was associated with some cardiac risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe authors did not observe a correlation between BAC and coronary angiography-detected CHD, even when CHD severity was considered. On the basis of these results, caution should be exercised when using screening mammography-detected BAC to identify patients with CHD.",

        "title": "Risk factors associated with breast arterial calcifications",
        "abstract": "Background A number of studies have linked the presence of breast arterial calcifications (BACs) with an increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cardiovascular mortality. Because there is a well-established screening system for breast cancer, it has been proposed that the presence of BACs can be used as a warning sign indicating an increased risk of metabolic and vascular diseases. Purpose To determine the relation between BAC and early renal dysfunction. Material and Methods A retrospective review of 6118 mammograms identified 701 cases with BACs. Women with BACs were compared to a random selection of 362 women without BACs based on available laboratory data. Univariate analysis was conducted according to age groups. Results The prevalence of BACs was 11.5% in our study. Hyperglycemia increased the odds of BACs by 8.1 (95% CI 3.0\u201322.1, P < 0.001) in the 50\u201359-year age group. The presence of an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine increased the odds of BACs by 2.6 (95% CI 1.2\u20136.0, P = 0.016) and 2.3 (95% CI 1.0\u20135.2, P = 0.045) in women \u226570 years of age. Hyperlipidemia was not a significant risk factor for BACs in any age group. Conclusion Our results support the view that the presence of BACs on mammography may be indicative of diabetes in middle-aged women. On the other hand, BACs are not very useful for predicting early renal dysfunction in women <70 years of age.",

        "title": "Associations of Breast Arterial Calcifications with Cardiovascular Disease.",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD), continue to be the leading cause of global mortality among women. While traditional CVD/CAD prevention tools play a significant role in reducing morbidity and mortality among both men and women, current tools for preventing CVD/CAD rely on traditional risk factor-based algorithms that often underestimate CVD/CAD risk in women compared with men. In recent years, some studies have suggested that breast arterial calcifications (BAC), which are benign calcifications seen in mammograms, may be linked to CVD/CAD. Considering that millions of women older than 40 years undergo annual screening mammography for breast cancer as a regular activity, innovative risk prediction factors for CVD/CAD involving mammographic data could offer a gender-specific and convenient solution. Such factors that may be independent of, or complementary to, current risk models without extra cost or radiation exposure are worthy of detailed investigation. This review aims to discuss relevant studies examining the association between BAC and CVD/CAD and highlights some of the issues related to previous studies' design such as sample size, population types, method of assessing BAC and CVD/CAD, definition of cardiovascular events, and other confounding factors. The work may also offer insights for future CVD risk prediction research directions using routine mammograms and radiomic features other than BAC such as breast density and macrocalcifications.",

        "abstract": "Breast arterial calcifications (BAC) are increasingly recognized as indicative markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study, we manually annotated BAC areas on 3,330 mammograms, forming the foundational dataset for developing a deep learning model to automate assessment of BAC. Using this annotated data, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning approach to analyze unannotated mammography images, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve BAC segmentation accuracy. Our approach combines the U-net architecture, a well-established deep learning method for medical image segmentation, with a semi-supervised learning technique. We retrieved mammographic examinations of 6,000 women (3,000 with confirmed CVD and 3,000 without) from the screening archive to allow for a focused study. Utilizing our trained deep learning model, we accurately detected and measured the severity of BAC in these mammograms. Additionally, we examined the time between mammogram screenings and the occurrence of CVD events. Our study indicates that both the presence and severity (grade) of BAC, identified and measured using deep learning for automated segmentation, are crucial for primary CVD prevention. These findings underscore the value of technology in understanding the link between BAC in mammograms and cardiovascular disease, shaping future screening and prevention strategies for women's health.",
