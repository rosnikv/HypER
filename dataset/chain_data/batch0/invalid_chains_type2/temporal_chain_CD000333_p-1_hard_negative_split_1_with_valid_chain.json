        "abstract": "With the ageing population in most countries, disorders of bone and mineral metabolism are becoming increasingly relevant to every day clinical practice. Consequently, the interest in, and the need for effective measures to be used in the screening, diagnosis and follow-up of such pathologies have markedly grown. Together with clinical and imaging techniques, biochemical tests play an important role in the assessment and differential diagnosis of metabolic bone disease. In recent years, the isolation and characterisation of cellular and extracellular components of the skeletal matrix have resulted in the development of molecular markers that are considered to reflect either bone formation or bone resorption. These biochemical indices are non-invasive, comparatively inexpensive and, when applied and interpreted correctly, helpful tools in the diagnostic and therapeutic assessment of metabolic bone disease. This review provides an overview of the current evidence regarding the clinical use of biochemical markers of bone remodelling in bone disease, with an emphasis on osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the relationships between myocardial injury as indicated by serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation, 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], and PTH status and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in older patients with hip fracture (HF). In 238 consecutive patients (mean age 81.9 +/- 7.8 yr; 72% women) with low trauma HF, serum concentrations of cTnI, 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and urine excretion of free deoxypyridinoline (DPD) and N-terminal cross-linked teleopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) were measured and clinical data were collected prospectively. Myocardial injury (cTnI >0.06 microg/L) presented in 29%, 25(OH)D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) in 81.6%, elevated PTH (>6.5 pmol/L) in 53%, and excessive bone resorption (increased DPD and/or NTx excretion) in 93.7%. Multivariate logistic regression showed that elevated serum PTH level is a major predictor of peri-operative myocardial injury (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.01-4.51; p = 0.049) and in-hospital all-cause mortality (OR = 18.5; 95% CI 2.0-72.3; p = 0.010), independent of age, sex, 25(OH)D status, and comorbidities. The degree of hyperparathyroidism was associated with the risk of cTnI elevation and the mortality rate. In cTnI positive patients, PTH levels correlated with cTnI concentrations (r = 0.28; p = 0.026) and urine DPD exretion (r = 0.37; p = 0.004). These results suggest for the first time that in older patients with HF, elevated PTH level is associated with peri-operative myocardial injury and in-hospital all-cause mortality, and that elevated PTH level contributes to both disturbed bone metabolism and poor outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Diseases with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) such as primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism are associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and death. However, data on the prospective association between circulating PTH levels and cardiovascular mortality in the community are lacking. Methods and Results\u2014 The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM), a community-based cohort of elderly men (mean age, 71 years; n=958), was used to investigate the association between plasma PTH and cardiovascular mortality. During follow-up (median, 9.7 years), 117 participants died of cardiovascular causes. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for established cardiovascular risk factors (age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, antihypertensive treatment, lipid-lowering treatment, and history of cardiovascular disease), higher plasma PTH was associated with higher risk for cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio for 1-SD increase in PTH, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 1.60; P<0.001). This association remained essentially unaltered in participants without previous cardiovascular disease and in participants with normal PTH (<6.8 pmol/L) with no other signs of a disturbed mineral metabolism (normal serum calcium, 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L; normal glomerular filtration rate, >50 mL \u00b7 min\u22121 \u00b7 1.73 m\u22122 and without vitamin D deficiency, plasma 25-OH vitamin D >37.5 nmol/L). Interestingly, elevated plasma PTH (>5.27 pmol/L) accounted for 20% (95% confidence interval, 10 to 26) of the population-attributable risk proportion for cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions\u2014 Plasma PTH levels predict cardiovascular mortality in the community, even in individuals with PTH within the normal range. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical implications of measuring PTH in cardiovascular risk prediction and to elucidate whether PTH is a modifiable risk factor.",

Participants were followed until 1 December 2008 for mortality and CVD events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring a median follow-up of 6.0 years, 220 participants died and 182 had CVD events. Compared with participants with FGF-23 levels in the lowest tertile, those in the highest tertile had 2-fold greater risk for mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.24]) and CVD events (HR, 1.83 [CI, 1.15 to 2.91]) after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, C-reactive protein levels, and kidney function. The highest ucMGP tertile was associated with lower mortality risk (HR, 0.48 [CI, 0.31 to 0.75]) and showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower CVD event risk by tertile analysis (HR, 0.65 [CI, 0.40 to 1.05])-an association that was significant when modeled continuously (P = 0.029). No significant association of fetuin-A with mortality (HR, 0.84 [CI, 0.55 to 1.27]) or CVD events (HR, 0.99 [CI, 0.64 to 1.55]) was observed.\n\n\nLIMITATION\nParticipants had prevalent CAD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn outpatients with stable CAD, higher FGF23 and lower ucMGP levels are independently associated with mortality and CVD events.\n\n\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nAmerican Heart Association.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with CKD. Elevated levels of FGF23 have been linked to greater risks of LVH and mortality in patients with CKD, but whether these risks represent causal effects of FGF23 is unknown. Here, we report that elevated FGF23 levels are independently associated with LVH in a large, racially diverse CKD cohort. FGF23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via FGF receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for FGF23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. Intramyocardial or intravenous injection of FGF23 in wild-type mice resulted in LVH, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated FGF23 levels and LVH. In an established animal model of CKD, treatment with an FGF-receptor blocker attenuated LVH, although no change in blood pressure was observed. These results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for FGF23 in the pathogenesis of LVH and suggest that chronically elevated FGF23 levels contribute directly to high rates of LVH and mortality in individuals with CKD.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been reported to induce left ventricular hypertrophy, but it remains unclear whether FGF23 plays a role in cardiac fibrosis. This study is attempted to investigate the role of FGF23 in post-infarct myocardial fibrosis in mice. We noted that myocardial and plasma FGF23 and FGF receptor 4 were increased in mice with heart failure as well as in cultured adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts (AMCFs) exposed to angiotensin II, phenylephrine, soluble fractalkine. Recombinant FGF23 protein increased active \u03b2-catenin , procollagen I and procollagen III expression in cultured AMCFs. Furthermore, intra-myocardial injection of adeno-associated virus-FGF23 in mice significantly increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and myocardial fibrosis, and markedly upregulated active \u03b2-catenin, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), procollagen I and procollagen III in both myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia/reperfusion (IR) mice, while \u03b2-catenin inhibitor or silencing of \u03b2-catenin antagonized the FGF23-promoted myocardial fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that FGF23 promotes myocardial fibrosis and exacerbates diastolic dysfunction induced by MI or IR, which is associated with the upregulation of active \u03b2-catenin and TGF-\u03b2.",

        "abstract": "Background\nFibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is discussed as a new biomarker of cardiac hypertrophy and mortality in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). We previously demonstrated that FGF23 is expressed by cardiac myocytes, enhanced in CKD and induces cardiac hypertrophy via activation of FGF receptor 4 independent of its co-receptor klotho. The impact of FGF23 on cardiac fibrosis is largely unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nBy conducting a retrospective case-control study including myocardial autopsy samples from 24 patients with end-stage CKD and in vitro studies in cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes, we investigated the pro-fibrotic properties of FGF23.\n\n\nResults\nThe accumulation of fibrillar collagens I and III was increased in myocardial tissue of CKD patients and correlated with dialysis vintage, klotho deficiency and enhanced cardiac angiotensinogen (AGT) expression. Using human fibrosis RT2 Profiler PCR array analysis, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and its related TGF-\u03b2 receptor/Smad complexes, extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes and pro-fibrotic growth factors were upregulated in myocardial tissue of CKD patients. FGF23 stimulated cell proliferation, migration, pro-fibrotic TGF-\u03b2 receptor/Smad complexes and collagen synthesis in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. In isolated cardiac myocytes, FGF23 enhanced collagen remodeling, expression of pro-inflammatory genes and pro-survival pathways and induced pro-hypertrophic genes. FGF23 stimulated AGT expression in cardiac myocytes and angiotensin II and aldosterone, as components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), induced FGF23 in cardiac myocytes.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data demonstrate that activated RAAS induces FGF23 expression in cardiac myocytes and thereby stimulates a pro-fibrotic crosstalk between cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, which may contribute to myocardial fibrosis in CKD.",

        "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are prone to developing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which is associated with increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) serum levels. Elevated circulating FGF23 was shown to induce left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) via the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and contributed to cardiac fibrosis by stimulation of profibrotic factors. We hypothesized that FGF23 may also stimulate the local renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) in the heart, thereby further promoting the progression of FGF23-mediated cardiac pathologies. We evaluated LVH and fibrosis in association with cardiac FGF23 and activation of RAAS in heart tissue of 5/6 nephrectomized (5/6Nx) rats compared to sham-operated animals followed by in vitro studies with isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and fibroblast (NRVM, NRCF), respectively. Uremic rats showed enhanced cardiomyocyte size and cardiac fibrosis compared with sham. The cardiac expression of Fgf23 and RAAS genes were increased in 5/6Nx rats and correlated with the degree of cardiac fibrosis. In NRVM and NRCF, FGF23 stimulated the expression of RAAS genes and induced Ngal indicating mineralocorticoid receptor activation. The FGF23-mediated hypertrophic growth of NRVM and induction of NFAT target genes were attenuated by cyclosporine A, losartan and spironolactone. In NRCF, FGF23 induced Tgfb and Ctgf, which were suppressed by losartan and spironolactone, only. Our data suggest that FGF23-mediated activation of local RAAS in the heart promotes cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that aldosterone may be one of the driving forces behind increased FGF23 secretion in CKD. Methods Using data from a prospective study in humans, a retrospective study in dogs and cats, and an experimental study in 5/6-nephrectomized mice, we analyzed the relationship between circulating FGF23 and serum aldosterone levels in CKD across four species. To assess the effects of acute inhibition of aldosterone signaling on circulating FGF23, we acutely treated mice with established CKD with the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker canrenone (50 mg/kg iv/sc), and measured intact FGF23 before and 24 h as well as 72 h after start of administration of the drug. Results We found a tight positive association between circulating intact FGF23 and serum aldosterone in human, canine, and feline CKD patients, as well as in experimental murine CKD (humans: rS = 0.57, p = 0.0368; dogs: rS = 0.66, p = 0.0019; cats: rS = 0.75, p = 0.0003; mice: rS = 0.49, p = 0.0004). Injection of canrenone in mice with established CKD did not lead to changes in FGF23 levels within 24 h, but reduced FGF23 in all mice at 72 h.
