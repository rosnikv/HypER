        "title": "Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor to reduce postpercutaneous coronary intervention myonecrosis and improve coronary flow in diabetics: the \u2018OPTIMIZE-IT\u2019 pilot randomized study",
        "abstract": "Background Subgroup analyses of trials enrolling acute coronary syndrome patients suggest that inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa can improve the outcome of diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), possibly by improving microvascular perfusion. However, the efficacy of small-molecule IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors to improve microvascular perfusion in stable diabetic patients undergoing elective PCI has not been specifically investigated. Methods We randomized consecutive stable diabetic patients, undergoing elective PCI, to tirofiban or placebo groups along with double antiplatelet therapy. High-dose bolus (25 \u03bcg/kg per 3 min) of tirofiban was administered immediately before PCI followed by 8 h continuous infusion (0.15 \u03bcg/kg per min). Postprocedural myonecrosis was assessed prospectively by measurement of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) at 6 and 24 h after PCI. The primary end-points were post-PCI coronary flow estimated by corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count and post-PCI myocardial infarction. Platelet aggregation was measured by platelet function analyser-100 values. Results Forty-six patients entered the study (22 randomized to placebo and 24 randomized to tirofiban). The study drug was associated with a significant increase of platelet function analyser-100 values that peaked immediately after PCI and was maintained at 6 h (pre-PCI: 131 \u00b1 65 s; post-PCI: 222 \u00b1 49 s; after 6 h: 219 \u00b1 55 s). Post-PCI corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count was similar in tirofiban and in placebo groups (10.2 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 12.0 \u00b1 7.6, P = 0.30, respectively). The prevalence of raised cTnT levels was similar in the two groups (25 vs. 30%, P = 0.56, respectively). At multivariate analysis, direct stenting (associated with reduced myonecrosis) and postdilatation (associated with increased myonecrosis) predicted cTnT elevation. Conclusion A high-dose bolus of tirofiban in stable diabetic patients undergoing elective PCI, along with double antiplatelet therapy, was associated with a significant further inhibition of platelet aggregation which, however, did not translate in a lower incidence of post-PCI distal embolization.",

        "abstract": "Background The Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study (SANTISS) is an open-label investigator-initiated single-centre registry launched to assess the combination of bleeding and access site in-hospital complications (primary end-point) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by femoral approach only. Methods We compared patients who were on oral single antiaggregating drug (AAD) and received, just prior to PCI, high-dose tirofiban and a second oral antiplatelet agent (triple AAD: group 1, n = 970) with those who were already on an oral double AAD regimen and did not receive tirofiban (double AAD: group 2, n = 608). Results Group 2 patients were slightly older, presented less frequently with unstable angina and had chronic renal failure more frequently. They were more than twice as frequently on rescue PCI, being more than three-fold less frequently on primary PCI (all: 0.01>P < 0.001). Overall, there were 87 in-hospital (average 4.7 days of stay) complications: 51 (5.3%) in group 1 and 36 (5.9%) in group 2 (not significant). Haemotransfusions were needed in 34 patients: 21 (2.2%) in group 1 and 13 (2.1%) in group 2 (not significant). Of the 16 hospital deaths, eight (0.8%) were seen in group 1 and eight (1.3%) in group 2 (not significant). Multivariate prediction showed a high predictive accuracy (areas under the curve >0.700) of female sex, rescue PCI and chronic renal failure to index complications, with highly significant odds ratios. The presence of high-dose tirofiban did not increase complication risk. Conclusion In the real world, high-dose tirofiban is well tolerated by patients on elective, primary or rescue PCI, and the in-hospital complication rate, including major bleeding, is low. This may have pharmacoeconomic consequences.",

        "title": "Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Antagonists in Acute Coronary Syndromes Undergoing PCI: A Long Way to Select Optimal Agent and Route",
        "abstract": "Antiplatelet treatment in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), without or with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), forces to keep the balance between potential threats and optimal clinical advantages. Apart from clopidogrel, glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab and 2 small molecules, tirofiban and eptifibatide) have come to the clinical scene. Recent evidence (2009\u20132011) is reviewed pointing to pharmacoeconometric considerations of concern in times of budget restrictions worldwide. In ACS, when clopidogrel plus aspirin are on, there might be no advantage to add small molecules. Whereas in STEMI patients treated by primary PCI, all 3\u2009GP IIb/IIIa antagonists might be superimposable, when only ACS is present and PCI is elective, definite distinction among the 3 agents, both pharmacoeconomically and pharmacodynamically, might be invoked. There are still points open to debate. Among these the route (upstream versus downstream) is still a matter of uncertainties. Moreover, theoretically, there might be differences not only between abciximab and small molecules (mostly superimposable) but also between tirofiban and eptifibatide (the former being potentially more potent). Thus, a long way is needed before a prominent agent among GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be selected. The game is still open, a role will be played soon by new agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To assess the efficacy of tirofiban in comparison to usual care or other GPIIb/IIIa antagonists (eptifibatide and abciximab). Results were analysed by drug administration with planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or as medical management without planned PCI, and separately for STEMI or NSTE ACS patients. Research design and methods: A systematic review was performed of randomized controlled trials of tirofiban, abciximab, eptifibatide or usual care given to patients with acute coronary syndrome. Nine databases were searched up to March 2010. Pair-wise meta-analysis was used to combine all available direct comparisons; indirect comparisons and network analysis were performed when this was not possible. The primary outcome was MACE (major adverse cardiac event). Results: The search yielded 8, 119 records and 50 trials were included (total number of patients\u2009=\u200952,958). Compared to usual care, high and medium-dose tirofiban (25 and 10\u2009\u00b5g/kg/min) administered with planned PCI reduced MACE at 30 days for patients with STEMI (RR\u20090.67, 95% CI 0.45, 0.99; RR\u20090.28, 95% CI 0.10, 0.80), but was not effective as a medical management. Medium-dose tirofiban (10\u2009\u00b5g/kg/min) administered with planned PCI or low dose (0.4\u2009\u00b5g/kg/min) as medical management reduced the risk of MACE for patients with NSTE ACS (RR\u20090.39, 95% CI 0.21, 0.75; RR\u20090.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.83) in comparison to usual care, but at the expense of increased thrombocytopenia (RR\u20093.26, 95% CI 1.31, 8.13). Evidence from RCTs and network analysis indicated tirofiban and abciximab were equally effective and safe. Comparing tirofiban and eptifibatide treatment by indirect and network analysis produced inconclusive results. Conclusions: Tirofiban was more effective than usual care for STEMI and NSTE ACS patients receiving planned PCI, and NSTE ACS patients receiving medical management. Tirofiban and abciximab were equally effective. Comparisons of tirofiban and eptifibatide were inconclusive.",

        "title": "Short-term follow-up of tirofiban as alternative therapy for urgent surgery patients with an implanted coronary drug-eluting stent after ST-elevation myocardial infarction",
        "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with a recently diagnosed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and implanted coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) who need urgent surgery are at increased risk of surgical bleeding unless aspirin and clopidogrel are discontinued beforehand. However, discontinuation of aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with a high rate of recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, and malignant arrhythmias because of stent thrombosis. The main point of debate is how to treat these patients. We hypothesized that perioperative intravenous administration of tirofiban, a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor, would allow the safe withdrawal of aspirin and clopidogrel without increasing the risk of surgical bleeding. MethodsTwenty-one patients implanted with a coronary DES after STEMI who underwent urgent surgery were selected for this clinical trial. Tirofiban was used to replace aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet drugs) before and after urgent surgery. Major adverse cardiovascular and bleeding events were observed during hospitalization and within 3 months of discharge. ResultsTwenty-one patients with recently diagnosed STEMI and implanted DES [median (range) 6 (3\u20138) months] and high-risk characteristics for stent thrombosis underwent urgent major surgery. Tirofiban was used to replace aspirin and clopidogrel 5 days before surgery, stopped 4 h before surgery, and resumed until oral aspirin and clopidogrel was resumed after surgery. There were no deaths, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or surgical re-exploration because of bleeding during hospitalization and within 3 months of discharge. There was one case of acute left ventricular failure during hospitalization. ConclusionIn patients who need urgent surgery after recently diagnosed STEMI and implanted DES, a strategy using tirofiban may allow temporary withdrawal of dual antiplatelet drugs without increasing the risk of bleeding. This conclusion needs to be further confirmed by large-scale randomized clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To review the efficacy and safety of perioperative administration of intravenous (IV) antiplatelet agents as a substitute for oral P2Y12 inhibitors and to provide clinicians guidance on optimal and cost-effective use of these medications. Data Sources: A MEDLINE literature search (1950 to November 2018) was performed using the key search terms abciximab, bridging, cangrelor, cardiac surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, eptifibatide, intravenous antiplatelet agent, and tirofiban. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations. Study Selection and Data Extraction: In all, 18 original research reports and case reports/series were included in the review. Data Synthesis: Prevention of postoperative bleeding is critical to decrease morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. IV antiplatelet medications have short half-lives and are frequently used to substitute for oral P2Y12 inhibitors to allow platelet function recovery before procedures. Functional recovery of platelets is delayed after abciximab discontinuation and increases postoperative bleeding risk. Eptifibatide and tirofiban have similar pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties and comparable efficacy and safety in the setting of perioperative bridging. Cangrelor may be considered in patients with renal insufficiency as decreased clearance of eptifibatide or tirofiban may increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Comparative studies of IV antiplatelet medications have not been published. Appropriate use of IV antiplatelet medications can prevent perioperative ischemic events and bleeding. Conclusions: Eptifibatide, tirofiban, and cangrelor are preferred over abciximab as a perioperative bridge. The choice of agent should be tailored to clinical characteristics of the patient and institutional acquisition costs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In cases of large-vessel-occlusion strokes due to an underlying tandem internal carotid artery occlusion or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, concomitant stent placement may be needed. Immediate platelet inhibition is necessary, but to date, a standardized approach for antiplatelet inhibition in acute settings is still missing. Here we report our single-center experience about the safety and efficacy of periprocedural administration of cangrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial or cervical artery occlusion undergoing stent placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all cases of acute ischemic stroke that needed acute stent implantation and were treated with periprocedural administration of cangrelor between January 2019 and April 2020 at our institution. All patients who needed either extracranial or intracranial artery stent placement (in either the anterior or posterior circulation) were included. RESULTS: We evaluated 38 patients in whom cangrelor was administered IV periprocedurally. Their mean age was 64\u2009years (range, 26\u201385 years), with 25/38 male subjects and 13/38 female patients. In 26 patients (68.4%), a tandem occlusion was present and was treated with carotid artery stent placement, while 12 patients (31.6%) required an intracranial stent implantation. In 4 subjects (10.5%), an intracerebral hemorrhage occurred after the procedure. All patients in the series were alive 1\u2009week after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Although larger, multicentric randomized studies are strongly warranted, our results support the hypothesis of a possible role of cangrelor as a valuable therapeutic option in the management of platelet inhibition in acute ischemic stroke procedures after intra- or extracranial stent placement.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neurointerventional procedures in acute ischemic stroke often require immediate antiplatelet therapy in the cases of acute stenting and occasionally re-occluding vessels. Intravenous cangrelor is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist with short onset and quick offset. The study objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous cangrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke requiring urgent antiplatelet effect. Methods: Patients who received intravenous cangrelor intra-procedurally during acute ischemic stroke treatment were identified from a prospectively collected database. Cangrelor was administered as a bolus of 15 mcg/kg, followed by an infusion rate of 2 mcg/kg/min. A historical control group consisting of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was used to compare to patients with similar lesions who received intravenous cangrelor. Outcomes of interest included in-stent thrombosis, thromboembolic complications, intracranial hemorrhage, and functional outcomes at 90 days. Results: Twelve patients received intravenous cangrelor for acute ischemic stroke between October 2018 and April 2020 at a comprehensive stroke center. Eleven patients had intra or extracranial stenting performed, which included two posterior circulation lesions. No cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were reported. At 90 day follow-up, two patients had died and 10 had a good functional outcome. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusions who received cangrelor and those who received dual antiplatelets orally had similar radiographic and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Low dose intravenous cangrelor is similar in safety and efficacy to oral antiplatelets in acute ischemic stroke in a small case series. Larger prospective studies on the efficacy, safety, and effect on procedure times of intravenous cangrelor in neurointervention are warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rescue therapies are increasingly used in the setting of endovascular therapy for large-vessel occlusion strokes. Among these, cangrelor, a new P2Y12 inhibitor, offers promising pharmacologic properties to join the reperfusion strategies in acute stroke. We assessed the safety and efficacy profiles of cangrelor combined with endovascular therapy in patients with large-vessel-occlusion stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective patient data analysis in the ongoing prospective multicenter observational Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke Registry in France from July 2018 to December 2020 and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using several data bases. Indications for cangrelor administration were rescue strategy in case of refractory intracranial occlusion with or without intracranial rescue stent placement, and cervical carotid artery stent placement in case of cervical occlusion (tandem occlusion or isolated cervical carotid occlusion). RESULTS: In the clinical registry, 44 patients were included (median initial NIHSS score, 12; prior intravenous thrombolysis, 29.5%). Intracranial stent placement was performed in 54.5% (n\u2009=\u200924/44), and cervical stent placement, in 27.3% (n\u2009=\u200912/44). Adjunctive aspirin and heparin were administered in 75% (n\u2009=\u200933/44) and 40.9% (n\u2009=\u200918/44), respectively. Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma, and 90-day mortality were 9.5% (n\u2009=\u20094/42), 9.5% (n\u2009=\u20094/42), and 24.4% (n\u2009=\u200910/41).

Dose adjusted cangrelor based on platelet function testing is suggested to be advantageous for use during neuroendovascular procedures. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy. Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients who received low dose intravenous cangrelor (5\u2009\u00b5g/kg; infusion 1\u2009\u00b5g/kg/min) for ruptured (RIA) and unruptured (UIA) intracranial aneurysms, and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Indications were acute stenting or intraluminal thrombus. Outcomes were assessed at 24\u2009hours by brain CT and CT angiography. The primary efficacy outcome was the rate of stent occlusion or persistent intraluminal thrombus. The primary safety outcome was the rate of major hemorrhages. Results 101 patients (56 men; median age (IQR) 59 (51\u201370) years) received low dose cangrelor for acute stenting (79/101 (78%)) and intraprocedural thrombus (22/101 (22%)). Overall, 5 (4.9%) patients experienced stent occlusion within 24\u2009hours (RIA 3/28; AIS 2/52). There were no cases of failure among UIA patients. Stent mis-opening (fish mouthing or stenosis >50%) was significantly associated with stent occlusion (P<0.001). The overall rate of major hemorrhage was 2% (2/101), which occurred in AIS patients. Platelet reactivity unit (PRU) values were lower in those presenting with major hemorrhage (PRU 4 (SD 1.4) vs PRU 60 (SD 63); P=0.043). Mortality rate after cangrelor related hemorrhage was 1%.

Cangrelor was associated with improved odds of favorable outcome, defined as mRS score 0-2, at discharge (aOR=2.69, P=0.001) and on 90-day follow-up (aOR=2.23, P=0.031).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCangrelor was associated with a decreased risk of hemorrhagic conversion and might lead to favorable functional outcomes for patients during hospitalization in comparison with GPIs. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate its use in EVT.",
