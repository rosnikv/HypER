        "title": "Azathioprine versus sulfasalazine in maintenance of remission in severe ulcerative colitis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAzathioprine is useful as a steroid-sparing drug in patients with ulcerative colitis. Its role as monotherapy in the maintenance of disease remission has not been evaluated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this prospective, randomized, open-label study, 25 patients with severe ulcerative colitis received either azathioprine (2.5 mg/Kg/day; Group A, n = 12) or sulfasalazine (6 g/day; Group B, n = 13). All patients received oral corticosteroids in a tapering dosage schedule initially. Treatment failure was defined as either disease relapse or drug withdrawal because of adverse effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive of 12 patients in Group A and 8 of 13 patients in Group B had sustained remission during the stipulated study period of 18 months (p = ns). Two patients in Group A had to stop azathioprine because of adverse effects (bone marrow suppression and acute pancreatitis). In Group A, all patients who had treatment failure developed it in the first half of the study while in Group B treatment failure occurred in both halves.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe relapse rate of ulcerative colitis on maintenance therapy with azathioprine or sulfasalazine is comparable; there was a trend towards earlier treatment failure with azathioprine.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo evaluate the role of azathioprine (AZA) in Indian patients with ulcerative colitis over longer duration of time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred fifty six patients with ulcerative colitis who were treated with AZA from January 1995 to December 2003 were reviewed. The indications for its use were as follows: (1) steroid dependent and steroid refractory disease; (2) Azathioprine monotherapy for naive patients with severe disease; and (3) combination therapy (AZA + sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates) for naive patients with severe disease. The data included patient and disease demographics, efficacy and toxicity profile of AZA. Patients with a minimum duration of 6 mo use of AZA were included in this report.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf a total of 156 patients treated with AZA, 45 were excluded from analysis for the following reasons- (follow up less than 6 mo, n = 9; poor follow up, n = 18; adverse affects, n = 18). In steroid refractory/dependent group the mean number of relapses prior to and post initiation of AZA therapy were 3.28 (+/- 0.81) and 0.94 (+/- 0.29) respectively. Discontinuation of steroids could be accomplished in 12 of the 15 steroid dependent patients. The proportion of patients with sustained remission of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years duration were calculated. Eighteen patients experienced adverse effects necessitating withdrawal of AZA (pancreatitis, n = 7; hepatitis, n = 3; gastrointestinal intolerance, n = 2; alopecia, n = 2; and hematological, n = 4) while 13 patients needed dose reduction or temporary withdrawal of the drug.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAzathioprine is well tolerated and has therapeutic benefits lasting as long as 4 years. Adverse effects such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, cytopenias and gastrointestinal symptoms do occur but are controlled by drug withdrawal only.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Pancreatitis occurs as an extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the cause is poorly understood. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is overexpressed in an abnormal, hypoglycosylated form on the colonic epithelium in human IBD where it contributes to inflammation. MUC1 is also expressed on pancreatic ductal epithelia. We tested the possibility that in IBD, MUC1 expression on pancreatic ducts is also abnormal leading to inflammation and pancreatitis. Methods: We used MUC1+/interleukin-10\u2212/\u2212 mice that develop IBD. We imaged abnormal MUC1 expression in these mice by adoptively transferring T cells from T cell receptor transgenic mice specific for abnormal MUC1. Cells were labeled with a novel perfluorocarbon tracer reagent and quantified and visualized in vivo using high-throughput 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: MUC1-specific T cells migrated to the colon in mice with IBD and also to the pancreas. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased expression on the pancreatic ducts of the abnormal MUC1 seen in the colon and the presence of cellular infiltrate. Conclusions: Migration of MUC1-specific T cells to the colon and the pancreas in diseased mice suggests that pancreatitis is an extraintestinal site of IBD, characterized by proinflammatory abnormal expression of MUC1. Therapies directed against abnormal MUC1 have the potential of targeting the disease in both sites.",

        "title": "Healing of intestinal inflammation by IL\u201022",
        "abstract": "&NA; An interleukin (IL)\u201010 family cytokine, IL\u201022 is characterized by several unique biological properties, including 1) the target restricted to innate cells; 2) the distinct expression pattern between large and small intestines; 3) alteration of the cellular source depending on several factors; 4) the dual abilities to serve as protective versus proinflammatory mediators in inflammatory responses; and 5) the close association with some major inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility genes. The major functions of IL\u201022 in the intestine are the stimulation of epithelial cells to produce a wide variety of antibacterial proteins, the reinforcement of mucus barrier through stimulation of mucin 1 production under intestinal inflammatory conditions, and the enhancement of epithelial regeneration with goblet cell restitution. Through these beneficial functions, IL\u201022 contributes to the improvement of some types of experimental chronic colitis, which are mediated by T helper (Th)1 or Th2 responses. Most important, studies using both loss\u2010of\u2010function and gain\u2010of\u2010function approaches have clearly demonstrated the ability of IL\u201022 to promote intestinal wound healing from acute intestinal injury. These findings highlight IL\u201022 as an attractive and promising target for future IBD therapy. Alternatively, the enormous progress in the field of IL\u201022 biology has also suggested more complicated mechanisms with the IL\u201022 pathway than previously predicted. This review article briefly summarizes previous and current knowledge on IL\u201022 particularly associated with intestinal inflammation. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2012;)",

        "abstract": "Abstract:Inflammatory bowel disease accounts for significant patient morbidity in the Western world. Several immunosuppressive therapies are available but are associated with potential significant adverse effects. In addition, there remains a cohort of patients with refractory or relapsing disease. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic agents continues. In this review, we evaluate the role of a number of designated cytokines that are candidates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and discuss how their manipulation has been explored as a therapeutic strategy for this disease. The interleukins (ILs) chosen for discussion reflect those that currently show most promise as future therapeutic targets, as well as discussing the role of some of the most recently identified ILs, such as IL-27, IL-33, IL-35, and IL-22, in this context.",

        "title": "Targeting IL-33 in Autoimmunity and Inflammation",
        "abstract": "Interleukin-33 (IL-33) belongs to the IL-1 family of cytokines. Whereas IL-1 is processed and released by live immune cells in response to infection or other triggers, IL-33 is mostly released as a danger signal (\u201calarmin\u201d) from damaged cells. IL-33 may also be processed and released from activated mast cells (MCs) with subsequent autocrine and paracrine actions. IL-33 augments the stimulatory effects of IgE and substance P on MCs but can also trigger release of cytokines from MCs on its own. Blood IL-33 levels are increased in asthma, atopic dermatitis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. However, prolonged elevation of IL-33 downregulates Fc\u03b5RI and may be protective in atherosclerosis, suggesting different roles in immune-regulated diseases. Even though neutralizing IL-33, knocking-down its receptor, or using its soluble \u201cdecoy\u201d receptor has resulted in anti-inflammatory effects, there appear to be different outcomes in different tissues. Hence, selective regulation of IL-33 synthesis, release, and signaling may be required to provide effective treatment options.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To examine the effect of hydrogen water (HW) on the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) and elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: For this experimental study between March 2015 and December 2015, NC/Nga mice characterized by mild AD severity were given either HW (n=11) or purified water (PW) (n=9) ad libitum; specific-pathogen-free mice (n=9) were used as AD-free control. Atopic dermatitis severity score and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were examined at baseline (0 week), and after 4 weeks of HW/PW treatment. Levels of serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and cytokines in the AD lesion were measured by ELISA; and mRNA expression of TARC and aquaporin (AQP-3) genes in the skin was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Mice treated with HW for 4 weeks demonstrated a significant decrease in the AD severity score compared with PW-treated mice (p<0.01). Hydrogen water administration also significantly reduced TEWL and serum TARC levels (p<0.01), infiltration of mast cells (p<0.05), and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-33 (p<0.05) in skin lesions compared with PW. However, no difference was observed between PW and HW groups in interferon-g secretion and expression of AQP-3 and TARC genes. Conclusion: Hydrogen water suppressed inflammation in AD mice, leading to amelioration of disease severity, which suggests the therapeutic potential of HW in AD treatment.",

        "abstract": "Tomato seeds contain steroidal saponins called lycoperosides. However, it currently remains unclear whether lycoperosides exert anti-inflammatory or anti-allergic effects. Therefore, we herein investigated the effects of tomato seed extract (TSE) and lycoperoside H (LH) in Interleukin (IL)-33 transgenic mice. TSE (500\u00a0mg/kg) or LH (10\u00a0mg/kg) was orally administered once a day for 101\u00a0days and then evaluated mouse behavior, skin symptoms, and blood and skin inflammatory cytokines. TSE slightly suppressed scratching behavior, while TSE and LH both increased locomotive activity. LH also significantly suppressed inflammation scores in the limbs, and TSE and LH reduced transepidermal water loss. Epidermal hyperplasia and the accumulation of eosinophils and mast cells were decreased by TSE and LH. Skin Th2/Th1 cytokine ratio and serum IgE concentrations were significantly reduced by TSE and LH. The present results suggest that the oral administration of LH derived from tomato seeds effectively ameliorates the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It has been reported that tomato seeds contain steroidal saponins, lycoperosides, though the effects of lycoperosides on anti-inflammatory or anti-allergic have not yet been revealed. In this study, we demonstrated that the oral administration of lycoperoside H derived from tomato seeds suppressed atopic dermatitis symptoms in IL-33 transgenic mice.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that hyperglycemia leads to the progression and expansion of various micro and macrovascular disease such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). Lycoperoside H (LH) alkaloidal saponin exhibited the antidiabetic effect, but its DN effect is unclear. In this experimental study, we scrutinized the renal protective effect of LH against the streptozotocin (STZ)\u2010induced DN in rats and explore the underlying mechanism. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were used in this experimental study and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45\u2009mg/kg) was used for the induction of diabetes, rats received the oral administration of LH (20\u2009mg/kg). The blood glucose level, body weight, organ weight (renal and pancreas), and biochemical parameters were estimated. We also scrutinized the effect of LH to enhance intestinal barrier function and suppress inflammation and intestinal permeability. LH significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) decreased the glucose level and enhanced the body weight with a reduction of renal weight and boost the pancreas weight. LH significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) enhanced the creatinine level and decreased the albumin level, urine volume, urinary albumin excretion rate, and urinary albumin creatinine ratio in the urine. It also suppressed the renal parameters, such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urea. LH significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) altered the level of lipid and antioxidant parameters. LH treatment significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) suppressed the cytokines and inflammatory parameters. LH considerably enhanced the Ruminococcaceae, Blautia, and suppressed the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Turicibacter. It reduced the F/B ratio along with alteration of community abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, other bacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The current result suggests that LH suppressed the diabetic nephropathological condition via alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element in animals, but excessive intake can lead to renal toxicity damage. Thus, the exploration of effective natural antagonists to reduce the toxicity caused by Zn has become a major scientific problem. Methods Here, we found that hesperidin could effectively alleviate the renal toxicity induced by Zn in pigs by using hematoxylin-eosin staining, transmission electron microscope, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence quantitative PCR, and microfloral DNA sequencing. Results The results showed that hesperidin could effectively attenuate the pathological injury in kidney, and reduce autophagy and apoptosis induced by Zn, which evidenced by the downregulation of LC3, ATG5, Bak1, Bax, Caspase-3 and upregulation of p62 and Bcl2. Additionally, hesperidin could reverse colon injury and the decrease of ZO-1 protein expression. Interestingly, hesperidin restored the intestinal flora structure disturbed by Zn, and significantly reduced the abundance of Tenericutes (phylum level) and Christensenella (genus level). Discussion Thus, altered intestinal flora and intestinal barrier function constitute the gut-kidney axis, which is involved in hesperidin alleviating Zn-induced nephrotoxicity. Our study provides theoretical basis and practical significance of hesperidin for the prevention and treatment of Zn-induced nephrotoxicity through gut-kidney axis.",
