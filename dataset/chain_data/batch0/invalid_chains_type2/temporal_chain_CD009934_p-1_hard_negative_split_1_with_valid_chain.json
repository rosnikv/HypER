        "abstract": "Introduction Emerging randomised controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effect of green tea (GT) supplementation or GT extract (GTE) on blood pressure (BP) among overweight and obese adults yielded inconclusive results. We aim to conduct a systematic review to summarise the evidence of RCTs until now, to clarify the efficacy of GT supplementation or GTE in BP in overweight and obese populations. Methods and analysis The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched to retrieve potential RCTs. Unpublished studies will be identified by searching the abstract books or websites of the three major conference proceedings: the International Society of Hypertension, the Nutrition & Health Conference and the World Congress of Nutrition and Health. A random-effects meta-analysis will be performed to pool the mean difference for the change in BP from baseline (ie, postintervention BP minus baseline BP) between intervention groups and placebo groups of the included studies, presenting the pooled results with 95% CIs. Subgroups analyses will be conducted according to different doses of GT or GTE, trial duration, geographic regions, overweight versus obese participants, and participants with versus without change in body weight after intervention. Sensitivity analysis will be performed by excluding studies classified as having a high risk of bias, applying a fixed-effects model, using the postintervention BP for analyses and excluding trials with non-study cointerventions. Ethics and dissemination This systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. It will be disseminated electronically and in print. Summarising the RCT evidence to clarify the efficacy in BP among overweight and obese adults will aid in making the dietary recommendation of GT and improving the clinical management of hypertension.

        "abstract": "Background: Emerging randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of green tea or green tea extract (GTE) supplementation on blood pressure (BP) among overweight and obese adults reported inconsistent findings. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the efficacy of green tea or GTE on BP among overweight and obese adults. Methods: Electronic databases, conference proceedings and gray literature were searched systematically to include parallel and cross-over RCTs examining the efficacy of green tea or GTE on BP compared with placebo. Data were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model, to compare the mean difference of the change in BP from baseline in the intervention and the placebo groups. Results: Fourteen RCTs with 971 participants (47% women) were pooled for analysis. Green tea or GTE produced a significant effect on both SBP (mean difference \u22121.42\u200ammHg, 95% confidence interval \u22122.47 to \u22120.36, P\u200a=\u200a0.008; I2\u200a=\u200a52%, P\u200a=\u200a0.01 for heterogeneity) and DBP (mean difference \u22121.25\u200ammHg, 95% confidence interval \u22122.32 to \u22120.19, P\u200a=\u200a0.02; I2\u200a=\u200a74%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001 for heterogeneity), compared with placebo. The quality of evidence across studies was low. Similar results were found in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Among overweight and obese adults, green tea or GTE supplementation is found to cause a small but significant reduction in BP. More high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes are needed to further confirm the efficacy on BP and make strong recommendations for green tea or GTE supplementation among the overweight and obese adults.",

        "title": "Beneficial Effects of Tea and the Green Tea Catechin Epigallocatechin-3-gallate on Obesity",
        "abstract": "Green tea has been shown to have beneficial effects against cancer, obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, bacterial and viral infections, and dental caries. The catechin (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has shown the highest biological activity among green tea catechins (GTCs) in most of the studies. While several epidemiological studies have shown the beneficial effects of tea and GTCs on obesity, some studies have failed to do this. In addition, a large number of interventional clinical studies have shown these favorable effects, and cellular and animal experiments have supported those findings, and revealed the underlying anti-obesity mechanisms. One of the mechanisms is enhanced cellular production of reactive oxygen species, which is mediated through the pro-oxidant action of EGCG, leading to the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, which suppresses gene and protein expression of enzymes and transcription factors involved in adipogenesis and lipogenesis, and stimulates those involved in lipolysis. Recently, scientific evidence supporting the beneficial anti-obesity effects of green tea and GTCs has been increasing. However, future investigations are still required to clarify the reasons for the inconsistent results reported in the human studies; to achieve this, careful adjustment of confounding factors will be required.",

        "title": "EGCG Reduces Obesity and White Adipose Tissue Gain Partly Through AMPK Activation in Mice",
        "abstract": "(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the most abundant catechin in green tea, has many potential health benefits, including decreased weight gain and/or adipose tissue weight. Suggested mechanisms for body weight reduction by EGCG include: (1) a decrease in calorie intake and (2) activation of AMPK in liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue. However, only one study supports the AMPK hypothesis. To determine the role of AMPK in EGCG-induced reduction of body weight, we administrated 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg per day to mice, together with a high-fat diet (HFD), for 20 weeks. EGCG had a significant effect on obesity and decrease in epididymal adipose tissue weight, and also affected serum lipid characteristics, including triglyceride, cholesterol (CHOL), and high- and low-density lipoprotein CHOL (HDL-C, LDL-C) concentrations. In addition, EGCG increased the excretion of free fatty acids from feces. By measuring the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism, we found that EGCG inhibited the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of de novo fatty acids (acc1, fas, scd1, c/ebp\u03b2, ppar\u03b3, and srebp1) and increased the expression of genes associated with lipolysis (hsl) and lipid oxidization in white adipose tissue, in both the HFD and the EGCG groups. However, EGCG significantly increased the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of de novo fatty acids compared with the HFD group. Increased AMPK activity was found in both subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissues. In conclusion, EGCG can decrease obesity and epididymal white adipose tissue weight in mice, only partially via activation of AMPK.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is one of major risk factors increasing chronic diseases including type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. The effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major active compound in green tea, on reduced obesity and improved metabolic profiles are still controversial. Furthermore, the effects of EGCG on human adipocyte lipolysis and browning of white adipocytes have not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EGCG on obesity, lipolysis, and browning of human white adipocytes. The results showed that, when compared to the baseline values, EGCG significantly decreased fasting plasma triglyceride levels (P <\u20090.05), systolic blood pressure (P\u2009<\u20090.05), diastolic blood pressure (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and serum kisspeptin levels (P\u2009<\u20090.05) after 8 weeks of supplement. On the other hand, supplement of EGCG in obese human subjects for 4 or 8\u2009weeks did not decrease body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, nor total body fat mass or percentage when compared to their baseline values. The study in human adipocytes showed that EGCG did not increase the glycerol release when compared to vehicle, suggesting that it had no lipolytic effect. Furthermore, treatment of EGCG did not enhance uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA expression in human white adipocytes when compared with treatment of pioglitazone, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist, suggesting that EGCG did not augment the browning effect of PPAR-\u03b3 on white adipocytes. This study revealed that EGCG reduced 2 metabolic risk factors which are triglyceride and blood pressure in the human experiment. We also showed a novel evidence that EGCG decreased kisspeptin levels. However, EGCG had no effects on obesity reduction in humans, lipolysis, nor browning of human white adipocytes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is one of the most abundant and powerful flavonoids contained in green tea. Because of the global increase in green tea consumption, there has been a general interest in understanding its health benefits, including its bioactive compounds like EGCG. Indeed, preclinical evidence already indicates that EGCG demonstrated a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could be essential in protecting against metabolic syndrome. The current review explores clinical evidence reporting on the beneficial effects of EGCG supplementation in obese subjects or patients with diverse metabolic complications that include type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The discussion incorporates the impact of different formulations of EGCG, as well as the effective doses and treatment duration. Importantly, besides highlighting the potential use of EGCG as a nutraceutical, the current review also discusses crucial evidence related to its pharmaceutical development as an agent to hinder metabolic diseases, including its bioavailability and metabolism profile, as well as its well-known biological properties.",

        "abstract": "Green tea polyphenols have numerous functions including antioxidation and modulation of various cellular proteins and are thus beneficial against metabolic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, and their comorbidities. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant polyphenol in green tea and is attributed to antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, and the likelihood of targeting multiple metabolic pathways. It has been shown to exhibit anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-arteriosclerotic, and weight-reducing effects in humans. Worldwide, the incidences of metabolic diseases have been escalating across all age groups in modern society. Therefore, EGCG is being increasingly investigated to address the problems. This review presents the current updates on the effects of EGCG on metabolic diseases, and highlights evidence related to its safety. Collectively, this review brings more evidence for therapeutic application and further studies on EGCG and its derivatives to alleviate metabolic diseases and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.",

        "abstract": "Catechins, a class of phytochemicals found in various fruits and tea leaves, have garnered attention for their diverse health-promoting properties, including their potential in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Among these catechins, (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green tea, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are key pathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). EGCG has neuroprotective efficacy due to scavenging free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and attenuating neuroinflammatory processes. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms of EGCG\u2019s anti-oxidative stress and chronic neuroinflammation, emphasizing its effects on autoimmune responses, neuroimmune system interactions, and focusing on the related effects on AD and PD. By elucidating EGCG\u2019s mechanisms of action and its impact on neurodegenerative processes, this review underscores the potential of EGCG as a therapeutic intervention for AD, PD, and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, EGCG emerges as a promising natural compound for combating chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, offering novel avenues for neuroprotective strategies in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",
