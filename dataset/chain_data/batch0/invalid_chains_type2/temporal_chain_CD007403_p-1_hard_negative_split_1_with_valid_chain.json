        "title": "Use of Theraflex-TMJ Topical Cream for the Treatment of Temporomandibular Joint and Muscle Pain",
        "abstract": "Abstract This randomized, double-blind study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the topical cream Theraflex-TMJ (NaBob/Rx, San Mateo, CA) in patients with masseter muscle pain and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain. Fifty-two subjects (5 males and 47 females) were instructed to apply a cream over the afflicted masseter muscle(s) or over the jaw joint(s) twice daily for two weeks. Theraflex-TMJ cream was used by the experimental group, while a placebo cream was used by the control group. The means of pain ratings were calculated prior to the application of the cream (baseline), after ten days of tx (period 1), and 15 days of tx (period 2) days of treatment and five days after stopping the treatment (follow-up). There was a significant decrease in reported pain levels from baseline in the experimental group for period 1 (p<0.01), period 2 (p<0.001), and follow-up (p<0.01). For the control group, no significant differences were found between the different time periods (p>0.05). There was evidence of minor side effects such as skin irritation and/or burning on the site of the application in two subjects in the experimental as well as two subjects in the control groups. The data strongly suggest that Theraflex-TMJ topical cream is safe and effective for reducing pain in the masseter muscle and the temporomandibular joint.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRubefacients (containing salicylates or nicotinamides) cause irritation of the skin, and are believed to relieve various musculoskeletal pains. They are available on prescription, and are common components in over-the-counter remedies. A non-Cochrane review in 2004 found limited evidence for efficacy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo review current evidence for efficacy and safety of topically applied rubefacients in acute and chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nCochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and reference lists of articles were searched; last search December 2008.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised, double blind, placebo or active controlled clinical trials of topical rubefacient for musculoskeletal pain in adults, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, and reporting outcomes at close to 7 (minimum 3, maximum 10) days for acute conditions and 14 (minimum 7) days or longer for chronic conditions.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and quality, and extracted data. Relative benefit or risk and number needed to treat to benefit or harm (NNT or NNH) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Acute and chronic conditions were analysed separately.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSix placebo and one active controlled studies (560 and 137 participants) in acute pain, and seven placebo and two active controlled studies (489 and 90 participants) in chronic pain were included. All used topical salicylates. The evidence in acute conditions was not robust; using only better quality, valid studies, there was no difference between topical rubefacient and topical control, though overall, including lower quality studies, the NNT for clinical success compared with placebo was 3.2 (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.9). In chronic conditions the NNT was 6.2 (95% CI: 4.0 to 13) compared with topical placebo. Adverse events and withdrawals occurred more often with rubefacients than placebo, but analyses were sensitive to inclusion of individual studies, so not robust. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions against active controls.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence does not support the use of topical rubefacients containing salicylates for acute injuries, and suggests that in chronic conditions their efficacy compares poorly with topical non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Topical salicylates seem to be relatively well tolerated in the short-term, based on limited data. There is no evidence at all for topical rubefacients with other components.",

        "title": "Safety and Efficacy of Topical Diclofenac Sodium 1% Gel in Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide an alternative to oral NSAIDs to relieve pain from osteoarthritis (OA), reducing systemic exposure. This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter trial examined the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac sodium 1% gel (DSG) for symptomatic knee OA. Methods: Eligible patients were aged \u2265 35 years with symptomatic Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG) 1 to 3 OA in 1 or both knees for \u2265 6 months. Patients meeting entry criteria applied DSG 4 g or vehicle 4 times daily to the symptomatic knee(s). Primary endpoints were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and physical function subscales and global rating of benefit at week 12. Pain on movement at week 4 was an additional primary endpoint for European regulatory purposes. Secondary endpoints included primary outcomes at weeks 1, 4, and 8; WOMAC stiffness subscale; spontaneous pain; global rating of disease; and global evaluation of treatment. Subanalyses were performed according to KLG, the number of knees treated, and age. Results: Four hundred twenty patients were randomly assigned to DSG (n = 208) or vehicle (n = 212). At week 12, DSG provided significantly greater reductions in WOMAC pain (52.6% vs 43.1%; P = 0.008) and physical function (49.7% vs 39.4%; P = 0.004) versus vehicle and provided significant improvements in most secondary endpoints. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were infrequent (DSG, 7.7%; vehicle, 4.2%), with application site dermatitis being the most common AE (DSG, 4.8%; vehicle, 0%). No treatment-related gastrointestinal or serious AEs occurred with DSG. Conclusion: Topical DSG treatment provided effective pain relief and functional improvement of OA in 1 or both knees and was well tolerated, irrespective of disease severity or patient age.",

        "title": "Diclofenac topical solution compared with oral diclofenac: a pooled safety analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) formulations, which produce less systemic exposure compared with oral formulations, are an option for the management of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the overall safety and efficacy of these agents compared with oral or systemic therapy remains controversial. Methods Two 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled, multicenter studies compared the safety and efficacy profiles of diclofenac topical solution (TDiclo) with oral diclofenac (ODiclo). Each study independently showed that TDiclo had similar efficacy to ODiclo. To compare the safety profiles of TDiclo and ODiclo, a pooled safety analysis was performed for 927 total patients who had radiologically confirmed symptomatic OA of the knee. This pooled analysis included patients treated with TDiclo, containing 45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and those treated with ODiclo. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), recording of vital signs, dermatologic evaluation of the study knee, and clinical laboratory evaluation. Results AEs occurred in 312 (67.1%) patients using TDiclo versus 298 (64.5%) of those taking ODiclo. The most common AE with TDiclo was dry skin at the application site (24.1% vs 1.9% with ODiclo; P < 0.0001). Fewer gastrointestinal (25.4% vs 39.0%; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular (1.5% vs 3.5%; P = 0.055) AEs occurred with TDiclo compared with ODiclo. ODiclo was associated with significantly greater increases in liver enzymes and creatinine, and greater decreases in creatinine clearance and hemoglobin (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusions These findings suggest that TDiclo represents a useful alternative to oral NSAID therapy in the management of OA, with a more favorable safety profile.",

        "title": "Diclofenac in the treatment of osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Diclofenac is a nonselective NSAID that, in its oral form, has been used for decades in the treatment of osteoarthritis. More recently, topical formulations have been developed to decrease the significant systemic exposure associated with oral diclofenac. Several formulations of both oral and topical diclofenac are now approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the USA and Europe. Although diclofenac has generally been shown to be relatively safe, some significant safety risks have been observed. For instance, oral diclofenac displays the classic gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects of the NSAID class; however, topical formulations of the drug show a reduced incidence of these effects. Diclofenac is, thus, well established as an effective and relatively safe option for the treatment for osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder that can affect any joint in the human body. This study aimed to examine the anti-arthritic properties of high and low doses of grapefruit juice (GFJ), as grapefruit appears to contain anti-inflammatory biochemicals. Forty male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing 170\u2013180 g were divided into five groups. These groups comprised the untreated control group and osteoarthritic (Osteo) rats administered intra-articular injections of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (CFA; 0.5 mL; 1 mg/mL) as follows: OA rats administered low doses of GFJ (Osteo+GFJ (low); 5 mL/kg body weight (BW)); OA rats administered high doses of GFJ (Osteo+GFJ (high); 27 mL/kg BW); and OA rats administered diclofenac sodium (Osteo+Diclo) as a reference drug. Injections of CFA induced OA, as indicated by a significant increase in the serum levels of the inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and (prostaglandin (PGE2), as well as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1) and cathepsin K. The synovial levels of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) also increased, with a concomitant reduction in osteocalcin levels. The administration of either high or low doses of GFJ reduced CRP, IL-1\u03b2, PGE2, MMP-1, cathepsin K, and osteocalcin while increasing the synovial levels of GAGs, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, slowing cartilage degradation and boosting joint function. The results showed comparable histopathological and biochemical responses. A comparison of the treatments showed that high-dose GFJ had a greater chondroprotective effect than low-dose GFJ.",
