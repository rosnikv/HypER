        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether a 6-month home-based intervention program in adolescents with poorly controlled diabetes improves metabolic control and whether benefits are maintained after the intervention.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nAdolescents with a mean HbA1c of > 9.0% over the preceding 12 months received either routine care in a diabetes clinic and an ambulatory intervention for 6 months (n = 37) or routine care only (n = 32). A diabetes educator provided monthly home visits and weekly phone contact to educate and support the adolescents in setting goals for insulin adjustment, blood glucose monitoring, and target blood glucose range. There was no systematic change in the frequency of insulin injections. After the intervention, there was a 12-month follow-up when the intervention and control groups both received only routine care. Outcome measures were HbA1c and Diabetes Knowledge Assessment (DKN).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the intervention, mean HbA1c fell (baseline: 11.1 +/- 1.3%, 6 months: 9.7 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.0001) and mean knowledge scores increased (P = 0.0001) in the intervention group but not in control subjects. However, this improvement in HbA1c and increase in knowledge was not maintained in the intervention group at 12- and 18-month follow-up assessments. Parents' knowledge scores also improved significantly from baseline levels in the intervention group at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn ambulatory program improves metabolic control and knowledge in adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes; however, it is effective only while the intervention is maintained.",

        "title": "Increasing Problem Solving in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes: The Choices Diabetes Program",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that adolescents with type 1 diabetes can learn to become better problem solvers in diabetes self-care and thereby improve their metabolic control. METHODS Fifty-three adolescents aged 13 to 17 with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a 6-week problem-solving diabetes education program or to a control group (usual care). Al C levels were obtained as well as assessments of problem solving, frequency of behavior, level of responsibility, and 24-hour behavior recall at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS The experimental group participants showed significantly improved problem-solving test scores and Al C values from baseline to 6 months, changes not evident in the control group. At 6 months, the experimental group participants were doing blood glucose testing more often than those in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in problem-solving test scores or Al C values. CONCLUSIONS This 6-week intervention for adolescents with diabetes resulted in better problem-solving skills, more frequent blood glucose testing, and improved Al C values. The results suggest that a diabetes problem-solving program for adolescents can be effective in improving metabolic control.",

        "abstract": "Objectives We assessed the feasibility of ChatGPT for patients with type 2 diabetes seeking information about exercise. Methods In this pilot study, two physicians with expertise in diabetes care and rehabilitative treatment in Republic of Korea discussed and determined the 14 most asked questions on exercise for managing type 2 diabetes by patients in clinical practice. Each question was inputted into ChatGPT (V.4.0), and the answers from ChatGPT were assessed. The Likert scale was calculated for each category of validity (1\u20134), safety (1\u20134) and utility (1\u20134) based on position statements of the American Diabetes Association and American College of Sports Medicine. Results Regarding validity, 4 of 14 ChatGPT (28.6%) responses were scored as 3, indicating accurate but incomplete information. The other 10 responses (71.4%) were scored as 4, indicating complete accuracy with complete information. Safety and utility scored 4 (no danger and completely useful) for all 14 ChatGPT responses. Conclusion ChatGPT can be used as supplementary educational material for diabetic exercise. However, users should be aware that ChatGPT may provide incomplete answers to some questions on exercise for type 2 diabetes.",
