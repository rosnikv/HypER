        "abstract": "Background: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long\u2010term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. Methods: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low\u2010fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non\u2010EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. Results: On an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non\u2010EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1\u2010year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non\u2010EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)\u20101&bgr;, IL\u20106, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr; levels significantly increased with time in the non\u2010EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL\u20101&bgr;, P = 0.02; IL\u20106, P = 0.002; TNF\u2010&agr;, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. Conclusions: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.

        "abstract": "Enteral nutrition has long been a therapeutic alternative often used in adult Crohn's disease patients to obtain remission or clinical response, especially in those not responding to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids. However, the increasing use of immunosuppressors (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.), and the advent of biotherapies (especially anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies), decreased its use in adult Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, enteral nutrition remains of interest in patients presenting concomitant malnutrition (in particular in nonobstructed patients needing surgery), or in those intolerant or who failed to other therapeutics. In addition, recent studies provide data indicating its potential interest in maintenance therapy in selected patients groups. Finally, future research (in particular in the field of immuno- or pharmaconutrition) could lead to enteral formula's improvement, with better tolerance and acceptability, as well as increased efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Dietetic intervention with polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-\u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22) represents a relatively satisfactory therapeutic modality in adult patients with mild to moderately active Crohn\u2019s disease. However, there is no information concerning long-term results of this special diet. The aim of this study was to compare the results of the administration of a special diet (Modulen IBD) rich in TGF-\u03b22 with those of the administration of mesalamine, in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Methods: Of the 83 patients initially included in the study, 76 (91.5%) [36 in the Modulen and 30 in the mesalamine arm] completed the trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either two meals (2X50g) of Modulen IBD plus two regular meals per day (43 patients) or mesalamine (800mg three times a day) (40 patients) for six months. Patients were assessed at sixth months after initiation of the trial. Relapse was defined as a Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index of greater than 150 points or at least 60 points over baseline. Various anthropometric parameters and serum estimations including ESR, CRP, platelets, albumin, vitamin B12 and folic acid were carried out at the beginning of the trial and after six months. Results: Twenty-five patients in the Modulen arm (69%) continued to be in remission after six months compared with 18(60%) receiving mesalamine (no significant differences). Among patients with relapse the mean time to relapse was 103 days for those treated with mesalamine and 123 days for those treated with Modulen (no significant differences). Conclusion:Modulen-IBD treatment reduced relapse rate to a better degree compared with mesalamine treatment, although statistical significance was not achieved.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a poorly understood chronic immune disorder for which there is no medical cure. Milk and colostrum are rich sources of bioactives with immunomodulatory properties. Here we compared the therapeutic effects of oral delivery of bovine milk-derived iron-saturated lactoferrin (Fe-bLF), angiogenin, osteopontin (OPN), colostrum whey protein, Modulen IBD (Nestle Healthsciences, Rhodes, Australia), and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-enriched milk fat in a mouse model of dextran sulfate-induced colitis. The CLA-enriched milk fat significantly increased mouse body weights after 24d of treatment, reduced epithelium damage, and downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and nitrous oxide. Modulen IBD most effectively decreased the clinical score at d 12, and Modulen IBD and OPN most effectively lowered the inflammatory score. Myeloperoxidase activity that denotes neutrophil infiltration was significantly lower in mice fed Modulen IBD, OPN, angiogenin, and Fe-bLF. A significant decrease in the numbers of T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and a significant decrease in cytokine expression were observed in mice fed the treatment diets compared with dextran sulfate administered mice. The Fe-bLF, CLA-enriched milk fat, and Modulen IBD inhibited intestinal angiogenesis. In summary, each of the milk components attenuated IBD in mice, but with differing effectiveness against specific disease parameters.",

The D-ECCO working group along with other ECCO experts with expertise in nutrition, microbiology, physiology, and medicine reviewed the evidence investigating the role of diet and nutritional therapy in the onset, perpetuation, and management of IBD. A narrative topical review is presented where evidence pertinent to the topic is summarised collectively under three main thematic domains: i] the role of diet as an environmental factor in IBD aetiology; ii] the role of diet as induction and maintenance therapy in IBD; and iii] assessment of nutritional status and supportive nutritional therapy in IBD. A summary of research gaps for each of these thematic domains is proposed, which is anticipated to be agenda-setting for future research in the area of diet and nutrition in IBD.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The rising incidence of IBD has been associated with urbanization and shifts toward a Westernized diet. The intestinal microbiome has been a focus of disease pathogenesis and also therapeutic intervention. Dietary therapy for IBD has been well-studied with exclusive enteral nutrition, a formula-based diet with the exclusion of foods. In addition, interest in food-based exclusion diets has been increasing, with patients and families leading the charge. Challenges with dietary therapy for IBD include the lack of understanding of a detailed mechanistic pathway to explain the impact of diet on IBD pathogenesis and the difficult nature of designing and implementing dietary clinical trials. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations and intervention studies have demonstrated efficacy, but specific dietary targets remain as hypotheses at present. Current IBD therapy focuses on suppression of the immune system, yet the incomplete efficacy of present drugs suggests that other therapies must be developed and employed. Dietary interventions, with known ability to modulate the intestinal microbiome, are a unique opportunity to improve outcomes in IBD. Dietary intervention trials are challenging, and capturing both broad dietary patterns as well as exposure to individual food compounds is important. With increasing patient interest and preliminary research in dietary therapy indicating efficacy, it is imperative to further advance the science of utilizing diet in IBD, as well as to support patients by proactively addressing diet within their care plan.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment for Crohn's disease in paediatrics with similar efficiency to corticosteroids. Benefits in adults have not been consistently observed with non-adherence cited as a limiting factor. This study aimed to gain an in depth understanding of the adult patient experience with EEN, identifying challenges and enablers to inform clinicians in the development of strategies to help increase patient adherence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis exploratory, qualitative study utilised individual semi-structured interviews with 17 adult patients who had completed EEN. Participants were purposively recruited across a range of ages, social backgrounds and clinical experience. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and independently thematically analysed by two researchers to provide consensus in identifying key themes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree major themes were identified. (i) Personal experience of EEN evolved over time, with the first few weeks the most challenging, becoming easier as symptoms improved, and participants became used to the EEN regimen. (ii) Participants developed coping strategies to manage challenges, including the impact on meal-based social participation and dietary restriction and monotony. (iii) Enabling factors for adherence to EEN included patient self-efficacy, health system support, supplement characteristics and access, and social support.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study explored the evolving experiences of patients who completed a prescribed course of EEN. Patients described the challenges they faced, how they overcame them identifying enablers for adherence. This provides useful strategies for clinicians to integrate in their assessments and share with patients starting EEN.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate clinical outcomes, patterns of use, tolerance and nutritional outcomes of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in adults with Crohn\u2019s disease and to compare initiation in the inpatient compared with ambulatory care setting. Design/method Adults with Crohn\u2019s disease who received EEN at a single centre over 2.5 years were identified and outcomes assessed via examination of patient records. Results EEN was initiated in 60 patients (23 as an outpatient) who had objective evidence of active disease. Of 49 in whom the goal was induction of remission, 28 completed EEN and 24 achieved clinical remission/response. Twenty-one withdrew prematurely, due to intolerance in 15 and disease factors in 6. Of 11 with a planned intervention, 6 fulfilled the goal of downstaging disease while two were intolerant. Completion of the prescribed therapy was associated with self-reported adherence to EEN and with improvements in disease activity scores and biochemical markers. Malnutrition halved (40% to 20%) and intentional weight loss (median 5.1\u2009kg) was achieved in six obese patients. The major reason for intolerance was the inability to accept total avoidance of non-formula food. There were no differences in any outcomes according to the location of initiation of therapy. Conclusion Positive outcomes occur in 70% of adult patients with Crohn\u2019s disease tolerating EEN and 81% in those who are able to completely adhere to EEN, without compromise of nutritional status. Similar success occurs when initiated as an inpatient or outpatient. Failure to tolerate EEN is the major hurdle to its use.",

        "abstract": "There is demand from patients and clinicians to use the Crohn's disease exclusion diet (CDED) with or without partial enteral nutrition (PEN). However, the therapeutic efficacy and nutritional adequacy of this therapy are rudimentary in an adult population. This review examines the evidence for the CDED in adults with active luminal Crohn's disease and aims to provide practical guidance on the use of the CDED in Australian adults. A working group of nine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dietitians of DECCAN (Dietitians Crohn's and Colitis Australian Network) and an IBD gastroenterologist was established. A literature review was undertaken to examine (1) clinical indications, (2) monitoring, (3) dietary adequacy, (4) guidance for remission phase, and (5) diet reintroduction after therapy. Each diet phase was compared with Australian reference ranges for food groups and micronutrients. CDED with PEN is nutritionally adequate for adults containing sufficient energy and protein and meeting > 80% of the recommended daily intake of key micronutrients. An optimal care pathway for the clinical use of the CDED in an adult population was developed with accompanying consensus statements, clinician toolkit, and patient education brochure. Recommendations for weaning from the CDED to the Australian dietary guidelines were developed. The CDED + PEN provides an alternate partial food\u2010based therapy for remission induction of active luminal Crohn's disease in an adult population. The CDED + PEN should be prioritized over CDED alone and prescribed by a specialist IBD dietitian. DECCAN cautions against using the maintenance diet beyond 12 weeks until further evidence becomes available.",

While initial studies predominantly originated from Israel, recent years have witnessed the expansion of experiences to diverse cultures, culminating in the recognition of CDED in the latest ESPEN guidelines. However, implementing dietary therapy poses significant challenges across various cultures, necessitating adaptations. Aim and Methods: This case-based study aims to present the collective experience from different cultures, shedding light on the encountered challenges and the corresponding solutions devised to surmount them by convening healthcare providers (dietitians and physicians across six countries and eight cultural settings) with extensive experience in utilizing the CDED. Results and Conclusions: Our findings underscore the efficacy of CDED across diverse cultural contexts and emphasize the pivotal role of dietitians in tailoring the diet to accommodate patients\u2019 cultural behaviors and traditions. We highlight challenges encountered and delineate strategies for overcoming them by customizing the diet and offering tailored guidance. Additionally, we provide insights into implementing CDED in various regions through adjusted recipes and personalized counseling from dietitians.
