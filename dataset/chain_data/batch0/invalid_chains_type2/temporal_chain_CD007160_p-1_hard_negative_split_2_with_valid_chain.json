        "title": "Hypoxaemia and Supplemental Oxygen Therapy in the First 24 Hours after Myocardial Infarction: The Role of Pulse Oximetry",
        "abstract": "Objective To assess the incidence and degree of hypoxaemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate the nation-wide perception and usage of oxygen therapy. Design Postal survey of all coronary care units (CCU) in England of their use of prescribed oxygen and pulse oximetry. Prospective randomised study of 50 patients presenting within 24 hours of onset of myocardial infarction, half of whom received oxygen therapy. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) as continuously measured by pulse oximetry, and arrhythmias and ST segment changes were recorded on simultaneous 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitors. Results In 53% of UK coronary care units oxygen is not routinely prescribed but in only 3% is a pulse oximeter used to aid management. In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction the incidence of hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 90%) was 70% and severe hypoxaemia 35% in those not given oxygen, compared with only 27% and 4% in patients given oxygen therapy. The only patient to receive oxygen on clinical grounds had an oxygen saturation of 71%. Severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 80%) occurred significantly less often (1 and 7 patients, p < 0.05) in patients given oxygen. There were no differences in arrhythmias or ST segment changes between groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemia occurs frequently in patients in the first 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction. It is effectively and easily treated with supplemental oxygen which can be guided by pulse oximetry. This is rarely done. Measurements of oxygen saturation are therefore justified in all patients to guide oxygen therapy unless there is a decision to give all patients supplemental oxygen: this we believe to be unnecessary.",

        "abstract": "Context: International guidelines recommend the routine use of oxygen therapy in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). Objective: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. Data sources: Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and CINHAL. Study selection: Randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. Data extraction: The primary clinical outcome was mortality. Results: Two of 51 potential studies met the inclusion criteria. The one study with substantive clinical outcome data reported that in uncomplicated MI, high-flow oxygen was associated with a non-significant increased risk of death (risk ratio 2.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 10.3, p\u200a=\u200a0.08) and a greater serum aspartate aminotransferase level (difference 19.2 IU/ml, 95% CI 0 to 38.4, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) than room air. Conclusion: The limited evidence that does exist suggests that the routine use of high-flow oxygen in uncomplicated MI may result in a greater infarct size and possibly increase the risk of mortality.",

        "abstract": "Background Although the haemodynamic effects of oxygen in healthy subjects are well documented, there have been no well-controlled studies of the effects of oxygen in patients with heart failure (HF). Aims To non-invasively evaluate haemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of oxygen in patients with HF at rest. Methods and results 13 men with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) were randomised in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to receive medical air or oxygen (40% and high concentration via Hudson non-rebreathing mask). Haemodynamic measurements were made with applanation tonometry, impedance cardiography and venous occlusion plethysmography. Plasma C-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and A-type natriuretic peptide were measured. Data were analysed with paired t tests. Cardiac output fell by \u22120.58 (0.62)\u2005l/min on high-flow oxygen compared with \u22120.02 (0.58)\u2005l/min on air, p=0.031. Oxygen caused a reduction in heart rate (\u22124.02 (4.21) vs 0.41 (5.35)\u2005beats/min, respectively, p=0.021) and a trend towards increased systemic vascular resistance (875 (1174) vs 235 (321)\u2005dyne/s/m5, p=0.050). Oxygen led to a paradoxical increase in forearm blood flow (0.513 (0.391) vs 0.024 (0.246)\u2005ml/min/100\u2002ml forearm volume on air, p=0.01). Natriuretic peptides were unchanged with oxygen. Conclusions High-concentration inhaled oxygen has significant haemodynamic effects in patients with LVSD and mild HF. Such effects may be detrimental in patients with decompensated HF.",

        "title": "Cardiovascular effects of hyperoxia during and after cardiac surgery",
        "abstract": "During and after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, high concentrations of oxygen are routinely administered, with the intention of preventing cellular hypoxia. We systematically reviewed the literature addressing the effects of arterial hyperoxia. Extensive evidence from pre\u2010clinical experiments and clinical studies in other patient groups suggests predominant harm, caused by oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, perfusion heterogeneity and myocardial injury. Whether these alterations are temporary and benign, or actually affect clinical outcome, remains to be demonstrated. In nine clinical cardiac surgical studies in low\u2010risk patients, higher oxygen targets tended to compromise cardiovascular function, but did not affect clinical outcome. No data about potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia, such as reduction of gas micro\u2010emboli or post\u2010cardiac surgery infections, were reported. Current evidence is insufficient to specify optimal oxygen targets. Nevertheless, the safety of supraphysiological oxygen suppletion is unproven. Randomised studies with a variety of oxygen targets and inclusion of high\u2010risk patients are needed to identify optimal oxygen targets during and after cardiac surgery.",

        "title": "Normothermic Perfusion in the Assessment and Preservation of Declined Livers Before Transplantation: Hyperoxia and Vasoplegia\u2014Important Lessons From the First 12 Cases",
        "abstract": "Background A program of normothermic ex situ liver perfusion (NESLiP) was developed to facilitate better assessment and use of marginal livers, while minimizing cold ischemia. Methods Declined marginal livers and those offered for research were evaluated. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion was performed using an erythrocyte-based perfusate. Viability was assessed with reference to biochemical changes in the perfusate. Results Twelve livers (9 donation after circulatory death [DCD] and 3 from brain-dead donors), median Donor Risk Index 2.15, were subjected to NESLiP for a median 284 minutes (range, 122-530 minutes) after an initial cold storage period of 427 minutes (range, 222-877 minutes). The first 6 livers were perfused at high perfusate oxygen tensions, and the subsequent 6 at near-physiologic oxygen tensions. After transplantation, 5 of the first 6 recipients developed postreperfusion syndrome and 4 had sustained vasoplegia; 1 recipient experienced primary nonfunction in conjunction with a difficult explant. The subsequent 6 liver transplants, with livers perfused at lower oxygen tensions, reperfused uneventfully. Three DCD liver recipients developed cholangiopathy, and this was associated with an inability to produce an alkali bile during NESLiP. Conclusions Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion enabled assessment and transplantation of 12 livers that may otherwise not have been used. Avoidance of hyperoxia during perfusion may prevent postreperfusion syndrome and vasoplegia, and monitoring biliary pH, rather than absolute bile production, may be important in determining the likelihood of posttransplant cholangiopathy. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion has the potential to increase liver utilization, but more work is required to define factors predicting good outcomes.",

        "title": "Observations on the ex situ perfusion of livers for transplantation",
        "abstract": "Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion might allow viability assessment of livers before transplantation. Perfusion characteristics were studied in 47 liver perfusions, of which 22 resulted in transplants. Hepatocellular damage was reflected in the perfusate transaminase concentrations, which correlated with posttransplant peak transaminase levels. Lactate clearance occurred within 3 hours in 46 of 47 perfusions, and glucose rose initially during perfusion in 44. Three livers required higher levels of bicarbonate support to maintain physiological pH, including one developing primary nonfunction. Bile production did not correlate with viability or cholangiopathy, but bile pH, measured in 16 of the 22 transplanted livers, identified three livers that developed cholangiopathy (peak pH < 7.4) from those that did not (pH > 7.5). In the 11 research livers where it could be studied, bile pH > 7.5 discriminated between the 6 livers exhibiting >50% circumferential stromal necrosis of septal bile ducts and 4 without necrosis; one liver with 25\u201050% necrosis had a maximum pH 7.46. Liver viability during normothermic perfusion can be assessed using a combination of transaminase release, glucose metabolism, lactate clearance, and maintenance of acid\u2010base balance. Evaluation of bile pH may offer a valuable insight into bile duct integrity and risk of posttransplant ischemic cholangiopathy.",

Although (dual) hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion ([D]HOPE) resuscitates livers after cold storage, NMP enables assessment of hepatobiliary function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective clinical trial, nationwide declined livers were subjected to ex situ NMP (viability assessment phase), preceded by 1-hour DHOPE (resuscitation phase) and 1 hour of controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), using a perfusion fluid containing an hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. During the first 2.5\u200ahours of NMP, hepatobiliary viability was assessed, using predefined criteria: perfusate lactate <1.7 mmol/L, pH 7.35 to 7.45, bile production >10\u200amL, and bile pH >7.45. Livers meeting all criteria were accepted for transplantation. Primary endpoint was 3-month graft survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen livers underwent DHOPE-COR-NMP. All livers were from donors after circulatory death, with median age of 63 (range 42-82) years and median Eurotransplant donor risk index of 2.82. During NMP, all livers cleared lactate and produced sufficient bile volume, but in 5 livers bile pH remained <7.45. The 11 (69%) livers that met all viability criteria were successfully transplanted, with 100% patient and graft survival at 3 and 6 months. Introduction of DHOPE-COR-NMP increased the number of deceased donor liver transplants by 20%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSequential DHOPE-COR-NMP enabled resuscitation and safe selection of initially declined high-risk donor livers, thereby increasing the number of transplantable livers by 20%.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nwww.trialregister.nl; NTR5972.",

Background: HOPE might improve outcomes in LT, particularly in high-risk settings such as ECD organs after DBD, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, 46 patients undergoing ECD-DBD LT from four centers were randomly assigned to HOPE (n = 23) or SCS (n = 23). Peak-ALT levels within 7 days following LT constituted the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included incidence of postoperative complications [Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)], length of intensive care- (ICU) and hospital-stay, and incidence of early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Results: Demographics were equally distributed between both groups [donor age: 72 (IQR: 59\u201378) years, recipient age: 62 (IQR: 55\u201365) years, labMELD: 15 (IQR: 9\u201325), 38 male and 8 female recipients]. HOPE resulted in a 47% decrease in serum peak ALT [418 (IQR: 221\u2013828) vs 796 (IQR: 477\u20131195) IU/L, P = 0.030], a significant reduction in 90-day complications [44% vs 74% CD grade \u22653, P = 0.036; 32 (IQR: 12\u201356) vs 52 (IQR: 35\u201398) CCI, P = 0.021], and shorter ICU- and hospital-stays [5 (IQR: 4\u20138) vs 8 (IQR: 5\u201318) days, P = 0.045; 20 (IQR: 16\u201327) vs 36 (IQR: 23\u201362) days, P = 0.002] compared to SCS. A trend toward reduced EAD was observed for HOPE (17% vs 35%; P = 0.314). Conclusion: This multicenter RCT demonstrates that HOPE, in comparison to SCS, significantly reduces early allograft injury and improves post-transplant outcomes in ECD-DBD liver transplantation.",
