        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of milnacipran at a dosage of 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) for monotherapy treatment of fibromyalgia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess 1,025 patients with fibromyalgia who were randomized to receive milnacipran 100 mg/day (n = 516) or placebo (n = 509). Patients underwent 4-6 weeks of flexible dose escalation followed by 12 weeks of stable-dose treatment. Two composite responder definitions were used as primary end points to classify the response to treatment. The 2-measure composite response required achievement of \u226530% improvement from baseline in the pain score and a rating of \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" on the Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. The 3-measure composite response required satisfaction of these same 2 improvement criteria for pain and global status as well as improvement in physical function on the Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter 12 weeks of stable-dose treatment, a significantly greater proportion of milnacipran-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients showed clinically meaningful improvements, as evidenced by the proportion of patients meeting the 2-measure composite responder criteria (P < 0.001 in the baseline observation carried forward [BOCF] analysis) and 3-measure composite responder criteria (P < 0.001 in the BOCF). Milnacipran-treated patients also demonstrated significantly greater improvements from baseline on multiple secondary outcomes, including 24-hour and weekly recall pain score, PGIC score, SF-36 PCS and mental component summary scores, average pain severity score on the Brief Pain Inventory, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire total score (all P < 0.001 versus placebo), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory total score (P = 0.036 versus placebo). Milnacipran was well tolerated by most patients, with nausea being the most commonly reported adverse event (placebo-adjusted rate of 15.8%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMilnacipran administered at a dosage of 100 mg/day improved pain, global status, fatigue, and physical and mental function in patients with fibromyalgia.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate and compare the efficacy and acceptability of the antidepressants amitriptyline (AMT), duloxetine (DLX) and milnacipran (MLN) for FM syndrome (FMS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nCochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, www.clinicalstudyresults.org and www.clinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized pharmacological placebo-controlled trials until 30 May 2010. Outcomes of interest were symptom reduction [pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL)] and acceptability (total drop-out rates). We performed a meta-analysis of each drug vs placebo using a random-effects model and adjusted indirect analyses of the three drugs. Methodological quality was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTen AMT studies (612 patients), four DLX studies (1411 patients) and five MLN studies (4129 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The reported methodological quality of most AMT trials was poor, that of DLX and MLN were high. The three drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance and AMT for HRQOL. The significant effects of AMT and DLX were small and those of MLN not substantial. In adjusted indirect comparisons, AMT was superior to DLX and MLN in reduction of pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue and limitations of HRQOL. DLX was superior to MLN in reducing pain, sleep disturbances and limitations of HRQOL. MLN was superior to DLX in reducing fatigue. There were no significant differences in acceptability of the three drugs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAMT cannot be regarded as the gold standard of FMS therapy with antidepressants because of the methodological limitations of its trials.",

There were no other active comparators or studies in other neuropathic pain conditions. Study quality was generally good, although the imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect.Both doses of milnacipran provided moderate levels of pain relief to about 40% of those treated, compared to 30% with placebo, giving a number needed to treat of 8 to 10. Adverse events were common in both milnacipran (87%) and placebo (78%) groups, but serious adverse events (< 2%) did not differ between groups. Nausea and constipation were the most common events showing the greatest difference between groups (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome of 7 and 13 respectively, compared with placebo).Withdrawals for any reason were more common with milnacipran than placebo, and more common with 200 mg than 100 mg (NNH of 23 and 8.8 respectively, compared with placebo). This was largely driven by adverse event withdrawals, where the NNH compared with placebo was 14 for 100 mg, and 7.0 for 200 mg). Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were more common with milnacipran than placebo but did not differ between doses (number needed to treat to prevent an additional unwanted outcome of 45 and 41 respectively).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence available indicates that milnacipran 100 mg or 200 mg is effective for a minority in the treatment of pain due to fibromyalgia, providing moderate levels of pain relief (at least 30%) to about 40% of participants, compared with about 30% with placebo. There were insufficient data to assess substantial levels of pain relief (at least 50%), and the use of last observation carried forward imputation may overestimate drug efficacy. Milnacipran is associated with increased adverse events and adverse event withdrawals, which were significantly greater for the higher dose.

        "title": "Milnacipran for pain in fibromyalgia in adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. That review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of milnacipran for neuropathic pain is now dealt with in a separate review.Milnacipran is a serotonin-norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is licensed for the treatment of fibromyalgia in some countries, including Canada, Russia, and the United States.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the analgesic efficacy of milnacipran for pain in fibromyalgia in adults and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE to 18 May 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and two clinical trial registries. For the earlier review, we also contacted the manufacturer.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised, double-blind studies of eight weeks' duration or longer, comparing milnacipran with placebo or another active treatment in fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two review authors examined issues of study quality independently.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified one new study with 100 participants for the pooled analysis. We identified two additional reports of a study using an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design that included participants from earlier randomised controlled trials and an open-label study. Because this study used the same participants already included in our main analysis, and a different design, we dealt with it separately.The main analysis included six studies (five from the earlier review; 4238 participants in total), all of which were placebo-controlled, and used titration to a target dose of milnacipran 100 or 200 mg, with assessment after 8 to 24 weeks of stable treatment. There were no studies with active comparators. Study quality was generally good, although the imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect.Both doses of milnacipran provided moderate levels of pain relief (at least 30% pain intensity reduction) to about 40% of participants treated, compared to 30% with placebo, giving a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) of 6 to 10 (high quality evidence). Using a stricter definition for responder and a more conservative method of analysis gave lower levels of response (while maintaining a 10% difference between milnacipran and placebo) and increased the NNT to 11 (high quality evidence). One EERW study was broadly supportive.Adverse events were common in both milnacipran (86%) and placebo (78%) groups (high quality evidence), but serious adverse events did not differ between groups (less than 2%) (low quality evidence). Nausea, constipation, and headache were the most common events showing the greatest difference between groups (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) of 5.7 for nausea, 13 for constipation, and 29 for headache) (moderate quality evidence).Withdrawals for any reason were more common with milnacipran than placebo, and more common with 200 mg (NNH 9) than 100 mg (NNH 23), compared with placebo. This was largely driven by adverse event withdrawals, where the NNH compared with placebo was 14 for 100 mg and 7.0 for 200 mg (high quality evidence). Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were less common with milnacipran than placebo but did not differ between doses (number needed to treat to prevent an additional unwanted outcome (NNTp) of 41) (moderate quality evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence available indicates that milnacipran 100 mg or 200 mg is effective for a minority in the treatment of pain due to fibromyalgia, providing moderate levels of pain relief (at least 30%) to about 40% of participants, compared with about 30% with placebo. There were insufficient data to assess substantial levels of pain relief (at least 50%), and the use of last observation carried forward imputation may overestimate drug efficacy. Using stricter criteria for 'responder' and a more conservative method of analysis gave lower response rates (about 26% with milnacipran versus 17% with placebo). Milnacipran was associated with increased adverse events and adverse event withdrawals, which were significantly greater for the higher dose.",

        "title": "LPM580098, a Novel Triple Reuptake Inhibitor of Serotonin, Noradrenaline, and Dopamine, Attenuates Neuropathic Pain",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Sedation and somnolence remain serious adverse effects of the existing analgesics (e.g., pregabalin, duloxetine) for neuropathic pain. The available evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NE), and dopamine (DA) play important roles in modulating the descending inhibitory pain pathway and sleep\u2013wake cycle. The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that LPM580098, a novel triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI) of 5-HT, NE, and DA, has analgesic effect, and does not induce significant adverse effects associated with central inhibition, such as sedation and somnolence. Methods: The analgesic activity of LPM580098 was assessed on formalin test and spinal nerve ligation (SNL)-induced neuropathic pain model. Locomotor activity, pentobarbital sodium-induced sleeping and rota-rod tests were also conducted. In vitro binding and uptake assays, and Western blotting were performed to examine the potential mechanisms. Results: LPM580098 suppressed the nocifensive behaviors during phase II of the formalin test in mice. In SNL rats, LPM580098 (16 mg kg\u22121) inhibited mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and hyperexcitation of wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons, in which the effect of LPM580098 was similar to pregabalin (30 mg kg\u22121). However, pregabalin altered the spontaneous locomotion, affected pentobarbital sodium-induced sleep, and showed a trend to perform motor dysfunction, which were not induced by LPM580098. Mechanistically, LPM580098 inhibited the uptake of 5-HT, NE, and DA, improved pain-induced changes of the synaptic functional plasticity and structural plasticity possibly via downregulating the NR2B/CaMKII\u03b1/GluR1 and Rac1/RhoA signaling pathways. Conclusion: Our results suggest that LPM580098, a novel TRI, is effective in attenuating neuropathic pain without producing unwanted sedation and somnolence associated with central nervous system (CNS) depressants.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord dorsal horn srGAP3 (slit\u2010robo GTPase activating protein 3) increases in the initiation phase of neuropathic pain and decreases in the maintenance phase. However, Rac1 activity, which can be reduced by srGAP3, decreases in the initiation phase and increases in the maintenance phase. The increased srGAP3 in the initiation phase promotes new immature dendritic spines instigating neuropathic pain. Decreased srGAP3 in the maintenance phase enhances Rac1 activity facilitating maturation of dendritic spines and the persistence of neuropathic pain. SrGAP3 small interfering RNA can ameliorate neuropathic pain only when administrated in the initiation phase. The Rac1 inhibitor can ameliorate neuropathic pain only when administrated in the maintenance phase. Combined targeting of srGAP3 in the initiation phase and Rac1 in the maintenance phase can produce optimal analgesic efficacy.",

        "title": "Electroacupuncture may alleviate neuropathic pain via suppressing P2X7R expression",
        "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a severe problem that is difficult to treat clinically. Reducing abnormal remodeling of dendritic spines/synapses and increasing the anti-inflammatory effects in the spinal cord dorsal horn are potential methods to treat this disease. Previous studies have reported that electroacupuncture (EA) could increase the pain threshold after peripheral nerve injury. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) mediate the activation of microglia and participate in the occurrence and development of neuropathic pain. We hypothesized that the effects of EA on relieving pain may be related to the downregulation of the P2X7R. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rats were used as a model in this experiment, and 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP (BzATP) was used as a P2X7R agonist. We found that EA treatment decreased dendritic spine density, inhibited synaptic reconstruction and reduced inflammatory response, which is consistent with the decrease in P2X7R expression as well as the improved neurobehavioral performance. In contrast to the beneficial effects of EA, BzATP enhanced abnormal remodeling of dendritic spines/synapses and inflammation. Furthermore, the EA-mediated positive effects were reversed by BzATP, which is consistent with the increased P2X7R expression. These findings indicated that EA improves neuropathic pain by reducing abnormal dendritic spine/synaptic reconstruction and inflammation via suppressing P2X7R expression.",

The primary outcomes were depression (assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale scores) and anxiety (evaluated by Hamilton anxiety scale scores). The secondary outcomes were quality of life (assessed using the 36-item short form health survey) and adverse events. We collected and analyzed the outcome data before and after treatment. After treatment, patients in the treatment group did not show greater relief on depression (Hamilton depression scale, P\u2005>\u2005.05) or anxiety (Hamilton anxiety scale, P\u2005>\u2005.05) than those in the control group.
