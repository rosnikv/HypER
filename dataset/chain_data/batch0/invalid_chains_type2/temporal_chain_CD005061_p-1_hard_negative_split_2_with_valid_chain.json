        "title": "Mulberry leaf extract reduces postprandial hyperglycemia with few side effects by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase in normal rats.",
        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf extract (MLE) was investigated as a potent plant-derived \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor with low \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. MLE was prepared by heating in an autoclave at 121 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, and its in vitro and in vivo antihyperglycemic activities were investigated. The adverse side effects of MLE were analyzed by measuring the weight and volume of the cecum, stool color, starch content in the cecum, and the integrity of intestinal transporting capacity. The in vitro inhibitory activity of MLE on intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase was potent and that on intestinal \u03b1-amylase was very weak compared with acarbose. Sugar loading tests with starch, maltose, and sucrose showed that MLE may reduce postprandial increases in blood glucose by acting as an intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Feeding tests suggested that MLE may exhibit fewer adverse side effects than other \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, such as abdominal flatulence and meteorism, which are attributed to the impaired digestion of starch by strong inhibition of intestinal \u03b1-amylase. These results suggest that MLE could be used in the development of pharmaceutical foods to control the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients by inhibiting intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase with reduced side effects.",

        "title": "Comparison of inhibitory activities and mechanisms of five mulberry plant bioactive components against \u03b1-glucosidase.",
        "abstract": "The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of five bioactive components, namely 1-deoxynojirimycin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol contained in mulberry (Morus, Moraceae) plants have been compared. Spectroscopy methods were employed to compare their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory mechanisms. The results revealed that 1-deoxynojirimycin (competitive), resveratrol and oxyresveratrol (noncompetitive) were stronger inhibitors than acarbose, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (mix competitive and noncompetitive) showed modest activities. 1-Deoxynojirimycin, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol could quench the fluorescence spectra statically by forming stable complexes, while the quenching of cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside belonged to dynamic quenching by the collision of molecules. The interactions between ligands and \u03b1-glucosidase were mainly driven by hydrophobic force, or hydrogen bonding consequently induced conformational changes and reduced surface hydrophobicity. Docking results suggested that they could bind to \u03b1-glucosidase at different sites. This work provides useful information for the understanding of the ligands-\u03b1-glucosidase interactions and identifies oxyresveratrol as a potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor.",

        "title": "Comparison of Polyphenol Profile and Inhibitory Activities Against Oxidation and \u03b1-Glucosidase in Mulberry (Genus Morus) Cultivars from China.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nMulberry (genus Morus) is a significant source of polyphenols, which can promote positive effects on human health. China has various mulberry cultivars, however, many Chinese mulberry cultivars have been only minimally studied. To solve this lack of research, 8 mulberry cultivars (Da10, Tang10, Yueshen74, Yuefenshen, Longsang, Ningxia1hao, Taiwanguosang, and Baiyuwang) from 4 regions of China were assessed to determine their polyphenol profiles using HPLC-MS/MS and then tested for their antioxidant and anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activities in vitro. A total of 18 nonanthocyanins and 4 anthocyanins were quantified in mulberry cultivars; among these polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside were confirmed as the major phenolic acid, flavonol derivative, and anthocyanin, respectively. Two types of stilbene compounds, piceid, and piceatannol, were detected for the 1st time in all mulberry cultivars. Moreover, the methanolic extracts of different mulberry cultivars showed disparate antioxidant and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities, and this discrepancy was mainly attributed to varying the anthocyanin content. Based on our results, Taiwanguosang is proposed to be a good candidate suitable for further process due to its high level of anthocyanins.\n\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION\nThe polyphenols of mulberry cultivars are vital for human health and are relevant to the further development of mulberry-based products. China has a wide range of mulberry cultivar resources, and many of these cultivars have not yet been studied. Our research concentrated on the polyphenol profiles, antioxidant, and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities of various mulberry cultivars from different regions of China to provide basic information for mulberry cultivar selection and mulberry-based food production.",

        "title": "Influence of Freeze Concentration Technique on Aromatic and Phenolic Compounds, Color Attributes, and Sensory Properties of Cabernet Sauvignon Wine",
        "abstract": "Red wines produced in the Xinjiang region of China possess poor color density, and lack fruity notes and elegance. The freeze concentration technique, as a well-established concentration method for liquid food systems, was applied to the Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L.) wine-making process, aiming to investigate its effect on wine quality improvement. Results showed that the freeze concentration treatment did not significantly alter the physicochemical properties of the wine, except for an increase of glycerol and alcoholic content. This technique increased ester contents, as well as decreasing the amount of volatile acids. Higher alcohol contents were also increased, but within an acceptable content range. All taken into consideration, the freeze concentration treated wine showed better fragrance characters according to sensory evaluation. The non-anthocyanin composition was altered by this application, however, the difference disappeared after the aging process. Fortunately, sensory evaluation showed that the treated wine possessed better mouthfeel properties. Anthocyanin contents were enhanced, and effectively stabilized the fresh wine color attributes, resulting in an improvement in appearance of the treated wine. All results considered, it can be concluded that freeze concentration treatment could be a good choice to improve wine quality.",

        "title": "Comparative Study of the Structural Properties, Color, Bioactive Compounds Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Aerated Gelatin Gels Enriched with Cryoconcentrated Blueberry Juice during Storage",
        "abstract": "Cryoconcentrated blueberry juice (CBJ) was incorporated into aerated gelatin gel and the effects on the mechanical properties, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity (AA) were evaluated at day 1 and day 28 under refrigerated storage. At day 1, 8 g of gelatin gel and 40 g of CBJ (called M5) exhibited a soft texture and heterogeneous and non-spherical small bubbles, with values close to 10.5, 8.0 and 7.1 N, for hardness, gumminess and chewiness, respectively. M5 presented an increase of approximately 1.7, 1.9 and 1.9, and 1.2, 1.8, 2.1 and 1.3 times in comparison to the other samples, for total polyphenol, anthocyanin and flavonoid contents, and individual phenolic compounds, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays, respectively. At day 28, the samples showed a weakening of the 3D network, with high degradation of phenolic compounds and AA due to the oxidation, polymerization and syneresis. Therefore, CBJ might be an interesting functional ingredient to add to (aerated and non-aerated) gelatin gel without affecting its properties, and thus different food products with high nutritional values and without added artificial sweeteners could be developed. Additionally, the gelatin gel/CBJ combinations might be suitable for additive manufacturing as a coating of food matrices.",

        "title": "Centrifugal Filter-Assisted Block Freeze Crystallization Applied to Blueberry Juice",
        "abstract": "The impact of centrifugal-filter assisted block freeze crystallization (CFBFC) on the physicochemical parameters, total phenolic content (TPC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), and total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activity (AA) and process parameters applied to blueberry juice was studied. Additionally, CFBFC was contrasted with gravitational BFC (GBFC) and centrifugal BFC (CBFC) techniques. For CFBFC process, the solutes values were \u224835.9 \u00b0Brix (fresh juice \u224813.8 \u00b0Brix), with a very dark red/purple color. Moreover, the bioactive components values presented a significant increase of 2.1, 2.0, 1.8, and 3.1 times compared to the initial TPC, TAC, TFC, and AA values, respectively, and these values were higher than GBFC and CBFC techniques. For efficiency, percentage of concentrate, and solute yield, CFBFC showed values close to 86%, 81%, and 0.9 (kg/kg), respectively, which were higher values than GBFC (48%, 38%, and 0.5 (kg/kg)) and CBFC (79%, 68%, and 0.7 (kg/kg)). Therefore, this research offers new benefits with the addition of the filter in the centrifugal BFC, and thus, CFBFC offers an advantage due to the better separation than GBFC and CBFC, since the filter can be designated as a second separation stage, and only one cycle is necessary to obtain high quality properties in the final solution.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogels can absorb and/or retain components in the interstitial spaces due to the 3D cross-linked polymer network, and thus, these matrices can be used in different engineering applications. This study focuses on the physicochemical and textural properties, as well as bioactive compounds and their antioxidant activity stability of commercial hydrogels fortified with cryoconcentrated blueberry juice (CBJ) stored for 35 days. CBJ was added to commercial hydrogels (gelatin gel (GG), aerated gelatin gel (AGG), gummy (GM), and aerated gummy (AGM)). The samples showed a total polyphenol, anthocyanin, and flavonoid content ranging from 230 to 250 mg GAE/100 g, 3.5 to 3.9 mg C3G/100 g, and 120 to 136 mg CEQ/100 g, respectively, and GG and GM showed the lowest bioactive component degradation rate, while AGM presented the highest degradation. GG and GM samples could be stored for up to 21 days without significant changes, while the results indicated \u224815 days for the AGG and AGM samples. Thereby, CBJ offers enormous possibilities to be used as a functional ingredient due to the high nutritional values, and it allows enriching different hydrogel samples, and in turn, the structures of hydrogels protected components during in vitro digestion, enhancing the bioaccessibility after the digestion process.",

        "abstract": "A model (sucrose and gallic acid) solution was concentrated by block freeze concentration (BFC) at three centrifugation cycles, and the solutions were encapsulated in calcium alginate and corn starch calcium alginate hydrogel beads. Static and dynamic tests determined the rheological behavior, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) established thermal and structural properties, and the release kinetics was evaluated under in vitro simulated digestion experiment. The highest efficiency encapsulation value was close to 96%. As the concentrated solution increased in terms of solutes and gallic acid, the solutions were fitted to the Herschel\u2013Bulkley model. Moreover, from the second cycle, the solutions exhibited the highest values of storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033), contributing to form a more stable encapsulation. The FTIR and DSC results demonstrated strong interactions between corn starch and alginate, establishing a good compatibility and stability in the bead formation. The kinetic release model under in vitro conditions was fitted to the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model, demonstrating the significant stability of the model solutions inside the beads. Therefore, the present study proposes a clear and precise definition for the elaboration of liquid foods obtained by BFC and its incorporation inside an edible material that facilitates the controlled release in specific sites.",
