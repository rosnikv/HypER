        "abstract": "Albuminuria reduction could be renoprotective in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, the current use of renin-angiotensin-system intervention is targeted to BP only. Therefore, this study investigated the adequacy of this approach in 1428 patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy from the placebo-controlled Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. Investigated were the extent of discordance in treatment effects on systolic BP (SBP) and albuminuria and its association with renal outcome in a multivariate Cox model. Among patients with a reduced SBP during treatment, a lack of albuminuria reduction was observed in 37, 26, and 51% (total, losartan, and placebo, respectively) at month 6. SBP or albuminuria reduction was associated with a lower risk for ESRD, whereas combined SBP and albuminuria reduction was associated with the lowest risk for events. Across all categories of SBP change, a progressively lower ESRD hazard ratio was observed with a larger albuminuria reduction. A lower residual level of albuminuria was also associated with lower ESRD risk. In conclusion, changes in albuminuria are not concordant in a substantial proportion of patients when titrated for BP. Meanwhile, the ESRD risk showed a clear dependence on albuminuria reduction. The ESRD risk also showed dependence on the residual level of albuminuria, even in patients who reached the current SBP target. Antihypertensive treatment that is aimed at improving renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy may therefore require a dual strategy, targeting both SBP and albuminuria reduction.",

        "title": "Combination therapy with AT1 blocker and vitamin D analog markedly ameliorates diabetic nephropathy: Blockade of compensatory renin increase",
        "abstract": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, and blockade of the RAS is currently used for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. One major problem for the current RAS inhibitors is the compensatory renin increase, which reduces the efficacy of RAS inhibition. We have shown that vitamin D exerts renoprotective actions by transcriptionally suppressing renin. Here we demonstrated that combination therapy with an AT1 receptor blocker and a vitamin D analog markedly ameliorated renal injury in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model due to the blockade of the compensatory renin rise by the vitamin D analog, leading to more effective RAS inhibition. STZ-treated diabetic DBA/2J mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis within 13 weeks, accompanied by increased intrarenal production of angiotensin (Ang) II, fibronection, TGF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and decreased expression of slit diaphragm proteins. Treatment of the diabetic mice with losartan or paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2, an activated vitamin D analog) alone moderately ameliorated kidney injury; however, combined treatment with losartan and paricalcitol completely prevented albuminuria, restored glomerular filtration barrier structure, and markedly reduced glomerulosclerosis. The combined treatment suppressed the induction of fibronection, TGF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and reversed the decline of slit diaphragm proteins nephrin, Neph-1, ZO-1, and \u03b1-actinin-4. These were accompanied by blockade of intrarenal renin and Ang II accumulation induced by hyperglycemia and losartan. These data demonstrate that inhibition of the RAS with combination of vitamin D analogs and RAS inhibitors effectively prevents renal injury in diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Analogs of vitamin D attenuate renal injury in several models of kidney disease, but the mechanism underlying this renoprotective effect is unknown. To address the role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in renal fibrogenesis, we subjected VDR-null mice to unilateral ureteral obstruction for 7 days. Compared with wild-type mice, VDR-null mice developed more severe renal damage in the obstructed kidney, with marked tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Significant induction of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen I), profibrogenic and proinflammatory factors (TGF-beta, connective tissue growth factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accompanied this histologic damage. Because VDR ablation activates the renin-angiotensin system and leads to accumulation of angiotensin II (AngII) in the kidney, we assessed whether elevated AngII in the VDR-null kidney promotes injury. Treatment with the angiotensin type 1 antagonist losartan eliminated the difference in obstruction-induced interstitial fibrosis between wild-type and VDR-null mice, suggesting that AngII contributes to the enhanced renal fibrosis observed in obstructed VDR-null kidneys. Taken together, these results suggest that the VDR attenuates obstructive renal injury at least in part by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.",

        "abstract": "There is increasingly evidence that the interactions between vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and klotho form an endocrine axis for calcium and phosphate metabolism, and derangement of this axis contributes to the progression of renal disease. Several recent studies also demonstrate negative regulation of the renin gene by vitamin D. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), low levels of calcitriol, due to the loss of 1-alpha hydroxylase, increase renal renin production. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), in turn, reduces renal expression of klotho, a crucial factor for proper FGF-23 signaling. The resulting high FGF-23 levels suppress 1-alpha hydroxylase, further lowering calcitriol. This feedback loop results in vitamin D deficiency, RAAS activation, high FGF-23 levels, and renal klotho deficiency, all of which associate with progression of renal damage. Here we examine current evidence for an interaction between the RAAS and the vitamin D-FGF-23-klotho axis as well as its possible implications for progression of CKD.",

        "abstract": "The eggshell is an ancient innovation that helped the vertebrates' transition from the oceans and gain dominion over the land. Coincident with this conquest, several new eggshell and noncollagenous bone\u2010matrix proteins (NCPs) emerged. The protein ovocleidin\u2010116 is one of these proteins with an ancestry stretching back to the Triassic. Ovocleidin\u2010116 is an avian homolog of Matrix Extracellular Phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) and belongs to a group of proteins called Small Integrin\u2010Binding Ligand Interacting Glycoproteins (SIBLINGs). The genes for these NCPs are all clustered on chromosome 5q in mice and chromosome 4q in humans. A unifying feature of the SIBLING proteins is an Acidic Serine Aspartate\u2010Rich MEPE (ASARM)\u2010associated motif. The ASARM motif and the released ASARM peptide play roles in mineralization, bone turnover, mechanotransduction, phosphate regulation and energy metabolism. ASARM peptides and motifs are physiological substrates for phosphate\u2010regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PHEX), a Zn metalloendopeptidase. Defects in PHEX are responsible for X\u2010linked hypophosphatemic rickets. PHEX interacts with another ASARM motif containing SIBLING protein, Dentin Matrix Protein\u20101 (DMP1). DMP1 mutations cause bone\u2010renal defects that are identical with the defects caused by loss of PHEX function. This results in autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR). In both X\u2010linked hypophosphatemic rickets and ARHR, increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) expression occurs, and activating mutations in FGF23 cause autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR). ASARM peptide administration in vitro and in vivo also induces increased FGF23 expression. This review will discuss the evidence for a new integrative pathway involved in bone formation, bone\u2010renal mineralization, renal phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism in disease and health.

        "abstract": "Excessive FGF23 has been identified as a pivotal phosphaturic factor leading to renal phosphate\u2010wasting and the subsequent development of rickets and osteomalacia. In contrast, loss of FGF23 in mice (Fgf23\u2212/\u2212) leads to high serum phosphate, calcium, and 1,25\u2010vitamin D levels, resulting in early lethality attributable to severe ectopic soft\u2010tissue calcifications and organ failure. Paradoxically, Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a severe defect in skeletal mineralization despite high levels of systemic mineral ions and abundant ectopic mineralization, an abnormality that remains largely unexplained. Through use of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold labeling coupled with electron microscopy of bone samples, we discovered that expression and accumulation of osteopontin (Opn/OPN) was markedly increased in Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results were confirmed by qPCR analyses of Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 bones and ELISA measurements of serum OPN. To investigate whether elevated OPN levels were contributing to the bone mineralization defect in Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 mice, we generated Fgf23\u2212/\u2212/Opn\u2212/\u2212 double\u2010knockout mice (DKO). Biochemical analyses showed that the hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia observed in Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 mice remained unchanged in DKO mice; however, micro\u2010computed tomography (\u00b5CT) and histomorphometric analyses showed a significant improvement in total mineralized bone volume. The severe osteoidosis was markedly reduced and a normal mineral apposition rate was present in DKO mice, indicating that increased OPN levels in Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 mice are at least in part responsible for the osteomalacia. Moreover, the increased OPN levels were significantly decreased upon lowering serum phosphate by feeding a low\u2010phosphate diet or after deletion of NaPi2a, indicating that phosphate levels contribute in part to the high OPN levels in Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 mice. In summary, our results suggest that increased OPN is an important pathogenic factor mediating the mineralization defect and the alterations in bone metabolism observed in Fgf23\u2212/\u2212 bones. \u00a9 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor\u201023 (Fgf23) is a bone\u2010derived hormone, suppressing phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D hormone (1,25(OH)2D3) production in the kidney. It has long been an enigma why lack of Fgf23 or of Klotho, the coreceptor for Fgf23, leads to severe impairment in bone mineralization despite the presence of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Using Fgf23\u2010/\u2010 or Klotho\u2010/\u2010 mice together with compound mutant mice lacking both Fgf23 or Klotho and a functioning vitamin D receptor, we show that in Klotho\u2010/\u2010 mice the mineralization defect is solely driven by 1,25(OH)2D3\u2010induced upregulation of the mineralization\u2010inhibiting molecules osteopontin and pyrophosphate in bone. In Fgf23\u2010/\u2010 mice, the mineralization defect has two components, a 1,25(OH)2D3\u2010driven component similar to Klotho\u2010/\u2010 mice and a component driven by lack of Fgf23, causing additional accumulation of osteopontin. We found that FGF23 regulates osteopontin secretion indirectly by suppressing alkaline phosphatase transcription and phosphate production in osteoblastic cells, acting through FGF receptor\u20103 in a Klotho\u2010independent manner. Hence, FGF23 secreted from osteocytes may form an autocrine/paracrine feedback loop for the local fine\u2010tuning of bone mineralization. \u00a9 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism caused by CKD. Impaired bone mineralization together with increased bony secretion of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) are hallmarks of CKD-MBD. We recently showed that FGF23 suppresses the expression of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in bone cells by a Klotho-independent, FGF receptor-3-mediated signaling axis, leading to the accumulation of the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. Therefore, we hypothesized that excessive FGF23 secretion may locally impair bone mineralization in CKD-MBD. To test this hypothesis, we induced CKD by 5/6 nephrectomy in 3-month-old wild-type (WT) mice and Fgf23\u2212/\u2212/VDR\u0394/\u0394 (Fgf23/VDR) compound mutant mice maintained on a diet enriched with calcium, phosphate, and lactose. Eight weeks postsurgery, WT CKD mice were characterized by reduced bone mineral density at the axial and appendicular skeleton, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased serum intact Fgf23, and impaired bone mineralization as evidenced by bone histomorphometry. Laser capture microdissection in bone cryosections showed that both osteoblasts and osteocytes contributed to the CKD-induced increase in Fgf23 mRNA abundance. In line with our hypothesis, osteoblastic and osteocytic activity of alkaline phosphatase was reduced, and bone pyrophosphate concentration was ~2.5-fold higher in CKD mice, relative to Sham controls. In Fgf23/VDR compound mice lacking Fgf23, 5/6-Nx induced secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone loss. However, 5/6-Nx failed to suppress TNAP activity, and bone pyrophosphate concentrations remained unchanged in Fgf23/VDR CKD mice. Collectively, our data suggest that elevated Fgf23 production in bone contributes to the mineralization defect in CKD-MBD by auto-/paracrine suppression of TNAP and subsequent accumulation of pyrophosphate in bone. Hence, our study has identified a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD.",

        "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal malignant hematopoietic disorders in the elderly characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. This is accompanied by an altered bone microenvironment, which contributes to MDS progression and higher bone fragility. The underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that myelodysplastic NUP98\u2011HOXD13 (NHD13) transgenic mice display an abnormally high number of osteoblasts, yet a higher fraction of nonmineralized bone, indicating delayed bone mineralization. This was accompanied by high fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) serum levels, a phosphaturic hormone that inhibits bone mineralization and erythropoiesis. While Fgf23 mRNA expression was low in bone, brain, and kidney of NHD13 mice, its expression was increased in erythroid precursors. Coculturing these precursors with WT osteoblasts induced osteoblast marker gene expression, which was inhibited by blocking FGF-23. Finally, antibody-based neutralization of FGF-23 in myelodysplastic NHD13 mice improved bone mineralization and bone microarchitecture, and it ameliorated anemia. Importantly, higher serum levels of FGF\u201123 and an elevated amount of nonmineralized bone in patients with MDS validated the findings. C\u2011terminal FGF\u201123 correlated negatively with hemoglobin levels and positively with the amount of nonmineralized bone.

Patients with CKD develop anemia as the kidneys progressively lose the ability to produce erythropoietin (EPO). Anemia is a potent driver of FGF23 secretion; therefore, a hypoxia\u2010inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF\u2010PHI) currently in clinical trials to elevate endogenous EPO to resolve anemia was tested for effects on iron utilization and FGF23\u2010related parameters in a CKD mouse model. Mice were fed either a casein control diet or an adenine\u2010containing diet to induce CKD. The CKD mice had markedly elevated iFGF23 and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hyperphosphatemia, and anemia. Cohorts of mice were then treated with a patient\u2010equivalent dose of BAY 85\u20103934 (BAY; Molidustat), which elevated EPO and completely resolved aberrant complete blood counts (CBCs) in the CKD mice. iFGF23 was elevated in vehicle\u2010treated CKD mice (120\u2010fold), whereas circulating iFGF23 was significantly attenuated (>60%) in the BAY\u2010treated CKD mice. The BAY\u2010treated mice with CKD also had reduced BUN, but there was no effect on renal vitamin D metabolic enzyme expression. Consistent with increased EPO, bone marrow Erfe, Transferrin receptor (Tfrc), and EpoR mRNAs were increased in BAY\u2010treated CKD mice, and in vitro hypoxic marrow cultures increased FGF23 with direct EPO treatment. Liver Bmp\u20106 and hepcidin expression were downregulated in all BAY\u2010treated groups. Femur trabecular parameters and cortical porosity were not worsened with BAY administration. In vitro, differentiated osteocyte\u2010like cells exposed to an iron chelator to simulate iron depletion/hypoxia increased FGF23; repletion with holo\u2010transferrin completely suppressed FGF23 and normalized Tfrc1. Collectively, these results support that resolving anemia using a HIF\u2010PHI during CKD was associated with lower BUN and reduced FGF23, potentially through direct restoration of iron utilization, thus providing modifiable outcomes beyond improving anemia for this patient population. \u00a9 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",
