A significant effect on pain score was found due to LEL treatment, but when data were corrected for disease variation the effect disappeared. No effect of LEL could be demonstrated on the other assessed variables: grip strength, morning stiffness, flexibility, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP). In conclusion, we did not find that LEL had any clinically relevant effects on RA.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014The long-term effects of cardiac cell transplantation on cardiac function are unknown. Therefore, we tested the survival and functional impact of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes up to 6 months after transplantation into infarcted hearts. Methods and Results\u2014Cardiomyocytes from male neonatal Fischer 344 rats (1 to 2 days, 3 to 5\u00d7106) or medium was injected into the infarcts of adult syngeneic female animals 1 week after left coronary artery ligation. Six months later, implanted cardiomyocytes were still present by quantitative TaqMan polymerase chain reaction and histology. In all treated hearts, discrete lumps of cells were present within the infarct scar, which was not observed in media-injected hearts typified by a transmural infarct scar. Infarct thickness was greater in treated animals versus control animals (909\u00b197 versus 619\u00b143 &mgr;m, P <0.02), whereas infarct size and left ventricular volumes were similar. By biplane angiography, left ventricular ejection fractions at 6 months were greater (0.36\u00b10.03 versus 0.25\u00b10.02, P <0.01) and significantly less infarct zone dyskinesis was seen (0.30\u00b10.08 versus 0.55\u00b10.07, P =0.035, lateral projection) in treated animals versus control animals. Conclusions\u2014Grafted neonatal cardiomyocytes were present in infarcts 6 months after transplantation; they thickened the wall of the left ventricle and were associated with enhanced ejection fraction and reduced paradoxical systolic bulging of the infarct. Therefore, neonatal cardiac cell transplants exhibit long-term survival in a myocardial infarct model and contribute to long-term improved cardiac function.

        "abstract": "Abstract \u2014Cellular transplantation has emerged as a potential approach to treat diseased hearts. Although cell transplantation can affect global heart function, it is not known if this results directly via functional integration of donor myocytes or indirectly via enhanced revascularization and/or altered postinjury remodeling. To determine the degree to which donor cardiomyocytes are able to functionally integrate with the host myocardium, fetal transgenic cardiomyocytes expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein were transplanted into the hearts of nontransgenic adult mice. Two\u2010photon molecular excitation laser scanning microscopy was then used to simultaneously image cellular calcium transients in donor and host cells within the intact recipient hearts. Calcium transients in the donor cardiomyocytes were synchronous with and had kinetics indistinguishable from those of neighboring host cardiomyocytes. These results strongly suggest that donor cardiomyocytes functionally couple with host cardiomyocytes and support the notion that transplanted cardiomyocytes can form a functional syncytium with the host myocardium.

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from blastocysts can propagate indefinitely in culture while maintaining pluripotency, including the ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (CMs); therefore, hESCs may provide an unlimited source of human CMs for cell-based therapies. Although CMs can be derived from hESCs ex vivo, it remains uncertain whether a functional syncytium can be formed between donor and recipient cells after engraftment. Methods and Results\u2014Using a combination of electrophysiological and imaging techniques, here we demonstrate that electrically active, donor CMs derived from hESCs that had been stably genetically engineered by a recombinant lentivirus can functionally integrate with otherwise-quiescent, recipient, ventricular CMs to induce rhythmic electrical and contractile activities in vitro. The integrated syncytium was responsive to the &bgr;-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol as well as to other pharmacological agents such as lidocaine and ZD7288. Similarly, a functional hESC-derived pacemaker could be implanted in the left ventricle in vivo. Detailed optical mapping of the epicardial surface of guinea pig hearts transplanted with hESC-derived CMs confirmed the successful spread of membrane depolarization from the site of injection to the surrounding myocardium. Conclusions\u2014We conclude that electrically active, hESC-derived CMs are capable of actively pacing quiescent, recipient, ventricular CMs in vitro and ventricular myocardium in vivo. Our results may lead to an alternative or a supplemental method for correcting defects in cardiac impulse generation, such as cell-based pacemakers.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To test the hypothesis that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be guided to form new myocardium by transplantation into the normal or infarcted heart, and to assess the influence of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESCMs) on cardiac function in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). Methods: Undifferentiated hESCs (0.5\u20131\u00d7106), human embryoid bodies (hEBs) (4\u20138 days; 0.5\u20131\u00d7106), 0.1 mm pieces of embryonic stem-derived beating myocardial tissue, and phosphate-buffered saline (control) were injected into the normal or infarcted myocardium of athymic nude rats (n\u200a=\u200a58) by direct injection into the muscle or into preimplanted three-dimensional alginate scaffold. By 2\u20134 weeks after transplantation, heart sections were examined to detect the human cells and differentiation with fluorescent in situ hybridisation, using DNA probes specific for human sex chromosomes and HLA-DR or HLA-ABC immunostaining. Results: Microscopic examination showed transplanted human cells in the normal, and to a lesser extent in the infarcted myocardium (7/7 vs 2/6; p<0.05). The transplanted hESCs and hEBs rarely created new vessels and did not form new myocardium. Transplantation of hESCM tissue into normal heart produced islands of disorganised myofibres, fibrosis and, in a single case, a teratoma. However, transplantation of hESCMs into the infarcted myocardium did prevent post-MI dysfunction and scar thinning. Conclusions: Undifferentiated hESCs and hEBs are not directed to form new myocardium after transplantation into normal or infarcted heart and may create teratoma. Nevertheless, this study shows that hESC-derived cardiomyocyte transplantation can attenuate post-MI scar thinning and left ventricular dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "When implanted into immunodeficient mice, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) give rise to teratoma, tumor-like formations containing tissues belonging to all three germ layers. The ability to form teratoma is a sine qua non characteristic of pluripotent stem cells. However, limited data are available regarding the effects of implantation site and the methods employed for implantation on the success rate of teratoma formation. In this study, the rate of teratoma formation in immunodeficient mice was site dependent: subcutaneous (25-100%), intratesticular (60%), intramuscular (12.5%), and under the kidney capsule (100%). Co-injecting the hESCs with Matrigel increased subcutaneous teratoma formation efficiency from 25-40% to 80-100%. We did not observe site-specific differences in the teratoma composition at the histological level. However, subcutaneous teratomas were quite distinct, easy to remove, and caused minimal discomfort to the mice. Also, subcutaneous teratomas displayed larger proportion of solid tissues as opposed to cyst formation that dominated the teratomas formed at the other sites. Interestingly, a chromosomally abnormal hESCs with trisomy 20 formed teratomas where the ratio of differentiated to undifferentiated tissues was significantly decreased suggesting defective pluripotency of the cells. In conclusion, subcutaneous implantation of hESCs in presence of Matrigel appears to be the most efficient, reproducible, and the easiest approach for teratoma formation by hESCs. Also, teratoma formation can be employed to study the development defects exhibited by the chromosomally abnormal hESC lines.",

        "title": "Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Develop Teratoma More Efficiently and Faster Than Human Embryonic Stem Cells Regardless the Site of Injection",
        "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and reprogrammed/induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) research is becoming the \u201cflavor of the month\u201d for downstream applications such as drug screening, disease modeling, and future regenerative medicine and cell therapies [1\u20134]. Pluripotency (the ability to give rise to any cell type of the three germ layers: mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm) is the defining feature of hESCs and iPSCs [5]. In vivo teratoma formation in immune-compromised mice is the \u201cgold-standard\u201d assay to define bona fide pluripotent stem cells capable of generating tumoral disorganized structures containing tissues representing the three germ layers [5,6]. Despite the importance of teratoma assay as an extended screen for the pluripotency of hESCs and iPSCs and as in vivo assay to explore molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the biology of human teratomas and their transition to teratocarcinomas, there are no standard procedures for performing this assay [5\u20137]. Different studies on hESCs have correlated the site of implantation with the efficiency of teratoma formation and histology tissue composition [6,8]. However, limited data are available regarding the teratoma development latency. More importantly, no study so far has compared side-by-side the efficiency, latency, and histological tumor composition of hESCs- and iPSCs-derived teratomas. In addition, a new generation of immunodeficient mice has been developed: the NOD/SCID IL2R\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mouse. This strain carries a IL2R\u03b3-chain deficiency that blocks signaling through multiple cytokine receptors leading to many innate immune defects [9,10]. The non obese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) IL2R\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 strain facilitates engraftment and tumor formation and does not develop thymic lymphoma, ensuring a longer lifespan of inoculated mice. \n \nHere, we followed the improved teratoma protocol previously developed by Prokhorova et al. [6,11\u201313] to transplant side-by-side as few as 1 \u00d7 106 of either fully characterized undifferentiated hESCs or iPSCs in 6- to 8-week-old non obese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) IL2R\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice [11,13\u201315]. The following hESC lines were used: H9, H1, AND1, AND2, AND3, HS181, and ECAT. The following iPSC lines were used: MSHU-001, iAND4, CB-CD34+ iPSC1, and CB-CD34+ iPSC2. These lines have been fully characterized and deposited according to Spanish Legislation at The Spanish Stem Cell Bank (http://www.isciii.es/htdocs/terapia/terapia_lineas.jsp) [16]. Briefly, cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 30% matrigel (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, http://www.bd.com) [6] and transplanted subcutaneously (200 \u03bcl volume) or by intratesticular injection (60 \u03bcl volume). Figure \u200bFigure1A1A depicts the experimental strategy used. We then analyzed efficiency, latency, and histological tumor composition. In hESCs, the rate of teratoma formation was 81% subcutaneously versus 94% intratesticularly (n = 30 mice; Fig. \u200bFig.1B).1B). However, the intratesticular injection, despite showing higher efficiency of teratoma formation, displayed a slightly longer latency (66 vs. 59 days; p-value > 0.05). There were no site-specific differences in the teratoma composition at the histological level (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1C).1C). Interestingly, when iPSCs were transplanted the rate of teratoma formation was 100% (n = 16 mice), regardless the type of injection. More importantly, iPSCs seem more aggressive in vivo as the latency was shortened 52% (from 59 days to 31 days) upon subcutaneous injection and 26% (from 66 days to 49 days) upon intratesticular injection. As with hESCs, no differences in teratoma composition were observed either. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nHuman iPSCs form teratomas faster and with higher efficiency than hESCs regardless the site of injection. (A): Cartoon summarizing the experimental design. (B): Table summarizing the efficiency, latency, and histological analysis of the teratomas developed ... \n \n \n \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing side-by-side the efficiency, latency, and teratoma composition between hESCs and iPSCs. We found clear differences in the efficiency and latency but not in the teratoma histological composition. Further experiments are still demanded to gain insights into the higher aggressiveness in vivo of iPSCs as compared with hESCs. Ploidy, analyzed by conventional G-banding karyotype, could not explained these differences because all but two pluripotent stem cell lines were euploid: the aneuploid lines were one hESC (AND1) and one iPSC (iAND4). It is worth emphasizing, however, that karyotype analysis is not a high-resolution technique detecting fine genomic aberrations, with a euploid karyotype not being therefore indicative of an overall cellular genomic stability. Whether or not specific tiny genomic insults (detectable by high-resolution methods such as comparative genomic hybridazation (CGH)-arrays and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis) or epigenetic differences may explain the higher aggressiveness in vivo of iPSCs still needs to be elucidated. We envision that these data may be useful not only for stem cells scientists addressing pluripotency issues and studying mechanisms underlying specific germ-layer/tissue differentiation but also for cancer researchers developing in vivo models for germ cell tumors.",

        "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) have been generated from different tissues, with the age of the donor, tissue source and specific cell type influencing the reprogramming process. Reprogramming hematopoietic progenitors to hiPSC may provide a very useful cellular system for modelling blood diseases. We report the generation and complete characterization of hiPSCs from human neonatal fibroblasts and cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors using a single polycistronic lentiviral vector containing an excisable cassette encoding the four reprogramming factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-myc (OKSM). The ectopic expression of OKSM was fully silenced upon reprogramming in some hiPSC clones and was not reactivated upon differentiation, whereas other hiPSC clones failed to silence the transgene expression, independently of the cell type/tissue origin. When hiPSC were induced to differentiate towards hematopoietic and neural lineages those hiPSC which had silenced OKSM ectopic expression displayed good hematopoietic and early neuroectoderm differentiation potential. In contrast, those hiPSC which failed to switch off OKSM expression were unable to differentiate towards either lineage, suggesting that the residual expression of the reprogramming factors functions as a developmental brake impairing hiPSC differentiation. Successful adenovirus-based Cre-mediated excision of the provirus OKSM cassette in CB-derived CD34+ hiPSC with residual transgene expression resulted in transgene-free hiPSC clones with significantly improved differentiation capacity. Overall, our findings confirm that residual expression of reprogramming factors impairs hiPSC differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a complex genetic disease associated with a defective DNA repair pathway known as the FA pathway. In contrast to many other FA proteins, BRCA2 participates downstream in this pathway and has a critical role in homology\u2010directed recombination (HDR). In our current studies, we have observed an extremely low reprogramming efficiency in cells with a hypomorphic mutation in Brca2 (Brca2\u039427/\u039427), that was associated with increased apoptosis and defective generation of nuclear RAD51 foci during the reprogramming process. Gene complementation facilitated the generation of Brca2\u039427/\u039427 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a disease\u2010free FA phenotype. Karyotype analyses and comparative genome hybridization arrays of complemented Brca2\u039427/\u039427 iPSCs showed, however, the presence of different genetic alterations in these cells, most of which were not evident in their parental Brca2\u039427/\u039427 mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Gene\u2010corrected Brca2\u039427/\u039427 iPSCs could be differentiated in vitro toward the hematopoietic lineage, although with a more limited efficacy than WT iPSCs or mouse embryonic stem cells, and did not engraft in irradiated Brca2\u039427/\u039427 recipients. Our results are consistent with previous studies proposing that HDR is critical for cell reprogramming and demonstrate that reprogramming defects characteristic of Brca2 mutant cells can be efficiently overcome by gene complementation. Finally, based on analysis of the phenotype, genetic stability, and hematopoietic differentiation potential of gene\u2010corrected Brca2\u039427/\u039427 iPSCs, achievements and limitations in the application of current reprogramming approaches in hematopoietic stem cell therapy are also discussed.

        "abstract": "The recent advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and gene therapy tools has raised the possibility of autologous cell therapy for rare genetic diseases. However, cellular reprogramming is inefficient in certain diseases such as ataxia telangiectasia, Fanconi anemia, LIG4 syndrome, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva syndrome, owing to interference of the disease-related genes. To overcome these therapeutic limitations, it is necessary to fundamentally correct the abnormal gene during or prior to the reprogramming process. In addition, as genetic etiology of Parkinson's disease, it has been well known that induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) were progressively depleted by LRRK2 gene mutation, LRRK2 (G2019S). Thus, to maintain the induced NSCs directly derived from PD patient cells harboring LRRK2 (G2019S), it would be ideal to simultaneously treat the LRRK2 (G2019S) fibroblast during the process of TD. Therefore, simultaneous reprogramming (or TD) and gene therapy would provide the solution for therapeutic limitation caused by vulnerability of reprogramming or TD, in addition to being suitable for general application to the generation of autologous cell-therapy products for patients with genetic defects, thereby obviating the need for the arduous processes currently required.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The extrapolability of the current tumorigenicity test performed by transplanting human cell product into immunodeficient (NOG) mice was investigated. For this purpose, the susceptibility to form teratomas of NOG mice was assessed by transplanting undifferentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as positive control cells via the liver, striatum, or tail vein and evaluating the TPD50 value (dose required to form teratomas in half of the transplanted mice). This was then compared to the TPD50 of syngeneic or allogeneic mouse models. The TPD50 of C57/BL/6(B6)-iPSC or 129/Ola(129)-embryonic stem cell (ESC) transplanted into the liver of syngeneic mice was 4.08\u2005\u00d7\u2005105 and 4.64\u2005\u00d7\u2005104 cells, respectively, while the TPD50 of hiPSC administered into the liver of NOG mice was 4.64\u2005\u00d7\u2005104 cells. The TPD50 of B6-miPSC-synergic, 129-mESC-synergic, or 129-cell/B6 allogeneic transplantation into the striatum was 5.09\u2005\u00d7\u2005102, 1.0\u2005\u00d7\u2005104, and 3.73\u2005\u00d7\u2005104 cells, respectively, while that of hiPSC/NOG mice was 1.0\u2005\u00d7\u2005103 cells. The TPD50 for B6-miPSC or 129-mESC syngeneic tail vein infusion was 3.16\u2005\u00d7\u2005106 or 5.62\u2005\u00d7\u2005106 cells, respectively, while no incidence was observed from 1\u2005\u00d7\u2005107 B6-miPSCs in 129 mice or hiPSCs in NOG mice infusion study. Although the number of data sets was limited, these data indicate that the teratoma formation from transplanted undifferentiated hiPSCs via the liver or striatum in NOG mice is comparable to that in syngeneic or allogeneic mouse transplantation model, suggesting that the result of the current tumorigenicity test in NOG mice would provide useful information to infer the incidence of teratoma from residual undifferentiated hPSCs in hPSC-derived products after transplantation.",
