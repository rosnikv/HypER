        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the effectiveness of high-intensity aerobic training compared with low-intensity training in terms of energy cost of locomotion, peak oxygen uptake, peak power, and self-reported physical function in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty children with JIA, ages 8-16 years, were enrolled in a randomized, single-blind controlled trial. Both groups participated in a 12-week, 3-times-weekly training program consisting of high-intensity aerobics in the experimental group and qigong in the control group. Subjects underwent exercise testing measuring submaximal oxygen uptake at 3 km/hour (VO(2submax)) as the primary outcome, maximal oxygen uptake, and peak power at the beginning and end of the program. Physical function was measured using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe exercise program was well tolerated in both groups. There was no difference in VO(2submax) or any other exercise testing measures between the groups through the study period and no indication of improvement. Both groups showed significant improvements in C-HAQ with no difference between the groups. Adherence was higher in the control group than the experimental group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings suggest that activity programs with or without an aerobic training component are safe and may result in an important improvement in physical function. The intensity of aerobic training did not seem to provide any additional benefits, but higher adherence in the qigong program may suggest that less intensive regimens are easier for children with JIA to comply with, and provide a degree of benefit equivalent to more intensive programs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExercise therapy is considered an important component of the treatment of arthritis. The efficacy of exercise therapy has been reviewed in adults with rheumatoid arthritis but not in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of exercise therapy on functional ability, quality of life and aerobic capacity in children with JIA.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2007), EMBASE (January 1966 to October 2007), PEDro (January 1966 to October 2007), SportDiscus (January 1966 to October 2007), Google Scholar (to October 2007), AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine) (January 1985 to October 2007), Health Technologies Assessment database (January 1988 to October 2007), ISI Web Science Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (January 1966 to October 2007) and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website (http://www.cps.uk.org) were searched and references tracked.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise treatment in JIA.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nPotentially relevant references were evaluated and all data were extracted by two review authors working independently.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThree out of 16 identified studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 212 participants. All the included studies fulfilled at least seven of 10 methodological criteria. The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08), quality of life (CHQ-PhS: n = 115; WMD -3.96, 95% CI -8.91 to 1.00) and aerobic capacity (n = 124; WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.19). The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant. None of the studies reported negative effects of the exercise therapy.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nOverall, based on 'silver-level' evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy can improve functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity or pain. The low number of available RCTs limits the generalisability. The included and excluded studies were all consistent about the adverse effects of exercise therapy; no short-term detrimental effects of exercise therapy were found in any study. Both included and excluded studies showed that exercise does not exacerbate arthritis. The large heterogeneity in outcome measures, as seen in this review, emphasises the need for a standardised assessment or a core set of functional and physical outcome measurements suited for health research to generate evidence about the possible benefits of exercise therapy for patients with JIA. Although the short-term effects look promising, the long-term effect of exercise therapy remains unclear.",

The review's focus on exercise therapy in JIA makes it partially dependent on the source paper's hypothesis that exercise training can improve physical function in children with arthritis. However, the review's findings suggest that the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise therapy in JIA is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits."

        "abstract": "Evidence on the effects of exercise in the treatment of patients with chronic diseases should be based on well designed randomised controlled trials. The most consistent finding of the meta-analyses summarised in the present work is that aerobic/functional capacity and muscle strength can be improved by exercise training among patients with different diseases without having detrimental effects on disease progression. This is important, as with population aging exercise therapy may be an important means of reducing disability and increasing the number of older people living independently. Additionally, there is accumulating evidence that in patients with chronic disease exercise therapy is effective in improving the prognostic risk factor profile and, in certain diseases, in delaying mortality. In some diseases, such as osteoarthritis, pain symptoms may also be reduced. Severe complications during the exercise therapy programs were rare.",

        "abstract": "It is not known to what extent exercise programs increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in patients with coronary heart diseases (CHD). The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of exercise interventions on VO2max in subjects with CHD. Database search of randomized controlled trials was conducted from PubMed. Studies were included that reported the characteristics and effects of exercise interventions in subjects with CHD, included a non\u2010exercise control group and measured VO2max using direct measurement method. Eighteen studies were eligible. Exercise interventions increased VO2max by 2.6 \u00b1 1.6 and 0.3 \u00b1 1.4\u2003mL/kg/min in the training and control groups, respectively. The net difference in the change of VO2max between the groups was 2.3\u2003mL/kg/min with a standardized mean difference of 0.60 [95% CI 0.47, 0.74] (P<0.001). Aerobic training led to a larger difference in VO2max between the groups than other training modes. Over 6 months of training period and training started within 3 months after a cardiac event also had a significant effect on VO2max. This analysis showed that a long exercise training period starting soon after a cardiac event improved VO2max in patients with CHD most effectively. In future studies, the training programs should be designed carefully as even larger improvements in VO2max may be possible.",

        "title": "Importance of characteristics and modalities of physical activity and exercise in the management of cardiovascular health in individuals with cardiovascular disease (Part III)",
        "abstract": "The beneficial effect of exercise training and exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on symptom-free exercise capacity, cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function, quality of life, general healthy lifestyle, and reduction of depressive symptoms and psychosocial stress is nowadays well recognized. However, it remains largely obscure, which characteristics of physical activity (PA) and exercise training \u229f frequency, intensity, time (duration), type (mode), and volume (dose: intensity\u2009\u00d7\u2009duration) of exercise \u2013 are the most effective. The present paper, therefore, will deal with these exercise characteristics in the management of individuals with cardiovascular disease, i.e. coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure patients, but also in patients with congenital or valvular heart disease. Based on the current literature, and if sufficient evidence is available, recommendations from the European Association on Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation are formulated regarding frequency, intensity, time and type of PA, and safety aspects during exercise in patients with cardiovascular disease. This paper is the third in a series of three papers, all devoted to the same theme: the importance of the exercise characteristics in the management of cardiovascular health. Part I is directed to the general population and Part II to individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. In general, PA recommendations and exercise training programmes for patients with coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure need to be tailored to the individual\u2019s exercise capacity and risk profile, with the aim to reach and maintain the individually highest fitness level possible and to perform endurance exercise training 30\u201360\u2009min daily (3\u20135 days per week) in combination with resistance training 2\u20133 times a week. Because of the frequently reported dose\u2013response relationship between training effect and exercise intensity, one should seek sufficiently high training intensities, although more scientific evidence on effect sizes and safety is warranted. At present, there is insufficient data to give more specific recommendations on type, dosage, and intensity of exercise in some other cardiovascular diseases, such as congenital heart disease, valve disease, cardiomyopathies, channelopathies, and patients with implanted devices.",

        "title": "Effect of High\u2010Intensity Training Versus Moderate Training on Peak Oxygen Uptake and Chronotropic Response in Heart Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Crossover Trial",
        "abstract": "In heart transplant (HTx) recipients, there has been reluctance to recommend high\u2010intensity interval training (HIIT) due to denervation and chronotropic impairment of the heart. We compared the effects of 12 weeks' HIIT versus continued moderate exercise (CON) on exercise capacity and chronotropic response in stable HTx recipients >12 months after transplantation in a randomized crossover trial. The study was completed by 16 HTx recipients (mean age 52 years, 75% males). Baseline peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was 22.9\u2009mL/kg/min. HIIT increased VO2peak by 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7\u2009mL/min/kg (17%) and CON by 2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009mL/kg/min (10%) (significantly higher in HIIT; p\u2009<\u20090.001). During HIIT, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.037) with no significant change in CON (p\u2009=\u20090.241; between group difference p\u2009=\u20090.027). Peak heart rate (HRpeak) increased significantly by 4.3\u2009beats per minute (p\u2009=\u20090.014) after HIIT with no significant change in CON (p\u2009=\u20090.34; between group difference p\u2009=\u20090.027). Heart rate recovery (HRrecovery) improved in both groups with a trend toward greater improvement after HIIT. The 5\u2010month washout showed a significant loss of improvement. HIIT was well tolerated, had a superior effect on oxygen uptake, and led to an unexpected increase in HRpeak accompanied by a faster HRrecovery. This indicates that the benefits of HIIT are partly a result of improved chronotropic response.",

        "abstract": "Background Peak ratios of pulmonary gas\u2010exchange to ventilation during exercise (V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E and V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E, termed \u201ccirculatory equivalents\u201d) are sensitive to heart failure (HF) severity, likely reflecting low and/or poorly distributed pulmonary perfusion. We tested whether peak V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E and V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E would: (1) distinguish HF patients from controls; (2) be independent of incremental exercise protocol; and (3) correlate with lactate threshold (LT) and ventilatory compensation point (VCP), respectively. Methods and Results Twenty\u2010four HF patients (61\u00b111 years) with reduced ejection fraction (31\u00b18%) and 11 controls (63\u00b17 years) performed ramp\u2010incremental cycle ergometry. Eighteen HF patients also performed slow (5\u00b11 W/min), medium (9\u00b14 W/min), and fast (19\u00b16 W/min) ramps. Peak V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E and V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E from X\u2010Y plot, and LT and VCP from 9\u2010panel plot, were determined by 2 independent, blinded, assessors. Peak V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E (31.2\u00b14.4 versus 41.8\u00b14.8 mL/L; P<0.0001) and V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E (29.3\u00b13.0 versus 36.9\u00b14.0 mL/L; P<0.0001) were lower in HF than controls. Within individuals, there was no difference across 3 ramp rates in peak V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E (P=0.62) or V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E (P=0.97). Coefficient of variation (CV) in peak V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E was lower than for LT (5.1\u00b12.1% versus 8.2\u00b13.7%; P=0.014), and coefficient of variation in peak V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E was lower than for VCP (3.3\u00b11.8% versus 8.7\u00b14.2%; P<0.001). In all participants, peak V\u02d9O2/V\u02d9E was correlated with, but occurred earlier than, LT (r 2=0.94; mean bias, \u22120.11 L/min), and peak V\u02d9CO2/V\u02d9E was correlated with, but occurred earlier than, VCP (r 2=0.98; mean bias \u22120.08 L/min). Conclusions Peak circulatory equivalents during exercise are strongly associated with (but not identical to) LT and VCP. Peak circulatory equivalents are reliable, objective, effort\u2010independent indices of gas\u2010exchange abnormality in HF.",
