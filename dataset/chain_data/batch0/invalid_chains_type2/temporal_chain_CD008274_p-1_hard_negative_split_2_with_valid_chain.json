        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNational guidelines recommend consideration of step down or withdrawal of medication in patients with well-controlled hypertension, but knowledge of factors that predict or mediate success in achieving this goal is limited.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo identify patient characteristics associated with success in controlling blood pressure (BP) after withdrawal of antihypertensive medication.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly tested whether lifestyle interventions designed to promote weight loss or a reduced intake of sodium, alone or in combination, provided satisfactory BP control among elderly patients (aged 60-80 years) with hypertension after withdrawal from antihypertensive drug therapy. Participants were observed for 15 to 36 months after attempted drug withdrawal.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nTrial end points were defined by (1) a sustained BP of 150/90 mm Hg or higher, (2) a clinical cardiovascular event, or (3) a decision by participants or their personal physicians to resume BP medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProportional hazards regression analyses indicated that the hazard (+/- SE) of experiencing an end point among persons assigned to active interventions was 75% +/- 9% (weight loss), 68% +/- 7% (sodium reduction), and 55% +/- 7% (combined weight loss/sodium reduction) that of the hazard for those assigned to usual care. Lower baseline systolic BP (P < .001), fewer years since diagnosis of hypertension (P < .001), fewer years of antihypertensive treatment (P < .001), and no history of cardiovascular disease (P = .01) were important predictors of maintaining successful nonpharmacological BP control throughout follow-up, based on logistic regression analysis. Age, ethnicity, baseline level of physical activity baseline weight, medication class, smoking status, and alcohol intake were not statistically significant predictors. During follow-up, the extent of weight loss (P = .001) and urinary sodium excretion (P = .04) were associated with a reduction in the risk of trial end points in a graded fashion.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWithdrawal from antihypertensive medication is most likely to be successful in patients with well-controlled hypertension who have been recently (within 5 years) diagnosed or treated, and who adhere to life-style interventions involving weight loss and sodium reduction. More than 80% of these patients may have success in medication withdrawal for longer than 1 year.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFew trials have evaluated the effects of reduced sodium intake in older individuals, and no trial has examined the effects in relevant subgroups such as African Americans.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe effects of sodium reduction on blood pressure (BP) and hypertension control were evaluated in 681 patients with hypertension, aged 60 to 80 years, randomly assigned to a reduced sodium intervention or control group. Participants (47% women, 23% African Americans) had systolic BP less than 145 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 85 mm Hg while taking 1 antihypertensive medication. Three months after the start of intervention, medication was withdrawn. The primary end point was occurrence of an average systolic BP of 150 mm Hg or more, an average diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or more, the resumption of medication, or a cardiovascular event during follow-up (mean, 27.8 months).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with control, mean urinary sodium excretion was 40 mmol/d less in the reduced sodium intervention group (P<.001); significant reductions in sodium excretion occurred in subgroups defined by sex, race, age, and obesity. Prior to medication withdrawal, mean reductions in systolic and diastolic BPs from the reduced sodium intervention, net of control, were 4.3 mm Hg (P<.001) and 2.0 mm Hg (P =.001). During follow-up, an end point occurred in 59% of reduced sodium and 73% of control group participants (relative hazard ratio = 0.68, P<.001). In African Americans, the corresponding relative hazard ratio was 0.56 (P =.005); results were similar in other subgroups. In dose-response analyses, end points were progressively less frequent with greater sodium reduction (P for trend =.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA reduced sodium intake is a broadly effective, nonpharmacologic therapy that can lower BP and control hypertension in older individuals.",

        "title": "Systematic Review: Antihypertensive Drug Therapy in Black Patients",
        "abstract": "Black persons of sub-Saharan African descent differ from white persons and other populations in cultural, social, and psychological roots, as well as in biological characteristics (1, 2). Although the black population is heterogeneous, hypertension investigators have considered black persons a distinct biological entity when studying environmental and genetic factors that might explain the observed group differences in risk for hypertension and response to treatment (1, 3-5). Not only are black persons more likely to develop hypertension, but compared with hypertension in other ethnic groups, the disorder in black patients is often more severe, more resistant to treatment, and more likely to be fatal at an earlier age (1, 3). Thus, hypertension seems to be a more aggressive disease in black patients; this has important implications for the choice of an antihypertensive agent (1). However, there is no consensus on the optimum drug treatment strategy for hypertension in black patients (1, 6-11). Current guidelines offer different opinions (1, 7-11) and either contain no specific treatment strategies for black patients (7), describe strategies without a specific drug of choice for first-line treatment (8), or advise the use of a specific drug, usually a diuretic, as first-line treatment (1, 9-11). We conducted this systematic review to critically assess the existing evidence on the efficacy of all commonly used antihypertensive drugs in reducing blood pressure and morbidity and mortality outcomes in this population. Methods Literature Search We sought to identify all trials, published or unpublished, that considered the effect of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive black adults. To identify relevant trials, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud), African Index Medicus, and the Cochrane Library from their inception through November 2003 and searched PubMed from September 2003 through March 2004. We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Best Evidence, and Reviews in Progress (all from the United Kingdom) and hand searched Index Medicus from 1953 backward. Finally, we searched for trials by using references from textbooks, narrative reviews, and systematic reviews; by contacting experts and pharmaceutical companies; and by searching the Internet. We did not restrict the searches to any specific languages. Detailed search and retrieval strategies have been published elsewhere (12, 13). Selection Criteria To assess the blood pressurelowering efficacy of the drugs, we included randomized, placebo-controlled trials of at least 2 weeks' duration that compared single drugs with concurrent placebo treatment and provided quantitative data on effects on systemic arterial blood pressure (as a continuous or dichotomous measure) in black adults. We also determined whether an increase in drug dose was needed for adequate blood pressure control. To assess the effects of drugs on morbidity and mortality, we included randomized, controlled trials that lasted at least 1 year, that used single drug treatment or compared single drugbased combinations of antihypertensive drugs with other combinations or with concurrent placebo treatment, and provided separate quantitative data on morbidity or mortality in black adults. We further assessed whether drug dose was increased or other drugs were added to reach the blood pressure goal. In addition, we evaluated adverse effects; discontinuation of drug therapy; and dropouts due to lack of effect, adverse effects, or other reasons, as defined by the authors. Trials that considered oral treatment with diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, centrally acting agents, peripheral adrenergic neuron antagonists, -blockers, -blockers, single agents with combined - and -blocking activity, direct vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers were eligible for inclusion. We included only trials that reported the number of black patients treated (per protocol or intention-to-treat analysis). Data Assessment At least 2 reviewers independently assessed each eligible study. Disagreement was resolved through final discussion. Investigators of each study were contacted twice to obtain missing information. We assigned a Jadad score ranging from 0 to 5 points to the included trials according to whether the investigators described the study as randomized and double-blind, reported the methods used to randomly assign patients and blind the intervention, and reported the number of withdrawals and dropouts and the reason (14). The score was calculated on the basis of separate descriptions of withdrawals and dropouts for black persons. Other quality aspects addressed were as follows: whether the study assessed the minimum drug dose needed to reach a maximum antihypertensive effect (15), whether outcome assessment was blinded, and whether the report described adverse effects. Statistical Analysis We performed the statistical analysis using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan) software, version 4.2 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, United Kingdom). When studies did not provide SDs, we imputed them per drug type by using the available SDs for each drug class (16). Quantitative analysis of outcomes was based on intention-to-treat results (primary) and per protocol analysis (secondary). Our measure of effect for each study was difference in means (in mm Hg) for systemic arterial blood pressure (continuous measure) and relative risk for dichotomous data. When a study provided only the differences between the drug and placebo groups, we entered data in RevMan as drug results, with a nil for placebo results. We included data from the first part of crossover studies when such data were available; if not, we included the data these studies provided. Before applying approximate chi-square tests for heterogeneity, we clinically assessed studies for heterogeneity in patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. We used I2 statistics to quantify the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that was due to heterogeneity (17). We then explored the sources of the heterogeneity and decided whether we should aggregate the studies. When we aggregated studies, we used the random-effects model. We did not aggregate results with a high variation across studies because of heterogeneity (I2 75%) (17). We performed sensitivity analyses by reanalyzing data using fixed-effects models and by reanalyzing data after excluding studies with imputed SDs, crossover studies, and studies that used per protocol analysis. We predefined the following subgroup analyses (13): patients with differential severity of hypertension before treatment allocation (18); studies conducted in Africa compared with U.S. and Caribbean studies (since European admixture of up to 25% has occurred in the black population in the Americas [19], possible genetic influences on drug responses might be stronger in African patients); and outcomes based on sex. Data Synthesis Trial Retrieval Full reports or abstracts from more than 2900 references of papers yielded 30 trials that involved 53 interventions, 8 classes of antihypertensive drugs, and 20006 black patients. Blood pressure was the main outcome measure in 26 of these trials (20-47) (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the trial flow and reasons for exclusion of trials. Table 1. Characteristics of Included Studies with Blood Pressure Outcomes Figure 1. Trial flow. SHEP Methodologic Quality of Included Studies Jadad scores ranged from 2 to 4 (median, 3) in studies with blood pressure outcomes (Table 1) and from 3 to 5 in studies with morbidity and mortality outcomes. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) study lost 2 points1 for method of randomization (which we could not retrieve) and 1 for withdrawals and dropouts; the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study and the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) both lost 1 point because of withdrawals and dropouts; the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) achieved the maximum score of 5 (48-61). Studies with blood pressure outcomes used preset doses and did not report whether they assessed the minimum dose needed to reach a maximum antihypertensive effect in black people (15). No trial reported subgroup analyses based on baseline blood pressure. Three trials reported blinding of assessment of outcome (49, 53, 57). Adverse effects were reported in 12 of 26 studies that had blood pressure outcomes, and dropouts and withdrawals were described in 14 studies (total rates, 0% to 52%; median, 14%). Two of the 4 trials with morbidity and mortality outcomes described adverse effects (57, 61), and 1 reported the dropout percentage for black patients (31%) (57). Seventeen trials used intention-to-treat analysis, including all trials that had morbidity and mortality outcomes; 13 trials used per protocol analysis (Table 1). Seven studies were crossover studies (21, 29, 34-37, 43), and 1 provided separate data on the first part of the crossover study (43). Trials with Blood Pressure Outcomes Blood PressureLowering Efficacy The trials with blood pressure outcomes included patients with baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) up to 225 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of up to 155 mm Hg. The median duration of active treatment was 8 weeks (range, 2 to 52 weeks). With the exception of -blockers for SBP, all the reviewed antihypertensive drugs were more effective than placebo in reducing SBP and DBP as continuous measures, although the effect of -blockers on diastolic blood pressure was of marginal significance (Figures 2 and 3). Four trials showed a tendency toward an increase in SBP with the use of -blockers (29, 35, 39, 43), and trials that reported results of individual patients (29, 34) f",

        "title": "Calcium Channel Blockers: A More Expansive Treatment Role",
        "abstract": "SUPPL. 1 VOL. 7 NO. 4 APRIL 2005 2 Since the very beginning of calcium channel blocker (CCB) use in the treatment of hypertension, these agents became known as very effective antihypertensive agents, providing substantial and consistent blood pressure (BP) reduction in all age groups and races.1 The BP reduction with CCBs can be seen even with a first dose or at least after a few days, which can be expected to improve compliance and both patient and doctor satisfaction. Unlike other vasodilators, CCBs are mildly natriuretic and do not bring about volume retention.2 Thus, for the most part, CCBs lower BP by dropping peripheral vascular resistance. These drugs are of proven utility in BP reduction in certain patient subsets, including the elderly with systolic hypertension3,4 and the African-American hypertensive.5 The decrease in BP with CCBs is proportional to the pretreatment levels of BP, and hypotension is uncommon.6 Moreover, the quick onset of action with these drugs comparably reduces short-term cardiovascular outcomes and is now viewed as an important facet of their use (Figure).7 Head-to-head comparisons of different CCBs reveal sparingly little difference in the magnitude of the BP fall with the various agents, provided that comparable doses are given.8 In addition, numerous clinical studies suggest comparable (if not superior) efficacy to other antihypertensive agents.1 Furthermore, these drugs are now used in such diverse conditions as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, angina pectoris, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, esophageal spasm, and cerebral vasospasm.9 HISTORY The recent history of the CCB class dates to their approval in the 1980s for the treatment of hypertension. These compounds became the best-selling antihypertensive drugs during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Despite their considerable popularity, the foothold of CCBs in the hypertensive market developed without their having been tested in a single major cardiovascular trial. Thus, it came as no great surprise that the positioning of these drugs was vulnerable and so, in the middle of the 1990s, contrarian views began to emerge concerning the cardiovascular risks of the CCB class. These negative perceptions quickly snowballed and served as the basis for considerable and oftentimes harsh debate on the place of CCBs as primary and/or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of hypertension. Such debate is not without precedent since similar intellectual outbursts have happened on occasion with other drug classes. As a matter of record, one of the first such assaults occurred by way of retrospective studies implicating reserpine in breast cancer risk. This claim was eventually refuted, but only after a series of prospective studies and metaanalysis of case-controlled studies were undertaken that provided the factual basis for challenging this unwarranted association.10,11 A second upheaval was set off by a subanalysis of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT),12 from which it was inferred that in a subset of hypertensive patients with ECG abnormalities at rest, diuretic treatment may have been of more harm than good. Despite this claim and other conjecture, diuretics (especially at low doses) remain an everyday ingredient of antihypertensive therapy and a highlypositioned component of virtually all algorithms for the treatment of hypertension.13 www.lejacq.com ID: 4495 I n t r o d u c t i o n",

        "abstract": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Through blood pressure reduction, and possibly other mechanisms such as antioxidative effects, they may play a role in diminishing the risk for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes. The combination of CCBs with other newer antihypertensive agents such, as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may provide complementary effects on risk reduction in cardiovascular adverse events and renal disease. Although the efficacy of CCBs as antihypertensive agents has been adequately demonstrated, there have been concerns regarding the use of short acting dihydropyridines after acute myocardial infarction. There have also been questions about the role of CCBs with regards to other antihypertensive agents in renal disease. For example, differential effects of dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine CCBs may affect progression of renal disease and risk for diabetes. Certain precautions involving drug interactions are needed because of the effects of CCBs on the CYP450 enzyme systems.",

The most recent report (2003) of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure uses BP thresholds to define categories of normal, prehypertension, and hypertension. A new definition proposed by the Hypertension Writing Group in 2005 offers an approach to diagnosis and management based on global or total risk. Thus, even in the absence of sustained elevations in BP, patients may have a moderate to high risk of vascular events due to the presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors, disease markers, and target organ damage. The 2007 European guidelines continue to classify hypertension based on cutoffs while also placing emphasis on multivariate formulations for cardiovascular risk assessment and goals of therapy.

In 70 nondiabetic chronic kidney disease stage 1/2 patients who had been already treated with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker valsartan for at least 12 months, amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide was added to their existing medication. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid arteries, urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) were determined before and 12 months after the start of add-on treatments. Add-on amlodipine and add-on hydrochlorothiazide significantly and similarly decreased 24-hour ambulatory BP by 18 and 19 mm Hg, respectively, PWV by 206 and 184 cm/s, respectively, and UAE, but did not change the IMT. The decreases in BP significantly contributed to the decreases in PWV and UAE and suggested that the decrease in serum cholesterol level brought about by add-on amlodipine also contributed to the decrease in UAE.

Methods:Forty hypertensive patients with CKD were assigned randomly to either of the 2 treatments: 8 mg benidipine once daily (n = 20, group A) or 5 mg amlodipine once daily (n = 20, group B). Treatment was continued for 12 months. Blood pressure, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary protein excretion, urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein, interleukin-6, high mobility group box-1 protein, urinary 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine, pulse wave velocity, intima-media thickness, and blood asymmetric dimethylarginine were monitored. Results:Blood pressure decreased equally in both groups (P < 0.001, at 6 and 12 months versus before treatment). Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate changed little during the experimental period in each group. However, urinary protein excretion (P < 0.001), urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (P < 0.001), urinary 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (P < 0.001), blood interleukin-6 (P < 0.001), blood high mobility group box-1 (P < 0.05), and pulse wave velocity (P < 0.01) decreased more in group A than in group B with 12 months of treatment. The percent reductions in intima-media thickness and blood asymmetric dimethylarginine were significantly greater in group A than in group B (P < 0.001). Conclusions:Benidipine is more effective than amlodipine for protecting renal function and potentially for ameliorating atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients with mild CKD.

Compared with nondiabetic rats, diabetes (D) was associated with increased urine albumin excretion (UAE, 12.6 \u00b1 3.40 vs. 3.73 \u00b1 1.14 mg/day), glomerular filtration rate (2.17 \u00b1 0.09 vs. 1.64 \u00b1 0.12 ml/min/g kidney weight), glomerulosclerosis (0.21 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 AU) and infiltration of inflammatory cells (18.5 \u00b1 2.78 vs. 6.92 \u00b1 0.70 cells/cm2), but did not affect mean arterial pressure (MAP, 110 \u00b1 4.70 vs. 109 \u00b1 5.33 mm Hg). While DA20 abolished glomerular hyperfiltration (1.49 \u00b1 0.05 ml/min/g kidney weight) and inflammatory cell abundance (6.0 \u00b1 0.79 cells/cm2), it exacerbated UAE (43.5 \u00b1 8.49 mg/day) and increased MAP (132 \u00b1 3.76 mm Hg), but had no effect on renal pathology. These data suggest that amlodipine reduces renal inflammation and abolished glomerular hyperfiltration, but increases blood pressure and exacerbates albuminuria in the rat model of normotensive diabetic kidney disease. We conclude that amlodipine may have limited renoprotective effects in the face of hyperfiltration and absence of elevated blood pressure.",

The source paper found benidipine to be more effective than amlodipine in protecting renal function in hypertensive patients with mild CKD, and this paper examines amlodipine's effects in a different context, a nonhypertensive model of diabetes-associated hyperfiltration."

        "abstract": "Background: Excessive urinary albumin excretion is associated with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) used as antihypertensives suppress such albuminuria with variable efficacy. While hypertension benefits from the addition of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), it is unknown if ARBs alter the effects of CCBs on albuminuria. Objective: This study compared the efficacy of combined ARB irbesartan with either CCB amlodipine or CCB cilnidipine on albuminuria associated with experimental diabetic nephropathy. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with a CCB alone (amlodipine 2.0 mg/kg/d or cilnidipine 2.0 mg/kg/d), an ARB alone (irbesartan 20.0 mg/kg/d), or combinations. In the acute protocol, changes in glomerular afferent and efferent arteriole diameters were examined by a charge-coupled device video microscope following single doses. In the chronic protocol, urinary albumin excretion, glomerular reactive oxygen species, and endothelial surface layer (ESL) condition were evaluated after 2 weeks of daily treatment. Results: In the acute protocol, cilnidipine mono therapy caused a greater dilation in glomerular efferent arterioles than amlodipine monotherapy, while combination therapy with irbesartan induced comparable efferent arteriole dilation. In the chronic protocol, cilnidipine mono therapy suppressed albuminuria, reduced glomerular oxidative stress, and protected the glomerular ESL against degeneration to a much greater extent that amlodipine monotherapy. However, addition of irbesartan reduced albumin excretion, oxidative stress, and ESL degeneration to the same extent in both groups. Conclusions: While cilnidipine is more effective alone, the combinations of irbesartan with cilnidipine or amlodipine are equally effective for reducing albuminuria and other pathological sequela of experimental diabetic nephropathy.",
