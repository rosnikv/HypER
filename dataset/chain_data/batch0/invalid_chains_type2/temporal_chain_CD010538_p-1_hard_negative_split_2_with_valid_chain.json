        "title": "Efficacy of symptomatic control of knee osteoarthritis with 0.0125% of capsaicin versus placebo.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent and associated with both pain and functional disability. Current treatments aim to alleviate mild to moderate symptoms by various methods. Topical capsaicin (0.075% and 0.05%) has been evaluated for the treatment of the painful joints. A burning sensation was the most common side effect at these strengths. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 0.0125% capsaicin gel (Capsika gel) compared to a placebo (the vehicle gel) in patients with symptomatic OA knee.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nThis was a cross-over; double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 100 patients with mild to moderate knee OA. All of the patients received either capsaicin gel or placebo gel applied to the affected knee, three times daily for 4 weeks with one week washout period after which the treatment switched to either capsaicin gel or placebo gel for the next 4 weeks. A blinded examiner used the visual analog scale (VAS) and WOMAC score to do weekly assessments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects averaged 61 years of age (range, 44 to 82). During the enrollment phase, only female farmers presented. Mean body weight and height was 62.97 +/- 10.25 kg and 1.54 +/- 0.053 m, respectively The respective baseline VAS and WOMAC score was 6.40 +/- 1.64 and 51.65 +/- 13.3. The severity of OA, according to the KL criteria was: 83 patients with grade 2 and 16 with grade 3. The respective mean difference of VAS and total WOMAC score in the capsaicin group vs. the placebo group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean difference of the WOMAC pain, stiffness and functional subscales in the capsaicin vs. the placebo group was also significant (p < 0.05). The only adverse event reported was a burning sensation. During the 4-week treatment with capsaicin, approximately 67% of patients had a burning sensation but none withdrew for this reason.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n0.0125% capsaicin gel was an effective treatment in mildly to moderately painful OA knees. The burning sensation reported by patients in the capsaicin group was less disturbing than in previous studies and none of the present patients withdrew for this reason.",

        "title": "Pharmacologic Management of Osteoarthritis-Related Pain in Older Adults: A review shows that many drug therapies provide small-to-modest pain relief.",
        "abstract": "OVERVIEW: Because pain is a common and debilitating symptom of osteoarthritis in older adults, the authors reviewed data on the efficacy and safety of commonly used oral, topical, and intraarticular drug therapies in this population. A search of several databases found that most studies have focused on knee osteoarthritis and reported only short-term outcomes. Also, treatment efficacy was found to vary by drug class; the smallest effect was observed with acetaminophen and the largest with opioids and viscosupplements. Acetaminophen and topical agents had the best safety profiles, whereas oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and opioids had the worst. Little data were available on patients ages 75 years old and older and on patients from diverse racial and ethnic groups. Most drug therapies gave mild-to-moderate pain relief; their long-term safety and efficacy and their effects in diverse populations (particularly older adults) remain undetermined.",

        "title": "Using Viscosupplementation to Treat Knee Osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Abstract This article provides physicians specializing in nonsurgical sports medicine with an overview of viscosupplementation as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Osteoarthritis is a painful, disabling condition that is becoming more prevalent in patients and is generally treated using conservative nonpharmacologic measures. If conservative measures are unsuccessful at alleviating pain, current recommendations include prescribing acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to patients. However, long-term use of these agents increases the risk for liver, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal complications in patients. Viscosupplementation is the term used for intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid/hylans. Intra-articular injections of these agents have good safety profiles and have shown efficacy for treating knee OA pain. Viscosupplementation injections relieve pain for \u2a7e 26 weeks, which is longer than the short-term pain relief derived from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid injections. Additionally, viscosupplementation administered to patients in earlier stages of OA may be more beneficial than when given later in the treatment of OA. As part of a multimodal algorithm, viscosupplementation combined with conventional therapy or other pharmacologic agents has been shown to be more effective at managing OA than conventional care alone. This article reviews the evidence for using viscosupplementation as part of a comprehensive program for managing OA in patients.",

        "title": "Efficacy of combination therapy of Hyaluronic acid and Methylprednisolon verses Hyaluronic acid single therapy in knee Osteoarthritis : A comparative study",
        "abstract": "Background : Osteoarthritis of knee joint is one of the most common problem which cause pain, loss of function even joint disability and increases misery and morbidity in old age. Now a day\u2019s intra-articular injection of single Hyaluronic acid or corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) are using for knee osteoarthritis cases. But the combined therapy by injection of both Hyaluronic acid and Methyl prednisolone are not so much practiced and still under debate. Objectives : To compare the efficacy of intra-articular injection of combined Hyaluronic acid and Methyl prednisolone with single Hyaluronic acid alone. Methods : A prospective, comparative study was done in Northern International Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, during May 2017 to April 2018 at Out Patient Department with 80 patients (132 knees). Patients were randomized into two groups: Group-A with 40 patients with 15 unilateral and 25 bilateral knee cases (65 knees) were treated with combined Hyaluronic acid and Methyl prednisolone and Group-B with 40 patients with13 unilateral and 27 bilateral knee cases (67 knees) were infiltrated with single Hyaluronic acid. Results were evaluated with Knee Society Score (KSS) and Visual analogue score (VAS) at the 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month after injection. Result : In both Group (A and B) patients of age 61\u201370 years were highest, 50% and 45% respectively. Male and female ratio was 1:2.2. At the 1st week KSS for pain in Group-A (mean 65.6) was better than Group-B (mean 57.4). At the 1st month mean pain scores (Group-A 72.4, Group-B 64.4) and the 3rd month (Group-A 81.4, Group-B 75.6) and mean function scores at 1st week (Group-A 61.3, Group-B 49.6)), 1st month (Group-A65.1, Group-B 53.6) and 3rd month (Group-A68.4, Group-B 59.4). The KSS for pain and function improved in combination therapy group.VAS decreased in both groups. Conclusion : As combination therapy by Hyaluronic acid and Methyl prednisolone showed better efficacy than single Hyaluronic acid. Therefore, combination of these two drugs in a single vial can be used as an effective and easy nonoperative treatment of knee osteoarthritis.",

        "title": "No Difference Between One-shot Co-injection of Corticosteroids and Hyaluronic Acid in a Three-injection Regimen for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized, Double-blind Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough many guidelines now recommend against hyaluronic acid (HA) injections alone for the nonoperative management of knee osteoarthritis (OA), prior studies have disagreed about whether adding an intra-articular corticosteroid to HA results in sufficient benefit to justify the potential dose-dependent and time-dependent chondrotoxicity of corticosteroids.\n\n\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES\n(1) Do patients with knee OA treated with low-dose intra-articular corticosteroids and HA administered under ultrasound guidance have more favorable patient-reported knee OA-related outcomes from 1 to 26 weeks after treatment than those treated with ultrasound-guided HA injections alone? (2) Do patients treated with a corticosteroid co-injection exhibit more favorable physical functional performance than those treated with injections of HA alone?\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind trial at a small medical center in urban Taipei, Taiwan. We considered those who fulfilled the clinical and radiographic criteria for knee OA, defined by the American College of Rheumatology as a Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3, as potentially eligible. We excluded those who had a previous knee fracture or surgery and those who had received intra-articular knee injections of HA or corticosteroids within 6 months of the trial. Based on these criteria, 78 patients were eligible, and 76 agreed to be randomized to the co-injection or HA-only groups through block randomization. The groups had 38 patients each; all participants who completed the study follow-up were analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized and treated. There was no crossover. The patients in the co-injection group were treated with a one-shot co-injection of HA with corticosteroids (Hyruan Plus: molecular weight, 3000 kDa, 10 mg/mL HA, 2 mL with triamcinolone acetonide 10 mg/dL, 1 mL) in the first week followed by two injections of HA (10 mg/mL, 2 mL) at a 1-week interval. The patients in the HA-only group received three HA injections (Hyruan Plus: molecular weight, 3000 kDa, 10 mg/mL HA, 2 mL) administered at a 1-week interval. A senior physiatrist performed ultrasound-guided knee injections using the lateral suprapatellar approach. The physiatrist, participants, and outcome assessor were all blinded to the injection contents. No differences were observed between the two groups regarding primary demographic data, baseline WOMAC and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) scores, and physical functional performance. Three participants experienced localized swelling after the injections, and all symptoms improved after a few days of localized ice pack application. A total of 3.9% of patients (three of 76) had adverse events (mainly localized swelling of the knee, with or without accompanying pain), with no between-group differences in the frequency of adverse events. No severe side effects were reported during or after the injections. The patient-reported outcomes were the WOMAC and KOOS scores. The objective outcome was physical function performance (speed for 10-meter regular and fastest walking, and time for stair-climbing and chair-rising). The primary outcome timepoint was 6 months postinjection. A sample size of 34 participants was required in each group, based on a difference in WOMAC scores of 58 points, a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.8.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found no difference in improvement from baseline between the two groups regarding patient-reported outcomes at any follow-up timepoint, from 1 week after injection to 6 months. At 6 months post-treatment, compared with baseline, there were no between-group differences in improvement between the co-injection group and the HA-only group in terms of WOMAC pain scores (mean difference 1 [95% CI -2 to 3]; p = 0.62), stiffness (mean difference -11 [95% CI -13 to -9]; p < 0.001), and physical function (mean difference -4 [95% CI -5 to -3]; p <\u20090.001) and KOOS scores for pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sports and recreation, and quality of life. Except for chair-rising time at 6 months, which may have represented spurious significance because of the number of comparisons, compared with baseline, we found no differences in improvement between the two groups regarding the regular and fastest walking speed and stair ascent and descent time.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe found that a single co-injection of corticosteroids along with HA did not confer any additional benefit regarding patient-reported outcomes or physical function compared with a three-injection regimen of HA. Therefore, we do not recommend a one-shot co-injection of corticosteroids alongside the three-injection regimen of HA for patients with knee OA, and because prior research found HA to be ineffective, HA should not be used with or without corticosteroids for patients with knee OA.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nLevel I, therapeutic study.",
