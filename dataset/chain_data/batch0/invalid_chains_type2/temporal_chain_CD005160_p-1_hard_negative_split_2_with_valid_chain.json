        "title": "Management of fatty liver disease with vitamin E and C compared to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS\nDespite a proposed role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, antioxidant approaches have not been investigated sufficiently in the therapy of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our aim was to determine whether vitamin E plus C therapy is effective in normalization of liver enzymes compared to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in patients with fatty liver disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was an open-labeled, prospective, randomized study enrolling patients with histologically proven fatty liver disease who had chronically elevated alanine aminotransferase, despite a three-month reducing diet. Patients consuming alcohol (more than 20 g/day) were excluded. The patients were randomly prescribed either oral vitamin E (600 IU/day) plus vitamin C (500 mg/day) or ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg/day). Patients were randomized as two groups to receive vitamin E plus vitamin C combination (28 patients, 10 F) or ursodeoxycholic acid treatment (29 patients, 13 F).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant change in body mass index before and after the treatment in both groups. At the end of six months of therapy, serum aspartate aminotransferase and aminotransferase levels significantly decreased in both treatment options. Vitamin E and C combination was more efficacious on serum aminotransferase levels than ursodeoxycholic acid, but the difference was not significant. Alanine aminotransferase decreased to normal levels in 17 of 27 (63%) and in 16 of 29 patients (55%), respectively, in the two groups. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid, but no change was obtained in the vitamin-treated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVitamin E plus C combination treatment is a safe, inexpensive and effective treatment option in patients with fatty liver disease, with results comparable to those obtained with ursodeoxycholic acid. Since more effective new therapeutic options are lacking, patients with fatty liver disease should be encouraged to take vitamin E and C supplements, which are safe and affordable.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a condition characterised by fatty deposition in the hepatocytes of patients in patients with minimal or no alcohol intake. Some patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Bile acids may potentially protect cellular structures and may be of benefit in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo systematically evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005), EMBASE (1980 to July 2005), and The Chinese Biomedical Database (1978 to July 2005). No language restrictions were applied.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised clinical trials evaluating any bile acids versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with NAFLD.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe extracted data from the identified trials as well as contacted authors. We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomised trials by assessing the generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. We made our analyses following the intention-to-treat method by imputing missing data.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified four randomised clinical trials randomising 279 patients. Only one of the trials was considered a low-bias risk trial. One of the trials reported a non-liver-related death in the bile acid group. No significant differences were found regarding mortality or improvement in liver function tests observed after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Data on the radiological and histological responses were too scant to draw any definite conclusions. Adverse events were non-specific and considered of no major clinical relevance.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nPresently, there are insufficient data to support or refute the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.",

        "abstract": "Background: Uncertainty exists regarding the treatment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who are unable to lose weight and/or change lifestyle. The present study assesses the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and dietary supplement interventions for NAFLD. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) both in adults and in children. Results: Fifteen (2 pediatric patients and 13 adults) RCTs met the inclusion criteria. A significant effect on normalization of alanine transaminase was found in patients treated with metformin compared with vitamin E, and in those treated with high-dose (3 g) carnitine vs diet. In contrast, there was no difference in patients treated with pioglitazone combined with vitamin E versus vitamin E alone, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) combined with vitamin E or alone versus placebo, or UDCA versus combination of vitamin E and vitamin C, and in patients treated with vitamin E, probucol, N-acetylcysteine, low doses of carnitine, or Yo Jyo Shi Ko compared with placebo. Aspartate aminotransferase normalization was significantly higher in those treated with UDCA combined with vitamin E versus UDCA alone or placebo, and in those treated with metformin. Small number of subjects, high drop-out rates, and numerous interventions in 1 study limit the value of many studies. Only 7 RCTs analyzed biopsy specimens, but most of them have significant methodological limitations. Pioglitazone had reduced liver necrosis and inflammation in 1 large study. Conclusions: Limited data do not allow one to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy of various treatments for NAFLD.",

        "abstract": "Aim: The renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The beneficial effect of spironolactone in a mouse model with diabetes and NAFLD has recently been reported. The main aim was assessment of the effect of spironolactone on serum metabolic parameters and insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD. Methods: This study includes preliminary results of a single-centre randomised controlled trial of treatment with vitamin E (group 1, 10 patients) versus spironolactone plus vitamin E (group 2, 10 patients) in biopsy-proven NAFLD. Serum transaminases, lipids, potassium, sodium, glucose and insulin were measured, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated before and 8 weeks after baseline assessment. Results: Insulin was decreased within group 2 (15.3 \u00b1 2.7 at baseline vs. 10.3 \u00b1 5.0 at week 8, p = 0.013). Although no difference in glucose was observed, HOMA-IR significantly decreased (4.4 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 0.5, respectively, p = 0.047). QUICKI was increased, but not statistically significantly. Conclusions: Spironolactone and vitamin E combined therapy seems to exhibit a favourable effect on serum insulin and HOMA-IR in patients with NAFLD. If validated in a large-scale clinical trial, it may prove an inexpensive therapeutic approach for the management of NAFLD patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewRecent data suggest that mineralocorticoid receptor activation can affect insulin resistance independent of its effects on blood pressure. This review discusses new evidence linking mineralocorticoid receptor to insulin resistance and the underlying mechanisms of these effects. Recent findingsObservational studies have shown mineralocorticoid activity to be associated with insulin resistance irrespective of race, blood pressure or body weight. Increased mineralocorticoid activity may be the common link between obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, features that make up the metabolic syndrome. Treatment of primary aldosteronism is associated with a decrease in insulin resistance and provides one of the most convincing evidences in favor of the contribution of mineralocorticoid receptor to insulin resistance. Dietary salt restriction, which increases aldosterone levels, is also associated with an increase in insulin resistance. Potential mechanisms by which mineralocorticoid receptor may contribute to insulin resistance include a decreased transcription of the insulin receptor gene, increased degradation of insulin receptor substrates, interference with insulin signaling mechanisms, decreased adiponectin production and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Advantages of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on insulin resistance have been demonstrated in animal models. SummaryThere may be a benefit of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in human insulin resistance states, but more clinical research is needed to explore these possibilities.",

The presence of multiple comorbidities often represents an obstacle for being admitted to clinical settings for the treatment of metabolic diseases.

Rehabilitation of such patients require a here-and-now multidimensional, comprehensive approach, where the intensity of rehabilitative treatments depends on the disability level and severity of comorbidities and consists of the simultaneous provision of physiotherapy, diet and nutritional support, psychological counselling, adapted physical activity, specific nursing in hospitals with appropriate organizational and structural competences.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic condition associated with risk factors for many medical complications and comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, osteoarthritis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, type-2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and different psychosocial issues and psychopathological disorders. Obesity is a highly complex, multifactorial disease: genetic, biological, psychological, behavioral, familial, social, cultural, and environmental factors can influence in different ways. Evidence-based strategies to improve weight loss, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce related comorbidities typically integrate different interventions: dietetic, nutritional, physical, behavioral, psychological, and if necessary, pharmacological and surgical ones. Such treatments are implemented in a multidisciplinary context with a clinical team composed of endocrinologists, nutritionists, dietitians, physiotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and sometimes surgeons. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is traditionally recognized as the best established treatment for binge eating disorder and the most preferred intervention for obesity, and could be considered as the first-line treatment among psychological approaches, especially in a long-term perspective; however, it does not necessarily produce a successful weight loss. Traditional CBT for weight loss and other protocols, such as enhanced CBT, enhanced focused CBT, behavioral weight loss treatment, therapeutic education, acceptance and commitment therapy, and sequential binge, are discussed in this review.

        "abstract": "Objective: Binge eating disorder (BED) is frequently linked with obesity and related health risks like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to determine the effectiveness of brief strategic therapy (BST) compared with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 1 year after a two-phase inpatient and outpatient-telemedicine treatment for BED. Method: Italian women with BED and comorbid obesity were recruited from a self-referred inpatient treatment program for weight loss (N = 60) and randomly assigned to either the BST treatment condition (n = 30) or CBT treatment condition (n = 30). Inpatient psychotherapy sessions were conducted in person and outpatient telemedicine psychotherapy sessions were conducted over the telephone. Multilevel growth curve modeling was used to estimate average growth trajectories from baseline to 1 year after treatment for the following outcomes: binge eating frequency, weight, and global functioning. Results: One year after treatment, women in the BST condition decreased in binge eating frequency and women in the CBT condition did not, whereas women in both conditions improved in weight and global functioning. BST was statistically and clinically superior to CBT in improving binge eating frequency, weight, and global functioning. Conclusions: Examining BED, given the current obesity epidemic, is an important area of study. Findings suggest that BST is statistically and clinically more effective than CBT in treating BED, promoting weight loss, and improving global functioning among women with BED and comorbid obesity 1 year after treatment.

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Stress affects many adolescents and is associated with physical and mental health symptoms that can have a negative impact on normative development. However, there are very few evidence-based, specific treatment approaches. The aim of the study was to investigate an eight-session group intervention using components of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) enriched with elements of CBT (psychoeducation, problem solving) and art therapy, compared to a waitlist control (WLC) group, regarding its efficacy in reducing stress and associated symptoms. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in eight cohorts. Eligible participants were 13\u201318 years old with elevated stress levels. Via block-randomization (n = 70), participants were allocated to receive ACT (n = 38) or WLC (n = 32) and subsequent ACT. We used a multimodal assessment (self-reports, interviews, ecological momentary assessment, physiological markers) before treatment (T1), after the training of the ACT group (T2) and after subsequent training in the WLC group (T3). Primary outcome was perceived stress at T2 assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale. The trial was preregistered at the German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00012778). Results: Results showed significantly lower levels of perceived stress in the ACT group at T2, illustrating superiority of ACT compared to WLC with a medium to large effect size (d = 0.77). Furthermore, the training was effective in the reduction of symptoms of school burnout and physical symptoms associated with stress. Conclusion: Indicated prevention, especially when based on the principles of ACT and CBT, seems efficient in significantly decreasing stress in adolescents with increased stress.",
