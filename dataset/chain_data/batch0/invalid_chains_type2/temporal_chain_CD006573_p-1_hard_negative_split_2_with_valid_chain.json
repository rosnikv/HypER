        "abstract": "A randomized, double\u2010blind, dose\u2010escalation study evaluated the safety and efficacy of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010AbXTL68, a neutralizing, high\u2010affinity, fully human, anti\u2010E2 monoclonal antibody, in 24 HCV\u2010positive patients undergoing liver transplantation. HCV\u2010AbXTL68 or placebo was administered at doses from 20\u2010240 mg as 2\u20104 infusions during the first 24 hours after transplantation, followed by daily infusions for 6 days, weekly infusions for 3 weeks, and either 2 or 4 weekly infusions for 8 weeks. Serum concentrations of total anti\u2010E2 obtained during daily infusions of 120\u2010240 mg HCV\u2010AbXTL68 were 50\u2010200 \u03bcg/mL above concentrations in the placebo group. Median serum concentration of HCV RNA dropped below baseline in all groups immediately after transplantation. On day 2, median change from baseline in HCV RNA was \u22121.8 and \u22122.4 log in the 120\u2010mg and 240\u2010mg groups, respectively, compared with \u22121.5 log with placebo. The difference was lost after day 7 when the dosing frequency was reduced. The coincidence of increases in anti\u2010E2 with decreases in HCV RNA concentration indicate that the dose\u2010related changes in HCV RNA concentration were a result of HCV\u2010AbXTL68 administration in the 120\u2010 and 240\u2010mg groups. The overall incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was higher with placebo (60%) vs. all active treatments combined (42%). In conclusion, HCV\u2010AbXTL68 may decrease serum concentrations of HCV RNA in patients after liver transplantation. Studies evaluating more frequent daily dosing at doses >120 mg are necessary to investigate sustained viral suppression in this population. Liver Transpl 12:1381\u20131389. 2006. \u00a9 2006 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are present in Igs made from anti-HCV-positive plasma. However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412\u2013419 (epitope I) and 434\u2013446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.",

        "title": "Depletion of interfering antibodies in chronic hepatitis C patients and vaccinated chimpanzees reveals broad cross-genotype neutralizing activity",
        "abstract": "Using human immune globulins made from antihepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive plasma, we recently identified two antibody epitopes in the E2 protein at residues 412\u2013426 (epitope I) and 434\u2013446 (epitope II). Whereas epitope I is highly conserved among genotypes, epitope II varies. We discovered that epitope I was implicated in HCV neutralization whereas the binding of non-neutralizing antibody to epitope II disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. These findings suggested that, if this interfering mechanism operates in vivo during HCV infection, a neutralizing antibody against epitope I can be restrained by an interfering antibody, which may account for the persistence of HCV even in the presence of an abundance of neutralizing antibodies. We tested this hypothesis by affinity depletion and peptide-blocking of epitope-II-specific antibodies in plasma of a chronically HCV-infected patient and recombinant E1E2 vaccinated chimpanzees. We demonstrate that, by removing the restraints imposed by the interfering antibodies to epitope-II, neutralizing activity can be revealed in plasma that previously failed to neutralize viral stock in cell culture. Further, cross-genotype neutralization could be generated from monospecific plasma. Our studies contribute to understanding the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization and interference and provide a practical approach to the development of more potent and broadly reactive hepatitis C immune globulins.",

        "abstract": "It has been estimated that viruses are etiological agents in approximately 12% of human cancers. Most of these cancers can be attributed to infections by human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Prophylactic vaccines against other pathogenic viruses have an excellent record as public health interventions in terms of safety, effectiveness, and ability to reach economically disadvantaged populations. These considerations should prompt efforts to develop and implement vaccines against oncoviruses. Safe and effective HBV and HPV vaccines, based on virus-like particles, are commercially available, and the major focus is now on vaccine delivery, especially to low-resource settings. HCV and EBV vaccines are under active development, but few clinical trials have been conducted, and none of the candidate vaccines has proven to be sufficiently effective to warrant commercialization. Efforts to develop KSHV vaccines have been more limited.",

        "title": "Reducing HPV-Associated Cancer Globally",
        "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers are a major worldwide public health concern. Virtually all cervical cancer is HPV related, with 70% caused by HPV16 and -18. Variable proportions of certain noncervical cancers (e.g., anal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal) are HPV related; more than 90% of the HPV-related ones are caused by HPV16, -18. The HPV-related cancers are dominated by cervical cancer in the developing world, where cervical cancer screening is limited. In this setting, widespread uptake of current HPV vaccines by adolescent girls could reduce this cancer's incidence and mortality by approximately two-thirds, with cost-effective screening programs of adult women having the potential to reduce mortality more rapidly. In the industrialized world, some noncervical HPV-related cancers, especially oropharyngeal, are rapidly increasing, and now rival the incidence of cervical cancer, whose rates continue to decline thanks to established cervical screening programs. Therefore, reducing HPV-associated noncervical cancers with HPV vaccination has greater importance in the industrialized world, especially because there are no approved screening programs for these cancers. Preventing the substantial number of noncervical HPV cancers in men will require either \u201cherd\u201d immunity through high-vaccination rates in females or male vaccination. Current HPV vaccination can complement cervical screening in protecting against cervical cancer and may permit the safe reduction of screening intensity in industrialized countries. Second-generation HPV vaccines (active against a broader array of cervical cancer\u2013related HPV types) could prevent an even higher proportion of cervical precancer and cancer and might permit further reductions in screening intensity.

        "abstract": "Background The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide updates on cancer incidence and death rates and trends in these outcomes for the United States. This year\u2019s report includes incidence trends for human papillomavirus (HPV)\u2013associated cancers and HPV vaccination (recommended for adolescents aged 11\u201312 years). Methods Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR, and data on mortality were obtained from the CDC. Long- (1975/1992\u20132009) and short-term (2000\u20132009) trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and among women were examined by joinpoint analysis. Prevalence of HPV vaccination coverage during 2008 and 2010 and of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing during 2010 were obtained from national surveys. Results Death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined for men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups and for most major cancer sites; rates for both sexes combined decreased by 1.5% per year from 2000 to 2009. Overall incidence rates decreased in men but stabilized in women. Incidence rates increased for two HPV-associated cancers (oropharynx, anus) and some cancers not associated with HPV (eg, liver, kidney, thyroid). Nationally, 32.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30.3% to 33.6%) of girls aged 13 to 17 years in 2010 had received three doses of the HPV vaccine, and coverage was statistically significantly lower among the uninsured (14.1%, 95% CI = 9.4% to 20.6%) and in some Southern states (eg, 20.0% in Alabama [95% CI = 13.9% to 27.9%] and Mississippi [95% CI = 13.8% to 28.2%]), where cervical cancer rates were highest and recent Pap testing prevalence was the lowest. Conclusions The overall trends in declining cancer death rates continue. However, increases in incidence rates for some HPV-associated cancers and low vaccination coverage among adolescents underscore the need for additional prevention efforts for HPV-associated cancers, including efforts to increase vaccination coverage.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancers has risen rapidly in recent decades among men in the United States. We investigated the US population-level effect of prophylactic HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV infection, the principal cause of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of men and women 18 to 33 years of age (N = 2,627) within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 to 2014, a representative sample of the US population. Oral HPV infection with vaccine types 16, 18, 6, or 11 was compared by HPV vaccination status, as measured by self-reported receipt of at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. Analyses accounted for the complex sampling design and were adjusted for age, sex, and race. Statistical significance was assessed using a quasi-score test. Results Between 2011 and 2014, 18.3% of the US population 18 to 33 years of age reported receipt of at least one dose of the HPV vaccine before the age of 26 years (29.2% in women and 6.9% in men; P < .001). The prevalence of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals (0.11% v 1.61%; Padj = .008), corresponding to an estimated 88.2% (95% CI, 5.7% to 98.5%) reduction in prevalence after model adjustment for age, sex, and race. Notably, the prevalence of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated versus unvaccinated men (0.0% v 2.13%; Padj = .007). Accounting for vaccine uptake, the population-level effect of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was 17.0% overall, 25.0% in women, and 6.9% in men. Conclusion HPV vaccination was associated with reduction in vaccine-type oral HPV prevalence among young US adults. However, because of low vaccine uptake, the population-level effect was modest overall and particularly low in men.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-E6 antibodies are detectable in peripheral blood before diagnosis in the majority of HPV16-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), but the timing of seroconversion is unknown. Patients and methods We formed the HPV Cancer Cohort Consortium which comprises nine population cohorts from Europe, North America and Australia. In total, 743 incident OPSCC cases and 5814 controls provided at least one pre-diagnostic blood sample, including 111 cases with multiple samples. Median time between first blood collection and OPSCC diagnosis was 11.4\u2009years (IQR\u2009=\u20096\u201311\u2009years, range\u2009=\u20090\u201340\u2009years). Antibodies against HPV16-E6 were measured by multiplex serology (GST fusion protein based Luminex assay). Results HPV16-E6 seropositivity was present in 0.4% of controls (22/5814; 95% CI 0.2% to 0.6%) and 26.2% (195/743; 95% CI 23.1% to 29.6%) of OPSCC cases. HPV16-E6 seropositivity increased the odds of OPSCC 98.2-fold (95% CI 62.1\u2013155.4) in whites and 17.2-fold (95% CI 1.7\u2013170.5) in blacks. Seropositivity in cases was more frequent in recent calendar periods, ranging from 21.9% pre-1996 to 68.4% in 2005 onwards, in those with blood collection near diagnosis (lead time <5\u2009years). HPV16-E6 seropositivity increased with lead time: 0.0%, 13.5%, 23.7%, and 38.9% with lead times of >30\u2009years (N\u2009=\u200924), 20\u201330\u2009years (N\u2009=\u2009148), 10\u201320\u2009years (N\u2009=\u2009228), and <10\u2009years (N\u2009=\u2009301 cases) (p-trend\u2009<\u20090.001). Of the 47 HPV16-E6 seropositive cases with serially-collected blood samples, 17 cases seroconverted during follow-up, with timing ranging from 6 to 28\u2009years before diagnosis. For the remaining 30 cases, robust seropositivity was observed up to 25\u2009years before diagnosis. Conclusions The immune response to HPV16-driven tumorigenesis is most often detectable several decades before OPSCC diagnosis. HPV16-E6 seropositive individuals face increased risk of OPSCC over several decades.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Serum antibodies against human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) proteins are associated with HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC). The HPV status of OPC cases is clinically relevant because patients with HPV-OPC show improved survival and treatment response compared to tobacco- or alcohol-induced OPC. In clinical settings, molecular HPV tumor status is usually determined by tissue-based methods detecting molecular markers, such as viral nucleic acids or p16 overexpression. Antibodies against HPV16 in peripheral blood were shown to be very accurate in determining the molecular HPV tumor status in multiple studies. In this work, we reviewed and summarized the available literature on the performance of HPV16 serology for E2, E6 and E7 antibodies to determine molecular HPV tumor status in OPC cases in comparison with tissue-based reference methods. We calculated summary estimates across different studies for sensitivity and specificity, and we investigated factors influencing test performance. Abstract Antibodies against HPV16 early proteins have been shown to be promising biomarkers for the identification of HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) among OPC cases in multiple studies. A systematic literature search was performed to identify original research articles comparing HPV early antigen serology with established reference methods to determine molecular HPV tumor status. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 serology for HPV-OPC. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity across studies and describe variables associated with test performance. We identified n = 23 studies meeting all eligibility criteria and included these in the meta-analysis. E6 serology showed the best performance with pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates of 83.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72.5\u201390.2%) and 94.6% (95% CI 89.0\u201397.4%), respectively, while E2 and E7 serological assays were highly specific (E2: 92.5% (95% CI 79.1\u201397.6%); E7: 88.5% (95% CI 77.9\u201394.4%)) but moderately sensitive (E2: 67.8% (95% CI 58.9\u201375.6%); E7: 67.0% (95% CI 63.2\u201370.6%)). Subgroup analyses revealed increased pooled sensitivity for bacterially (89.9% (95% CI 84.5\u201393.6%)) vs. in vitro expressed E6 antigen (55.3% (95% CI 41.0\u201368.7%)), while both showed high specificity (95.2% (95% CI 93.0\u201396.7%) and 91.1% (95% CI 46.6\u201399.2%), respectively). Pooled specificity estimates for HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 serology were significantly lower in studies utilizing HPV DNA PCR as the only molecular reference method compared to those using a combination of any two reference methods (HPV DNA, RNA, in situ hybridization (ISH), p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC)), or histopathological reference methods (ISH or p16 IHC) as stand-alone marker. In conclusion, HPV16 E6 seropositivity is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for HPV-OPC. However, its performance differs between serological assays and depends on molecular reference methods.",

Those who survive their cancer often suffer life-long treatment effects and early death. HPV vaccination could prevent virtually all HPV-related cancers but is not an effective preventive strategy for those already exposed. Without a dramatic increase in vaccine uptake in the U.S., HPV vaccination will have a negligible effect on OPC incidence through 2045 and no substantial impact until 2060. Additionally, targeted screening for earlier diagnosis may soon be feasible for those inadequately protected by vaccination. Areas covered PubMed search for English-language articles related to incidence, screening, and prevention of HPV-related malignancies, focused on OPC in the U.S. Expert opinion HPV-related OPC incidence will continue to increase for the foreseeable future with prophylactic vaccination offering no substantial public health impact for decades. Consequently, we must rapidly increase vaccination rates and develop screening methods to identify high-risk individuals. Such individuals would be eligible for potential preventive treatments and screening to diagnose early-stage HPV-related OPC allowing less morbid treatments. These methods will bridge the population into an era of decreasing incidence after vaccination takes effect.",
