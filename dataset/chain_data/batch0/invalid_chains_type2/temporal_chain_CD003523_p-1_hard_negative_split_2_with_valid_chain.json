        "title": "The treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee with pulsed electrical stimulation.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe safety and effectiveness of pulsed electrical stimulation was evaluated for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial that enrolled 78 patients with OA of the knee incorporated 3 primary efficacy variables of patients' pain, patients' function, and physician global evaluation of patients' condition, and 6 secondary variables that included duration of morning stiffness, range of motion, knee tenderness, joint swelling, joint circumference, and walking time. Measurements were recorded at baseline and during the 4 week treatment period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients treated with the active devices showed significantly greater improvement than the placebo group for all primary efficacy variables in comparisons of mean change from baseline to the end of treatment (p < 0.05). Improvement of > or = 50% from baseline was demonstrated in at least one primary efficacy variable in 50% of the active device group, in 2 variables in 32%, and in all 3 variables in 24%. In the placebo group improvement of > or = 50% occurred in 36% for one, 6% for 2, and 6% for 3 variables. Mean morning stiffness decreased 20 min in the active device group and increased 2 min in the placebo group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed for tenderness, swelling, or walking time.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe improvements in clinical measures for pain and function found in this study suggest that pulsed electrical stimulation is effective for treating OA of the knee. Studies for longterm effects are warranted.",

        "title": "Systemic morphine in combination with TENS produces an increased antihyperalgesia in rats with acute inflammation.",
        "abstract": "Given that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) achieves its anti-hyperalgesia through endogenous opioid receptors, this study was undertaken to assess if TENS in combination with morphine was more effective at reducing primary hyperalgesia. Acute inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of 3% carrageenan into the rat's hindpaw. The withdrawal latency to heat and the mechanical withdrawal threshold were assessed before and after inflammation and after treatment with TENS (high- or low-frequency). Animals were divided into the following groups: Group 1, saline, no TENS; Group 2, high- or low-frequency TENS plus saline; Group 3, morphine (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), no TENS; and Group 4, high- or low-frequency TENS plus morphine (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, i.p.). There was an increase in inhibition of primary heat but not mechanical hyperalgesia after treatment with either high- or low-frequency TENS in combination with morphine. In combination with morphine, low-frequency TENS produced a similar reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia when compared with morphine alone. High-frequency TENS in combination with morphine produced a similar reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia when compared with the effects of high-frequency TENS alone. Thus, a lower dose of morphine could be used in combination with TENS to decrease the side effects of systemic morphine and achieve the same degree of analgesia.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the combination of TENS with morphine to produce an increased antihyperalgesia in rats. While the paper builds upon the concept of electrical stimulation, it does not directly build upon the findings of the source paper, which focused on the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee with pulsed electrical stimulation. However, it is partially dependent on the previous findings regarding the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in pain management, thus using the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis."

        "title": "Blockade of opioid receptors in rostral ventral medulla prevents antihyperalgesia produced by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).",
        "abstract": "Although transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used extensively in inflammatory joint conditions such as arthritis, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aims to demonstrate an opiate-mediated activation of descending inhibitory pathways from the rostral ventral medulla (RVM) in the antihyperalgesia produced by low- (4 Hz) or high-frequency (100 Hz) TENS. Paw withdrawal latency to radiant heat, as an index of secondary hyperalgesia, was recorded before and after knee joint inflammation (induced by intra-articular injection of 3% kaolin and carrageenan) and after TENS/no TENS coadministered with naloxone (20 microg/1 microl), naltrindole (5 microg/1 microl), or vehicle (1 microl) microinjected into the RVM. The selectivity of naloxone and naltrindole doses was tested against the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) (20 ng, 1 microl) and the delta2-opioid receptor agonist deltorphin (5 microg, 1 microl) in the RVM. Naloxone microinjection into the RVM blocks the antihyperalgesia produced by low frequency (p < 0.001), but not that produced by high-frequency TENS (p > 0.05). In contrast, naltrindole injection into the RVM blocks the antihyperalgesia produced by high-frequency (p < 0.05), but not low-frequency (p > 0.05) TENS. The analgesia produced by DAMGO and deltorphin is selectively blocked by naloxone (p < 0.05) and naltrindole (p < 0.05), respectively. Thus, the dose of naloxone and naltrindole used in the current study blocks mu- and delta-opioid receptors, respectively. Hence, low-frequency and high-frequency TENS produces antihyperalgesia by activation of mu- and delta-opioid receptors, respectively, in the RVM.",

        "title": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation: basic science mechanisms and clinical effectiveness.",
        "abstract": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used clinically by a variety of health care professionals for the reduction of pain. Clinical effectiveness of TENS is controversial, with some studies supporting whereas others refute its clinical use. Although used by health professionals for decades, the mechanisms by which TENS produces analgesia or reduces pain are only recently being elucidated. This article describes the basic science mechanisms behind different frequencies of TENS stimulation. Specifically, we describe the literature that supports the use of different frequencies and intensities of TENS. We further describe theories that support the use of TENS such as the gate control theory and the release of endogenous opioids. The literature that supports or refutes each of these theories is described. We also review the clinical literature on TENS effectiveness and elucidate the problems with clinical research studies to date. In conclusion, TENS is a noninvasive modality that is easy to apply with relatively few contraindications. However, the clinical efficacy of TENS will remain equivocal until the publication of sufficient numbers of high quality, randomized, controlled clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a technique widely used in clinical practice to control pain, although its clinical efficacy remains controversial. Though many mechanisms have been proposed for its analgesic effects, there is a conspicuous lack of experimentally controlled research investigating whether TENS analgesia is related to its effects on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing an established psychophysiological paradigm, the present study investigated the effects of high-frequency/low-intensity TENS, low-frequency/high-intensity TENS, and sham TENS on the perception of experimental pain and SNS function in healthy volunteers. Measures of heart rate, digital pulse volume, and skin conductance were recorded during a 20-minute TENS stimulation period and in anticipation of a series of painful electric shocks prior to and following TENS stimulation. Healthy volunteers rated the intensity of the shocks using a 0-10-point verbal pain rating scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe three TENS conditions failed to differentially effect SNS responses during either the 20-minute TENS treatment period or the shock anticipation periods, and TENS did not affect ratings of pain intensity to the shock stimuli.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhile these results may not generalize to acute or chronic pain patients, within the limitations of the present experimental paradigm, no support was found for TENS affecting either SNS function or acute experimental pain perception.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on blood flow and skin temperature following an elevation of baseline blood flow using infrared preheating. A randomized controlled approach was used whereby 66 healthy human subjects (33 male, 33 female) were allocated to one of three intervention groups (n\u2003=\u200322 per group, equal male and female): Control, Low frequency TENS (4\u2003Hz/200\u2003\u03bcs), or High frequency TENS (110\u2003Hz/200\u2003\u03bcs). TENS was applied just below motor threshold over the median nerve of the right forearm for 15\u2003min immediately following an infrared preheating. Cutaneous blood flow and skin temperature were recorded at 3\u2010min intervals from the forearm and fingertips during TENS and for 15\u2003min following TENS. Analysis of data revealed no significant differences between High and Low frequency TENS for cutaneous blood flow or skin temperature at the forearm. A small and short lived increase in cutaneous blood flow at the index finger was observed on TENS groups compared with control when TENS was switched off. TENS reduced skin temperature when compared to control during the first 9\u2003min of the 15\u2010min stimulation period at the middle finger but not at the index finger. It was concluded that the effects of high and low frequency TENS when applied below motor threshold produced changes in blood flow and skin temperature that were transient and small.",

        "title": "Microcurrent transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in painful diabetic neuropathy: a randomized placebo-controlled study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nDiabetes is a common health care problem in western countries. Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) might be one of the consequences of long ongoing diabetes; it is estimated that approximately 20% of European diabetic patients suffer from PDN. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is often used as additional pain treatment. However, recent studies show inconsistent results. We aimed to assess the effect of micro-TENS in reducing neuropathic pain in patients with PDN in a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, and randomized design. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS/OUTCOME MEASURES: 22 diabetic patients have been treated with a micro-TENS therapy and 19 patients have been treated with a placebo therapy. Treatment duration was 4 weeks with three therapeutical settings per week. Standardized questionnaires (Pain Disability Index [PDI], neuropathic pain score [NPS], Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]) were used to assess pain intensity, pain disability, as well as quality of life at baseline at the end of the treatment period and 4 weeks after treatment termination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients with a minimum of 30% reduction in NPS were defined as therapy responders. After 4 weeks of treatment, 6/21 patients in the verum group vs 10/19 patients in the placebo group responded to therapy. The median PDI score after 4 weeks of treatment showed a reduction of 23% in the verum vs 25% in the placebo group. The differences did not reach statistical significance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe pain reduction with the applied transcutaneous electrotherapy regimen is not superior to a placebo treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPainful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological therapies are ineffective in many patients. Therefore, other treatment modalities should be considered, including electrical stimulation and electromagnetic fields.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe research objective was to evaluate the effect of treatment with electrical stimulation and electromagnetic fields on pain and sensitivity in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy compared with placebo or another intervention.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe searched the following electronic databases (from inception to April 2012): MEDLINE (accessed by PubMed), LILACS, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL. We included randomized trials that compared electrical stimulation or electromagnetic fields with control groups in which the objective was to assess pain and sensitivity in patients with PDN. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. A random-effects model was used for the main analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe search retrieved 1336 articles, of which 12 studies were included. Reductions in the mean pain score were significantly greater in the TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) group than in the placebo group [-0.44 (95% CI: -0.79 to -0.09; I2: 0%)]. There was no improvement in pain relief when electromagnetic fields were compared with the control group [-0.69 (95% CI: -1.86 to 0.48; I2: 63%)].\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found that TENS improved pain relief in patients with diabetic neuropathy, while no such improvement was observed with the use of electromagnetic field treatment.

        "abstract": "Background: The peripheral neuropathy is one of the common complications of type II diabetes mellitus along with other complications and affects both somatic and autonomic nervous system. The pharmacological treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is mainly directed for symptom control with varying extent of the effectiveness. TENS is a less expensive, non-invasive procedure useful in neuropathic pain; however, the literature evidence for its effectiveness is inconclusive and contradictory. This article aimed for a critical analysis of the available evidence on the application of TENS for the clinical treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients. Methodology: An electronic search was carried out for the relevant literature published during the period of 2009 to 2014 in the databases. The selected evidence evaluated for quality and level of evidence using SIGN critiquing tool and Harbour and Miller 2001 hierarchy of evidence respectively. Results: Identified five relevant pieces of evidence for critical analysis. Three of them were systematic reviews, one randomized controlled trial and one observational study. Conclusion: The majority of the evidence recommends the use of TENS therapy for the management of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, it is limited with short duration of trial period and lack of standardization of TENS therapy for the condition.",
