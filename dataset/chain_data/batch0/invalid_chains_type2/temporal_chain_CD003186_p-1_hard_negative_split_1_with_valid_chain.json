        "abstract": "Objective To define the cardiovascular effects of lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease. Design Collaborative prospective meta-analysis of randomised trials. Data sources and eligibility Participating randomised trials of drugs to lower blood pressure compared with placebo or each other or that compare different blood pressure targets, with at least 1000 patient years of follow-up per arm. Main outcome measures Major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) in composite and individually and all cause death. Participants 26 trials (152\u2009290 participants), including 30\u2009295 individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Data extraction Individual participant data were available for 23 trials, with summary data from another three. Meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated with a random effects model. Results Compared with placebo, blood pressure lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced eGFR (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P=1.00 for homogeneity). The results were similar irrespective of whether blood pressure was reduced by regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics/\u03b2 blockers. There was no evidence that the effects of different drug classes on major cardiovascular events varied between patients with different eGFR (all P>0.60 for homogeneity). Conclusions Blood pressure lowering is an effective strategy for preventing cardiovascular events among people with moderately reduced eGFR. There is little evidence from these overviews to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease.",

        "title": "Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial",
        "abstract": "Background Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin\u2013angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. Methods The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke. Results The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.",

Design Population based cohort study using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting UK primary care, 1997-2014. Participants Patients starting treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (n=122\u2009363). Main outcome measures Poisson regression was used to compare rates of end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death among patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more after starting treatment against those without such increases, and for each 10% increase in creatinine. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of other antihypertensive drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Results Among the 2078 (1.7%) patients with creatinine increases of 30% or more, a higher proportion were female, were elderly, had cardiorenal comorbidity, and used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop diuretics, or potassium sparing diuretics. Creatinine increases of 30% or more were associated with an increased adjusted incidence rate ratio for all outcomes, compared with increases of less than 30%: 3.43 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 4.91) for end stage renal disease, 1.46 (1.16 to 1.84) for myocardial infarction, 1.37 (1.14 to 1.65) for heart failure, and 1.84 (1.65 to 2.05) for death. The detailed categorisation of increases in creatinine concentrations (<10%, 10-19%, 20-29%, 30-39%, and \u226540%) showed a graduated relation for all outcomes (all P values for trends <0.001). Notably, creatinine increases of less than 30% were also associated with increased incidence rate ratios for all outcomes, including death (1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) for increases of 10-19% and 1.35 (1.23 to 1.49) for increases of 20-29%, using <10% as reference). Results were consistent across calendar periods, across subgroups of patients, and among continuing users. Conclusions Increases in creatinine after the start of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment were associated with adverse cardiorenal outcomes in a graduated relation, even below the guideline recommended threshold of a 30% increase for stopping treatment.",

        "title": "Acute Increases in Serum Creatinine After Starting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor-Based Therapy and Effects of its Continuation on Major Clinical Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The ADVANCE Trial",
        "abstract": "Discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is recommended if patients experience \u226530% acute increase in serum creatinine after starting this therapy. However, the long-term effects of its continuation or discontinuation on major clinical outcomes after increases in serum creatinine are unclear. In the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation), 11\u2009140 diabetes mellitus patients were randomly assigned to perindopril-indapamide or placebo after a 6-week active run-in period. The current study included 11\u2009066 participants with 2 serum creatinine measurements recorded before and during the active run-in period (3 weeks apart). Acute increase in creatinine was determined using these 2 measurements and classified into 4 groups: increases in serum creatinine of <10%, 10% to 19%, 20% to 29%, and \u226530%. The primary study outcome was the composite of major macrovascular events, new or worsening nephropathy, and all-cause mortality. An acute increase in serum creatinine was associated with an elevated risk of the primary outcome (P for trend <0.001). The hazard ratios were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97\u20131.28) for those with an increase of 10% to 19%, 1.34 (1.07\u20131.66) for 20% to 29%, and 1.44 (1.15\u20131.81) for \u226530%, compared with <10%. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the benefit of randomized treatment effects on the outcome across subgroups defined by acute serum creatinine increase (P for heterogeneity=0.94). Acute increases in serum creatinine after starting perindopril-indapamide were associated with greater risks of subsequent major clinical outcomes. However, the continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy reduced the long-term risk of major clinical outcomes, irrespective of acute increase in creatinine.

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common outcome evaluated in clinical studies, often as a safety end point in a variety of cardiovascular, kidney disease, and other clinical trials. AKI end points that include modest increases in serum creatinine levels from baseline may not associate with patient-centered outcomes such as initiation of dialysis, sustained decline in kidney function, or death. Surprisingly, data from several randomized controlled trials have suggested that in certain settings, the development of AKI may be associated with favorable outcomes. AKI safety end points that are nonspecific and may not associate with patient-centered outcomes could result in beneficial therapies being inappropriately withheld or never developed for commercial use. We review several issues related to commonly used AKI definitions and suggest that future work in AKI use more patient-centered AKI end points such as major adverse kidney events at 30 days or other later time points.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) has a high mortality rate, but its pathogenesis remains unclear Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated renal tubular epithelial pyroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of AKI. NLR family of pyrin domains containing 3 (NLRP3) plays an important role in pyroptosis. To further understand the transcriptional regulation mechanism of NLRP3, the peripheral blood of patients with AKI was analyzed in this study, showing that the levels of NLRP3 and cell pyroptosis in patients with AKI were significantly higher than those in normal controls. Furthermore, elevated levels of NLRP3 and cell pyroptosis were found in renal tubular epithelial cells after LPS treatment. Transcription factor ETS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ETS1) could bind to the upstream promoter transcription site of NLRP3 to transactivate NLRP3 in renal tubular epithelial cells. The cell pyroptosis level also decreased by knocking down ETS1. It is concluded that knocking down of ETS1 may reduce the renal tubular epithelial pyroptosis by regulating the transcription of NLRP3, thus relieving AKI. ETS1 is expected to be a molecular target for the treatment of AKI. Graphical abstract",

        "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays an important role in spinal cord injury (SCI), and pyroptosis is inflammatory-related programmed cell death. Although neuroinflammation induced by pyroptosis has been reported in SCI, there is a lack of systematic research on SCI pyroptosis and its regulation mechanism. The purpose of this study was to systematically analyze the expression of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in different SCI models and associated regulation axis by bioinformatics methods. We downloaded raw counts data of seven high-throughput sequencings and two microarray datasets from the GEO database, classified by species (rat and mouse) and SCI modes (moderate contusive model, aneurysm clip impact-compression model, and hemisection model), including mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, basically covering the acute, subacute and chronic stages of SCI. We performed differential analysis by R (DEseq2) or GEO2R and found that the AIM2/NLRC4/NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes, GSDMD, IL1B, and IL18, were highly expressed in SCI. Based on the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis-related genes (NLRP3/PRGs), we constructed transcription factors (TFs)\u2013NLRP3/PRGs, miRNAs- Nlrp3/PRGs and lncRNAs/circRNAs/mRNAs\u2013miRNA- Nlrp3/PRGs (ceRNA) networks. In addition, we also predicted Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and small, drug-like molecules with NLRP3/PRGs as potential targets. Finally, 39 up-regulated TFs were identified, which may regulate at least two of NLRP3/PRGs. A total of 7 down-regulated miRNAs were identified which could regulate Nlrp3/PRGs. ceRNA networks were constructed including 23 lncRNAs, 3 cicrRNAs, 6 mRNAs, and 44 miRNAs. A total of 24 herbs were identified which may with two NLRP3/PRGs as potential targets. It is expected to provide new ideas and therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCI.",
