        "abstract": "In a randomized, double blind, multicentre study with 4 weeks follow-up of 290 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee joint, a topical NSAID (eltenac) was compared with oral diclofenac and placebo. The main outcome, Lequesne's Index and pain by VAS showed no statistically significant differences between neither of the active treatments and placebo for the total study population. However, in patients with more severe symptoms, both active groups showed statistically significant differences to placebo. No severe adverse drug reactions were seen but the number of GI reactions were three times higher in the diclofenac group compared to the topical treatment. Local skin reactions were twice as frequent in the eltenac than in the placebo group. Taking into account the nature of the treatment for a chronic disease like OA, our results indicate that eltenac gel could be a safe alternative to oral NSAIDs.",

        "title": "Oral versus topical NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases: a comparison.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and are responsible for approximately one-quarter of all adverse drug reaction reports. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for patients with rheumatic disease--a population at increased risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Topical administration of NSAIDs offers the advantage of local, enhanced drug delivery to affected tissues with a reduced incidence of systemic adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease and GI haemorrhage. NSAIDs administered topically penetrate slowly and in small quantities into the systemic circulation; bioavailability and maximal plasma NSAID concentration after topical application are generally less than 5 and 15%, respectively, compared with equivalent oral administration. Product formulation may have a dramatic impact, not only on absorption rates but also on penetration depth. Compared with oral administration, topical application leads to relatively high NSAID concentrations in the dermis. Concentrations achieved in the muscle tissue below the site of application are variable, but are at least equivalent to that obtained with oral administration. NSAIDs applied topically do reach the synovial fluid, but the extent and mechanism (topical penetration versus distribution via the systemic circulation) remain to be determined. In addition, marked interindividual variability was noted in all studies; percutaneous absorption may be strongly influenced by individual skin properties. In general, interpretation of clinical studies measuring efficacy of topical NSAIDs in rheumatic disease states is difficult because of a remarkably high placebo response rate, use of rescue paracetamol (acetaminophen), and significant variability in percutaneous absorption and response rates between patients. Overall efficacy rates attributable to topical NSAIDs in patients with rheumatic disorders ranged from 18 to 92% of treated patients. Topically applied NSAIDs have a superior safety profile to oral formulations. Adverse effects secondary to topical NSAID application occur in approximately 10 to 15% of patients and are primarily cutaneous in nature (rash and pruritus at site of application). GI adverse drug reactions are rare with topically applied NSAIDs, compared with a 15% incidence reported for oral NSAIDs. Available clinical studies suggest, but do not document, equivalent efficacy of topical over oral NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases.",

        "explanation": "This paper compares oral and topical NSAIDs in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, which is related to the source paper's topic of topical NSAID gel (eltenac) in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. The key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper, as it explores the advantages and disadvantages of topical NSAIDs, which were investigated in the source paper."

        "abstract": "There is much lore about training room treatments for common overuse and traumatic musculoskeletal injuries. This review looks at the evidence behind many of the common transdermal treatments that are purported to reduce pain and inflammation and improve function. These include cryotherapy, laser treatments, electrical stimulation, ultrasound and phonophoresis, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and iontophoresis. In addition, there are numerous over the counter sports creams and prescribed topical treatments that are routinely used. With the pressure to treat athletes safely and efficiently, sports practitioners must rely on well-proven evidence to build the most effective treatment plans.",

        "abstract": "Objective. This descriptive study was undertaken to report the medications used by the athletes and officials of Team South Africa at the 2004 Olympic Games and to provide a model for the estimation of quantities to be used for planning support to future events.\nSetting. South African medical facility, 2004 Olympic Games, Athens, Greece.\nMethods. The names of the medications, including the dosage and quantity of medications dispensed, were recorded in the pharmacy stock control book at the South African medical facility, 2004 Olympic Games, Athens, Greece. Retrospective review of patient files and medical encounter forms was also undertaken to check against the pharmacy stock control book to ensure complete data capture of dispensed medications.\nMain outcome measures. Quantities of medications consumed during the observation period. The units of medication consumed per travelling team member were calculated by dividing the number of units (tablets, capsules, tubes, inhalers, bottles and ampoules)\nused during the trip by the total number of travelling team members.\nResults. Complete records of medications included in the travelling pharmacy are described. Quantities of medications included ranged from single units to 2 250 units and percentage use of various medications varied from 0% to 100% of stocks. Units per team member ranged from 0 to 9.43. Medications were consumed from all categories of agents. The most utilised agents included the analgesics, musculoskeletal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\nagents as well as certain vitamin and mineral supplements.\nConclusions. This study describes the consumption of pharmacological agents by the athletes and officials of Team South Africa during the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. It also provides a model to assist with the estimation of quantities of medications to be\nincluded in the travelling pharmacy for future international multicoded sports events.
