        "title": "Effects of doxazosin in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation versus doxazosin standard and placebo in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin Investigators' Study Group.",
        "abstract": "The alpha 1-blocker doxazosin is a well-established therapy for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, in its standard form, a multiple-step titration regimen is usually required. The new gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin greatly minimizes the need for titration by changing drug-delivery rate and the pharmaco-kinetic profile. To demonstrate this in hypertensive patients, we assessed the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily versus doxazosin standard 1-8 mg once daily, and placebo, in an integrated analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trials. Each trial included a 2-week washout period and 12 weeks of therapy. One study compared doxazosin GITS, doxazosin standard, and placebo in 392 patients with mild hypertension [blood pressure (BP) 95-105/ < or = 180 mm Hg]; the other study compared doxazosin GITS with doxazosin standard in 315 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (BP 95-115/ < or = 220 mm Hg). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of responders (sitting diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg or 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline 24 h after the dose) at the final visit for the per-protocol population. Mean baseline BP and heart rate were well matched in each group. Approximately 64% of patients with doxazosin GITS (198 of 309 patients) and 68% with doxazosin standard (207 of 304 patients) achieved goal BP response at the final visit versus 36% with placebo (25 of 70 patients; p < 0.05). The majority with doxazosin GITS (60%) remained at the initial 4-mg starting dose. Doxazosin GITS was as effective as doxazosin standard, and both were more effective than placebo in controlling BP in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated, and fewer patients with the GITS formulation discontinued therapy because of side effects compared with doxazosin standard or placebo. Syncope was not reported with doxazosin GITS. Whereas the efficacy of doxazosin GITS at 4 or 8 mg is equivalent to that of the standard regimen in this combined analysis, the GITS formulation appears to eliminate the need for titration in most patients.",

        "title": "Double\u2013Blind Trial of the Efficacy and Tolerability of Doxazosin in the Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System, Doxazosin Standard, and Placebo in Patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia",
        "abstract": "Background: The \u03b11\u2013blocker doxazosin mesylate is an established efficacious and welltolerated treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (PBH). However, its clinical utility can be limited by the need for multiple titration steps, starting at an initial dose of 1 mg, increased up to 8 mg once daily, to achieve optimal therapeutic response. A new controlled\u2013release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin mesylate enhances the pharmacokinetic profile and drug delivery rate, reducing the plasma doxazosin mesylate peak\u2013to\u2013trough ratio and minimizing the need for titration.Objective: A study was conducted to assess the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily, doxazosin standard 1 mg to 8 mg once daily, and placebo, in 795 men with BPH. This randomized, double\u2013blind, multicenter Scandinavian study included a 2\u2013week washout period, 2\u2013week single\u2013blind placebo run\u2013in phase, and 13\u2013week double\u2013blind treatment phase. Doxazosin GITS was initiated at 4 mg once daily and titrated to 8 mg once daily after 7 weeks, if indicated, and doxazosin standard was initiated at 1 mg once daily, titrated to 2 mg after 1 week, to 4 mg at 3 weeks, and to 8 mg at 7 weeks if indicated, to achieve symptom control. The primary outcome measures were mean changes from baseline to the final visit for International Prostate Symptom Score (I\u2013PSS) and maximum urinary flow rate adjusted for baseline values.Results: Both doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard significantly improved the symptoms of BPH, as evidenced by least\u2013squares mean reductions in total I\u2013PSS of \u20138.0\u00b10.3 and \u20138.4\u00b10.3 from baseline, respectively, compared with a reduction of \u20136.0\u00b10.4 in patients on placebo. Doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard produced clinically comparable improvements in maximum urinary flow rates, with a greater improvement observed earlier following treatment with doxazosin GITS than with doxazosin standard. Both active treatments produced significantly greater increases in maximum urinary flow rate compared with placebo. Nearly half of the patients on doxazosin GITS achieved symptom relief at the 4\u2013mg starting dose. A similar number of patients in both doxazosin groups were titrated to the maximum dose of 8 mg for both formulations. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar among patients treated with doxazosin GITS and placebo, and slightly higher in those on doxazosin standard. There was no apparent difference in the type of adverse events reported for the two formulations of doxazosin, although most adverse events were reported at a lower frequency with doxazosin GITS.Conclusions: Doxazosin GITS is significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the clinical symptoms of BPH and improving maximum urinary flow rate, and as effective as doxazosin standard. A therapeutic effect equivalent to that of doxazosin standard was achieved with doxazosin GITS with fewer titration steps, in a manner that appeared to be better tolerated. Because treatment with doxazosin GITS starts with an effective dose for many patients, it is likely that this clinical profile will result in the need for fewer patient visits than with doxazosin standard therapy.",

        "title": "Interaction between the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, tadalafil and 2 alpha-blockers, doxazosin and tamsulosin in healthy normotensive men.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is effective therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with ED have a high incidence of comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are safe when administered with most medications, sildenafil given with doxazosin and vardenafil given with terazosin evoke orthostatic hypotension in some patients. We examined the hemodynamic interactions of tadalafil with the alpha-blockers doxazosin and tamsulosin.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn separate double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized crossover studies (18 patients in each study) we evaluated the hemodynamic effects of doxazosin 8 mg with tadalafil 20 mg, and tamsulosin 0.4 mg with tadalafil 10 and 20 mg. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were recorded before dosing and for 24 hours after dosing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTadalafil 20 mg augmented the hypotensive effect of doxazosin by producing a mean maximal decrease in standing systolic BP (SBP) that was significantly greater than placebo (a mean difference of 9.8 mm Hg). Analysis of BP outliers showed that the number of subjects with a standing SBP of less than 85 mm Hg was greater after doxazosin plus tadalafil (28%) versus doxazosin plus placebo (6%). In subjects on tamsulosin, tadalafil 10 and 20 mg produced mean maximal decreases in standing SBP that were similar to placebo (mean difference of 1.7 and 2.3 mm Hg, respectively). No subject taking tamsulosin had a decrease in standing SBP less than 85 mm Hg.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTadalafil augmented the hypotensive effects of doxazosin but had little hemodynamic interaction with tamsulosin. In patients taking tadalafil for ED, tamsulosin 0.4 mg may be given for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

        "title": "Alpha\u2010adrenoceptors are a common denominator in the pathophysiology of erectile function and BPH/LUTS \u2013 implications for clinical practice",
        "abstract": "A literature search of PubMed documented publications and abstracts from proceedings of scientific meetings was made to review the available data on benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) with a special focus on the role of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptors as critical mediators of pathophysiology. The reader is introduced to clinical results on the therapeutic potential of \u03b1\u2010blockers alone and in combination with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE\u20105) inhibitors in the treatment of ED associated with LUTS/BPH. Epidemiological studies clearly show that an association exists between ED and LUTS/BPH. The severity of LUTS is correlated with the risk for ED. A significant number of LUTS/BPH patients are nonresponsive to the common ED treatment with PDE\u20105 inhibitors. As smooth muscle contractility is regulated by adrenoceptors in the corpus cavernosum, prostate and detrusor, the \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor system may be considered a common pathophysiological mediator in the development of ED and LUTS/BPH. Blockade of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptors for the treatment of BPH/LUTS may have the potential of improving sexual function. Conversely, PDE\u20105 inhibitors may exhibit positive effects in LUTS patients. Pilot studies on combination regimens of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor antagonists and PDE\u20105 inhibitors have yielded encouraging results in LUTS patients with persistent ED. On the basis of pharmacological and clinical evidence, it is established that the \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of ED and LUTS secondary to BPH. Larger trials on the combination of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor antagonists with PDE\u20105 inhibitors are necessary to develop an integrated treatment approach for BPH/LUTS patients with comorbid ED.",

For the statistical analysis, a Tukey-Kramer multicomparison test was used.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted from September 2007 to February 2008 in one center. Thirty men, older than 50 years old, with a history of LUTS/BPH of at least 6 months, were randomized into two groups to receive tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day vs. tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day plus tadalafil 20 mg/day for 45 days, and then switched to the other treatment mode for other 45 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-seven patients completed the study. Improvements of IPSS score and IPSS-QOL were significant with both treatments but greater with the drug combination. Both regimens similarly improved the Qmax and decreased the PVR volume from baseline (P < 0.001) with no significant differences between tamsulosin alone vs. tamsulosin and tadalafil (P > 0.05). The IIEF improved with tamsulosin plus tadalafil (P < 0.001) but not with tamsulosin alone (P > 0.05). The GAQ showed that all patients preferred the combination scheme.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are the first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). Numerous studies have supposed a significant association between ED and LUTS, but a causal relationship cannot be established.\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim was to evaluate the efficacy of a combined therapy with an AB (alfuzosin) and PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil) in patients with LUTS and ED.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a randomized, open-label, three-arm study. A total of 66 men complaining of ED and LUTS were included in the study. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of study treatment, and then underwent randomized allocation to either alfuzosin 10 mg once a day (22 patients) or tadalafil 20 mg on alternative days (21 patients), or a combination of both (23 patients).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nAll participants completed the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS). Other efficacy variables included maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and medium urinary flow rate (Qave).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIIEF-EF tended to improve with alfuzosin alone (+15%), while it was clearly improved with tadalafil alone (+36.3%). The greatest improvement was experienced with the combination therapy (+37.6%). Improvement in Qmax was observed in all groups, but patients receiving combination therapy had greater improvement (29.6%) than patients receiving either only alfuzosin (21.7%) or only tadalafil (9.5%).

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is prevalent in old men and often results in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, etc.) are first-line treatments for erectile dysfunction. Recently, PDE5 inhibitors have been found to regulate smooth muscle tone in human prostate. This article focuses on the use of PDE5 inhibitors for BPH/LUTS treatment and highlights the clinical significance. Recent findings Preclinical and clinical studies have provided promising evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may be an effective and well tolerated treatment option for BPH/LUTS. Combination therapy using PDE5 inhibitors and \u03b11-adrenergic blockers resulted in greater improvements in BPH/LUTS than did either drug alone. Summary There has been increasing interest in the use of PDE5 inhibitors to treat BPH/LUTS. Combination of PDE5 inhibitors and \u03b11-adrenergic blockers may have an additive beneficial effect on BPH/LUTS compared with monotherapy. Mechanisms of action of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate/PDE5 pathway in the treatment of BPH/LUTS deserve further investigations. Larger-scale, well designed clinical trials in future are needed to ascertain the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in elder men and a number of drugs alone or combined are clinically used for this disorder. But available studies investigating the comparative effects of different drug therapies are limited. This study was aimed to compare the efficacy of different drug therapies for LUTS/BPH with network meta-analysis. Materials and Methods An electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different drug therapies for LUTS/BPH within 24 weeks. Comparative effects were calculated using Aggregate Data Drug Information System. Consistency models of network meta-analysis were created and cumulative probability was used to rank different therapies. Results A total 66 RCTs covering seven different therapies with 29384 participants were included. We found that \u03b1-blockers (ABs) plus phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) ranked highest in the test of IPSS total score, storage subscore and voiding subscore. The combination therapy of ABs plus 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors was the best for increasing maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) with a mean difference (MD) of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.86) as compared to placebo. ABs plus muscarinic receptor antagonists (MRAs) ranked secondly on the reduction of IPSS storage subscore, although monotherapies including MRAs showed no effect on this aspect. Additionally, PDE5-Is alone showed great effectiveness for LUTS/BPH except Qmax. Conclusions Based on our novel findings, combination therapy, especially ABs plus PDE5-Is, is recommended for short-term treatment for LUTS/BPH. There was also evidence that PDE5-Is used alone was efficacious except on Qmax. Additionally, it should be cautious when using MRAs. However, further clinical studies are required for longer duration which considers more treatment outcomes such as disease progression, as well as basic research investigating mechanisms involving PDE5-Is and other pharmacologic agents alleviate the symptoms of LUTS/BPH.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia have been two very common diseases among the elderly men, especially with the aging of the population in the world. We have designed a study to investigate the clinical effect of interventional therapy for plasmakinetic resection of the prostate and plasmakinetic resection of the bladder, which is called \u201cBPSC\u201d (The bladder cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia study in Chinese population). The BPSC is not only a specific study, it is made up of many studies. In this article, we introduced the research background, source, name, study framework, study management and further direction of BPSC project. We hope this process will contribute to the growth of the database through sharing data and enriching the evidence of bladder cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in the Chinese population, thereby finally improving the accessibility of these important findings for doctors, researchers, and patients.",

        "title": "A potential therapeutic strategy for prostatic disease by targeting the oral microbiome",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, human microbiome research is rapidly growing and emerging evidence has witnessed the critical role that oral microbiome plays in the process of human health and disease. Oral microbial dysbiosis has been confirmed as a contributory cause for diseases in multiple body systems, ranging from the oral cavity to the gastrointestinal, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and even nervous system. As research progressing, oral microbiome\u2010based diagnosis and therapy are proposed and applied, which may represent potential drug targets in systemic diseases. Recent studies have uncovered the possible association between periodontal disease and prostatic disease, suggesting new prevention and therapeutic treatment for the disease by targeting periodontal pathogens. Thus, we performed this review to first explore the association between the oral microbiome and prostatic disease, according to current knowledge based on published articles, and then mainly focus on the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms and the potential prevention and treatment derived from these mechanistic studies.",

        "title": "Periodontitis Exacerbates Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia through Regulation of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation",
        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies demonstrate that men with periodontitis are also susceptible to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and that periodontal treatment can improve the prostatic symptom. However, molecular links of this relationship are largely unknown. The goal of the current study was to elucidate the effects of experimental periodontitis on the hyperplasia of prostate and whether oxidative stress and inflammation participated in this process. For this purpose, ligature-induced periodontitis, testosterone-induced BPH, and the composite models in rats were established. Four weeks later, all the rats were sacrificed and the following items were measured: alveolar bone loss and histological examination of periodontal tissues were taken to assess the establishment of periodontitis model, prostate index and histological examination of prostate tissues were taken to test the establishment of the BPH model, inflammatory cytokines in plasma were assessed, and Bax/Bcl-2 proteins related to cell apoptosis were analyzed via western blot analysis. To further investigate whether oxidative stress participates in the aggravation of BPH, in vitro models were also conducted to measure the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. We found that simultaneous periodontitis and BPH synergistically aggravated prostate histological changes, significantly increased Ki67 proliferation, and reduced apoptosis in rat prostate tissues. Also, our results showed that periodontal ligation induced increased Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas Bax expression was decreased in BPH rats than in normal rats. Compared with the control group, periodontitis and BPH both significantly enhanced inflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and CRP. Furthermore, Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induced enhanced generation of intracellular expression of ROS and H2O2 in BPH-1 cells. Our experimental evidence demonstrated that periodontitis might promote BPH development through regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory process, thus providing new strategies for prevention and treatment of BPH.",

        "title": "Alterations and Correlations of Gut Microbiota and Fecal Metabolome Characteristics in Experimental Periodontitis Rats",
        "abstract": "Objectives Periodontitis affects the progression of many diseases, while its detailed mechanism remains unclear. This study hopes to provide new ideas for exploring its mechanism by analyzing the gut microbiota and fecal metabolic characteristics of experimental periodontitis rats. Methods A total of 10 rats were randomly divided into ligature-induced experimental periodontitis (EP) group and healthy control group. After 4 weeks of the experiment, the feces of all rats were collected for sequencing through 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing technology and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS). Results 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the \u03b2-diversity of gut microbiota was significantly different between the EP and control group, and the levels of dominant genera were different. Compared with the control group, Ruminococcus, Escherichia, and Roseburia were significantly enriched in EP, and Coprococcus, Turicibacter, Lachnospira were significantly decreased. Correlation analysis showed that Roseburia exhibited the highest correlation within the genus. Of 3,488 qualitative metabolites, 164 metabolites were upregulated and 362 metabolites were downregulated in EP. Enrichment analysis showed that periodontitis significantly changed 45 positive/negative ion metabolic pathways. Five KEGG pathways, protein digestion and absorption, tyrosine metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, niacin and nicotinamide metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation, are enriched in both the microbiome and metabolome. Correlation analysis showed that the genera with significant differences in periodontitis were usually significantly correlated with more metabolites, such as Roseburia, Lachnospira, Escherichia, Turicibacter, and Ruminococcus. The genera with the same changing trend tended to have a similar correlation with some certain metabolites. In addition, vitamin D2 and protoporphyrin IX have the most significant correlations with microorganisms. Conclusion Our study reveals that periodontitis alters gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. The correlation analysis of microbiota and metabolome provides a deeper understanding of periodontitis, and also provides a direction for the study of periodontitis affecting other diseases.",

        "title": "Periodontal treatment and microbiome-targeted therapy in management of periodontitis-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with oral and gut dysbiosis",
        "abstract": "A growing body of evidence from multiple areas proposes that periodontal disease, accompanied by oral inflammation and pathological changes in the microbiome, induces gut dysbiosis and is involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A subgroup of NAFLD patients have a severely progressive form, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by histological findings that include inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. NASH has a high risk of further progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The oral microbiota may serve as an endogenous reservoir for gut microbiota, and transport of oral bacteria through the gastro-intestinal tract can set up a gut microbiome dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis increases the production of potential hepatotoxins, including lipopolysaccharide, ethanol, and other volatile organic compounds such as acetone, phenol and cyclopentane. Moreover, gut dysbiosis increases intestinal permeability by disrupting tight junctions in the intestinal wall, leading to enhanced translocation of these hepatotoxins and enteric bacteria into the liver through the portal circulation. In particular, many animal studies support that oral administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a typical periodontopathic bacterium, induces disturbances in glycolipid metabolism and inflammation in the liver with gut dysbiosis. NAFLD, also known as the hepatic phenotype of metabolic syndrome, is strongly associated with metabolic complications, such as obesity and diabetes. Periodontal disease also has a bidirectional relationship with metabolic syndrome, and both diseases may induce oral and gut microbiome dysbiosis with insulin resistance and systemic chronic inflammation cooperatively. In this review, we will describe the link between periodontal disease and NAFLD with a focus on basic, epidemiological, and clinical studies, and discuss potential mechanisms linking the two diseases and possible therapeutic approaches focused on the microbiome. In conclusion, it is presumed that the pathogenesis of NAFLD involves a complex crosstalk between periodontal disease, gut microbiota, and metabolic syndrome. Thus, the conventional periodontal treatment and novel microbiome-targeted therapies that include probiotics, prebiotics and bacteriocins would hold great promise for preventing the onset and progression of NAFLD and subsequent complications in patients with periodontal disease.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the periodontal supporting tissues. In addition to dental loss, it has been associated with various metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed to analyze the effects of periodontal disease on the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in the adult population. Method: An electronic search of systematic reviews published between 2019 and 2024 was conducted in the Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, as well as in the Epistemonikos meta-search engine. The search strategy was \"Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease AND Periodontitis\". A total of 47 articles were identified, of which three systematic reviews with meta-analyses were analyzed. Results: The results indicated a potential association between periodontal disease and NAFLD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.89; I\u00b2 = 92%) and 1.91 (95% CI: 1.21 to 3.02; I\u00b2 = 95%). However, this link has not been definitively proven, as heterogeneity decreases and the number of patients increases, resulting in an OR of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.12; I\u00b2 = 58%). Conclusion: It is suggested that systemic inflammation and pro-inflammatory markers may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of both conditions. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to clarify this relationship and explore the common metabolic parameters.",
