        "abstract": "AIMS\nTo evaluate the effect of influenza vaccination on the coronary events in patients with confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. We included 658 optimally treated CAD patients; 477 men, mean age 59.9+/-10.3 years. Three hundred and twenty-five patients received the influenza vaccine, and 333 patients placebo. Median follow-up was 298 (interquartile range 263-317) days. Primary endpoint was the cardiovascular death. Its estimated 12-month cumulative event rate was 0.63% in the vaccine vs. 0.76% in controls (HR 1.06 95% CI: 0.15-7.56, P = 0.95). There were two secondary composite endpoints: (i) the MACE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization) tended to occur less frequently in the vaccine group vs. placebo with the event rate 3.00 and 5.87%, respectively (HR 0.54;95% CI: 0.24-1.21, P = 0.13). (ii) Coronary ischaemic event (MACE or hospitalization for myocardial ischaemia) estimated 12-month event rate was significantly lower in the vaccine group 6.02 vs. 9.97% in controls (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.29-0.99, P = 0.047).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn optimally treated CAD patients influenza vaccination improves the clinical course of CAD and reduces the frequency of coronary ischaemic events. Large-scale studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular mortality. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 00371098).",

        "abstract": "Vaccination against influenza averts cardiovascular events and is recommended for all patients with coronary heart disease. Because data were unavailable regarding vaccination rates among such patients' household contacts, we sought to estimate the rate of influenza vaccination in persons with cardiovascular disease and their contacts. In 2004, we conducted a random, nationwide telephone survey of 1,202 adults (age, > or = 18 yr) to ascertain knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding influenza vaccination. Of the interviewees, 134 (11.1%) had histories of heart disease or stroke. Of these 134, 57% were men, and 45% were > or = 65 years of age. Overall, 57% were inoculated against influenza in 2003-2004, and 68% intended the same during 2004-2005. Vaccination rates increased with age: 48% (ages, 18-49 yr), 68% (ages, 50-64 yr), and 75% (age, > or = 65 yr). Forty of 69 respondents (58%) reported that their spouses were vaccinated, and 7 of 21 (33%) reported the inoculation of children < or = 17 years old in their household. Only 65% of the 134 patients considered themselves to be of high-risk status. Chief reasons for remaining unvaccinated were disbelief in being at risk and fear of contracting influenza from the vaccine. Although seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all coronary heart disease patients and their household contacts, the practice is less prevalent than is optimal. Intensified approaches are needed to increase vaccination rates. These findings suggest a need to increase vaccination efforts in high-risk subjects, particularly amidst the emerging H1N1 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the acceptance of pandemic influenza A 2009 vaccination in our high risk children with chronic renal diseases. . A total of 64 children/parents of pediatric nephrology department were approached to fill in a standardised questionnaire on influenza immunization profile. The H1N1 vaccination rates were 57.1% for transplant recipients, 61.5% for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), 36.4% for patients with various stages of chronic renal disease (CRD) and 26.7% for patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) on immunosuppressive therapy. Children on renal transplantation or PD had a fourfold higher rate of being vaccinated than children with GN (p=0.04). Causes of denying vaccination included fear of adverse effects (48.9%), lack of sufficient data on the new vaccine (31.9%) and others (19.2%). Patients being vaccinated were all urged by their pediatric nephrologist (100%), while patients not vaccinated were negatively influenced by media (41.4%), friends (24.1%), pediatrician (20.7%) and others (13.8%). Regarding parents education, higher level was associated with increased rate of children vaccination (p=0.04). It seems that patients with severe renal disease had better compliance with vaccination. The pediatric nephrologists had the most significant positive influence in contrast to the media which had the most negative influence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nInfluenza vaccination coverage in the US is lower than the recommended Healthy People 2020 threshold, especially among older African Americans. This analysis explores the complex relationship among neighborhood-level factors, socio behavioral influences, and influenza vaccination outcomes among older African Americans.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from 221 Black/African American participants' age \u226550 years living in Atlanta, Georgia. Generalized Estimating Equations for linear and logistic models assessed associations among socio demographic factors, census-tract neighborhood characteristics, and reported 2012-2013 seasonal influenza vaccination receipt, controlling for correlations among individuals within the same census tracts. Evaluated environmental factors included neighborhood deprivation indicators such as vacant housing percentage, vehicle availability, area violent crimes, and racial/ethnic composition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported greater influenza immunization uptake was significantly associated with older age \u226565 years [OR=1.05, p=0.04], positive vaccination attitudes [OR=5.30, p<0.01], having health insurance [OR=14.37, p=0.03], lower perceived neighborhood security [OR=0.51, p=0.02], and lower neighborhood vehicle ownership [OR=1.07, p=0.04], a proxy for neighborhood affluence and transportation ease. Having a post-secondary education was significantly associated with both positive perceived neighborhood security [\u03b2=0.28, p=0.02] and positive vaccination attitudes [\u03b2=0.27, p=0.02].\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings provide evidence for distal neighborhood-level influences on influenza vaccination uptake among older African Americans. Lower vehicle ownership and lower perceived neighborhood security influenced seasonal influenza immunizations. Those who perceived personal risk, based on reported neighborhood security, displayed intent to obtain the seasonal influenza vaccine. Further investigation of multilevel, socio geographic factors is therefore warranted to more effectively address suboptimal influenza vaccine coverage among this population.",

        "title": "Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Seasonal Influenza Vaccination among Dialysis Facilities in the United States.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRacial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates for seasonal influenza exist. Whether such disparities extend to patients with ESKD, who simultaneously are at risk for complications of infection and have extensive contact with health care providers, has not been investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo determine whether the proportion of patients vaccinated at a dialysis facility differs according to the facility's racial and ethnic composition, we examined dialysis facility data reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The main outcome was the proportion of facility patients vaccinated for influenza among 6735 Medicare-certified facilities operating between 2014 and 2017.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong dialysis facilities, the mean percentage of patients vaccinated during the influenza season was 72.1%. Facilities with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower vaccination percentages than less diverse facilities. The average proportion of patients vaccinated at each facility decreased significantly from 2014 to 2017 (a decrease of 1.05% vaccinated per year) and decreased significantly more so among facilities with higher minority proportions. The share of vaccinated patients in facilities in the quartile with the highest proportion of Black patients decreased 1.21% per year compared with a decrease of 0.88% per year in facilities in the quartile with the lowest proportion of Black patients. We found similar trends for Hispanic patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRates of seasonal influenza vaccination are modestly but significantly lower among dialysis facilities with larger proportions of minority patients, and the gap seems to be widening over time. As wide-scale vaccination efforts grow more urgent amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, these disparities must be addressed to protect patients and communities equitably.",

        "title": "SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Acceptability in Patients on Hemodialysis: A Nationwide Survey",
        "abstract": "Visual Abstract Significance Statement High uptake of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine among patients on dialysis is critical to mitigating the devastating rates of COVID-19\u2013related complications and deaths observed in the dialysis population. In a nationwide vaccine acceptability survey involving 150 dialysis facilities in the United States and broadly representative of this patient population, the authors found that, overall, one in five patients had vaccine hesitancy, as did one in four Black patients or patients aged 18\u201344 years. One in three responders identified dialysis staff as key sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Patients on hemodialysis who were vaccine hesitant were chiefly concerned about side effects. These findings highlight the opportunities available to dialysis networks in facilitating vaccine uptake among patients on dialysis and identify specific subgroups for which additional outreach is necessary. Background Patients on dialysis are at increased risk for COVID-19\u2013related complications. However, a substantial fraction of patients on dialysis belong to groups more likely to be hesitant about vaccination. Methods With the goal of identifying strategies to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients on hemodialysis, we conducted a nationwide vaccine acceptability survey, partnering with a dialysis network to distribute an anonymized English and Spanish language online survey in 150 randomly selected facilities in the United States. We used logistic regression to evaluate characteristics of vaccine-hesitant persons. Results A total of 1515 (14% of eligible) patients responded; 20% of all responders, 29% of patients aged 18\u201344 years, and 29% of Black responders reported being hesitant to seek the COVID-19 vaccine, even if the vaccine was considered safe for the general population. Odds of vaccine hesitancy were higher among patients aged 18\u201344 years versus those 45\u201364 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0 to 2.3), Black patients versus non-Hispanic White patients (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), Native Americans or Pacific Islanders versus non-Hispanic White patients (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.7), and women versus men (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.0). About half (53%) of patients who were vaccine hesitant expressed concerns about side effects. Responders\u2019 main information sources about COVID-19 vaccines were television news and dialysis staff (68% and 38%, respectively). Conclusions A substantial proportion of patients receiving in-center hemodialysis in the United States are hesitant about seeking COVID-19 vaccination. Facilitating uptake requires outreach to younger patients, women, and Black, Native American, or Pacific Islander patients, and addressing concerns about side effects.

        "abstract": "Visual Abstract Background and objectives Patients receiving hemodialysis are at high risk from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and demonstrate impaired immune responses to vaccines. There have been several descriptions of their immunologic responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination, but few studies have described the clinical efficacy of vaccination in patients on hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements In a multicenter observational study of the London hemodialysis population undergoing surveillance PCR testing during the period of vaccine rollout with BNT162b2 and AZD1222, all of those positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Clinical outcomes were analyzed according to predictor variables, including vaccination status, using a mixed effects logistic regression model. Risk of infection was analyzed in a subgroup of the base population using a Cox proportional hazards model with vaccination status as a time-varying covariate. Results SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in 1323 patients of different ethnicities (Asian/other, 30%; Black, 38%; and White, 32%), including 1047 (79%) unvaccinated, 86 (7%) after first-dose vaccination, and 190 (14%) after second-dose vaccination. The majority of patients had a mild course; however, 515 (39%) were hospitalized, and 172 (13%) died. Older age, diabetes, and immune suppression were associated with greater illness severity. In regression models adjusted for age, comorbidity, and time period, prior two-dose vaccination was associated with a 75% (95% confidence interval, 56 to 86) lower risk of admission and 88% (95% confidence interval, 70 to 95) fewer deaths compared with unvaccinated patients. No loss of protection was seen in patients over 65 years or with increasing time since vaccination, and no difference was seen between vaccine types. Conclusions These data demonstrate a substantially lower risk of severe COVID-19 after vaccination in patients on dialysis who become infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "abstract": "The global outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has prompted significant public health concerns. This study focuses on 442 chronic hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19, emphasizing the impact of vaccination status on clinical outcomes. The study investigates the correlation between vaccination status and laboratory findings, aiming to identify predictive factors for mortality. Results indicate that vaccination status plays a crucial role in outcomes. Full vaccination, evidenced by two or three doses, is associated with better outcomes, including reduced incidence of bilateral pneumonia and lower risks of complications such as hemorrhage and thrombosis. Laboratory analyses reveal significant differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in parameters like C-reactive protein, ferritin, and white blood cell counts. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses identify several factors influencing mortality, including comorbidities, pneumonia development, and various inflammatory markers. In conclusion among hemodialysis patients affected by COVID-19 infection, vaccination with at least three doses emerges as a protective factor against fatal outcomes. Independent predictors of mortality are CRP levels upon admission, maximum CRP values during the illness and cardiovascular comorbidities. Noteworthy lymphocytopenia during infection exhibits a notable level of specificity and sensitivity in predicting mortality.",

This study demonstrates the impact of infection and vaccination in 66 patients treated with PD and their outcomes during a 6-month follow-up. This is the first research that has studied the dynamics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum and effluent. In our research, 57.6% of PD patients were vaccinated, predominantly with Sinopharm (81.6%), which was also the most frequently administered vaccine in the Republic of Serbia at the beginning of immunization. During the monitoring period, the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the PD patients had an increasing trend in serum. In the group of vaccinated patients with PD, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies had an increasing trend in both serum and effluent, in contrast to non-vaccinated patients, where they decreased in effluent regardless of the trend of increase in serum, but statistical significance was not reached. In contrast to vaccinated (immunized) patients who did not acquire infection, the patients who only underwent the COVID-19 infection, but were not immunized, were more prone to reinfection upon the outbreak of a new viral strain, yet without severe clinical presentation and with no need for hospital treatment.",
