        "title": "Effects of doxazosin in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation versus doxazosin standard and placebo in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin Investigators' Study Group.",
        "abstract": "The alpha 1-blocker doxazosin is a well-established therapy for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, in its standard form, a multiple-step titration regimen is usually required. The new gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin greatly minimizes the need for titration by changing drug-delivery rate and the pharmaco-kinetic profile. To demonstrate this in hypertensive patients, we assessed the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily versus doxazosin standard 1-8 mg once daily, and placebo, in an integrated analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trials. Each trial included a 2-week washout period and 12 weeks of therapy. One study compared doxazosin GITS, doxazosin standard, and placebo in 392 patients with mild hypertension [blood pressure (BP) 95-105/ < or = 180 mm Hg]; the other study compared doxazosin GITS with doxazosin standard in 315 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (BP 95-115/ < or = 220 mm Hg). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of responders (sitting diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg or 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline 24 h after the dose) at the final visit for the per-protocol population. Mean baseline BP and heart rate were well matched in each group. Approximately 64% of patients with doxazosin GITS (198 of 309 patients) and 68% with doxazosin standard (207 of 304 patients) achieved goal BP response at the final visit versus 36% with placebo (25 of 70 patients; p < 0.05). The majority with doxazosin GITS (60%) remained at the initial 4-mg starting dose. Doxazosin GITS was as effective as doxazosin standard, and both were more effective than placebo in controlling BP in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated, and fewer patients with the GITS formulation discontinued therapy because of side effects compared with doxazosin standard or placebo. Syncope was not reported with doxazosin GITS. Whereas the efficacy of doxazosin GITS at 4 or 8 mg is equivalent to that of the standard regimen in this combined analysis, the GITS formulation appears to eliminate the need for titration in most patients.",

        "title": "Double\u2013Blind Trial of the Efficacy and Tolerability of Doxazosin in the Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System, Doxazosin Standard, and Placebo in Patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia",
        "abstract": "Background: The \u03b11\u2013blocker doxazosin mesylate is an established efficacious and welltolerated treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (PBH). However, its clinical utility can be limited by the need for multiple titration steps, starting at an initial dose of 1 mg, increased up to 8 mg once daily, to achieve optimal therapeutic response. A new controlled\u2013release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin mesylate enhances the pharmacokinetic profile and drug delivery rate, reducing the plasma doxazosin mesylate peak\u2013to\u2013trough ratio and minimizing the need for titration.Objective: A study was conducted to assess the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily, doxazosin standard 1 mg to 8 mg once daily, and placebo, in 795 men with BPH. This randomized, double\u2013blind, multicenter Scandinavian study included a 2\u2013week washout period, 2\u2013week single\u2013blind placebo run\u2013in phase, and 13\u2013week double\u2013blind treatment phase. Doxazosin GITS was initiated at 4 mg once daily and titrated to 8 mg once daily after 7 weeks, if indicated, and doxazosin standard was initiated at 1 mg once daily, titrated to 2 mg after 1 week, to 4 mg at 3 weeks, and to 8 mg at 7 weeks if indicated, to achieve symptom control. The primary outcome measures were mean changes from baseline to the final visit for International Prostate Symptom Score (I\u2013PSS) and maximum urinary flow rate adjusted for baseline values.Results: Both doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard significantly improved the symptoms of BPH, as evidenced by least\u2013squares mean reductions in total I\u2013PSS of \u20138.0\u00b10.3 and \u20138.4\u00b10.3 from baseline, respectively, compared with a reduction of \u20136.0\u00b10.4 in patients on placebo. Doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard produced clinically comparable improvements in maximum urinary flow rates, with a greater improvement observed earlier following treatment with doxazosin GITS than with doxazosin standard. Both active treatments produced significantly greater increases in maximum urinary flow rate compared with placebo. Nearly half of the patients on doxazosin GITS achieved symptom relief at the 4\u2013mg starting dose. A similar number of patients in both doxazosin groups were titrated to the maximum dose of 8 mg for both formulations. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar among patients treated with doxazosin GITS and placebo, and slightly higher in those on doxazosin standard. There was no apparent difference in the type of adverse events reported for the two formulations of doxazosin, although most adverse events were reported at a lower frequency with doxazosin GITS.Conclusions: Doxazosin GITS is significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the clinical symptoms of BPH and improving maximum urinary flow rate, and as effective as doxazosin standard. A therapeutic effect equivalent to that of doxazosin standard was achieved with doxazosin GITS with fewer titration steps, in a manner that appeared to be better tolerated. Because treatment with doxazosin GITS starts with an effective dose for many patients, it is likely that this clinical profile will result in the need for fewer patient visits than with doxazosin standard therapy.",

        "title": "Effect of Doxazosin GITS on Blood Pressure in Hypertensive and Normotensive Patients: A Review of Hypertension and BPH Studies",
        "abstract": "Doxazosin is an effective treatment for patients with hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the two comorbidly. In its standard formulation, doxazosin requires a multistep titration regimen to minimize a possible first-dose effect. A new extended-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin was developed to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent compound and to reduce or eliminate the need for dose titration and the potential risk of overdosing. This review presents an analysis of the effect of doxazosin GITS monotherapy on blood pressure (BP) and tolerability, as evaluated in four clinical trials, two conducted in patients with stage 1 to stage 2 hypertension and two in patients with BPH with different levels of BP. Doxazosin GITS was as effective as doxazosin standard and more effective than placebo was in reducing and controlling BP in patients with hypertension. Among normotensive patients with BPH, no clinically significant effect on BP was observed and no episodes of syncope were recorded. Doxazosin GITS was generally better tolerated than doxazosin standard, based on the proportion of patients with adverse events and those withdrawing due to adverse events. Moreover, the GITS formulation eliminated the need for titration in most patients. Doxazosin GITS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment in patients with hypertension and/or BPH and without heart failure or clinical coronary heart disease and has advantages over doxazosin standard in terms of a simpler dosing regimen and improved tolerability.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To investigate the relationship of improvement in erectile function (EF) with improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and to assess the contribution of tamsulosin dose to the improvement of EF apart from the indirect influence of LUTS improvement in men with LUTS and erectile dysfunction (ED). Materials and Methods Fifty patients received tamsulosin 0.2 mg/d for the first 4 weeks and were subsequently divided into two groups by patient-reported outcomes. Nonescalators were maintained starting dose and escalators increased to 0.4 mg for the remaining 8 weeks. International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and underwent uroflowmetry were evaluated at baseline, and weeks 4 and 12. Results LUTS parameters were significantly improved in both groups but insignificant between the 2 groups. The degree of the improvement in the total IPSS and in the voiding, storage, and quality of life (QoL) subscores were significantly correlated with the degree of the improvement in EF; this was especially prominent in patients successfully treated LUTS. The escalators experienced a significantly greater increase in IIEF-5 scores than did the nonescalators (3.3 vs. 1.5). Conclusions Dose escalation provided similar LUTS improvement in patients with refractory to starting dose. The improvements of LUTS were correlated with the improvement of EF. The increase in the IIEF-5 score was significantly higher in escalators. These findings imply that tamsulosin may contribute to the improvement in EF through the improvement of LUTS and QoL and direct relaxation of the corpus cavernosum in a dose-dependent fashion.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Previous studies have revealed that tamsulosin is effective in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile functioning but has some inhibitory effects on ejaculation, including decreased ejaculatory volume. However, these inhibitory effects on ejaculation can be beneficial to patients with premature ejaculation (PE). Therefore, this study was conducted to understand the effect of tamsulosin on PE in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and Methods Twenty-nine patients who visited with LUTS were categorized into 2 groups of LUTS-only patients (n=12) and LUTS combined with PE (LUTS+PE) patients (n=17), and 0.4 mg of tamsulosin was administered to the patients of both groups for 12 weeks. Comparative analyses of before and after the treatment were conducted for calculating the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT), and premature ejaculation profile (PEP). The patients with an IPSS score of 8 or higher were determined as LUTS patients, and the patients with IELT of less than 2 minutess and a PEDT score of 9 or higher were determined as PE patients. Results After treatment, the IPSS score significantly decreased in both groups. There was no statistically significant change in the PEDT for the LUTS group, but there was a significant decrease in PEDT (p=0.012; from 12.1\u00b13.31 to 8.4\u00b14.49) in the LUTS+PE group. Conclusions Tamsulosin not only has a treatment effect for LUTS but also improves the PE of LUTS+PE patients. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the effects of tamsulosin on PE.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective To investigate the effect of a 5mg daily tadalafil treatment on the ejaculation time, erectile function and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in patients with erectile dysfunction. Materials and Methods A total of 60 patients diagnosed with erectile dysfunction were retrospectively evaluated using the international index of erectile function questionnaire-5 (IIEF-5), intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and international prostate symptoms scores (IPSS). After the patients were treated with 5mg tadalafil once a day for three months, their erection, ejaculation and LUTS were assessed again. The fasting levels of blood glucose, total testosterone, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol were measured. The independent-samples t-test was used to compare the pre- and post-treatment scores of the patients. Results The mean age of the 60 participants was 50.4\u00b17.9 and the mean baseline serum total testosterone, total cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar were 444.6\u00b1178.6ng dL-1, 188.7\u00b129.6mg/dL-1,104 (80-360) mg dL-1, respectively.
