However, it has not been established whether leucovorin will abrogate the antiarthritic effect of MTX. We entered 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with MTX into a 48 week randomized, double blind, crossover trial of folinic acid vs placebo. The dose of folinic acid was equal to the dose of MTX and it was given orally 4 h following the single, weekly MTX administration. Under these conditions, leucovorin did not decrease the therapeutic effect of MTX. While the incidence of stomatitis and gastrointestinal toxicity were lower during leucovorin treatment, our study lacked sufficient power to establish a statistically significant difference.",

        "title": "Supplementation with Folic Acid during Methotrexate Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "The folic acid antagonist methotrexate (n-10-methyl-aminopterin) is useful in low doses (2.5 to 20 mg/wk) for treating chronic inflammatory diseases [1-7]. Many trials have established the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis [7-13]. Compared with other disease-modifying drugs, methotrexate has the highest probability of drug continuation at 10 years. Dose response-related toxic effects have been reported in 30% to 90% of patients given methotrexate [13]. Toxic effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic abnormalities, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity [14-22]. Some side effects of methotrexate administration, such as gastrointestinal intolerance, mimic complicated folate deficiency [23]. Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; further, folate stores are decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate, suggesting that impaired folate status is related to toxicity [24-26]. Folic acid supplementation has been reported anecdotally to lessen toxicity in patients receiving methotrexate treatment [27, 28]. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7 mg of folic acid weekly (1 mg/d or 2265 nmol/d) decreased methotrexate toxicity without affecting efficacy [29]. This was confirmed by Stewart and colleagues [30] in a retrospective chart review. Folinic acid (leucovorin, citrovorum factor) is a one-carbon-substituted, fully reduced folate that has also been administered during methotrexate therapy [31-36]. Low doses of the vitamin (1 to 7 mg/wk) have decreased methotrexate toxicity [35, 36]. Higher doses negate efficacy and lessen toxicity [31, 32]. Thus, the folinic acid dose may critically affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. The influence of the folic acid dose on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy remains controversial, and the effects of different doses of folic acid are not known [37, 38]. Some investigators argue that if toxic effects occur, the most rational approach is to reduce the dose of methotrexate rather than to provide folic acid supplements [37]. We designed a larger and longer study to evaluate different doses of folic acid, assuming that toxicity could be reduced without changing the efficacy of methotrexate. Methods Participants Patients aged 19 to 78 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology's revised criteria for rheumatoid arthritis consented to participate in the trial [39]. Enrollment criteria included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed more than 6 months previously, onset after the age of 16 years, and at least three of the following signs or symptoms: 3 or more swollen joints, 6 or more tender joints, at least 45 minutes of morning stiffness, and a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h. Referring rheumatologists and the principal investigator did the screening. Exclusion criteria included serious concomitant medical illnesses, liver enzyme levels twice the upper limit of normal, leukocyte counts less than 3.5 109/L or platelet counts less than 150 109/L, and use of methotrexate within the past 6 months. Gold salts were stopped for at least 10 days before the trial. This short washout period mirrors actual rheumatology practice. Patients remained under the care of their rheumatologists, abstained from alcohol use, did not become pregnant, and received stable doses of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If prednisone was taken at entry, the dose could not exceed 10 mg/d. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was allowed during the study. Study Design Figure 1 shows the trial design. To maintain the double-blind status of the trial, the statistician carried out the randomization using a computer program in which the algorithm was transparent and a coded vial number represented the treatment assignment. Patients were assigned to treatment groups by a sequential treatment assignment process designed to balance the sample with respect to baseline features, including age, sex, folate-containing vitamin use, rheumatoid factor status, and prednisone use [40]. Patients agreed to discontinue therapy with folate-containing vitamins during the trial. Rheumatoid factor was considered positive if the level was more than 30 IU/mL or if the titer was more than 1:160. Patients received either visually identical placebo or 5 mg (low-dose folic acid group) or 27.5 mg folic acid (high-dose folic acid group) each week, prepared by the Hospital Investigational Drug Service. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the mean SD folic acid content was 1 0.15 mg (2.3 0.3 mol) and 5.5 0.3 mg (12.5 0.7 mol) per capsule in the low-dose and high-dose folic acid groups, respectively. Lederle Laboratories provided the methotrexate (Rheumatrex; Pearl River, New York), which was started in a median oral dose of 16.5 mol (7.5 mg) per week and increased in 5.5-mol (2.5 mg) increments at the rheumatologist's discretion. Methotrexate was taken either in an undivided or a divided dose (that is, every 12 hours for three doses). The methotrexate dosing regimens were identical among the study groups. Folic acid supplements were given 5 days per week when methotrexate was not ingested. Compliance with the regimen was reinforced using a digital reminder cap (Counter Cap; Senetics, Boulder, Colorado). All participants and investigators were blinded to vitamin capsule content until the study was complete. Figure 1. Study design for the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical Assessment Patients were evaluated immediately before methotrexate initiation at a mean of 13, 26, 39, and 53 weeks (Figure 1). Each patient was assessed by the same physician-nutritionist (SLM). Two research assistants (JSA or WHV) did the joint evaluations. In most cases, patients were examined by the same observer throughout the study. The joint counts for tenderness and swelling were not significantly different between the two observers (P = 0.6 for tenderness; P = 0.9 for swelling). The following variables were evaluated at each visit: 1) number of the 58 diarthrodial joints with swelling; 2) number of the 60 joints with tenderness on pressure or with pain on passive motion (or both); 3) joint swelling and tenderness indices, expressed as a sum, with each joint graded for swelling as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 [severe]; 4) mean grip strength (three measurements) for both hands expressed in mm Hg; 5) duration of morning stiffness expressed in hours; 6) patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity graded as 0 (asymptomatic), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (very severe); 7) current medications and doses; 8) a 1-day dietary recall using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software, Food Database version 6A, Nutrient Database version F21 [41]; 9) eight activities of daily living assessed and averaged at baseline and at 12 months using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and scored on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to perform) [42]; and 10) presence, duration, intensity, and severity of toxic effects at every follow-up visit and every 3 weeks by telephone interview (done by SLM). Laboratory Assessments At the initial visit, complete blood cell count, Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzyme (aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase), rheumatoid factor by nephelometry, and serum creatinine values were obtained. The complete blood cell count, creatinine, and liver function tests were repeated at all visits. If laboratory values were obtained more frequently than stipulated in the protocol, they were recorded and became part of the toxicity score. Blood for plasma and erythrocyte folate levels, using a methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay, was drawn at all visits [43]. At baseline, blood was drawn for a vitamin panel (plasma and erythrocyte folate, vitamins B12, A, C, and E, carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, pyridoxine) [44-51]. If patients had abnormal values for any of the vitamins, other than folate, the abnormality was treated with single vitamin supplements. Radiographic Assessment Hand and wrist radiographs taken within 6 months of entering the trial were assessed by one of the rheumatologists (GSA) without knowledge of study status. Joint erosions and space narrowing were determined by the modified method of Sharp [52]. Results were expressed as the mean raw scores for joint erosion and joint space narrowing. Toxicity: Frequency and Severity Toxic effects and discontinuation of therapy with study medications due to toxicity were considered primary outcomes. We determined a toxicity score, modified from the one previously used, for each patient at each visit or until methotrexate therapy was discontinued [29] (Appendix). Efficacy We determined patient response to treatment using a modification of the criteria used in our previous folic acid supplementation trial and by others [8, 29, 53]. We defined marked improvement in the joint swelling index and the joint tenderness and pain index as a net decrease of 50% or more in value at any follow-up visit compared with visit 1. We defined moderate improvement as a 30% to 49% net decrease in the index, and no change as the index value remaining within 30% of the original value. We defined worsening as an increase in the index value of 30% or more. We examined the effects of folic acid supplementation on changes in physician and patient global assessments, grip strength, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, findings of the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, complete blood cell counts, blood folate levels, and dietary folate and vitamin B12 intake.

Long-term low-dose methotrexate therapy (25 mg or less once a week) inhibits production of thymidylate, purines, and methionine and leads to accumulation of adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory substance. These actions inhibit cellular proliferation, decrease formation of antibodies, and decrease production of mediators of inflammation such as interleukins and eicosanoids. Three uncontrolled trials and two controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy of low-dose methotrexate therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease and have also suggested possible benefit for ulcerative colitis and for remission maintenance indications in both diseases. Although methotrexate is generally well tolerated for long-term use at a low dose, several serious toxicities potentially limit its use.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethotrexate is a promising new agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Methotrexate is currently used as a treatment for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. This study sought to evaluate the hepatic effects of long-term methotrexate therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to determine whether the established guidelines for monitoring methotrexate-related hepatotoxicity with surveillance liver biopsy in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis are applicable to these patients.METHODS:Thirty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving cumulative methotrexate doses of \u22651500 mg were studied. Liver chemistry tests were obtained before and during therapy. Twenty patients underwent liver biopsies as recommended for methotrexate-treated patients with psoriasis; the biopsies were reviewed and graded according to Roenigk's criteria for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity (a grading system for methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis patients) by a liver pathologist blinded to the methotrexate dose.RESULTS:In patients who had liver biopsies, the mean cumulative methotrexate dose was 2633 mg (range, 1500\u20135410 mg), given for a mean of 131.7 wk (range, 66\u2013281 wk). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had mild histological abnormalities (Roenigk's grade I and II), and one patient had hepatic fibrosis (Roenigk's grade IIIB). Abnormal liver chemistry tests, present in 6 of 20 (30%) patients, did not identify the patient with Roenigk's grade IIIB hepatotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS:Cumulative methotrexate doses up to 5410 mg given up to 281 wk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are associated with little hepatotoxicity. Surveillance liver biopsies based on cumulative methotrexate doses are not warranted in these patients.",

Adult patients treated with MTX were enrolled in a multicentred study. Blood was drawn at the time of the visit, DNA was extracted and red blood cell (RBC) MTXPG levels (up to the penta-order of glutamation) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorometry. A G80A polymorphism in SLC19A1 and a -401C/T promoter polymorphism in GGH were measured by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were used to predict long-chain RBC MTXPG3-5. In 226 adult patients receiving MTX (median 15 mg range: 5-25 mg) median RBC long-chain MTXPG3-5 was 56 nmol/l (range < 5-224 nmol/l). A total of 35 patients carried the SLC19A1 80AA genotype whereas 36 patients carried the GGH-401TT genotype. Weekly MTX dose, age, presence of the SLC19A1 80AA and GGH-401TT genotypes predicted independently and significantly MTXPG3-5 levels (global r = 0.38; P < 0.0001). Patients with the GGH-401TT genotype were 4.8-fold [odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-13.0; P = 0.002] more likely to have MTXPG3-5 below the group median compared to patient carriers of the GGH-401CC or CT genotype. Conversely, those with the SLC19A1 80AA genotype were 3.4-fold more likely to have MTXPG3-5 levels above the group median compared to those with the SLC19A1 80GG or 80GA genotype (OR CI 95% 1.4-8.4; P = 0.007).

        "abstract": "The role of folate, a water-soluble B vitamin, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the folate metabolic pathway in human health and disease has been rapidly expanding. Recently, functionally significant SNPs in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a critical enzyme for intracellular folate homeostasis and metabolism, have been identified and characterized. The MTHFR SNPs are ideal candidates for investigating the role of SNPs in cancer risk modification and treatment because of their well-defined and highly relevant biochemical effects on intracellular folate composition and one-carbon transfer reactions. Indeed, a large body of molecular epidemiologic evidence suggests that the MTHFR 677 variant T allele is associated with cancer risk in a site-specific manner. Furthermore, biologically plausible mechanisms based on the functional consequences of changes in intracellular folate cofactors resulting from the MTHFR 677T variant exist to readily explain cancer risk modification associated with this variant. In addition, a growing body of in vitro and clinical evidence suggests that the MTHFR SNPs may be an important pharmacogenetic determinant of response to and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and methotrexate (MTX)-based cancer and anti-inflammatory chemotherapy. Furthermore, studies suggest that MTHFR inhibition may be a potential target for increasing chemosensitvity of cancer cells to 5FU-based chemotherapy. Because the MTHFR SNPs are prevalent and MTX and 5FU are widely used for the treatment of common cancers and inflammatory conditions, the pharmacogenetic role of the MTHFR SNPs has significant clinical implications. MTHFR SNPs may play an important role in providing rational, effective and safe tailored treatment to patients with cancer and inflammatory disorders requiring 5FU and MTX-based therapy. As such, largescale human studies and in vitro mechanistic studies are warranted to clarify the pharmacogenetic role of the MTHFR SNPs.",

Associations of individual SNPs (n\u200a=\u200a163) with RCC risk were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and study center. Minimum p-value permutation (Min-P) tests were used to identify gene regions associated with risk, and haplotypes were evaluated within these genes. Results The strongest associations with RCC risk were observed for SLC19A1 (Pmin-P\u200a=\u200a0.03) and MTHFR (Pmin-P\u200a=\u200a0.13). A haplotype consisting of four SNPs in SLC19A1 (rs12483553, rs2838950, rs2838951, and rs17004785) was associated with a 37% increased risk (p\u200a=\u200a0.02), and exploratory stratified analysis suggested the association was only significant among those in the lowest tertile of vegetable intake. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine variation in one-carbon metabolism genes in relation to RCC risk. We identified a novel association with SLC19A1, which is important for transport of folate into cells. Replication in other populations is required to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "Rare variation in protein coding sequence is poorly captured by GWAS arrays and has been hypothesized to contribute to disease heritability. Using the Illumina HumanExome SNP array, we successfully genotyped 191,032 common and rare non-synonymous, splice site, or nonsense variants in a multiethnic sample of 2,984 breast cancer cases, 4,376 prostate cancer cases, and 7,545 controls. In breast cancer, the strongest associations included either SNPs in or gene burden scores for genes LDLRAD1, SLC19A1, FGFBP3, CASP5, MMAB, SLC16A6, and INS-IGF2. In prostate cancer, one of the most associated SNPs was in the gene GPRC6A (rs2274911, Pro91Ser, OR\u200a=\u200a0.88, P\u200a=\u200a1.3\u00d710\u22125) near to a known risk locus for prostate cancer; other suggestive associations were noted in genes such as F13A1, ANXA4, MANSC1, and GP6. For both breast and prostate cancer, several of the most significant associations involving SNPs or gene burden scores (sum of minor alleles) were noted in genes previously reported to be associated with a cancer-related phenotype. However, only one of the associations (rs145889899 in LDLRAD1, p\u200a=\u200a2.5\u00d710\u22127 only seen in African Americans) for overall breast or prostate cancer risk was statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition to breast and prostate cancer, other cancer-related traits were examined (body mass index, PSA level, and alcohol drinking) with a number of known and potentially novel associations described. In general, these findings do not support there being many protein coding variants of moderate to high risk for breast and prostate cancer with odds ratios over a range that is probably required for protein coding variation to play a truly outstanding role in risk heritability. Very large sample sizes will be required to better define the role of rare and less penetrant coding variation in prostate and breast cancer disease genetics.",

        "abstract": "Genome\u2010wide association studies have identified more than 80 risk variants for prostate cancer, mainly in European or Asian populations. The generalizability of these variants in other racial/ethnic populations needs to be understood before the loci can be used widely in risk modeling. In our study, we examined 82 previously reported risk variants in 4,853 prostate cancer cases and 4,678 controls of African ancestry. We performed association testing for each variant using logistic regression adjusted for age, study and global ancestry. Of the 82 known risk variants, 68 (83%) had effects that were directionally consistent in their association with prostate cancer risk and 30 (37%) were significantly associated with risk at p\u2009<\u20090.05, with the most statistically significant variants being rs116041037 (p\u2009=\u20093.7 \u00d7 10\u221226) and rs6983561 (p\u2009=\u20091.1 \u00d7 10\u221216) at 8q24, as well as rs7210100 (p\u2009=\u20095.4 \u00d7 10\u22128) at 17q21. By exploring each locus in search of better markers, the number of variants that captured risk in men of African ancestry (p\u2009<\u20090.05) increased from 30 (37%) to 44 (54%). An aggregate score comprised of these 44 markers was strongly associated with prostate cancer risk [per\u2010allele odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.12, p\u2009=\u20097.3 \u00d7 10\u221298]. In summary, the consistent directions of effects for the vast majority of variants in men of African ancestry indicate common functional alleles that are shared across populations. Further exploration of these susceptibility loci is needed to identify the underlying biologically relevant variants to improve prostate cancer risk modeling in populations of African ancestry.",

        "title": "Population-standardized genetic risk score: the SNP-based method of choice for inherited risk assessment of prostate cancer",
        "abstract": "Several different approaches are available to clinicians for determining prostate cancer (PCa) risk. The clinical validity of various PCa risk assessment methods utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been established; however, these SNP-based methods have not been compared. The objective of this study was to compare the three most commonly used SNP-based methods for PCa risk assessment. Participants were men (n = 1654) enrolled in a prospective study of PCa development. Genotypes of 59 PCa risk-associated SNPs were available in this cohort. Three methods of calculating SNP-based genetic risk scores (GRSs) were used for the evaluation of individual disease risk such as risk allele count (GRS-RAC), weighted risk allele count (GRS-wRAC), and population-standardized genetic risk score (GRS-PS). Mean GRSs were calculated, and performances were compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and positive predictive value (PPV). All SNP-based methods were found to be independently associated with PCa (all P < 0.05; hence their clinical validity). The mean GRSs in men with or without PCa using GRS-RAC were 55.15 and 53.46, respectively, using GRS-wRAC were 7.42 and 6.97, respectively, and using GRS-PS were 1.12 and 0.84, respectively (all P < 0.05 for differences between patients with or without PCa). All three SNP-based methods performed similarly in discriminating PCa from non-PCa based on AUC and in predicting PCa risk based on PPV (all P > 0.05 for comparisons between the three methods), and all three SNP-based methods had a significantly higher AUC than family history (all P < 0.05). Results from this study suggest that while the three most commonly used SNP-based methods performed similarly in discriminating PCa from non-PCa at the population level, GRS-PS is the method of choice for risk assessment at the individual level because its value (where 1.0 represents average population risk) can be easily interpreted regardless of the number of risk-associated SNPs used in the calculation.",

        "title": "Genetic factors influencing prostate cancer risk in Norwegian men",
        "abstract": "Norway has one of the highest rates of death due to prostate cancer (PCa) in the world. To assess the contribution of both common and rare single nucleotide variants (SNPs) to the prostate cancer burden in Norway, we assessed the frequency of the established prostate cancer susceptibility allele, HOXB13 G84E, as well as a series of validated, common PCa risk SNPs in a Norwegian PCa population of 779 patients. The G84E allele was observed in 2.3% of patients compared to 0.7% of control individuals, OR\u2009=\u20093.8, P\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20104. While there was a trend toward an earlier age at diagnosis, overall the clinicopathologic features of PCa were not significantly different in G84E carriers and non\u2010carriers. Evaluation of 32 established common risk alleles revealed significant associations of risk alleles at 13 loci, including SNPs at 8q24, and near TET2, SLC22A3, NKX3\u20101, CASC8, MYC, DAP2IP, MSMB, HNF1B, PPP1R14A, and KLK2/3. When the data for each SNP are combined into a genetic risk score (GRS), Norwegian men within the top decile of GRS have over 5\u2010fold greater risk to be diagnosed with PCa than men with GRS in the lowest decile. These results indicate that risk alleles of HOXB13 and common variant SNPs are important components of inherited PCa risk in the Norwegian population, although these factors appear to contribute little to the malignancy's aggressiveness.",

        "abstract": "One of the principal mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in highly frequent solid tumors like colorectal cancer (CRC) is the decreased activity of drug transport into tumor cells due to low expression of important membrane proteins, such as solute carrier (SLC) transporters. Sequence complementarity is a major determinant for target gene recognition by microRNAs (miRNAs). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in target sequences transcribed into messenger RNA may therefore alter miRNA binding to these regions by either creating a new site or destroying an existing one. miRSNPs may explain the modulation of expression levels in association with increased/decreased susceptibility to common diseases as well as in chemoresistance and the consequent interindividual variability in drug response. In the present study, we investigated whether miRSNPs in SLC transporter genes may modulate CRC susceptibility and patient's survival. Using an in silico approach for functional predictions, we analyzed twenty-six miRSNPs in nine SLC genes in a cohort of 1368 CRC cases and 698 controls from the Czech Republic. After correcting for multiple tests, we found several miRSNPs significantly associated with patient's survival. SNPs in SLCO3A1, SLC22A2, and SLC22A3 genes were defined as prognostic factors in the classification and regression tree analysis. In contrast, we did not observe any significant association between miRSNPs and CRC risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating miRSNPs potentially affecting miRNA binding to SLC transporter genes and their impact on CRC susceptibility or patient's prognosis.",

CircRNA is produced by the reverse splicing of exon, intron or both, forming exon or intron circRNA. Studies have shown that circRNA is a ubiquitous molecule, which exceeds the linear mRNA distributed in human cells. Because of its covalent closed-loop structure, circRNA is resistant to RNase R, which is more stable than linear mRNA; circRNA is highly conserved in different species. It was found that circRNA competitively adsorbs miRNA, as a miRNA sponge, to involve in the expression regulation of a variety of genes and plays an important role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis and other processes. These molecules offer new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention and serve as biomarkers for diagnosis.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT A large number of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are dysregulated in lung cancer and affect the progression and prognosis of lung disease. Herein, this study selected specific circular RNA (circ_0070659) by bioinformatics analysis and aimed to investigate the role of circ_0070659 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The differentially expressed circRNA (hsa_circ_0070659) in NSCLC was screened from public databases (GEO), and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was carried out to identify the circ_0070659 levels in cancer tissues and cells. NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities after circ_0070659 silencing was detected by colony formation assay, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Transwell assay. Targeted binding between microRNA-377 (miR-377) and circ_0070659 or Ras-Associated Binding Protein 3C (RAB3C) was verified by western blot, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA pull-down assay. Our experimental results showed that circ_0070659 levels were largely increased in tumor tissues and cells. Biologically, knockdown of circ_0070659 obviously inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, circ_0070659 promoted RAB3C-mediated proliferation and invasion through sponging miR-377. Furthermore, miR-377 inhibitor reversed the inhibitory ability of circ_0070659 silencing on malignant biological behavior of NSCLC cells. Our study revealed a novel signaling pathway that circ_0070659/miR-377/RAB3C axis regulates tumor progression, and it may become a new therapeutic target for NSCLC. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",
