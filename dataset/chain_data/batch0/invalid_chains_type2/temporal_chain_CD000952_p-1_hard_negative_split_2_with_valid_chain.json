        "title": "Calcium and Vitamin D3 Supplementation Prevents Bone Loss in the Spine Secondary to Low-Dose Corticosteroids in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Long-term administration of low doses of corticosteroids is common in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, and allergic conditions. Although treatment with high doses of corticosteroids causes osteoporosis (especially in trabecular bone, such as that found in the lumbar spine [1]), use of corticosteroids in low doses (<10 mg/d) was thought to be associated with few substantial side effects [2]. However, recent research suggests that use of low doses of corticosteroids is also associated with loss of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine [3-6] and that patients receiving continuous therapy with low-dose corticosteroids have a higher rate of vertebral fracture [7-9]. Corticosteroids cause osteoporosis by several mechanisms, such as decreasing levels of sex steroids [10, 11] and direct effects on osteoblast [12] and osteoclast function [13]. Use of corticosteroids also decreases absorption of intestinal calcium [14-17], thereby causing secondary hyperparathyroidism [18]. Some studies [19, 20] have shown that vitamin D3 and its more potent analogues can improve calcium absorption in patients receiving corticosteroids. Treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and calcium stabilized bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in patients receiving moderate to high doses of corticosteroids [21]. However, calcitriol is a potent vitamin D analogue that can cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria [22]. The associated toxicity and expense make it impractical for widespread use for prevention of bone loss in all patients receiving long-term treatment with low-dose corticosteroids. Vitamin D3, the parent compound, is generally well tolerated and rarely causes side effects when used in the recommended dosage (400 to 800 IU/d). It has been suggested that vitamin D3 and calcium should be given to all patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy [23]. However, few data support this approach. Early studies [24] suggested that calcium and pharmacologic dosages of vitamin D3 (50 000 IU three times a week) increased bone mineral density in patients taking long-term corticosteroids, but bone mineral density was measured only in the radius. Adachi and colleagues [25] recently reported that treatment with calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (50 000 IU/wk) did not prevent bone loss associated with moderate- to high-dose treatment with corticosteroids, but Healy and colleagues [26] found that calcium and vitamin D3 prevented substantial loss of bone mineral density in a similar group of patients starting corticosteroid treatment. No randomized, controlled, clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation for prevention of bone loss secondary to long-term low-dose corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, we studied the effects of calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (500 IU/d) supplementation on the bone mineral density of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and contrasted the efficacy of this supplementation in patients who were and those who were not receiving corticosteroids. Methods Patients Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were followed at the University of Vermont, College of Medicine (n = 354) were identified through a computer listing by diagnostic code. All identified patients were contacted by mail and asked whether they were interested in participating in a study of the effects of rheumatoid arthritis and medication on bone mineral density. Patients were eligible if they were between 18 and 65 years of age and had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis as defined by the revised American College of Rheumatology criteria [27], serum creatinine level less than 176.8 mol/L, and normal liver function. Patients were excluded if they were receiving an anticonvulsant medication, hydrochlorothiazide, bisphosphonates, fluoride, calcitonin, or calcitriol or if they had a history of malabsorption, hyperparathyroidism, immobilization, metabolic bone disease, or thyroid disease with an abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone. One hundred thirty patients met these criteria, agreed to participate, and entered the study between January 1991 and January 1992. Study Design The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the University of Vermont, and informed consent was obtained as patients entered the study. Patients were stratified by sex, menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal without estrogen replacement, or postmenopausal with estrogen replacement), and current dosage of prednisone (<10 mg/d or 10 mg/d). Patients were randomly assigned in blocks of four to a treatment group using a random-number table. Group assignment was kept in sealed envelopes to ensure blinding. Patients received either calcium carbonate (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (500 IU/d) (two tablets twice a day of Os-Cal 250 + D, SmithKline Beecham Healthcare, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) or an identical placebo. Study medication was taken with breakfast and dinner. Measurement Demographic information and information about risk factors for osteoporosis, such as smoking history, use of alcohol, menstrual history, parity, fracture history, and use of medications (including thyroid medication and estrogen replacement therapy) were obtained from questionnaires given at the beginning of the study and annually thereafter. Calcium intake was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire [28] and 3-day dietary history. Disease-related information included activity level, measured by the Framingham Activity Index [29]; disease severity, measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire [30]; and a severity score, based on radiologic findings [31]. Information about disease duration and use of prednisone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was ascertained by chart review. Bone mineral densities of the femur (femoral neck, Ward triangle, and trochanter) and lumbar spine were measured in all patients by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Corp., Madison, Wisconsin) at the beginning of the study and at yearly follow-up visits. All studies were done using the same machine. Stability of measurement was assured with daily quality-assurance calibration by the manufacturer, weekly Lunar aluminum phantom in water bath, and Hologic spine phantom three times weekly. The coefficient of variation (calculated using 11 patients and three measurements) was 1.2% for the anteroposterior spine and 2.2% for the femoral neck. At the start of the study, the lateral scan of the spine was thought to be the most sensitive measurement for detecting changes induced by cortico-steroids [32]. However, we and others [33] have found the reproducibility of this view with the available technology to be suboptimal, especially in patients with arthritis, because correct positioning is difficult. We subsequently obtained anteroposterior scans of the spine. For patients from whom only the lateral view of the spine was available at baseline (n = 48 [20 patients in the treatment group and 28 in the placebo group]), we determined the anteroposterior value by adding the difference between the anteroposterior and lateral scans obtained after the first year of the study to the lateral scan obtained at baseline. This provided adequate measurement because the differences between anteroposterior and lateral views for each patient remained relatively constant (within 0.10 0.07 g/cm2 for 87% of patients). Patients were seen by the study coordinator at 6-month intervals to assess compliance. At these visits, pills were counted and patients were questioned about side effects of medication. Statistical Analysis Because loss of bone mineral density over time is presumed to be proportional to the amount of bone mineral density remaining, the yearly rate of change () was estimated using data from the three time points (baseline, year 1, and year 2) in the following equation: Equation 1 Differences in rates for the two treatment groups were assessed by using the t-test. The effect of treatment after adjustment for group differences in disease severity and duration was examined by linear regression analysis. Patients who received prednisone during the study and those who did not were analyzed separately and in combination. Clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square tests. Potential interactions between treatment effects and patient characteristics were examined by analysis of variance. All analyses were done using SPS statistical software (SPS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Results Baseline characteristics of the patients completing both years of the study are listed in Table 1. The patients studied were primarily middle-aged white women. Although study groups were similar for most characteristics, the patients receiving calcium and vitamin D3 tended to have disease of greater severity (by radiologic stage) and longer duration than did those receiving placebo. Among patients who were receiving corticosteroids, the mean dosage of prednisone at the initial visit was 5.9 mg/d for the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 5.0 mg/d for the placebo group. During the first year of study, 68% of patients were taking prednisone (mean dosage, 5.5 mg/d; range, 1 to 20 mg/d); during the second year, 65% were taking prednisone (mean dosage, 5.6 mg/d; range, 0.5 to 20 mg/d). Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Patients Who Had Bone Mineral Density Measurements Available for All Time Points* During the 2-year study period, 29 of the original 130 patients (22%) dropped out of the study. Fifteen of the patients who dropped out had been in the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 14 had been in the placebo group. Fourteen patients withdrew for personal reasons, 1 patient died, and 3 patients developed serious illness (inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Eleven patients (7 in the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 4 in the placebo group) dropped out of the study because",

        "abstract": "Long\u2010term use of high\u2010dose corticosteroids often results in bone loss, which may lead to osteoporosis\u2010related fractures. This was a multicenter, double\u2010blind study in which 290 ambulatory men and women receiving high\u2010dose oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone \u2265 7.5 mg/day or equivalent) for 6 or more months were randomized to receive placebo, risedronate 2.5 mg/day, or risedronate 5 mg/day for 12 months. All patients received calcium 1 g and vitamin D 400 IU daily. The primary endpoint was lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at month 12. Additional measurements included BMD at the femoral neck and trochanter and the incidence of vertebral fractures. Overall, there were statistically significant treatment effects on BMD at 12 months at the lumbar spine (p < 0.001), femoral neck (p = 0.004), and trochanter (p = 0.010). Risedronate 5 mg increased BMD at 12 months by a mean (SEM) of 2.9% (0.49%) at the lumbar spine, 1.8% (0.46%) at the femoral neck, and 2.4% (0.54%) at the trochanter, whereas BMD was maintained only in the control group. Although not powered to show fracture efficacy, we observed a reduction in the incidence of vertebral fractures of 70% in the combined risedronate treatment groups, relative to placebo (p = 0.042). Risedronate was well tolerated, had a good safety profile, and was not associated with gastrointestinal adverse events. We conclude that risedronate increases BMD and potentially reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures in patients with corticosteroid\u2010induced osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Risedronate reduces the risk of new vertebral fractures up to 70% within 1 year of treatment in patients with osteoporosis. Both increases in bone mass and preservation of bone architecture are thought to contribute to antifracture effects. Our objectives were to determine the effects of risedronate on trabecular bone mass and architecture and to determine the relative contributions of mass and architecture to strength in the vertebra of ovariectomized (OVX) minipigs. The minipigs were OVX at 18 months of age and were treated daily for 18 months with either vehicle or risedronate at doses of 0.5 mg/kg per day or 2.5 mg/kg per day. The three\u2010dimensional (3D) bone architecture of the L4 vertebral cores of Sinclair S1 minipigs was evaluated by 3D microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT). Compared with the OVX control, the vertebral bone volume (bone volume/tissue volume [BV/TV]) was higher in both treated groups (p < 0.05). The architectural changes were more significant at the 2.5\u2010mg/kg dose and were more prevalent at the cranial\u2010caudal ends compared with the midsection. At the higher dose, the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and connectivity were higher, and marrow star volume (Ma.St.V) and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) were lower (p < 0.05). The trabecular separation variation index(TSVI), a new measure to approximate structural variations, was smaller in the 2.5\u2010mg/kg\u2010treated group (p < 0.05). In this group, a significant preservation of trabeculae orthogonal to the cranial\u2010caudal axis was confirmed by a decrease in the degree of anisotropy (DA) and an increase in the percent Cross\u2010strut (%Cross\u2010strut; p < 0.05). Both normalized maximum load (strength) and normalized stiffness of the same vertebral cores were higher in the 2.5\u2010mg/kg risedronate group compared with the OVX group (p < 0.05). BV/TV alone could explain 76% of the variability of the bone strength. The combination of bone volume and architectural variables explained >90% of the strength. The study showed that risedronate preserved trabecular architecture in the vertebra of OVX minipigs, and that bone strength is tightly coupled to bone mass and architecture.",

        "title": "Preventing osteoporotic fractures with antiresorptive therapy: implications of microarchitectural changes",
        "abstract": "Prospective studies have demonstrated that low bone mass correlates well with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures at various skeletal sites. Trials have likewise confirmed that enhancing bone mass with antiresorptive therapy reduces fracture incidence in individuals at risk. However, correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) increases with therapeutic risk reduction has proved less consistent than correlation of BMD decreases with greater fracture risk in the untreated. Indeed, various analyses have indicated that \u2013 even during treatment with potent bisphosphonates like alendronate and risedronate \u2013 BMD changes from baseline account for <30% of the reduction in vertebral fractures in treated women. It is clearly, therefore, that factors other than BMD are involved in the reduction of fracture risk achieved by antiresorptive therapies. According to recent micro\u2010computed tomography imaging and other studies, antiresorptive therapy can help rebuild the microarchitecture of bone as well as strengthen the materials that go into it. When treating individuals with osteoporosis, these microarchitectural changes contribute to the reduction of fracture risk achieved by antiresorptive therapies.",

        "title": "Examining the Relationship Between Bone Mineral Density and Fracture Risk Reduction During Pharmacologic Treatment of Osteoporosis",
        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes the patient to an increased risk for fracture. Elements of bone strength include bone mineralization, architecture, turnover, size, and bone mineral density (BMD). Measurement of BMD is the most readily available, noninvasive method for assessing osteoporotic fracture risk and is used by the World Health Organization for diagnostic purposes. Because low BMD is predictive of increased fracture risk, it was believed that changes in BMD during pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis would strongly predict observed fracture risk reductions. We examined the relationship between changes in BMD and reduction in fracture risk during pharmacologic therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The correlation between BMD increases and fracture risk reduction during treatment is not consistent; larger increases in BMD do not necessarily correlate with greater reductions in fracture risk. Multiple factors, in addition to BMD, appear to contribute to the increased bone strength and decreased fracture risk achieved with approved drug therapies for osteoporosis. Until the exact relationship of these factors is fully understood, clinicians should continue to evaluate drug efficacy for osteoporosis based on the fracture risk reductions from well\u2010designed clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the effects of a low calcium diet on maxillofacial development by evaluating Bone Mineral Content (BMC) in the lower alveolar bones, femurs, and tibias and by performing cephalometry on growing rats.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThirty 5-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups; the control group (n = 10) was given standard diet for 6 weeks, the low calcium/standard diet group (n = 10) was given a calcium-restricted diet for the first 4 weeks, and then a standard diet for the following 2 weeks, and the low calcium diet group (n = 10) was given the calcium-restricted diet for 6 weeks. After the rats were euthanized, heads and legs were fixed and cephalometry was performed. Next, mandibles, femurs and tibias were digitally photographed and the BMC was evaluated using our newly developed software.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe BMC was decreased in all of the bone samples from the two groups that received restricted calcium. In the low calcium/standard diet group, the BMC recovered the most in the tibias and least in the lower alveolar bones. Development of the mandibles in the anterior-posterior direction was accelerated, while that in the superior-inferior direction was inhibited in those rats.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe BMC reduction following calcium deficiency in the lower alveolar bone hardly recovers, so prevention is important.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe variety of methodologies used to investigate ovariectomized female rats shows different results, which makes a clinical application of these results difficult. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of masticatory effort reduction and of low-calcium diet on maxillary bone turnover of ovariectomized female rats.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nEighty-four female rats were divided into four groups of 21 animals each as follows: SHAM--sham-operated; OVZ--ovariectomized and fed a standard commercial diet; LCD--fed a low calcium diet, and GCD--fed a grind commercial diet. The inferior first molars were extracted bilaterally 15 days after the ovariectomy, and the animals were euthanized 3, 5 and 8 weeks after ovaries removal. The maxillae were embedded in methylmetacrilate. The results were submitted to analysis of variance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe daily mineral apposition rate lowered with time and was not different between SHAM and OVZ groups. The trabecular bone volume of SHAM and OVZ animals was similar and decreased with time. The GCD animals presented the lowest means and the LCD the highest in comparison to the OVZ group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt was concluded that ovariectomy and a low calcium diet did not cause significant maxillary bone loss in the first molar region, and even in the absence of the antagonist tooth, they did not cause maxillary bone turnover. The grind commercial diet is a good alternative for the study of maxillary bone loss in ovariectomized female rats.",

        "abstract": "Many postmenopausal women have vitamin D and calcium deficiency. Therefore, vitamin D and calcium supplementation is recommended for all patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis. We used an experimental rat model to test the hypothesis that induction of osteoporosis is more efficiently achieved in peripheral bone through combining ovariectomy with a unique multi-deficiencies diet (vitamin D depletion and deficient calcium, vitamin K and phosphorus). 14-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats served as controls to examine the initial bone status. 11 rats were bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) and fed with multi-deficiencies diet. Three months later the treated group and the Sham group (n\u200a=\u200a8) were euthanized. Bone biomechanical competence of the diaphyseal bone was examined on both, tibia and femur. Image analysis was performed on tibia via \u00b5CT, and on femur via histological analysis. Lower torsional stiffness indicated inferior mechanical competence of the tibia in 3 month OVX+Diet. Proximal metaphyseal region of the tibia showed a diminished bone tissue portion to total tissue in the \u00b5CT despite the increased total area as evaluated in both \u00b5CT and histology. Cortical bone showed higher porosity and smaller cross sectional thickness of the tibial diaphysis in the OVX+Diet rats. A lower ALP positive area and elevated serum level of RANKL exhibited the unbalanced cellular interaction in bone remodeling in the OVX+Diet rat after 3 month of treatment. Interestingly, more adipose tissue area in bone marrow indicated an effect of bone loss similar to that observed in osteoporotic patients. Nonetheless, the presence of osteoid and elevated serum level of PTH, BGP and Opn suggest the development of osteomalacia rather than an osteoporosis. As the treatment and fracture management of both osteoporotic and osteomalacia patients are clinically overlapping, this study provides a preclinical animal model to be utilized in local supplementation of minerals, drugs and growth factors in future fracture healing studies.",

This study was conducted to assess the potential effect of the flavonoid fraction of Herba Epimedii on osteoporosis in ovariectomized rats. Rats received repeated administration of a vehicle (ovariectomized), the flavonoid fraction of Herba Epimedii (7.5, 15, 30\u2009mg/kg/d), and ipriflavone (200\u2009mg/kg/d) once a day for 8 weeks, beginning 4 weeks after ovariectomization. Then, the bone turnover markers, bone biomechanical properties, trabecular architecture, and related protein expressions were evaluated by biochemical assay kits, mechanical testing, microcomputed tomography, immunohistochemical evaluation, and Western blot analysis. Treatment with the flavonoid fraction of Herba Epimedii (15, 30\u2009mg/kg/d) and ipriflavone (200\u2009mg/kg/d) significantly increased bone strength while dramatically inhibiting the serum alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase levels in ovariectomized rats. Furthermore, the flavonoid fraction of Herba Epimedii also increased osteoprotegerin protein expression and reduced the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand protein expression compared with ovariectomized rats. In addition, the microcomputed tomography results showed that the flavonoid fraction of Herba Epimedii treatment significantly improved trabecular bone mineral density and restored the bone microarchitecture in ovariectomized rats. Therefore, our results indicated that the flavonoid fraction of Herba Epimedii might be beneficial for improving postmenopausal osteoporosis and should be considered as a promising candidate for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

The experimental studies indicated their potential use as treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis and investigated the underlying mechanisms including osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (OPG/RANKL), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase/c-Jun N terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/JNK/MAPK), estrogen receptor (ER), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and Notch signaling pathways. This review contributes to a better understanding of traditional Chinese medicine and provides useful information for the development of more effective anti-osteoporosis drugs.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to probe into the effect of sweroside (SOS) in osteoporosis (OP) and explains mechanisms of its molecular. Applying the ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model investigates the preventive effect of SOS against postmenopausal OP after 3 months of SOS treatment (120\u2009mg/kg/day). Using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and micro computed tomography (CT) observed the morphology of OP in each group. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was used to examine osteoblast markers. Experiments in vitro, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from C57/BL6 mice were treated with SOS for 14 days. The staining of alizarin red and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured, and the presentation of osteoblast markers was detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. BMSCs were also treated with 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL SOS with or without rapamycin, the expression of protein S6 (PS6), P\u2010mTOR, runt\u2010related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), OSX, and osteocalcin (OCN) was detected by Western blotting. Experiments in vivo, HE results show that SOS can alleviate OP, CT results show that there are lower trabecular thickness, bone mineral density, and trabecular number in control OVX mice than those in the OVX\u2009+\u2009SOS group. IHC results showed that SOS can promote the expression of osteogenic markers and immunofluorescent results show that SOS can promote mTORC1 signal activation. Experiments in vitro revealed that SOS stimulated the activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and upregulated RUNX2, OSX, and OCN, rapamycin can reverse it. Our findings demonstrated that differentiated BMSCs into osteoblasts can be promoted by SOS via upregulating the expression of P\u2010mTOR, PS6, RUNX2, OSX, and OCN. SOS effectively prevented OP by hyperactivation of the mTORC1/PS6 signaling pathway.",

        "title": "Promotion of osteogenesis by Sweroside via BMP2\u2010involved signaling in postmenopausal osteoporosis",
        "abstract": "Phlomis umbrosa has been traditionally used for bone diseases in traditional Korean Medicine. Sweroside (SOS), marker compounds of P. umbrosa, has been known to promote osteoblast differentiation. In this study, ameliorative effects of SOS on osteoporosis and potential target pathway were investigated. Ovariectomized mice were administered three doses of SOS three times a week for 4\u2009weeks after inducing osteoporosis. Bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were analyzed by dual energy X\u2010ray absorptiometry. A human osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS\u20102) was differentiated to clarify the promoting effects of SOS on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Osteoblastic bone\u2010forming markers were evaluated in lumbar vertebrae (LV) and mineralized SaOS\u20102 cells. SOS markedly elevated BMC and BMD levels and attenuated the bone marrow adipocytes in the femoral shaft. SOS increased the formation of bone matrix in SaOS\u20102 cells. Bone morphogenetic protein\u20102 (BMP2) and runt\u2010related transcription factor 2 (CBFA1) in LV and SaOS\u20102 cells were up\u2010regulated by SOS. SOS increased alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), osteopontin (SPP1), and bone sialoprotein\u20101 (BSPH1). In conclusion, SOS induced the formation of mineralized bone matrix by regulating BMP2/CBFA1\u2010mediated molecules. Therefore, SOS could be a therapeutic compound of treatment for osteoporosis by producing the new bone matrix.",

        "title": "A Comparison of the Antiosteoporotic Effects of Cornelian Cherry (Cornus mas L.) Extracts from Red and Yellow Fruits Containing Different Constituents of Polyphenols and Iridoids in Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts",
        "abstract": "Methods Polyphenolic and iridoid constituents of extracts were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using the ultraperformance liquid chromatography system coupled with a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry. Primary cultured osteoblasts isolated from mouse calvarias and osteoclast-lineage primary cultured monocytes isolated from mouse bone marrow were used for the assessment of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. In the osteoblast culture, cellular viability, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, ALP staining, and mRNA expression of Alpl and Runx2 were examined. In the osteoclast culture, the examined parameters were cellular viability, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and staining, and mRNA expression of Nfatc1, Ctsk, and Acp. Results A total of 41 main compounds of iridoids, anthocyanins, hydrolysable tannins, phenolic acids, and flavonols were identified in the three extracts. RED EXT1 contained most of the tested polyphenols and iridoids and was the only extract containing anthocyanins. YL EXT2 contained only one iridoid, loganic acid and gallic acid. YL EXT3 comprised a mixture of iridoids and polyphenols. RED EXT1, YL EXT 2, and to a lesser extent YL EXT3 promoted osteoblast differentiation increasing significantly ALP activity and the amount of ALP-positive stained cells. All extracts upregulated mRNA expression of Alpl and Runx2. RED EXT1 caused the most significant decrease in TRAP activity and the numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells. RED EXT1 caused also the most significant downregulation of mRNA expression of osteoclast related genes Nfatc1, Ctsk, and Acp5. Extracts from yellow fruits, mostly YL EXT2 caused lower, but still significant inhibitory effect on TRAP and osteoclast related genes. Conclusions The main conclusion of our study is that all three extracts, especially RED EXT1 from red cornelian cherry fruits, possess the antiosteoporotic potential and may be a promising phytomedicine candidate for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.",
