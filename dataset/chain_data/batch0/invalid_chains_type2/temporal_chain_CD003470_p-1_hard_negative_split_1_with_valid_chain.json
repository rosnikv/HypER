        "title": "Effect of intraarticular glycosaminoglycan polysulfate treatment on patellofemoral pain syndrome. A prospective, randomized double-blind trial comparing glycosaminoglycan polysulfate with placebo and quadriceps muscle exercises.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the effects of intraarticular (IA) injections of glycosaminoglycan polysulfate (GAGPS) plus basic conservative treatment with the effects of placebo injections plus conservative treatment and with the effects of conservative treatment alone in patients with chronic patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe treated 53 patients who presented with chronic PFPS in 1 knee, according to 1 of the 3 protocols, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Basic conservative treatment consisted of a 6-week program of quadriceps muscle exercise, elimination of symptom-producing activities, and oral doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Physiologic saline served as placebo for injection. During the 6-week treatment period, 5 injections were given 1 week apart. Along with measurements of quadriceps strength, standardized subjective, functional, and clinical assessments were performed at presentation, after 6 weeks of treatment, and after 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults at 6 months indicated that IA injections of GAGPS or saline did not result in significant improvement beyond the good results achieved by the basic conservative treatment alone. More than two-thirds of the patients in each group experienced complete recovery.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNeither the GAGPS injections nor the physiologic saline injections are more effective than conservative therapy in the treatment of chronic PFPS. Restoration of normal quadriceps muscle function to the affected knee seems to be crucial in treating PFPS.",

        "title": "Open Versus Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises for Patellofemoral Pain",
        "abstract": "The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of open versus closed kinetic chain exercises in the nonoperative management of patellofemoral pain. Sixty patients were randomized into a 5-week program that consisted of only closed kinetic chain exercises or only open kinetic chain exercises. Muscle characteristics, subjective symptoms, and functional performance were evaluated in this study at the time of the initial physical examination, at the end of the treatment period, and 3 months later. Both groups experienced a statistically significant decrease in pain and an increase in functional performance. This study shows that both open and closed kinetic chain exercise programs lead to an improved subjective and clinical outcome in patients with anterior knee pain. The few significantly better functional results for some of the tested parameters in the closed kinetic chain group suggest that this type of treatment is a little more effective than the open kinetic chain program in the treatment of these patients.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the findings of the source paper. The source paper concludes that restoration of normal quadriceps muscle function is crucial in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome, and this paper evaluates the efficacy of different types of exercises (open versus closed kinetic chain exercises) in the nonoperative management of patellofemoral pain, building on the idea of muscle function restoration."

        "title": "Patellofemoral Pain in Female Athletes",
        "abstract": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common complaint in female athletes. There are clear structural, biomechanical, sociological, and hormonal differences between women and men that contribute to an increased incidence of PFPS in women. Unfortunately, the etiology of PFPS is still not well understood. It may represent the end result of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Three major factors can be attributed to its etiology: quadriceps muscle imbalance and/or weakness, lower extremity and patellofemoral malalignment, and physical overload of patellofemoral joint. Exclusion of intraarticular pathology is essential to diagnose PFPS. Imaging can be helpful to diagnose any associated patellar instability. Conservative management, a mainstay in management, includes rehabilitation focusing on proprioception, strength, flexibility, endurance, and a gradual progression of the musculoskeletal load. Various training programs are in use, including isometric open kinetic chain exercises and eccentric closed kinetic chain exercises. Surgery may be required if conservative measures fail. Various procedures have been described, including lateral retinaculum release and proximal and distal realignment procedures.",

        "title": "Effects in the Q angle measurement with maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps muscle",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the difference between the angle of the quadriceps in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in two different examination situations, having the quadriceps relaxed and in a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) through radiographic measurement, aiming to contribute to the assessment and treatment of patients with patelofemoral disorder (PFD). Through the standard radiological method twenty 21 years old mean women (40 knees) were assessed. All individuals were positioned supine using a U-podalic stabilizer, having their lower limbs relaxed, using a plumb film on the anterior tuberosity of the tibia. For the statistical analysis, the averages for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups in a relaxed and MVIC status, as well as the Student\u2019s t-test with p < 0.05 significance level were used. The mean values to the Q angle compared to the asymptomatic group were 17.15 o on relaxation, and 14.5 o on MVIC, while the asymptomatic group presented 21.45 o , and 15.8 o , respectively. The results in the equality analysis between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups on the relaxed status attained a p = 0.004, and to the maximal voluntary isometric contraction, p = 0.29. Considering the data attained in the present study, it can be verified that in a relaxing status, there is a difference between the value of the Q angle among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, being found a higher value in the FPD bearers, while in a maximal isometric contraction of the quadriceps muscle no statistical difference was found in the present study, with a reduction in the angle in both groups.",
