        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAntithrombotic drugs are used after coronary-artery stenting to prevent stent thrombosis. We compared the efficacy and safety of three antithrombotic-drug regimens - aspirin alone, aspirin and warfarin, and aspirin and ticlopidine - after coronary stenting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 1965 patients who underwent coronary stenting at 50 centers, 1653 (84.1 percent) met angiographic criteria for successful placement of the stent and were randomly assigned to one of three regimens: aspirin alone (557 patients), aspirin and warfarin (550 patients), or aspirin and ticlopidine (546 patients). All clinical events reflecting stent thrombosis were included in the prespecified primary end point: death, revascularization of the target lesion, angiographically evident thrombosis, or myocardial infarction within 30 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point was observed in 38 patients: 20 (3.6 percent) assigned to receive aspirin alone, 15 (2.7 percent) assigned to receive aspirin and warfarin, and 3 (0.5 percent) assigned to receive aspirin and ticlopidine (P=0.001 for the comparison of all three groups). Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 10 patients (1.8 percent) who received aspirin alone, 34 (6.2 percent) who received aspirin and warfarin, and 30 (5.5 percent) who received aspirin and ticlopidine (P<0.001 for the comparison of all three groups); the incidence of vascular surgical complications was 0.4 percent (2 patients), 2.0 percent (11 patients), and 2.0 percent (11 patients), respectively (P=0.01). There were no significant differences in the incidence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (overall incidence, 0.3 percent) among the three treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with aspirin alone and a combination of aspirin and warfarin, treatment with aspirin and ticlopidine resulted in a lower rate of stent thrombosis, although there were more hemorrhagic complications than with aspirin alone. After coronary stenting, aspirin and ticlopidine should be considered for the prevention of the serious complication of stent thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "In response to physiological stimuli (eg, wound healing), normally quiescent smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the vessel wall can be activated to migrate and proliferate to produce new blood vessels. In addition to this physiological response, pathological migration and proliferation within the vessel wall can occur in disease states. Examples of such disease states include tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, accelerated arteriopathy after cardiac transplantation, and neointimal proliferation after balloon angioplasty (PTCA) and stent placement. An important limitation of PTCA is restenosis, which is due in large part to luminal narrowing; restenosis occurs in 20% to 40% of patients within the first few months after a successful intervention.1,2 The percentage of patients that develop early restenosis after PTCA can be reduced by stent implantation. However, stents actually increase the amount of late luminal narrowing due to intimal hyperplasia,3 and the overall rate of stent restenosis remains unacceptably high (\u224830%).\n\nNumerous pharmacological agents, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors, and cytotoxic agents, have failed to adequately reduce restenosis after PTCA and stenting. Novel therapeutic approaches based on understanding the molecular mechanisms that cause intimal hyperplasia are needed to reduce the high incidence of stent restenosis. Arterial injury is associated with SMC activation and re-entry into the cell cycle. Multiple approaches to inhibiting SMC proliferation have been and are being evaluated. Gene delivery systems aimed at blocking SMC proliferation after PTCA have been tested4,5; however, the low efficiency and/or potential hazards of this approach may limit its usefulness. Radiation therapy has been evaluated in numerous studies and has shown considerable promise as a nonpharmacological, antiproliferative approach for the reduction of restenosis. However, significant side effects, including late stent thrombosis, may also limit its usefulness.6\u20138 The unusually late stent thrombosis seen in the patients treated with \u2026",

        "abstract": "Pour faire d\u2019une pierre deux coups1 \n\nHeart transplantation can now be routinely performed. Acute rejection has been significantly reduced, and the limitations to the use of this procedure include the availability of organs, chronic rejection, and a late reaction that is driven by a unique vasculopathy. Post-transplant vasculopathy (PTV) shares features with the lipoprotein-driven native atherosclerosis and proliferation-driven postangioplasty restenosis, but it has been thought to be more sensitive to immune forces. These distinctions are critical, for they dictate our choice of therapy. Hypercholesterolemia dictates treatments that lower lipoproteins or their effects; thrombotic events require antiplatelet agents, antithrombotics, and even agents that interfere with the clotting cascade; proliferative and migratory events can be inhibited by directed agents; and an immune disease would suggest use of immunosuppressants. To date, statins and immunosuppressants have been the mainstay of therapy for patients with heart transplants. These drugs were intended to simultaneously reduce rejection and post-transplant vasculopathy by limiting excessive lipid accumulation and exuberant inflammation. Recent reports, including the findings by Mancini et al2 reported in this issue of Circulation , suggest that although reduction in rejection may directly follow from direct control of the immune response, the same is not true for the vasculopathy. Vascular disease in heart transplant patients is effectively controlled by an agent classified as an immunosuppressant but not because of immune modulation, rather because of antiproliferative effects.2\n\nSee p 48 \n\nPTV is an aggressive and diffuse coronary arteriopathy that occurs in heart transplant recipients. With an annual incidence rate of 5% to 10% and an unremitting course, it is the major factor limiting long-term survival after heart transplantation. Because the donor heart is denervated, PTV often presents on routine follow-up angiographies or symptomatically as congestive heart failure and/or sudden death.

        "abstract": "Allogeneic hand transplantation is now a clinical reality. While results have been encouraging, acute rejection rates are higher than in their solid\u2010organ counterparts. In contrast, chronic rejections, as defined by vasculopathy and/or fibrosis and atrophy of skin and other tissues, as well as antibody mediated rejection, have not been reported in a compliant hand transplant recipient. Monitoring vascularized composite allograft (VCA) hand recipients for rejection has routinely involved punch skin biopsies, vascular imaging and graft appearance. Our program, which has transplanted a total of 6 hand recipients, has experience which challenges these precepts. We present evidence that the vessels, both arteries and veins may also be a primary target of rejection in the hand. Two of our recipients developed severe intimal hyperplasia and vasculopathy early post\u2010transplant. An analysis of events and our four other patients has shown that the standard techniques used for surveillance of rejection (i.e. punch skin biopsies, DSA and conventional vascular imaging studies) are inadequate for detecting the early stages of vasculopathy. In response, we have initiated studies using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) to evaluate the vessel wall thickness. These findings suggest that vasculopathy should be a focus of frequent monitoring in VCA of the hand.",

        "abstract": "Whereas vascularized composite allografts often undergo acute rejections early in the postgraft period, rejection manifesting with severe vascular changes (graft vasculopathy) has only been observed on three occasions in humans. We report a hand\u2010allografted patient who developed severe rejection following discontinuation of the immunosuppressive treatment. It manifested clinically with erythematous maculopapules on the skin and pathologically with graft vasculopathy that affected both large vessels and smaller cutaneous ones. The observation that graft vasculopathy can affect skin vessels shows that it is amenable to diagnosis with usual skin biopsy as recommended for the follow\u2010up of these allografts.

        "abstract": "Background Skin chronic rejection (CR) in vascularized composite allotransplantation has not been included in the Banff classification yet. We report a face-transplant patient who developed cutaneous clinicopathologic changes suggestive of CR. Methods The recipient was a 27-year-old man with severe disfigurement of the lower face due to a pyrotechnic explosion. He received a facial allograft, including mandible, cheeks, lips, and chin, in November 2009. Immunosuppression included antithymocyte globulins and bone-marrow infusion then steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Results During the first posttransplant year the acute rejection episodes were characterized by reversible oedema and erythema of the graft. Subsequently, the patient developed primary asymptomatic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, followed by EBV+ B-cell lymphoma and hepatic EBV-associated posttransplant smooth muscle tumors; therefore, the immunosuppressive treatment was greatly reduced. Since the second posttransplant year, the allografted facial skin became progressively sclerotic and presented pigmented macules on a background of hypopigmentation and teleangiectasias, resulting in a poikilodermatous aspect. Skin biopsies showed epidermal atrophy, basal cell vacuolization, and diffuse dermal sclerosis in the absence of significant dermal cell infiltration. The dermal capillaries showed thickened walls and narrowed lumina, whereas the large vessels did not show significant alterations. Neither donor-specific antibodies nor vascular Cd4 deposits were detected. A dysfunction of the graft functions occurred. It was evidenced by a decrease in mouth opening and modification of some phonemes although lip closure was still possible allowing food intake.

        "abstract": "Vascularized composite tissue allografts (VCA) have become a viable option to restore severely damaged parts of the body that cannot be repaired with conventional surgical techniques. Acute rejection develops frequently in the early postgraft period both in human and experimental VCA, but the possibility of human VCA to undergo chronic rejection (CR) remained initially unknown. The experience gained over the years shows that, similar to solid organ transplants (SOT), human VCA can also develop CR. Chronic rejection is clinically mostly apparent on the skin and targets preferentially skin and deep vessels, leading, as in SOT, to graft vasculopathy and often to graft loss. Dermal sclerosis and adnexal atrophy are additional features of CR. The pathogenetic immune mechanisms involved (cell-mediated versus humoral) remain incompletely known. The changes of CR can be detected with skin and deep tissue biopsies. Modern in vivo imaging tools can detect vascular narrowing and have the advantage of being noninvasive. However, the diagnosis and treatment of CR remain challenging, as several important questions remain to be answered: a more accurate definition of CR in VCA is needed to establish criteria allowing an accurate and early diagnosis. The pathogenetic mechanisms of CR need to be better understood to allow more efficacious treatment. Favoring/triggering factors of CR need to be better known so that they can be avoided. As in SOT, there is a need for efficient tolerance-inducing protocols that will favor graft acceptance and (ideally) circumvent the necessity of lifelong immunosuppression.",

Some months later, she developed several skin rejection episodes treated with steroid pulses. Despite rapid clinical improvement, some months later the sentinel skin graft underwent necrosis. Microscopic examination showed intimal thickening, thrombosis of the pedicle vessel, and C4d deposits on the endothelium of some dermal vessels of the facial graft. Flow magnetic resonance imaging of the facial graft showed a decrease of the distal right facial artery flow. Three steroid pulses of 500 mg each, followed by intravenous immunoglobulins (2 g/kg), five sessions of plasmapheresis, and three cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, were administered. Despite rescue therapy with eculizumab, necrosis of the lips and the perioral area occurred, which led to surgical removal of the lower lip, labial commissures, and part of the right cheek in May 2015.

Following informed consent and institutional review board approval, a partial face and double jaw transplantation was performed in a 25-year-old man who sustained ballistic facial trauma. Extensive team preparations, thorough patient evaluation, preoperative diagnostic imaging, three-dimensional printing technology, intraoperative surgical navigation, and the use of dual induction immunosuppression contributed to the success of the procedure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe procedure was performed on January 5 and 6, 2018, and lasted nearly 25 hours.

        "abstract": "Summary Over the past 15 years, landmark achievements have established facial transplantation (FT) as a feasible reconstructive option for otherwise irreparable craniofacial defects. However, as the field matures and long-term outcomes begin to emerge, FT teams around the world are now facing new challenges. Data for this review were identified by searches of the PubMed/MEDLINE database from inception through August 2020. All English-language articles pertaining to FT were included. Significant advances in candidate selection, technology, operative technique, posttransplant care, and immunosuppressive management have contributed to the tremendous expansion of the field, culminating in the execution in the past 3 years of 2 facial re-transplantations, and most recently the world\u2019s first successful combined face and double hand transplant in August 2020. Despite these achievements, the allograft donor pool remains limited, with long wait times, requiring surgical experimentation with cross-sex FT. Immunosuppressive management has improved, but significant adverse events continue to be reported. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on the healthcare system, with various implications for the practice of reconstructive transplantation. In this article, we provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date FT review, highlighting fundamental lessons learned and recent advancements, while looking toward the challenges ahead. Over the past 15 years, extensive multidisciplinary efforts have been instrumental to the establishment of FT as a feasible reconstructive option. As novel challenges are beginning to emerge, continued collaborative and multispecialty research efforts are needed to further this field.",

        "abstract": "Background: In properly selected patients, combined face and whole eye transplantation (FWET) may offer a more optimal aesthetic and potentially functional outcome while avoiding the complications and stigma of enucleation and prosthetics. This study presents the most comprehensive cadaveric assessment for FWET to date, including rehearsal allograft procurement on a brain-dead donor. Methods: Over a 2-year period, 15 rehearsal dissections were performed on 21 cadavers and one brain-dead donor. After identification of a potential recipient, rehearsals assessed clinical feasibility and enabled operative planning, technical practice, refinement of personalized equipment, and improved communication among team members. Operative techniques are described. Results: Facial allograft procurement closely followed previously described face transplant techniques. Ophthalmic to superficial temporal (O-ST) vessel anastomosis for globe survival was assessed. Craniectomy allowed for maximal optic nerve and ophthalmic vessel pedicle length. Appropriate pedicle length and vessel caliber for O-ST anastomosis was seen. Research procurement demonstrated collateral blood flow to the orbit and surrounding structures from the external carotid system as well as confirmed the feasibility of timely O-ST anastomosis. Personalized cutting guides enabled highly accurate bony inset. Conclusions: This study formalizes an approach to FWET, which is feasible for clinical translation in judiciously selected patients. O-ST anastomosis seems to minimize retinal ischemia time and allow perfusion of the combined allograft on a single external carotid pedicle. Although restoration of vision likely remains out of reach, globe survival is possible.",
