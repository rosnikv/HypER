        "title": "Stem Cell Therapy Is Proarrhythmic",
        "abstract": "Stem cell therapy appears to be a promising modality for myocardial repair of both hearts that are post myocardial infarction (MI) and those with other forms of structural cardiac disease (eg, congestive heart failure). In fact, recent experimental and clinical work has suggested that stem cell therapy contributes to cardiac regeneration. Unfortunately at this time, we contend that stem cell therapy is proarrhythmic. Accordingly, in this review we will approach this subject by restating this potential in the framework of traditional mechanisms of arrhythmias (automaticity and reentry). Lastly, we will address recent clinical work with stem cells, commenting on the proarrhythmic outcomes.\n\nBefore assessing the proarrhythmic potential of stem cells, we think it important to first address the nature of the players. After all, these \u201cplayers\u201d are the cells selected for use in trials.\n\n### Embryonic Stem Cells\n\nObviously, because this cell population has the capacity to develop into differentiated cardiac cells, these cells have been phenotyped in terms of ionic current makeup, intracellular Ca2+ handling, and connexin expression.1 Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) have been shown to have at least fast sodium current, L-type Ca2+ current, If, IK1,2,3 and immature excitation-contraction (EC) coupling.4 Thus, implanting them into damaged myocardium would mean implanting areas of additional excitable cells that presumably would form gap junctions not only with fellow ESCs but also with surviving myocytes of the damaged substrate. Evidence for resident cardiac stem cells5,6 has surfaced, and these excitable cells could show promise for use in stem cell therapy. For example, c-Kit+ cardiac-derived cells isolated from a normal rat heart when delivered via the aortic root seem to invade the infarcted myocardium and regenerate muscle to improve left ventricular (LV) function.7 Unfortunately, no mention was made of rhythm instability (or stability) of the injected \u2026",

        "title": "Growth Factor-Induced Mobilization of Cardiac Progenitor Cells Reduces the Risk of Arrhythmias, in a Rat Model of Chronic Myocardial Infarction",
        "abstract": "Heart repair by stem cell treatment may involve life-threatening arrhythmias. Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) appear best suited for reconstituting lost myocardium without posing arrhythmic risks, being commissioned towards cardiac phenotype. In this study we tested the hypothesis that mobilization of CPCs through locally delivered Hepatocyte Growth Factor and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 to heal chronic myocardial infarction (MI), lowers the proneness to arrhythmias. We used 133 adult male Wistar rats either with one-month old MI and treated with growth factors (GFs, n\u200a=\u200a60) or vehicle (V, n\u200a=\u200a55), or sham operated (n\u200a=\u200a18). In selected groups of animals, prior to and two weeks after GF/V delivery, we evaluated stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias by telemetry-ECG, cardiac mechanics by echocardiography, and ventricular excitability, conduction velocity and refractoriness by epicardial multiple-lead recording. Invasive hemodynamic measurements were performed before sacrifice and eventually the hearts were subjected to anatomical, morphometric, immunohistochemical, and molecular biology analyses. When compared with untreated MI, GFs decreased stress-induced arrhythmias and concurrently prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP) without affecting neither the duration of ventricular repolarization, as suggested by measurements of QTc interval and mRNA levels for K-channel \u03b1-subunits Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, nor the dispersion of refractoriness. Further, markers of cardiomyocyte reactive hypertrophy, including mRNA levels for K-channel \u03b1-subunit Kv1.4 and \u03b2-subunit KChIP2, interstitial fibrosis and negative structural remodeling were significantly reduced in peri-infarcted/remote ventricular myocardium. Finally, analyses of BrdU incorporation and distribution of connexin43 and N-cadherin indicated that cytokines generated new vessels and electromechanically-connected myocytes and abolished the correlation of infarct size with deterioration of mechanical function. In conclusion, local injection of GFs ameliorates electromechanical competence in chronic MI. Reduced arrhythmogenesis is attributable to prolongation of ERP resulting from improved intercellular coupling via increased expression of connexin43, and attenuation of unfavorable remodeling.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nAcute myocardial infarction (MI) leads to fibrosis and severe left ventricular wall thinning. Enhancing vascularization within the infarct reduces cell death and maintains a thick left ventricular wall, which is essential for proper cardiac function. Here, we evaluated the controlled delivery of thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24), which supports cardiomyocyte survival by inducing vascularization and upregulating Akt activity, in the treatment of MI.\n\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS\nWe injected collagen-chitosan hydrogel with controlled release of T\u03b24 into the infarct after performing left anterior descending artery ligation in rats.\n\n\nRESULTS\nT\u03b24-encapsulated hydrogel (thymosin) significantly reduced tissue loss post-MI (13 \u00b1 4%), compared with 58 \u00b1 3% and 30 \u00b1 8% tissue loss for no treatment (MI only) and T\u03b24-free hydrogel (control). Significantly more Factor VIII-positive blood vessels with diameter >50 \u00b5m were in the thymosin group compared with both MI only and control (p < 0.0001), showing T\u03b24-induced vascularization.

Since the only viable treatment option for end-stage heart failure is a heart transplant, cardiac tissue engineering emerged from the need to develop alternative sources and methods of replacing tissue damaged by cardiovascular diseases. This chapter discusses the design criteria for injectable biomaterials used in cardiac tissue engineering and for direct in vivo application as well as the biomolecules used to enhance these novel therapies. The challenges facing the field and future directions that must be taken to ensure successful development of biomaterial strategies for cardiac therapy are suggested.",

        "title": "pH-Sensitive Chitosan Hydrogel with Instant Gelation for Myocardial Regeneration",
        "abstract": "Recently in situ injectable hydrogels have received considerable attention to regenerate failure heart tissue after myocardial infarction (MI). But two criteria remain crucial: first, defining their chemical composition and structural parameters because they must be fabricated to withstand physiological condition while having high cell retention; second, providing the hydrogel with short gelation time to protect the cells from washout and extrusion in the injection site. In this study, two different pH-sensitive hydrogels with instant gelation in the presence of aqueous acetic acid (WH sample), and DMEM medium along with acetic acid (MH sample) were prepared. The morphology and structural and mechanical properties of the hydrogels were evaluated by SEM, FTIR and compressive strength test, respectively. Also, the equilibrium swelling ratio of each hydrogel and their degradation rate as a desirable property were also determined. MTT test confirmed that both hydrogels were biocompatible and non-toxic for human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hBMSCs) within 14 days as well as 31 and 36% cell growth during this time for WH and MH samples, respectively. The viability investigation of human Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hADSCs), tested by live/dead assay with Acridine Orange and Ethidium bromide staining, showed high cell survival and cell density increase during 1, 7, 14, 21 days. The overall results demonstrated that both in situ forming hydrogels are promising candidates for regeneration of the infarcted myocardium.",

        "title": "Injectable Nanocomposite Hydrogels of Gelatin-Hyaluronic Acid Reinforced with Hybrid Lysozyme Nanofibrils-Gold Nanoparticles for the Regeneration of Damaged Myocardium",
        "abstract": "Biopolymeric injectable hydrogels are promising biomaterials for myocardial regeneration applications. Besides being biocompatible, they adjust themselves, perfectly fitting the surrounding tissue. However, due to their nature, biopolymeric hydrogels usually lack desirable functionalities, such as antioxidant activity and electrical conductivity, and in some cases, mechanical performance. Protein nanofibrils (NFs), such as lysozyme nanofibrils (LNFs), are proteic nanostructures with excellent mechanical performance and antioxidant activity, which can work as nanotemplates to produce metallic nanoparticles. Here, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized in situ in the presence of LNFs, and the obtained hybrid AuNPs@LNFs were incorporated into gelatin-hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels for myocardial regeneration applications. The resulting nanocomposite hydrogels showed improved rheological properties, mechanical resilience, antioxidant activity, and electrical conductivity, especially for the hydrogels containing AuNPs@LNFs. The swelling and bioresorbability ratios of these hydrogels are favorably adjusted at lower pH levels, which correspond to the ones in inflamed tissues. These improvements were observed while maintaining important properties, namely, injectability, biocompatibility, and the ability to release a model drug. Additionally, the presence of AuNPs allowed the hydrogels to be monitorable through computer tomography. This work demonstrates that LNFs and AuNPs@LNFs are excellent functional nanostructures to formulate injectable biopolymeric nanocomposite hydrogels for myocardial regeneration applications.",

        "abstract": "Bioengineered composite hydrogel platforms made of a supramolecular coassembly have recently garnered significant attention as promising biomaterial-based healthcare therapeutics. The mechanical durability of amyloids, in conjunction with the structured charged framework rendered by biologically abundant key ECM component glycosaminoglycan, enables us to design minimalistic customized biomaterial suited for stimuli responsive therapy. In this study, by harnessing the heparin sulfate-binding aptitude of amyloid fibrils, we have constructed a pH-responsive extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking hydrogel matrix. This effective biocompatible platform comprising heparin sulfate-amyloid coassembled hydrogel embedded with polyphenol functionalized silver nanoparticles not only provide a native skin ECM-like conductive environment but also provide wound-microenvironment responsive on-demand superior antibacterial efficacy for effective diabetic wound healing. Interestingly, both the cytocompatibility and antibacterial properties of this bioinspired matrix can be fine-tuned by controlling the mutual ratio of heparin sulfate-amyloid and incubated silver nanoparticle components, respectively. The designed biomaterial platform exhibits notable effectiveness in the treatment of chronic hyperglycemic wounds infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria, because of the integration of pH-responsive release characteristics of the incubated functionalized AgNP and the antibacterial amyloid fibrils. In addition to this, the aforementioned assemblage shows exceptional hemocompatibility with significant antibiofilm and antioxidant characteristics. Histological evidence of the incised skin tissue sections indicates that the fabricated composite hydrogel is also effective in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNF\u03b1 expressions at the wound vicinity with significant upregulation of angiogenesis markers like CD31 and \u03b1-SMA.",
