        "title": "Clinical and hemorheological effects of buflomedil in diabetic subjects with intermittent claudication.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nChanges in blood rheology have been described in diabetes mellitus. Buflomedil, a vasoactive substance with hemorheological properties, has been widely used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of buflomedil on clinical and hemorheological parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes and intermittent claudication.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty patients were randomly assigned to oral buflomedil or matching placebo for six months in a double-blind manner. Initial and absolute walking distances were assessed by a standard treadmill testing protocol. Erythrocyte deformability was estimated with a whole blood filtration technique. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was assessed with an aggregation profiler. beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 were measured with radioimmunoassays. All tests were performed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant increase in the mean initial (71%) and absolute (68%) walking distance was achieved only in the buflomedil group. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in the buflomedil group, while no significant changes in erythrocyte deformability, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 levels were noticed. However, beta-thromboglobulin levels increased significantly in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest the therapeutic efficacy of buflomedil in diabetic subjects with intermittent claudication. The inhibition of platelet aggregation and the influence on platelet activity exerted by the drug could play an important role in its clinical effect and may be of value in the treatment of such patients.",

        "title": "Pharmacological interventions for peripheral artery disease",
        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) encompasses the vascular diseases caused primarily by atherosclerosis and thromboembolic pathophysiological processes that alter the normal structure and function of the aorta, its visceral arterial branches and the arteries of the upper and lower extremities. PAD is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The goals for pharmacological therapy in PAD should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk, improving walking distance and preventing critical limb ischaemia. Exercise training plays a key role in the therapeutic assessment, as well stopping smoking. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) should be given to every PAD patient if there are no contraindications. Neither their combination nor anticoagulant therapy has shown additional benefit in PAD patients. Several pharmacological agents have been developed to improve the functional state of the claudicant and to relieve the symptoms. Many studied drugs have shown either no, a small or a potential benefit. With future development of new drugs for PAD, there is an absolute need for very strict well-designed protocols in order to evaluate the claudication distance, the progression of the disease and the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. New developments should focus on improvement of endothelial function, vascular repair and enhancement of collateral circulation.",

        "abstract": "Signorelli et al in this issue of Angiology screened almost 3500 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 61.3 + 9.7 years) using the ankle brachial index (ABI) to detect unrecognized peripheral arterial disease (PAD). An ABI 0.9 was considered diagnostic. A total of 80 (2.3%) participants had unrecognized PAD. Of interest, among those individuals with unrecognized PAD, 5% (n 1\u20444 4) also had >75% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, whereas 12.5% (n 1\u20444 8) had an ejection fraction 30% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In multivariate analysis, an ABI 50% stenosis, whereas 2.7% had an occluded internal carotid artery. An ABI 3-fold increased risk for >50% carotid stenosis compared with individuals with an ABI >0.9 (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% CI, 1.04-10.93; P 1\u20444 .033). An ABI <0.9 in patients with asymptomatic PAD is not only a marker of generalized atherosclerosis but also a predictor of perioperative myocardial damage, should these patients undergo vascular surgery for an unrelated condition. The ABI was recorded in 627 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. In multivariate analysis, an asymptomatic ABI <0.9 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of perioperative myocardial damage (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2). Besides the ABI, several other markers/tests may reflect the presence of PAD. Examples include C-reactive protein (CRP) and functional photoplethysmograph technology using a noninvasive automated device. Both have the advantage that, unlike the ABI, they are less operator-dependent. Future studies should evaluate the prognostic significance of these variables in patients with PAD as well as their ability to identify unrecognized PAD. The identification of subclinical PAD holds implications for the timely initiation of preventive measures, namely smoking cessation, weight reduction, adoption of exercise, blood pressure and diabetes mellitus control, management of dyslipidemia, and antiplatelet treatment. Patients with PAD need to be closely monitored. The early diagnosis of PAD and the initiation of conservative measures is associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but also with several additional beneficial actions. For example, PAD is associated with the metabolic syndrome which requires treatment in its own right. Besides the management of dyslipidemia, routine statin treatment in patients with PAD is associated with an improvement in claudication, increased walking distance, and",

        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of atherosclerotic vascular disease and the incidence of infrapopliteal PAD continues to rise in the population. The historical experience with surgical and endovascular interventions for infrapopliteal stenosis was disappointing as operators experienced high rates of early technical failures and procedural complications, coupled with high rates of restenosis in this vascular territory when compared with more proximal vascular beds. While patients with infrapopliteal PAD may be asymptomatic, the majority would ultimately develop intermittent claudication or may also present with critical limb ischemia. In this article, we review the current literature, and discuss some of the technical aspects of endovascular therapy in this vascular bed. We also emphasize the importance of adjunctive evidence-based therapies such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and lifestyle modification such as smoking cessation in this particularly high-risk cohort to optimize clinical outcomes.",

        "title": "Effect of Rivaroxaban and Aspirin in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease Undergoing Surgical Revascularization: Insights From the VOYAGER PAD Trial",
        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Background: Patients with peripheral artery disease requiring lower extremity revascularization (LER) are at high risk of adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The VOYAGER PAD trial (Vascular Outcomes Study of ASA [Acetylsalicylic Acid] Along With Rivaroxaban in Endovascular or Surgical Limb Revascularization for PAD) demonstrated that rivaroxaban significantly reduced this risk. The efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described in patients who underwent surgical LER. Methods: The VOYAGER PAD trial randomized patients with peripheral artery disease after surgical and endovascular LER to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin or matching placebo plus aspirin and followed for a median of 28 months. The primary end point was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major vascular amputation, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular death. The principal safety outcome was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding. International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding was a secondary safety outcome. All efficacy and safety outcomes were adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. Results: Of the 6564 randomized, 2185 (33%) underwent surgical LER and 4379 (67%) endovascular. Compared with placebo, rivaroxaban reduced the primary end point consistently regardless of LER method (P-interaction, 0.43). After surgical LER, the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 199 (18.4%) patients in the rivaroxaban group and 242 (22.0%) patients in the placebo group with a cumulative incidence at 3 years of 19.7% and 23.9%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67\u20130.98]; P=0.026). In the overall trial, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding were increased with rivaroxaban. There was no heterogeneity for Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding (P-interaction, 0.17) or International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding (P-interaction, 0.73) on the basis of the LER approach. After surgical LER, the principal safety outcome occurred in 11 (1.0%) patients in the rivaroxaban group and 13 (1.2%) patients in the placebo group; 3-year cumulative incidence was 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.39\u20131.95]; P=0.75) Among surgical patients, the composite of fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.95) and postprocedural bleeding requiring intervention (P=0.93) was not significantly increased. Conclusions: The efficacy of rivaroxaban is associated with a benefit in patients who underwent surgical LER. Although bleeding was increased with rivaroxaban plus aspirin, the incidence was low, with no significant increase in fatal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or postprocedural bleeds requiring intervention.
