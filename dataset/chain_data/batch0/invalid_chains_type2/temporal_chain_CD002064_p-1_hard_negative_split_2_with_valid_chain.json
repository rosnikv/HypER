        "abstract": "Troglitazone (TGZ), an antidiabetic drug that improves insulin\u2010resistance in the peripheral tissues, was tested for neurotrophic activity in motoneurones and other neurones in culture. In rat motoneurones, TGZ had a remarkable effect on survival, which was comparable or superior to that of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor, a known potent neurotrophic factor for rat motoneurones. However, TGZ did not promote the survival of sensory, sympathetic, septal or hippocampal neurones. The effect of TGZ on motoneurones was additive to that of insulin\u2010like growth factor\u2010I and both activities were inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3\u2010kinase) inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, suggesting the involvement of the activation of PI3\u2010kinase in the activity of TGZ. Pioglitazone, another antidiabetic drug structurally similar to TGZ, did not show any activity, indicating that the agonistic activity of TGZ for peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 is not involved in the survival activity. Chromanol, an antioxidant moiety of TGZ, showed little or no survival activity. These results indicate specific neurotrophic activity of TGZ for motoneurones through the activation of PI3\u2010kinase and support the applicability of TGZ for the treatment of motor neurone diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is the target of the insulin sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glaucoma and other retinal disorders are some of the major complications in diabetes. In the present study, the role that PPAR-gamma ligands play in protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) against glutamate insult was explored.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTransformed rat RGC (RGC-5 cells) and two PPAR-gamma agonists, 15-deoxy-D(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone were used. RGC-5 cells were incubated with either of the PPAR-gamma ligands and were exposed to either L-glutamic acid or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Cell viability was determined with the neutral red dye uptake assay. Levels of PPAR-gamma receptor proteins were monitored by immunoblot analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGlutamate treatment resulted in RGC-5 cell death, and both 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone protected the RGC-5 cells from glutamate cytotoxicity. The neuroprotective concentrations of both compounds ranged from approximately 1 to 5 micro M. Troglitazone further protected against BSO toxicity, whereas 15d-PGJ2 did not. Glutamate treatment appears to exert its cytotoxicity through oxidative damage, because pretreatment of RGC-5 cells with the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and thiourea resulted in the reversal of glutamate cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the glutamate effect was not reversed by pretreatment with MK801 or DL-threo-betabenzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA), suggesting that glutamate cytotoxicity is not mediated through the NMDA receptor and/or glutamate transporter, respectively. Levels of PPAR-gamma receptor protein did not show any appreciable change in response to glutamate exposure, with or without 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTwo PPAR-gamma ligands, 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, protect RGC-5, an established transformed rat retinal ganglion cell line, against glutamate cytotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of the two compounds appear to be mediated through an antioxidant rather than a PPAR-gamma-dependent pathway. These results suggest that PPAR-gamma agonists, in addition to improving insulin sensitivity, may also provide a valuable antioxidant benefit that could prove valuable in targeting ocular complications including glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nApoptosis-related signaling pathways were investigated in a cultured rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC-5) line deprived of growth factors after serum withdrawal from the culture medium.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRGC-5 cells were subjected to serum deprivation for 2 to 6 days and compared with RGC-5 cells cultured in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell viability was determined by a neutral red dye uptake assay. Apoptosis of RGC-5 cells was established by DNA laddering. The expression of various apoptosis-related genes was investigated by immunoblot analysis, and or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The redox state of the cell was determined by biochemical methods, including NF-kappaB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) and mitochondrial damage by JC-1 (5,5', 6,6'-tetrachloro 1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide) staining, using live cell confocal microscopy and cytosolic release of cytochrome c.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty percent cell loss was evident after 2 days of serum deprivation, as demonstrated by neutral red dye uptake assay. This cell loss was due to apoptotic cell death, as established by DNA laddering. The oxidative state of serum-deprived RGC-5 cells was perturbed as suggested by the increase in malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in cell lysates. The apoptosis of the RGC-5 cells was associated with the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and increased levels of Bax with corresponding decreases in Bcl-2 levels and NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity. Serum deprivation was also associated with a loss of mitochondrial function, as revealed by cytosolic release of cytochrome c and JC-1 staining of mitochondria of dying RGC-5 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaken together, these results indicate that serum withdrawal induces apoptotic cell death in RGC-5 cells via mitochondrial pathways. These studies lead to the speculation that growth factor deprivation arising from blockade of retrograde transport of neurotrophins may involve similar mechanism(s) of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAxonal loss is thought to contribute to the persistence of visual loss in optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms of injury are poorly understood. The authors investigated the contribution of mitochondrial oxidative stress and the effects of modulating mitochondrial antioxidant gene expression in the optic nerves of mice induced with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), with a focus on long-term neuroprotection.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOptic nerves from mice with EAE were probed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the use of dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA), dihydroethidium, and cerium chloride. To modulate mitochondrial oxidative stress, recombinant AAV containing the human SOD2 gene or a ribozyme targeting murine SOD2 was injected into the vitreous. Control eyes received the recombinant virus without a therapeutic gene. Mice were sensitized for EAE and were monitored by serial contrast-enhanced MRI. The effects of SOD2 modulation on the EAE optic nerve were gauged by computerized analysis of optic nerve volume, myelin fiber area, and retinal ganglion cell loss at 1, 3, and 12 months after sensitization for EAE.\n\n\nRESULTS\nROS were detected in the EAE optic nerve as early as 3 days after antigenic sensitization. Colocalization suggested mitochondria as the source of ROS activity in the absence of inflammation. The ribozyme suppressing SOD2 gene expression increased myelin fiber injury by 27%. Increasing SOD2 levels twofold in the optic nerve by virally mediated gene transfer ameliorated myelin fiber injury by 51% and RGC loss fourfold, limiting it to 7% in EAE at 1 year.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmelioration of mitochondrial oxidative stress by SOD2 gene delivery may be a therapeutic strategy for suppressing neurodegeneration in optic neuritis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether delivery of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (SOD2) or the catalase gene (CAT) could rescue the retinal vascular damage induced by I/R in mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nI/R injury to the retina was induced in mice by elevating intraocular pressure for 2 hours, and reperfusion was established immediately afterward. One eye of each mouse was pretreated with plasmids encoding manganese superoxide dismutase or catalase complexed with cationic liposomes and delivered by intravitreous injection 48 hours before initiation of the procedure. Superoxide ion, hydrogen peroxide, and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein modifications were measured by fluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis 1 day after the I/R injury. At 7 days after injury, retinal vascular cell apoptosis and acellular capillaries were quantitated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSuperoxide ion, hydrogen peroxide, and 4-HNE protein modifications increased at 24 hours after I/R injury. Administration of plasmids encoding SOD2 or CAT significantly reduced levels of superoxide ion, hydrogen peroxide, and 4-HNE. Retinal vascular cell apoptosis and acellular capillary numbers increased greatly by 7 days after the injury. Delivery of SOD2 or CAT inhibited the I/R-induced apoptosis of retinal vascular cell and retinal capillary degeneration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDelivery of antioxidant genes inhibited I/R-induced retinal capillary degeneration, apoptosis of vascular cells, and ROS production, suggesting that antioxidant gene therapy might be a treatment for I/R-related disease.",

        "abstract": "Purposes: To investigate whether valproic acid (VPA) has a neuroprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the rat retina, and to elucidate the potential antioxidant mechanisms involved. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham (group A), sham\u2005plus\u2005VPA (group B), I/R\u2005plus\u2005vehicle (group C), and I/R\u2005plus\u2005VPA (group D). Retinal I/R injury was produced by inducing an exceedingly high intraocular pressure (IOP). Prior to insult, VPA was administered subcutaneously (300\u2009mg/kg twice daily) for 7 days, after which the animal was sacrificed. Levels of retinal malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined. Protein expressions of retinal poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and nitrotyrosine (NT) were analyzed by Western blotting 24\u2009h after injury. Apoptosis of retinal cells was evaluated 24\u2009h after I/R injury by immunofluorescence of activated caspase-3 in histological sections of retina. Seven days after reperfusion, electroretinography (ERG) was performed, and retinal histological changes were examined by light microscopy. Results: Following ischemia, the thickness of the entire retina, including the inner nuclear layer (INL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL), as well as the number of cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) were significantly greater in group D than in group C (p < 0.05). VPA suppressed I/R-induced reductions in ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes (p < 0.05). VPA attenuated I/R-induced activation of caspase-3 in ganglion cells and INL cells (p < 0.001). VPA significantly decreased MDA levels and increased activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in group D (p < 0.05). VPA attenuated activation of PAR and accumulation of NT in the retina after I/R (p < 0.01). Conclusions: VPA protects the retina from I/R injury by enhancing anti-oxidative effects and inhibiting apoptosis of retinal cells.",

        "abstract": "Retinal hypoxia and oxidative stress are involved in several retinal degenerations including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, central retinal artery occlusion, or retinopathy of prematurity. The second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) has been reported to be protective for neuronal cells under several pathological conditions including ischemia/hypoxia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the accumulation of cGMP through the pharmacological inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) with Zaprinast prevented retinal degeneration induced by mild hypoxia in cultures of porcine retina. Exposure to mild hypoxia (5% O2) for 24h reduced cGMP content and induced retinal degeneration by caspase dependent and independent (PARP activation) mechanisms. Hypoxia also produced a redox imbalance reducing antioxidant response (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) and increasing superoxide free radical release. Zaprinast reduced mild hypoxia-induced cell death through inhibition of caspase-3 or PARP activation depending on the cell layer. PDE inhibition also ameliorated the effects of mild hypoxia on antioxidant response and the release of superoxide radical in the photoreceptor layer. The use of a PKG inhibitor, KT5823, suggested that cGMP-PKG pathway is involved in cell survival and antioxidant response. The inhibition of PDE, therefore, could be useful for reducing retinal degeneration under hypoxic/ischemic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multi-system connective tissue disease characterized by the increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin. Although the pathogenesis is not completely understood, a number of studies suggest that free radicals could be the major contributors to the disease. Indeed, different studies demonstrated how oxidative stress could contribute to the fibrotic process activation at the level of the skin and visceral organs. Emerging evidences highlight the beneficial effects of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), which protects different cell lines from the cell damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These data make sildenafil a good candidate for therapeutic treatment aimed to protect biological macromolecules against oxidative damage, thus preserving cell viability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of SSc dermal fibroblasts to an oxidative insult and the ability for sildenafil to prevent/reduce the DNA damage due to ROS action. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity for sildenafil to influence redox homeostasis and cytotoxicity, as well as cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. We demonstrated that SSc fibroblasts have an increased sensitivity to a pro-oxidant environment in comparison to healthy controls. The sildenafil treatment reduced ROS-induced DNA damage, counteracted the negative effects of ROS on cell viability and proliferation, and promoted the activity of specific enzymes involved in redox homeostasis maintenance. To our knowledge, in this report, we demonstrate, for the first time, that sildenafil administration prevents ROS-induced instability in human dermal fibroblasts isolated by SSc patients. These results expand the use of PDE5i as therapeutic agents in SSc by indicating a protective role in tissue damage induced by oxidative insult.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a tissue that has recently been recognized for its ability to produce androgens under physiological conditions. The steroidogenesis process is known to be negatively influenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in reproductive Leydig and ovary cells, while their effect on muscle steroidogenesis is still an unexplored field. Muscle cells are continuously exposed to ROS, resulting from both their metabolic activity and the surrounding environment. Interestingly, the regulation of signaling pathways, induced by mild ROS levels, plays an important role in muscle fiber adaptation to exercise, in a process that also elicits a significant modulation in the hormonal response. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ROS could influence steroidogenesis in skeletal muscle cells by evaluating the release of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as the evaluation of the relative expression of the key steroidogenic enzymes 5\u03b1-reductase, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), 17\u03b2-HSD, and aromatase. C2C12 mouse myotubes were exposed to a non-cytotoxic concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a condition intended to reproduce, in vitro, one of the main stimuli linked to the process of homeostasis and adaptation induced by exercise in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the influence of tadalafil (TAD), a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) originally used to treat erectile dysfunction but often misused among athletes as a \u201cperformance-enhancing\u201d drug, was evaluated in a single treatment or in combination with H2O2. Our data showed that a mild hydrogen peroxide exposure induced the release of DHT, but not T, and modulated the expression of the enzymes involved in steroidogenesis, while TAD treatment significantly reduced the H2O2-induced DHT release. This study adds a new piece of information about the adaptive skeletal muscle cell response to an oxidative environment, revealing that hydrogen peroxide plays an important role in activating muscle steroidogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Musculoskeletal health is directly linked to independence and longevity, but disease and aging impairs muscle mass and health. Complete repair after a pathological or physiological muscle injury is critical for maintaining muscle function, yet muscle repair is compromised after disuse, or in conditions such as metabolic diseases, cancer, and aging. Regeneration of damaged tissue is critically dependent upon achieving the optimal function of satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MSCs). MSC remodeling in muscle repair is highly dependent upon its microenvironment, and metabolic health of MSCs, which is dependent on the functional capacity of their mitochondria. Muscle repair is energy demanding and mitochondria provide the primary source for energy production during regeneration. However, disease and aging induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which limits energy production during muscle regeneration. Nevertheless, the role of mitochondria in muscle repair likely extends beyond the production of ATP and mitochondria could provide potentially important regulatory signaling to MSCs during repair from injury. The scope of current research in muscle regeneration extends from molecules to exosomes, largely with the goal of understanding ways to improve MSC function. This review focuses on the role of mitochondria in skeletal muscle myogenesis/regeneration and repair. A therapeutic strategy for improving muscle mitochondrial number and health will be discussed as a means for enhancing muscle regeneration. Highlights: (a). Mitochondrial dysfunction limits muscle regeneration; (b). Muscle stem cell (MSC) function can be modulated by mitochondria; (c). Enhancing mitochondria in MSCs may provide a strategy for improving muscle regeneration after an injury.",

Intramuscular injections of allogeneic mitochondria obtained from healthy animals into the hind limbs of mdx mice alleviated skeletal muscle injury, reduced calcium deposits in muscles and serum creatine kinase levels, and improved the grip strength of the hind limbs and motor activity of recipient mdx mice. We noted normalization of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and sarcoplasmic reticulum/mitochondria interactions in mdx muscles. At the same time, we revealed a decrease in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle mitochondria of recipient mdx mice accompanied by a reduction in lipid peroxidation products (MDA products) and reduced calcium overloading. We found no effect of MTT on the expression of mitochondrial signature genes (Drp1, Mfn2, Ppargc1a, Pink1, Parkin) and on the level of mtDNA.
