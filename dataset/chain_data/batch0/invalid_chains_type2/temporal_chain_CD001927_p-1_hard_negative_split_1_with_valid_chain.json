        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNonrheumatic atrial fibrillation is common among the elderly and is associated with an increased risk of stroke. We investigated whether anticoagulation with warfarin would reduce this risk.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate low-intensity anticoagulation with warfarin (prothrombin-time ratio, 1.2 to 1.5) in 571 men with chronic nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation; 525 patients had not previously had a cerebral infarction, whereas 46 patients had previously had such an event. The primary end point was cerebral infarction; secondary end points were cerebral hemorrhage and death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the patients with no history of stroke, cerebral infarction occurred in 19 of the 265 patients in the placebo group during an average follow-up of 1.7 years (4.3 percent per year) and in 4 of the 260 patients in the warfarin group during an average follow-up of 1.8 years (0.9 percent per year). The reduction in risk with warfarin therapy was 0.79 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.90; P = 0.001). The annual event rate among the 228 patients over 70 years of age was 4.8 percent in the placebo group and 0.9 percent in the warfarin group (risk reduction, 0.79; P = 0.02). The only cerebral hemorrhage occurred in a 73-year-old patient in the warfarin group. Other major hemorrhages, all gastrointestinal, occurred in 10 patients: 4 in the placebo group, for a rate of 0.9 percent per year, and 6 in the warfarin group, for a rate of 1.3 percent per year. There were 37 deaths that were not preceded by a cerebral end point--22 in the placebo group and 15 in the warfarin group (risk reduction, 0.31; P = 0.19). Cerebral infarction was more common among patients with a history of cerebral infarction (9.3 percent per year in the placebo group and 6.1 percent per year in the warfarin group) than among those without such a history.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow-intensity anticoagulation with warfarin prevented cerebral infarction in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation without producing an excess risk of major hemorrhage. This benefit extended to patients over 70 years of age.",

        "title": "Optimal oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and recent cerebral ischemia.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of oral anticoagulant therapy in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. However, both the targeted and the actual levels of anticoagulation differed widely among the studies, and a number of studies failed to report standardized prothrombin-time ratios as international normalized ratios (INRs). We therefore performed an analysis to determine the intensity of oral anticoagulant therapy in nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation that provides the best balance between the prevention of thromboembolism and the occurrence of bleeding complications.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe calculated INR-specific incidence rates for both ischemic and major hemorrhagic events occurring in 214 patients who received anticoagulant therapy in the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial, a secondary-prevention trial in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and a recent episode of minor cerebral ischemia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe optimal intensity of anticoagulation was found to lie between an INR of 2.0 and an INR of 3.9. No treatment effect was apparent with anticoagulation below an INR of 2.0. The rate of thromboembolic events was lowest at INRs from 2.0 to 3.9, and most major bleeding complications occurred with treatment at intensities with INRs of 5.0 or above.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo achieve optimal levels of anticoagulation with the lowest risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent episode of cerebral ischemia, the target value for the INR should be set at 3.0, and values below 2.0 and above 5.0 should be avoided.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe outcomes of an inception cohort of patients seen at an anticoagulation clinic (AC) were published previously. The temporary closure of this clinic allowed the evaluation of 2 more inception cohorts: usual medical care and an AC.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare newly anticoagulated patients who were treated with usual medical care with those treated at an AC for patient characteristics, anticoagulation control, bleeding and thromboembolic events, and differences in costs for hospitalizations and emergency department visits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRates are expressed as percentage per patient-year. Patients treated at an AC who received lower-range anticoagulation had fewer international normalized ratios greater than 5.0 (7.0% vs 14.7%), spent more time in range (40.0% vs 37.0%), and spent less time at an international normalized ratio greater than 5 (3.5% vs 9.8%). Patients treated at an AC who received higher-range anticoagulation had more international normalized ratios within range (50.4% vs 35.0%), had fewer international normalized ratios less than 2.0 (13.0% vs 23.8%), and spent more time within range (64.0% vs 51.0%). The AC group had lower rates (expressed as percentage per patient-year) of significant bleeding (8.1% vs 35.0%), major to fatal bleeding (1.6% vs 3.9%), and thromboembolic events (3.3% vs 11.8%); the AC group also demonstrated a trend toward a lower mortality rate (0% vs 2.9%; P= .09). Significantly lower annual rates of warfarin sodium-related hospitalizations (5% vs 19%) and emergency department visits (6% vs 22%) reduced annual health care costs by $132086 per 100 patients. Additionally, a lower rate of warfarin-unrelated emergency department visits (46.8% vs 168.0%) produced an additional annual savings in health care costs of $29 72 per 100 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA clinical pharmacist-run AC improved anticoagulation control, reduced bleeding and thromboembolic event rates, and saved $162058 per 100 patients annually in reduced hospitalizations and emergency department visits.",

        "title": "A Multicomponent Intervention To Prevent Major Bleeding Complications in Older Patients Receiving Warfarin",
        "abstract": "Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use, especially in older patients. Older people are widely thought to be at increased risk for warfarin-related bleeding (1-8), and they are less likely to be treated with warfarin, even when it has been proven efficacious, in part because of concern about risk for bleeding (9-13). Efforts that reduce the frequency of major warfarin-related bleeding not only will increase the net benefit of therapy but also will facilitate more appropriate and widespread use of warfarin therapy in older patients. Methods for identifying patients at highest risk for bleeding have recently advanced (5-7, 14-21), and experience with specialized programs that coordinate the management of anticoagulant therapy suggests that clinical outcomes may be improved (6, 14, 18, 22-27). However, there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding. We developed a multicomponent comprehensive program for management of warfarin therapy aimed at improving control of the anticoagulant effect and reducing events (such as use of an interacting medicine) that might precipitate bleeding. We hypothesized that this intervention would be acceptable to most elderly persons starting warfarin therapy and would reduce the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding. Methods Patients Patients hospitalized at University Hospitals of Cleveland, a 900-bed teaching hospital, between September 1992 and October 1995 who were 65 years of age or older and were receiving 10 000 units or more of intravenous unfractionated heparin every 24 hours were screened daily. Of these patients, we identified 426 persons who were 65 years of age or older, who resided in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and for whom treatment with warfarin was planned for 10 or more days (Figure 1). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with warfarin at any time during the previous 6 months, were admitted from a nursing home, were enrolled in another clinical trial, were too ill to give consent and had no available surrogate, were discharged prematurely, or did not speak English; if their private physician refused to participate; or if no random allocation was taking place (for example, during vacations or holidays). Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age, ethnicity, sex, or indication for therapy. Figure 1. Eligibility and random assignment of patients. Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index (20). This index includes four independent risk factors for major bleeding: age 65 years or older, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, history of stroke, and one or more of four specific comorbid conditions (recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit<30%, creatinine concentration>133 mol/L [1.5 mg/dL], or diabetes mellitus). Patients with one or two risk factors were classified as intermediate risk, and those with three or more risk factors were classified as high risk; estimated frequencies of major bleeding in 6 months were 6% and 35%, respectively. After stratification, patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care or intervention. Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups, and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group. This method, initially proposed by Zelen (28), allows the study to test the effectiveness of offering the intervention rather than simply the efficacy of the intervention in patients who consent to participation before random assignment. The sample size was calculated to provide 80% power and an level of 0.05. The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital's institutional review board. Intervention The intervention had two main components. The first component consisted of a guideline-based consultation that assessed the patient's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding. We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding during hospitalization (27). Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were made and implemented. The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio (INR) testing after hospital discharge. The second component included patient education, coaching, and self-monitoring of prothrombin time; this component was grounded in social learning theory (29-31) and experimental evidence (32, 33) showing that increasing participation of patients in their care can improve clinical outcomes but that increasing patient knowledge alone is insufficient (34, 35). Patient education consisted of one-on-one teaching by a lay educator using a specifically formatted workbook for older adults to teach them about warfarin, indications for its use, drug and food interactions, and the signs and symptoms of bleeding. The lay educator reviewed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training. Coaching was aimed to increase patients' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills. Patients were trained and encouraged to communicate more effectively with physicians and other health personnel about a range of issues, such as health concerns, drug interactions, or changes in lifestyle or diet. Finally, patients were taught to self-monitor the prothrombin time by using a home portable monitor (Coumatrak Protime Test System, Biotrack, Inc., Mountain View, California). The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy (36-38). Patients were initially assessed, educated, and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour. They were seen daily while hospitalized, warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed, and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed. Within 3 days of discharge from the hospital, the lay educator or study investigator made a home visit to assess patients' use of the portable monitor and to check the prothrombin time. In general, patients were instructed to check their prothrombin time three times during the first week after hospital discharge, weekly for the remainder of the first month, and monthly thereafter depending on their results. Patients phoned in their results to the coach, who reviewed the results with one of the investigators and provided same-day follow-up, including recommendations for dose and subsequent INR testing. Patients were instructed to call whenever they had questions or concerns about their warfarin management or possible side effects, if they were hospitalized for any reason, or if they began receiving new medications. After the 6-month intervention period, management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients' personal physicians. Patients assigned to usual care received medical care, including management, dosing, and medical information, according to the discretion and practices of their personal physician. Data Collection Trained abstractors who were not involved with the intervention component of the study collected data from the medical chart at the start of anticoagulant therapy; at each subsequent hospitalization; and by blinded interview at enrollment and 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment and every 6 months thereafter. Data elements included demographic characteristics, clinical history including comorbid diagnoses, indications for therapy, potential risk factors for bleeding, functional status, and new illnesses or comorbid conditions that developed after enrollment. Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview. Whenever an event was reported, the clinical characteristics of the bleeding or thromboembolic episode were determined by review of the relevant medical record and abstracted without identifying patient information onto a standard form. All dates of death were confirmed by death certificates, and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records. Follow-up was complete for all patients. End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period. Using explicit criteria in the Bleeding Severity Index (39) for the amount, rate, and consequences of bleeding, we defined major bleeding as overt bleeding that led to the loss of at least 2.0 units of blood in 7 days or less or was otherwise life-threatening (for example, intracranial bleeding). Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or randomization status. Two author-reviewers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events; their agreement was high ( statistic, 0.97). Secondary outcomes were death and recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6 months; major bleeding after 6 months; and control of anticoagulant therapy during the first 6 months of therapy, as measured by the INR. The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications (40). Therapeutic quality control was assessed by using the patient-time approach, described by Rosendaal and colleagues (41), for three time periods after discharge from the hospital: 0 to 1 month, 1 to 3 months, and 3 to 6 months of therapy. This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured, assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs.

        "title": "Should patients manage their own oral anticoagulation therapy",
        "abstract": "Oral anticoagulant therapy has become more commonly prescribed for people of 65 years and over following the widening of its clinical indications to include thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation.1 It is estimated that approximately 470 000 people in the UK, almost 1% of the population, are currently receiving oral anticoagulant therapy and this is growing. Due to its narrow therapeutic index and the intra-individual variation in dose requirement, there is a need to monitor the level of anticoagulation in each patient. In consequence, health systems have had to invest resources into monitoring services to cope with this development. Degree of anticoagulation is measured using the International Normalised Ratio (INR) of the prothrombin time (PT). Patients have, until recently, been monitored and managed by their local general practitioner or at specialized hospitalbased anticoagulation clinics. More recently, availability of small portable devices has enabled patient selfmonitoring of anticoagulation and, following adequate education, self-adjustment of dose. This has enabled patients to have more control over frequency of monitoring and become more actively involved in managing their treatment. When portable monitors were first introduced, the initial research focused on their accuracy in comparison with routine laboratory measurements and whether patients found home monitors acceptable to use. These studies confirmed a high degree of similarity between home tests and clinic tests.2,3,4 Studies to establish their clinical role were then undertaken.

        "title": "Preoperative Warfarin Reversal for Early Hip Fracture Surgery",
        "abstract": "Purpose. To evaluate our hospital protocol of low-dose vitamin K titration for preoperative warfarin reversal for early hip fracture surgery. Methods. Records of 16 men and 33 women aged 63 to 93 (mean, 81) years who were taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation (n=40), venous thromboembolism (n=9), cerebrovascular accident (n=3), and prosthetic heart valve (n=3) and underwent surgery for hip fractures were reviewed. The 3 patients with a prosthetic heart valve were deemed high risk for thromboembolism and the remainder low-risk. The international normalised ratio (INR) of patients was checked on admission and 6 hours after administration of vitamin K; an INR of <1.7 was considered safe for surgery. Results. No patient developed venous thromboembolism within one year. The 30-day and one-year mortality was 8.2% and 32.6%, respectively. For the 46 low-risk patients, the mean INR on admission was 2.6 (range, 1.1\u20134.6) and decreased to <1.7 after a mean of 2.2 (range, 0\u20134) administrations of 2 mg of vitamin K. Their INR was <1.7 within 18 hours (mean, 14 hours). 78% of patients underwent surgery within 36 hours. In the 22% of patients who did not undergo surgery within 36 hours, the delay was due to insufficient operative time or the patient being medically unfit for surgery. The 3 high-risk patients underwent bridging therapy of low-molecular-weight heparin and received no vitamin K; their mean INR on admission was 3.2 (range, 3.1\u20133.3) and the mean time to surgery was 5.3 (range, 3\u20138) days. Two low-risk patients and one high-risk patient died within 5 days of surgery. Conclusion. The low-dose intravenous vitamin K protocol is safe and effective in reversing warfarin within 18 hours.

Methods A retrospective cohort study of 1743 hip fracture patients was undertaken. All patients admitted taking warfarin were identified. These patients were then matched to nonwarfarinised patients using nearest neighbour propensity score matching, accounting for age, sex, hip fracture type, and Nottingham Hip Fracture Score. A pre-guideline group (no standardised warfarin reversal regimen) and a post-guideline group (standardised regimen) were identified. Outcomes assessed included time to INR less than 1.7, time to theatre, length of stay, and 30-day and 1-year mortality. Results Forty-six warfarinised hip fracture patients were admitted in the pre-guideline group (mean age 80.5, F:M 3:1) and 48 in the post-guideline group (mean age 81.2 years, F:M 3:1). Post-guideline patients were reversed to a safe operative INR level within 18 hours of admission, decreasing the time to first dose vitamin K (p<0.001). 70% of warfarinised patients were operated upon within 36 hours, compared to 19.6% with no regimen (p<0.05). After anticoagulation reversal protocol, thirty-day mortality decreased from 15.2% to 8.3% and 1-year mortality from 43.5% to 33% for warfarinised patients, which is comparable to nonwarfarinised matched patients. There was no significant change in the length of stay pre- and post-guideline for both groups of patients.

        "abstract": "Objectives: To determine the time to surgery (TTS) among patients with acute hip fracture who are anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) who receive prothrombic complex concentrate (PCC) compared to those who do not receive PCC.Method: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with an acute hip fracture presenting to the emergency department (ED) of the Jewish General Hospital, a 637-bed tertiary care hospital center in Montreal, Quebec, between January 1st, 2015 and March 1st, 2020. Eligible patients were identified via the ED electronic database. Inclusion criteria were: (1) > 18 years of age; (2) acute hip fracture and admission for surgical repair; (3) VKA use and international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 at admission. Follow-up was limited to index hospitalization. The primary outcome of TTS, reported in hours, was defined as the time from hospital admission to the time of surgery. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess any difference in median TTS between the two groups.\nResults: A total of 53 patients were included in our cohort of which 43.4% (23/53) received PCC with a median time to first dose of 25.5 hours (IQR 19.4-51.6). 84.9 % (45/53) received vitamin K with a median time to the first dose of 16 h (IQR 7.5-26.7).

Median TTS in both groups surpassed the recommended 48h benchmark, and PCC and vitamin K administration timing was suboptimal.

Les crit\u00e8res d\u2019inclusion sont : 1) personne \u00e2g\u00e9e de plus de 18 ans; 2) fracture aigu\u00eb de la hanche et hospitalisation en vue d\u2019une r\u00e9paration chirurgicale; 3) prise d\u2019AVK et rapport international normalis\u00e9 (RIN) sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 1,5 lors de l\u2019admission \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Le suivi se limite \u00e0 l\u2019admission initiale. Le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation principal du DAIC, indiqu\u00e9 en heures, est d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant le d\u00e9lai entre l\u2019admission \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital et le moment de l\u2019intervention chirurgicale. Le test U de Mann-Whitney est utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer toute diff\u00e9rence dans les DAIC m\u00e9dians entre les deux groupes.\nR\u00e9sultats: Au total, 53\u00a0patients font partie de la cohorte dont 43,4\u00a0% (23/53) ont re\u00e7u le CCP, le d\u00e9lai m\u00e9dian avant la premi\u00e8re dose \u00e9tant de 25,5\u00a0heures (\u00e9cart interquartile [EI] de 19,4 \u00e0 51,6), et 84,9\u00a0% (45/53) ont re\u00e7u de la vitamine\u00a0K, le d\u00e9lai m\u00e9dian avant la premi\u00e8re dose \u00e9tant de 16\u00a0heures (EI de 7,5 \u00e0 26,7). Le DAIC m\u00e9dian est de 51,8\u00a0heures (EI de 26,8 \u00e0 71,4) pour le groupe recevant le CCP et de 63,5\u00a0heures (EI de 49,4 \u00e0 73,2) pour celui ne recevant pas le CCP (p\u00a0=\u00a00,71).\nConclusion: Cette \u00e9tude r\u00e9v\u00e8le une tendance vers des DAIC plus courts chez les patients recevant le CCP que chez ceux qui ne le re\u00e7oivent pas. Le DAIC m\u00e9dian dans les deux groupes est sup\u00e9rieur au d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence recommand\u00e9 de 48\u00a0 heures, et le moment o\u00f9 le CCP et la vitamine\u00a0 K sont administr\u00e9s est sous-optimal. Ces constatations montrent une lacune importante en mati\u00e8re de soins chez cette population vuln\u00e9rable et repr\u00e9sentent un appel \u00e0 des initiatives visant \u00e0 assurer une approche simplifi\u00e9e et multidisciplinaire de la prise en charge de l\u2019anticoaguloth\u00e9rapie qui commence d\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e du patient \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital.",
