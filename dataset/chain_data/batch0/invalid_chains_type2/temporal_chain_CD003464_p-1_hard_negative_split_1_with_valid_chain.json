        "title": "Warfarin Therapy for an Octogenarian Who Has Atrial Fibrillation",
        "abstract": "An 80-year-old man with a 4-year history of atrial fibrillation has hypertension and occasional lower back and knee pain, but he feels well overall. He does not drink or smoke. He has had echocardiography but has never undergone a trial of cardioversion. Except for an irregularly irregular pulse at a rate of 90 beats/min and crepitus of his knees, the patient's physical examination is unremarkable. His mental function is good, with a score of 28 (out of 30) on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (1). Benefits and Risks of Prescribing Warfarin in an Elderly Patient Who Has Atrial Fibrillation What Are the Benefits of Prescribing Warfarin? In a recent meta-analysis of the atrial fibrillation trials, Hart and colleagues (2) found that compared with no antithrombotic therapy, adjusted-dose warfarin prevents 62% of strokes and aspirin prevents 22% of strokes. How these relative risk reductions translate into absolute benefit depends on the underlying risk for stroke. The stroke risk, in turn, depends on the presence or absence of specific comorbid conditions: previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease (including mitral stenosis and heart failure), and advanced age (3-5). The patient described here is very elderly and has hypertension. The incidence of stroke in this patient would be at least 4% per year without antithrombotic therapy (3, 5), even if his echocardiogram is normal. Aspirin reduces this annual rate to approximately 3.6% (6), while warfarin would reduce it to less than 2% per year (2). Although data from available clinical trials were primarily collected from patients who were younger than 80 years of age, a recent observational study suggests that warfarin also benefits octogenarians who have atrial fibrillation (7). Although warfarin is likely to benefit patients who have an annual stroke rate of 4% or greater, the net benefit will depend on the risk for hemorrhage and on personal preferences (8). We focus on these two factors before deciding whether to offer warfarin therapy. What Are the Risks of Prescribing Warfarin? The major risk of warfarin therapy is hemorrhage. The risk for serious hemorrhage increases with the following factors: recent hemorrhage, alcoholic binge drinking, renal insufficiency, liver disease, use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and cancer (9-13). Additional risk factors for hemorrhage may include advanced age, thrombocytopenia, previous stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, and nonwhite ethnicity (9-11, 14). Thus, this patient's only identifiable risk factor for hemorrhage is advanced age. Although there are exceptions (15-17), many investigators have found that older patients who receive warfarin have higher rates of major hemorrhage than do younger patients taking the same regimens (9, 11, 14, 18-21). In the atrial fibrillation trials, the annual rate of major hemorrhage averaged 1.4% for patients who were randomly assigned to adjusted-dose warfarin therapy (3, 22). Because this patient is an octogenarian and is not part of a clinical trial, his annual risk for major hemorrhage with warfarin therapy would be approximately 3% to 4% (14, 15)nearly 3% (per year) higher than the 0.5% (6) to 1% (3) annual rate of major hemorrhage associated with aspirin therapy. The patient is currently taking low-dose aspirin, digoxin, and extended-release nifedipine; he has never received warfarin. We discuss the risks and benefits of substituting warfarin therapy with him, including the need for regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR). We order baseline testing of INR, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and measurement of digoxin level. We arrange to obtain his old medical records. The patient returns for follow-up 1 week later. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg; his pulse is 95 beats/min and irregularly irregular. The remainder of his physical examination is unremarkable. His old medical records reveal previous screening flexible sigmoidoscopy and measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone level, both of which yielded normal findings. The patient's new laboratory test results are normal except for a slightly elevated creatinine level. His previous echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normal cardiac valves, and a slightly enlarged left atrium. How Should the Risk and Benefits of Prescribing Warfarin Be Weighed in the Setting of Atrial Fibrillation? For this patient, who has a 4% stroke risk without antithrombotic therapy and a 3% to 4% risk for hemorhage with warfarin, warfarin is likely to prolong his quality-adjusted survival by approximately 0.1 quality-adjusted life-year more than aspirin would (22). However, this estimate is sensitive to the patient's preferences (8). We begin to explore the patient's preferences by summarizing the benefits and risks of warfarin therapy as compared to aspirinwarfarin would reduce his stroke rate by 2% per year and increase his rate of major hemorrhage by 2% to 3% per year. After discussion, the patient understands that a stroke is usually much more debilitating than a hemorrhage, and he chooses to take warfarin and undergo regular INR monitoring. What Items Should Be Discussed with a Patient Who Is Starting Warfarin Therapy? We review topics on a checklist (Table) and provide the patient with written material from one of the manufacturers of warfarin. Table. Checklist of Information To Review with Patients When Prescribing Warfarin What INR Should Be Targeted in This 80-Year-Old Man with Atrial Fibrillation? Five recent randomized, controlled trials (23-27) support guidelines that recommend a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 (28-30). The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III investigators (23) found a 1.9% rate of stroke and systemic embolism in 523 high-risk participants randomly assigned to adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR, 2.0 to 3.0) and a 7.9% rate in participants randomly assigned to a combination of mini-dose warfarin (target INR, 1.2 to 1.5) and aspirin (325 mg). In a smaller study, Pengo and colleagues (24) also found a significantly lower stroke rate in participants randomly assigned to warfarin adjusted to an INR of 2 to 3 rather than to mini-dose warfarin. In contrast, three other small randomized, controlled trials found no statistically significant advantage to targeting INRs greater than 2.0 rather than lower levels of anticoagulation (25-27). When taken together, however, these three studies suggest that warfarin therapy adjusted to an INR greater than 2.0 is associated with a 33% relative risk reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke compared with mini-dose warfarin: Twelve strokes occurred in the 356 patients randomly assigned to have an INR greater than 2.0, whereas 18 strokes occurred in the 349 patients assigned to have a lower INR. On the basis of these five trials and other important studies (31-33), we conclude that the optimal INR for patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is at least 2.0; the optimal INR remains controversial, especially in an 80-year-old patient (34). For this patient, we choose a target INR of 2.5. Rate Control and Rhythm Control in Atrial Fibrillation Should Digoxin Therapy Be Continued for This Patient? Digoxin does not reliably control ventricular response during exertion in patients who have atrial fibrillation (35-37). For this patient, who has left ventricular hypertrophy and a heart rate of 95 beats/min, we discontinue digoxin and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker therapies and prescribe atenolol instead (37) . Should This Patient Undergo Cardioversion? Compared with a younger, symptomatic patient with new-onset atrial fibrillation, this octogenarian with chronic atrial fibrillation has relatively little to gain from electrical or chemical cardioversion (35, 36). He is already asymptomatic, and attempted cardioversion would probably fail because sinus rhythm becomes increasingly difficult to restore and maintain with advancing age and longer duration of atrial fibrillation (36, 38, 39). On the basis of this information, we elect not to pursue cardioversion at this time. Initiation of Warfarin Therapy When Initiating Warfarin Therapy, What Dose Should Be Prescribed? Most patients can start warfarin therapy with a 5-mg dose: Randomized trials have found that patients were more likely to have a therapeutic INR 3 to 5 days after starting warfarin therapy with a 5-mg rather than a 10-mg dose (39-41) because the higher dose often led to high INRs (40-42). The patient begins warfarin therapy with a single 5-mg dose. Because advanced age is associated with lower steady-state warfarin dose requirements (43-46), an octogenarian who begins warfarin therapy with a 5-mg dose should have his daily dose based on the INR response measured during the first days of therapy. Other factors known to be associated with lower steady-state warfarin dose requirements include mutations in the cytochrome P450 isozymes (47-49), low body weight (45, 50), low serum albumin level (51), cardiac failure (46), liver disease (52), or concomitant use of certain medications (53). In patients who are very elderly or who have one or more of these factors, many experts initiate warfarin therapy with an initial dose of 2 to 4 mg rather than 5 mg (54-56). Twenty hours after the 5-mg dose, the patient's INR is 1.25. After Giving the First Warfarin Dose, How Is the Next Dose Selected? The second dose should be selected cautiously: The primary concern is giving too high a dose, causing the INR to increase to 5 or more. Successful dosing requires letting sufficient time pass between the first dose of warfarin and the subsequent INR measurement and selecting doses of warfarin tailored to the increase in INR. The common practice of administering warfarin in the evening and measuring INR in the early morning does not allow sufficient time for the warfarin effect to become manif",

        "abstract": "The incidence of severe sepsis increases dramatically with advanced age, with a mortality rate that approaches 50%. The main purpose of this investigation was to determine both short- and long-term survival outcomes among 386 patients aged >or=75 years who were enrolled in the Protein C Worldwide Evaluation of Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) trial. Subjects who were treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated; DAA) had absolute risk reductions in 28-day and in-hospital mortality of 15.5% and 15.6%, respectively (P=.002 for both), compared with placebo recipients. The relative risk (RR) for 28-day mortality was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.87), and the in-hospital RR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.88). Resource use and patient disposition for DAA-treated patients compared favorably with those for placebo recipients. In addition, long-term follow-up data were available for 375 subjects (97.2%), and survival rates for DAA recipients were significantly higher over a 2-year period (P=.02). The incidences of serious adverse bleeding during the 28-day study period in the DAA and placebo groups were 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively (P=.34). There was no interaction between age and bleeding rates (P=.97). In conclusion, older patients with severe sepsis have higher short- and long-term survival rates when treated with DAA than when treated with placebo but an increased risk of serious bleeding that is not aged related.",

        "abstract": "Summary Prostacyclin (PGI2) has beneficial cytoprotective properties, is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and has been reported to improve microcirculatory blood flow during sepsis. The formation of PGI2 in response to proinflammatory cytokines is catalysed by the inducible cyclooxygenase (COX) isoform COX-2. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC, drotrecogin alfa (activated)) was shown to have multiple biological activities in vitro and to promote resolution of organ dysfunction in septic patients. Whether rhAPC exerts its beneficial effects by modulating prostanoid generation is unknown up to now. It was therefore the aim of the study to examine the in vitro effect of rhAPC on COX-2-mRNA-expression and PGI2 release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We found that rhAPC, at supra-therapeutical concentrations (500ng/ml-20\u03bcg/ ml), upregulated the amount of COX-2-mRNA in HUVEC at t=3\u20139h and caused a time- and dose-dependent release of 6-keto PGF1\u03b1, the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin. RhAPC further increased the stimulating effect of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and thrombin on COX-2-mRNA-levels. Transcript levels of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and prostagland-in I2 synthase, however, were unaffected by the stimulation with rhAPC or thrombin. The upregulatory effect on COX2-mRNA levels was specific for rhAPC since the zymogen protein C in equimolar concentrations had no effect on COX-2-mRNA-levels or 6keto PGF1\u03b1-release. Western Blot analysis revealed an increase of COX-2-protein content in HUVEC after treatment with rhAPC. As shown by experiments using monoclonal antibodies against the thrombin receptor PAR-1 (mAb=ATAP2) and against the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR; mAb=RCR-252), the effect of rhAPC on COX-2-mRNA up-regulation was mediated by binding to the EPCR-receptor and signaling via PAR-1. These results demonstrate that induction of COX-2-expression is an important response of HUVEC to stimulation with rhAPC and may represent a new molecular mechanism, by which rhAPC promotes upregulation of prostanoid production in human endothelium.",

        "abstract": "The functional significance of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in endothelial cells is largely undefined, and the intracellular consequences of their activation are poorly understood. Here, we show that the serine protease thrombin, a PAR-1-selective peptide (TFLLRN), and SLIGKV (PAR-2-selective peptide) induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein and mRNA expression in human endothelial cells without modifying COX-1 expression. COX-2 induction was accompanied by sustained production of 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1, the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, and this was inhibited by indomethacin and the COX-2-selective inhibitor NS398. PAR-1 and PAR-2 stimulation rapidly activated both ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, and pharmacological blockade of MEK with either PD98059 or U0126 or of p38MAPK by SB203580 or SB202190 strongly inhibited thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced COX-2 expression and 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 formation. Thrombin and peptide agonists of PAR-1 and PAR-2 increased luciferase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with an NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase reporter adenovirus, and this, as well as PAR-induced 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 synthesis, was inhibited by co-infection with adenovirus encoding wild-type or mutated (Y42F) I\u03baB\u03b1. Thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced COX-2 expression and 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 generation were markedly attenuated by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor PG490 and partially inhibited by the proteasome pathway inhibitor MG-132. Activation of PAR-1 or PAR-2 promoted nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p65-NF-\u03baB, and thrombin-induced but not PAR-2-induced p65-NF-\u03baB phosphorylation was reduced by inhibition of MEK or p38MAPK. Activation of PAR-4 by AYPGKF increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK without modifying NF-\u03baB activation or COX-2 induction. Our data show that PAR-1 and PAR-2, but not PAR-4, are coupled with COX-2 expression and sustained endothelial production of vasculoprotective prostacyclin by mechanisms that depend on ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and I\u03baB\u03b1-dependent NF-\u03baB activation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In vitro Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of primary human dermal microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells is characterized by the induction of preexisting host signal cascades, sustained expression of latency-associated genes, transient expression of a limited number of lytic genes, and induction of several cytokines, growth factors, and angiogenic factors. Since NF-\u03baB is a key molecule involved in the regulation of several of these factors, here, we examined NF-\u03baB induction during de novo infection of HMVEC-d and HFF cells. Activation of NF-\u03baB was observed as early as 5 to 15 min postinfection by KSHV, and translocation of p65-NF-\u03baB into nuclei was detected by immunofluorescence assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and p65 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. I\u03baB phosphorylation inhibitor (Bay11-7082) reduced this activation significantly. A sustained moderate level of NF-\u03baB induction was seen during the observed 72 h of in vitro KSHV latency. In contrast, high levels of ERK1/2 activation at earlier time points and a moderate level of activation at later times were observed. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was activated only at later time points, and AKT was activated in a cyclic manner. Studies with UV-inactivated KSHV suggested a role for virus entry stages in NF-\u03baB induction and a requirement for KSHV viral gene expression in sustained induction. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB did not affect target cell entry by KSHV but significantly reduced the expression of viral latent open reading frame 73 and lytic genes. KSHV infection induced the activation of several host transcription factors, including AP-1 family members, as well as several cytokines, growth factors, and angiogenic factors, which were significantly affected by NF-\u03baB inhibition. These results suggest that during de novo infection, KSHV induces sustained levels of NF-\u03baB to regulate viral and host cell genes and thus possibly regulates the establishment of latent infection.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) and \u03b13\u03b21 integrin during the early stages of infection of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), and these interactions are followed by virus entry overlapping with the induction of preexisting host cell signal pathways. KSHV also utilizes the amino acid transporter protein xCT for infection of adherent cells, and the xCT molecule is part of the cell surface heterodimeric membrane glycoprotein CD98 (4F2 antigen) complex known to interact with \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b1V\u03b23 integrins. KSHV gB mediates adhesion of HMVEC-d, CV-1, and HT-1080 cells and HFF via its RGD sequence. Anti-\u03b1V and -\u03b21 integrin antibodies inhibited the cell adhesion mediated by KSHV-gB. Variable levels of neutralization of HMVEC-d and HFF infection were observed with antibodies against \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 integrins. Similarly, variable levels of inhibition of virus entry into adherent HMVEC-d, 293 and Vero cells, and HFF was observed by preincubating virus with soluble \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b1V\u03b25 integrins, and cumulative inhibition was observed with a combination of integrins. We were unable to infect HT1080 cells. Virus binding and DNA internalization studies suggest that \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 integrins also play roles in KSHV entry. We observed time-dependent temporal KSHV interactions with HMVEC-d integrins and CD98/xCT with three different patterns of association and dissociation. Integrin \u03b1V\u03b25 interaction with CD98/xCT predominantly occurred by 1 min postinfection (p.i.) and dissociated at 10 min p.i., whereas \u03b13\u03b21-CD98/xCT interaction was maximal at 10 min p.i. and dissociated at 30 min p.i., and \u03b1V\u03b23-CD98/xCT interaction was maximal at 10 min p.i. and remained at the observed 30 min p.i. Fluorescence microscopy also showed a similar time-dependent interaction of \u03b1V\u03b25-CD98. Confocal-microscopy studies confirmed the association of CD98/xCT with \u03b13\u03b21 and KSHV. Preincubation of KSHV with soluble heparin and \u03b13\u03b21 significantly inhibited this association, suggesting that the first contact with HS and integrin is an essential element in subsequent CD98-xCT interactions. Anti-CD98 and xCT antibodies did not block virus binding and entry and nuclear delivery of viral DNA; however, viral-gene expression was significantly inhibited, suggesting that CD98-xCT play roles in the post-entry stage of infection, possibly in mediating signal cascades essential for viral-gene expression. Together, these studies suggest that KSHV interacts with functionally related integrins (\u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b13\u03b21, and \u03b1V\u03b25) and CD98/xCT molecules in a temporal fashion to form a multimolecular complex during the early stages of endothelial cell infection, probably mediating multiple roles in entry, signal transduction, and viral-gene expression.",

Here, we characterized KSHV entry into primary human microvascular dermal endothelial (HMVEC-d) and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Similar to the results for HMVEC-d cells, KSHV infection of HUVEC cells also resulted in an initial high level and subsequent decline in the expression of the lytic switch gene, ORF50, while latent gene expression persisted. Internalized virus particles enclosed in irregular vesicles were observed by electron microscopy of infected HMVEC-d cells. At an early time of infection, colocalization of KSHV capsid with envelope was observed by immunofluorescence analysis, thus demonstrating endocytosis of intact enveloped virus particles. Chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and filipin (C35H58O11), a caveolar endocytosis inhibitor, did not have any effect on KSHV binding, entry (DNA internalization), or gene expression in HMVEC-d and HUVEC cells. In contrast to the results for HFF cells, virus entry and gene expression in both types of endothelial cells were significantly blocked by macropinocytosis inhibitors (EIPA [5-N-ethyl-N-isoproamiloride] and rottlerin [C30H28O8]) and by cytochalasin D, which affects actin polymerization. Inhibition of lipid raft blocked viral gene expression in HMVEC-d cells but not in HUVEC or HFF cells. In HMVEC-d and HUVEC cells, KSHV induced the actin polymerization and formation of lamellipodial extensions that are essential for macropinocytosis. Inhibition of macropinocytosis resulted in the distribution of viral capsids at the HMVEC-d cell periphery, and capsids did not associate with microtubules involved in the nuclear delivery of viral DNA. Internalized KSHV in HMVEC-d and HUVEC cells colocalized with the macropinocytosis marker dextran and not with the clathrin pathway marker transferrin or with caveolin. Dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin, did not block viral entry into endothelial cells but did inhibit entry into HFF cells. KSHV was not associated with the early endosome marker EEA-1 in HMVEC-d cells, but rather with the late endosome marker LAMP1, as well as with Rab34 GTPase that is known to regulate macropinocytosis. Silencing Rab34 with small interfering RNA dramatically inhibited KSHV gene expression. Bafilomycin-mediated disruption of endosomal acidification inhibited viral gene expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that KSHV utilizes the actin polymerization-dependent, dynamin-independent macropinocytic pathway that involves a Rab34 GTPase-dependent late endosome and low-pH environment for its infectious entry into HMVEC-d and HUVEC cells. These studies also demonstrate that KSHV utilizes different modes of endocytic entry in fibroblast and endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT During target cell entry and infection, many enveloped and nonenveloped viruses utilize cell surface receptors that translocate into lipid rafts (LRs). However, the mechanism behind this translocation is not known. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interacts with the human microvascular dermal endothelial (HMVEC-d) cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), integrins \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b1V\u03b25, and the amino acid transporter x-CT protein and enters via c-Cbl-bleb-mediated macropinocytosis (Veettil et al., J. Virol. 82:12126-12144, 2008; Veettil et al., PLoS Pathog. 6:e1001238, 2010). Here we have demonstrated that very early during infection (1 min postinfection), c-Cbl induced the selective translocation of KSHV into the LR along with the \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and x-CT receptors but not \u03b1V\u03b25. Activated c-Cbl localized with LRs at the junctional base of macropinocytic blebs. LR-translocated \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b1V\u03b23 were monoubiquitinated, leading to productive macropinocytic entry, whereas non-LR-associated \u03b1V\u03b25 was polyubiquitinated, leading to clathrin entry that was targeted to lysosomes. c-Cbl knockdown blocked the macropinocytosis and receptor translocation and diverted KSHV to a clathrin-lysosomal noninfectious pathway. Similar results were also seen by LR disruption with M\u03b2CD. These studies provide the first evidence that c-Cbl regulates selective KSHV-\u03b13\u03b21, -\u03b1V\u03b23, and -x-CT receptor translocations into the LRs and differential ubiquitination of receptors which are critical determinants of the macropinocytic entry route and productive infection of KSHV. Our studies suggest that interventions targeting c-Cbl and LRs are potential avenues to block KSHV infection of endothelial cells.",

KSHV infection activated c-Cbl, which induced the selective translocation of KSHV into lipid rafts (LRs) along with the \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and xCT receptors, but not \u03b1V\u03b25.

Because the molecule(s) that integrate signal pathways and productive KSHV macropinocytosis were unknown, we immunoprecipitated KSHV-infected LR fractions with anti-\u03b13\u03b21 antibodies and analyzed them by mass spectrometry. The tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 (EphA2), implicated in many cancers, was identified in this analysis. EphA2 was activated by KSHV. EphA2 was also associated with KSHV and integrins (\u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b1V\u03b23) in LRs early during infection. Preincubation of virus with soluble EphA2, knockdown of EphA2 by shRNAs, or pretreatment of cells with anti-EphA2 monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib significantly reduced KSHV entry and gene expression. EphA2 associates with c-Cbl-myosin IIA and augmented KSHV-induced Src and PI3-K signals in LRs, leading to bleb formation and macropinocytosis of KSHV. EphA2 shRNA ablated macropinocytosis-associated signaling events, virus internalization, and productive nuclear trafficking of KSHV DNA. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the EphA2 receptor acts as a master assembly regulator of KSHV-induced signal molecules and KSHV entry in endothelial cells and suggest that the EphA2 receptor is an attractive target for controlling KSHV infection.",

        "abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interacts with human dermal endothelial cell surface tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 (EphA2) and integrins (\u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b1V\u03b23) in the lipid raft (LR) region, and EphA2 regulates macropinocytic virus entry by coordinating integrin-c-Cbl associated signaling. In contrast, KSHV enters human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells by LR-independent clathrin mediated endocytosis. The present studies conducted to identify the key molecules regulating KSHV entry in HFF cells showed that KSHV induces association with integrins (\u03b1V\u03b25, \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b13\u03b21) and EphA2 in non-LR regions early during infection and activates EphA2, which in turn associates with phosphorylated c-Cbl, myosin IIA, FAK, Src, and PI3-K, as well as clathrin and its adaptor AP2 and effector Epsin-15 proteins. EphA2 knockdown significantly reduced these signal inductions, virus internalization and gene expression. c-Cbl knockdown ablated the c-Cbl mediated K63 type polyubiquitination of EphA2 and clathrin association with EphA2 and KSHV. Mutations in EphA2's tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) or sterile alpha motif (SAM) abolished its interaction with c-Cbl. Mutations in tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) or RING finger (RF) domains of c-Cbl resulted in very poor association of c-Cbl with EphA2 and decreased EphA2 polyubiquitination. These studies demonstrated the contributions of these domains in EphA2 and c-Cbl association, EphA2 polyubiquitination and virus-EphA2 internalization. Collectively, these results revealed for the first time that EphA2 influences the tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin, the role of EphA2 in clathrin mediated endocytosis of a virus, and c-Cbl mediated EphA2 polyubiquitination directing KSHV entry in HFF cells via coordinated signal induction and progression of endocytic events, all of which suggest that targeting EphA2 and c-Cbl could block KSHV entry and infection.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Viruses often hijack cellular pathways to facilitate infection and replication. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic gammaherpesvirus etiologically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, a vascular tumor of endothelial cells. Despite intensive studies, cellular pathways mediating KSHV infection and replication are still not well defined. Using an antibody array approach, we examined cellular proteins phosphorylated during primary KSHV infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Enrichment analysis identified integrin/mitogen-activated protein kinase (integrin/MAPK), insulin/epidermal growth factor receptor (insulin/EGFR), and JAK/STAT as the activated networks during primary KSHV infection. The transcriptional factor CREB1 (cyclic AMP [cAMP]-responsive element-binding protein 1) had the strongest increase in phosphorylation. While knockdown of CREB1 had no effect on KSHV entry and trafficking, it drastically reduced the expression of lytic transcripts and proteins and the production of infectious virions. Chemical activation of CREB1 significantly enhanced viral lytic replication. In contrast, CREB1 neither influenced the expression of the latent gene LANA nor affected KSHV infectivity. Mechanistically, CREB1 was not activated through the classic cAMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway or via the AKT, MK2, and RSK pathways. Rather, CREB1 was activated by the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases 1 and 2 (MSK1/2). Consequently, chemical inhibition or knockdown of MSKs significantly inhibited the KSHV lytic replication program; however, it had a minimal effect on LANA expression and KSHV infectivity. Together, these results identify the MSK1/2-CREB1 proteins as novel essential effectors of KSHV lytic replication during primary infection. The differential effect of the MSK1/2-CREB1 pathway on the expression of viral latent and lytic genes might control the robustness of viral lytic replication, and therefore the KSHV replication program, during primary infection. IMPORTANCE Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human tumor virus associated with several cancers. Through genome-wide kinase screening, we found that KSHV activates the MSK1/2-CREB1 pathway during primary infection and that it depends on this pathway for viral lytic replication. Inhibition of this pathway blocks KSHV lytic replication. These results illustrate a mechanism by which KSHV hijacks a cellular pathway for its replication, and they identify a potential therapeutic target.",

        "title": "Suppression of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Infection and Replication by 5\u2032-AMP-Activated Protein Kinase",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The host intracellular antiviral restriction factors inhibit viral infection and replication. The 5\u2032-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor regulating metabolic homeostasis. Activated AMPK inhibits the replication of numerous RNA viruses but enhances the entry of vaccinia virus. However, the role of AMPK in herpesvirus infection is unclear. In this study, we showed that the constitutive AMPK activity restricted Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells while KSHV infection did not markedly affect the endogenous AMPK activity. Knockdown of the AMPK\u03b11 considerably enhanced the expression of viral lytic genes and the production of infectious virions, while overexpression of a constitutively active AMPK had the opposite effects. Accordingly, an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, augmented viral lytic gene expressions and virion productions but an AMPK agonist, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), suppressed both. Furthermore, a common diabetes drug, metformin, which carries an AMPK-agonistic activity, drastically inhibited the expression of viral lytic genes and the production of infectious virions, suggesting the use of metformin as a therapeutic agent for KSHV infection and replication. Together, these results identify the host AMPK as a KSHV restriction factor that can serve as a potential therapeutic target. IMPORTANCE Host cells encode specific proteins to restrict viral infection and replication. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human tumor virus associated with several cancers. In this study, we have identified 5\u2032-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, as a restriction factor of KSHV lytic replication during primary infection. Activation of AMPK suppresses, while inhibition of AMPK enhances, KSHV lytic replication by regulating the expression of viral genes. AICAR and metformin, both of which are AMPK agonists currently used in clinics for the treatment of conditions associated with metabolic disorders, inhibit KSHV lytic replication. Thus, our work has identified AMPK as a potential therapeutic target and AICAR and metformin as potential therapeutic agents for KSHV-associated cancers.",

        "abstract": "Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare and aggressive B\u2010cell lymphoma with a dismal prognosis caused by infection of Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus. Despite the findings that numerous viral genes and cellular pathways are essential for the proliferation and survival of PEL cells, there is currently no effective therapeutic treatment for PEL. Here, we report that the metabolic sensor SIRT1 is functionally required for sustaining the proliferation and survival of PEL cells. Knockdown of SIRT1 with specific shRNAs or inhibition of SIRT1 with an inhibitor (tenovin\u20106) induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PEL cells. We detected high levels of AMPK activation in PEL cells, reflected in AMPK\u03b11 phosphorylation at T174. Knockdown or inhibition of SIRT1 reduced AMPK activation, indicating that SIRT1 was required for AMPK activation. Interestingly, knockdown of AMPK with specific shRNAs or inhibition of AMPK with the inhibitor compound C recapitulated the phenotype of SIRT1, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active AMPK construct rescued the cytotoxic effect of SIRT1 knockdown. Remarkably, treatment with tenovin\u20106 effectively inhibited the initiation and progression of PEL, and significantly extended the survival of mice in a murine PEL model. Taken together, these results illustrate that the SIRT1\u2013AMPK axis is essential for maintaining the proliferation and survival of PEL and identify SIRT1 and AMPK as potential therapeutic targets, and tenovin\u20106 as a candidate therapeutic agent for PEL patients.

The lack of a full understanding of the molecular pathways coupling the vascular injury stimuli to VSMCs phenotype switching largely limits the development of medical therapies for treating intima hyperplasia\u2010related diseases. The role of signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) in modulating the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, especially macrophage, has been well investigated, but little is known about its pathophysiological role and target genes in restenosis after vascular injury. In the present work, Stat6\u2212/\u2212 mice were observed to exhibit less severe intimal hyperplasia compared with Stat6+/+ mice after carotid injury. The expression of STAT6 was upregulated in VSMCs located in the injured vascular walls. STAT6 deletion leads to decreased proliferation and migration of VSMCs while STAT6 overexpression enhances the proliferation and migration of VSMCs companies with reduced expression of VSMCs marker genes and organized stress fibers. The effect of STAT6 in mouse VSMCs was conserved in human aortic SMCs. RNA\u2010deep\u2010sequencing and experiments verification revealed LncRNA C7orf69/LOC100996318\u2010miR\u2010370\u20103p/FOXO1\u2010ER stress signaling as the downstream network mediating the pro\u2010dedifferentiation effect of STAT6 in VSMCs. These findings broaden our understanding of vascular pathological molecules and throw a beam of light on the therapy of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper. Both papers investigate the phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and its implications for in-stent restenosis. The source paper explores the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this process, while the current paper examines the downstream network of STAT6 in promoting VSMC phenotypic switch and neointimal formation. The current paper builds upon the understanding of VSMC phenotypic switching established in the source paper."
