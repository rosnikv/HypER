        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCollaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine associations between cerebral microbleed (CMB) burden with recurrent ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk after IS or TIA. Methods: We identified prospective studies of patients with IS or TIA that investigated CMBs and stroke (ICH and IS) risk during \u22653 months follow-up. Authors provided aggregate summary-level data on stroke outcomes, with CMBs categorized according to burden (single, 2\u20134, and \u22655 CMBs) and distribution. We calculated absolute event rates and pooled risk ratios (RR) using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 5,068 patients from 15 studies. There were 115/1,284 (9.6%) recurrent IS events in patients with CMBs vs 212/3,781 (5.6%) in patients without CMBs (pooled RR 1.8 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4\u20132.5). There were 49/1,142 (4.3%) ICH events in those with CMBs vs 17/2,912 (0.58%) in those without CMBs (pooled RR 6.3 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% CI 3.5\u201311.4). Increasing CMB burden increased the risk of IS (pooled RR [95% CI] 1.8 [1.0\u20133.1], 2.4 [1.3\u20134.4], and 2.7 [1.5\u20134.9] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively) and ICH (pooled RR [95% CI] 4.6 [1.9\u201310.7], 5.6 [2.4\u201313.3], and 14.1 [6.9\u201329.0] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively). Conclusions: CMBs are associated with increased stroke risk after IS or TIA. With increasing CMB burden (compared to no CMBs), the risk of ICH increases more steeply than that of IS. However, IS absolute event rates remain higher than ICH absolute event rates in all CMB burden categories.",

Background and Purpose\u2014 We aimed to determine the safety and mortality after mechanical thrombectomy in patients taking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Methods\u2014 In a multicenter observational cohort study, we used multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate associations of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) with VKA or DOAC prescription before thrombectomy as compared with no anticoagulation. The primary outcomes were the rate of sICH and all-cause mortality at 90 days, incorporating sensitivity analysis regarding confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation. Additionally, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature on this topic. Results\u2014 Altogether, 1932 patients were included (VKA, n=222; DOAC, n=98; no anticoagulation, n=1612); median age, 74 years (interquartile range, 62\u201382); 49.6% women. VKA prescription was associated with increased odds for sICH and mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.55 [95% CI, 1.35\u20134.84] and 1.64 [95% CI, 1.09\u20132.47]) as compared with the control group, whereas no association with DOAC intake was observed (aOR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.29\u20133.35] and 1.35 [95% CI, 0.72\u20132.53]). Sensitivity analyses considering only patients within the confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation range did not alter the findings. A study-level meta-analysis incorporating data from 7462 patients (855 VKAs, 318 DOACs, and 6289 controls) from 15 observational cohorts corroborated these observations, yielding an increased rate of sICH in VKA patients (aOR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.22\u20132.17]) but not in DOAC patients (aOR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.60\u20131.80]). Conclusions\u2014 Patients taking VKA have an increased risk of sICH and mortality after mechanical thrombectomy. The lower risk of sICH associated with DOAC may also be noticeable in the acute setting. Improved selection might be advisable in VKA-treated patients.

        "abstract": "Aim: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are over-represented in endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) populations, due to a high prevalence of large vessel occlusions (LVO) and contraindication to intravenous thrombolysis. This study aimed to: (1) compare 90-day functional outcomes [modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2] and mortality in AF vs. non-AF patients receiving EVT; (2) compare 90-day functional outcomes and mortality in AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation receiving EVT; and (3) identify factors influencing outcomes in AF patients receiving EVT. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 394 consecutive patients who received EVT for anterior cerebral circulation LVO at an Australian comprehensive stroke center was performed. The main outcome measures [90-day dichotomized mRS (0-2 good; 3-6 poor functional outcome) and mortality] were compared between AF and nonAF patients, as well as between therapeutic and non-therapeutic anticoagulation cohorts. Page 2 of Fu et al. Vessel Plus 2021;5:33 https://dx.doi.org/10.20517/2574-1209.2021.36 11 Results: In total, 171 (49%) EVT patients had AF. Patients with AF were older, had higher NIHSS, and had lower rates of thrombolysis administration. AF patients showed improved 90-day mRS on multivariate analysis [aOR 1.988 (1.167-3.387)], with similar symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) [aOR 0.364 (0.064-2.086)] and mortality [aOR 1.454 (0.785-2.696)]. There was no difference in 90-day mRS [aOR 1.402 (0.625-3.145)], successful reperfusion rates [aOR 3.761 (0.661-21.410)], or mortality [aOR 1.077 (0.429-2.705)] between AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation. In patients with AF, advancing age and higher NIHSS were independent predictors of worse 90-day functional outcome (OR = 1.045, P = 0.020; OR = 1.086, P = 0.001) and mortality (OR = 1.138, P < 0.001; OR = 1.107, P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, thrombolysis administration improved mortality (OR = 0.215, P = 0.016) but not functional outcomes. Conclusion: Patients with AF showed improved 90-day functional outcome, with similar mortality and sICH, after EVT. Therapeutic anticoagulation did not adversely influence EVT outcomes.",

We aimed to perform a meta\u2010analysis of adjusted effect estimates to examine the association between the presence of AF and the clinical outcomes in patients with AIS who received endovascular thrombectomy. Methods and Results We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database between January 1, 2013 and July 10, 2023. Data were meta\u2010analyzed to compare the outcomes among patients with AIS with and without AF who received endovascular thrombectomy. Our primary outcome was 90\u2010day functional independence defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. Secondary outcomes included excellent independence (90\u2010day modified Rankin Scale score of 0\u20131), 90\u2010day mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and any intracranial hemorrhage. Eighteen observational studies comprising 16\u2009096 patients with AIS (mean age, 70.1\u2009years; women, 48.2%; 6862 with AF versus 9234 without AF) were included.

        "title": "Determining Differences in the Association Between Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Stroke Outcomes by Treatment Received",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Whether the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke (IS) outcomes differs by IS treatment type is unknown. We hypothesize that patients with IS who have AF will have a worse NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score than non-AF, with differences by IS treatment type. Methods: Patients with, and without AF admitted to Johns Hopkins (2020\u20132023) with confirmed IS and complete covariates were eligible for inclusion. Consecutive patients either received acute IS treatment (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IVtPA), mechanical thrombectomy (MT), or both) or did not receive treatment (2:1 ratio). Multivariable regression models were used to determine the association between AF and discharge NIHSS, or 90-day mRS, separately, with interaction terms for IS treatment type as appropriate. Results: Among 353 IS patients (mean age 69 years, 52.1% female, 54.7% Black), 62 received IVtPA only, 66 received IVtPA then MT, 108 received MT only, and 117 were not treated. Patients with AF (N = 152) were, on average, 11 years older and had more comorbidities than non-AF. AF was associated with higher odds of an NIHSS > 5, even after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.29\u20133.40). AF increased the odds of a worse 90-day mRS (Ordinal OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03\u20132.64). The association between AF and NIHSS differed by whether MT was received (p-interaction 0.037), but not by IVtPA (p-interaction 0.105). AF and 90-day mRS differed by whether MT was received (p-interaction 0.020), but not by IVtPA (p-interaction 0.139). Patients with AF who did not receive MT had a worse NIHSS (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.38\u201313.00) and 90-day mRS (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.30\u20131.97) compared to non-AF. The individual effect estimates were not significant for those treated with MT when comparing AF to non-AF. Conclusions: The association between AF (vs non-AF) and both NIHSS and 90-day mRS differed by whether MT was received, but not by IVtPA. Patients with AF who did not receive MT had more severe strokes and worse outcomes than non-AF. These findings suggest that while AF is typically linked to more severe strokes, not receiving MT when eligible is particularly detrimental. Receipt of IVtPA did not appear to make a difference, possibly due to treatment contraindications and delays among those with AF.",
