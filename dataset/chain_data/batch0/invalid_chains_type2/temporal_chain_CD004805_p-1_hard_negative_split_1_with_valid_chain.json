        "title": "Combinations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium supplements in hypertension.",
        "abstract": "Dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium have each been reported to lower blood pressure, but the extent of blood pressure reduction in epidemiological studies and clinical trials has tended to be small and inconsistent. We hypothesized that combinations of these mineral supplements would lower blood pressure and that the reductions would be greater than that usually reported in studies of each cation alone. One hundred twenty-five patients 82 men and 43 women) with untreated mild or borderline hypertension were randomly assigned to daily treatment with one of the following four regimens: 60 mmol potassium and 25 mmol (1000 mg) calcium, 60 mmol potassium and 15 mmol (360 mg) magnesium, calcium and magnesium, or placebo. Standardized clinic blood pressure measurements were obtained on 3 days at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. At baseline, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- SD) were 139 +/- 12 and 90 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, and dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were 77 +/- 32, 19 +/- 13, and 12 +/- 52 mmol/d, respectively. The mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) of the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures between the treatment and placebo groups were not significant: -0.7 (-4.3 to +2.9) and -0.4 (-2.9 to +2.1) for potassium and calcium, -1.3 (-4.4 to +1.8) and 0.4 (-2.5 to +3.3) for potassium and magnesium, and +2.1 (-1.8 to +6.0) and +2.2 (-1.0 to +5.4) for calcium and magnesium. In conclusion, this trial provides little evidence of an important role of combinations of cation supplements in the treatment of mild or borderline hypertension.",

        "title": "Renal inflammation is modulated by potassium in chronic kidney disease: possible role of Smad7.",
        "abstract": "High-potassium diets have been shown to be beneficial in cardiovascular disease partly because of a blood pressure-lowering effect. The effect of potassium on inflammation has not been studied. We investigated the influence of potassium supplementation on the degree of renal inflammation and the intracellular signaling mechanisms that could mediate inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD was created in male Sprague-Dawley rats by subtotal nephrectomy. Two groups of CKD rats were pair fed with diets containing 2.1% potassium (potassium-supplemented diet) or 0.4% potassium (basal diet). Body weight, blood pressure, and blood and urine electrolytes were measured biweekly. The animals were euthanized at week 8, and the remnant kidneys were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR. In the CKD pair-fed groups, blood potassium concentration did not differ significantly, but blood pressure was lower in the potassium-supplemented group. Compared with the basal diet, potassium supplementation decreased renal tubulointerstitial injury and suppressed renal inflammation as evidenced by decreased macrophage infiltration, lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased NF-kappaB activation. These renoprotective effects were associated with downregulation of renal transforming growth facto-beta, upregulation of renal Smad7, and lower blood pressure. Our results show that potassium supplementation can reduce renal inflammation and hence, could modulate the progression of kidney injury in CKD.",

        "title": "Association of Hypo- and Hyperkalemia with Disease Progression and Mortality in Males with Chronic Kidney Disease: The Role of Race",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Abnormal serum potassium is associated with higher mortality in dialysis patients, but its impact on outcomes in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear. Furthermore, blacks with normal kidney function have lower urinary potassium excretion, but it is unclear if such differences have a bearing on race-associated outcomes in CKD. Methods: We studied predialysis mortality and slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) associated with serum potassium in 1,227 males with CKD. Mortality was examined in time-dependent Cox models, and slopes of eGFR in linear mixed effects models with adjustments for case mix and laboratory values. Results: Both hypo- and hyperkalemia were associated with mortality overall and in 933 white patients, but in 294 blacks hypokalemia was a stronger death predictor. Hypokalemia was associated with loss of kidney function independent of race: a 1 mEq/l lower potassium was associated with an adjusted difference in slopes of eGFR of -0.13 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (95% CI: -0.20 to -0.07), p < 0.001. Conclusion: Hypo- and hyperkalemia are associated with higher mortality in CKD patients. Blacks appear to better tolerate higher potassium than whites. Hypokalemia is associated with faster CKD progression independent of race. Hyperkalemia management may warrant race-specific consideration, and hypokalemia correction may slow CKD progression.

        "abstract": "Background In the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, the impact of serum potassium (sK) on renal outcomes has been controversial. Moreover, the reasons for the potential prognostic value of hypokalemia have not been elucidated. Design, Participants & Measurements 2500 participants with CKD stage 1\u20134 in the Integrated CKD care program Kaohsiung for delaying Dialysis (ICKD) prospective observational study were analyzed and followed up for 2.7 years. Generalized additive model was fitted to determine the cutpoints and the U-shape association between sK and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). sK was classified into five groups with the cutpoints of 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 mEq/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models predicting the outcomes were used. Results The mean age was 62.4 years, mean sK level was 4.2\u00b10.5 mEq/L and average eGFR was 40.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Female vs male, diuretic use vs. non-use, hypertension, higher eGFR, bicarbonate, CRP and hemoglobin levels significantly correlated with hypokalemia. In patients with lower sK, nephrotic range proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia were more prevalent but the use of RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors was less frequent. Hypokalemia was significantly associated with ESRD with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.03\u20133.22) in sK <3.5mEq/L and 1.67 (95% CI,1.19\u20132.35) in sK\u200a=\u200a3.5\u20134 mEq/L, respectively, compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia defined as sK >5 mEq/L conferred 1.6-fold (95% CI,1.09\u20132.34) increased risk of ESRD compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hypokalemia was also associated with rapid decline of renal function defined as eGFR slope below 20% of the distribution range. Conclusion In conclusion, both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with increased risk of ESRD in CKD population. Hypokalemia is related to increased use of diuretics, decreased use of RAS blockade and malnutrition, all of which may impose additive deleterious effects on renal outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nPatients with CKD are more likely than others to have abnormalities in serum potassium (K(+)). Aside from severe hyperkalemia, the clinical significance of K(+) abnormalities is not known. We sought to examine the association of serum K(+) with mortality and hospitalization rates within narrow eGFR strata to understand how the burden of hyperkalemia varies by CKD severity. Associations were examined between serum K(+) and discontinuation of medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which are known to increase serum K(+).\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nA cohort of patients with CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) with serum K(+) data were studied (n=55,266) between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013 (study end). Serum K(+), eGFR, and covariates were considered on a time-updated basis. Mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers were considered per time at risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the study, serum K(+) levels of 5.5-5.9 and \u22656.0 mEq/L were most prevalent at lower eGFR: they were present, respectively, in 1.7% and 0.2% of patient-time for eGFR of 50-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) versus 7.6% and 1.8% of patient-time for eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Serum K(+) level <3.5 mEq/L was present in 1.2%-1.4% of patient-time across eGFR strata. The median follow-up time was 2.76 years. There was a U-shaped association between serum K(+) and mortality; pooled adjusted incidence rate ratios were 3.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.53 to 3.68) and 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 2.52 to 4.34) for K(+) levels <3.5 mEq/L and \u22656.0 mEq/L, respectively. Within eGFR strata, there were U-shaped associations of serum K(+) with rates of MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth hyperkalemia and hypokalemia were independently associated with higher rates of death, MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. Future studies are needed to determine whether interventions targeted at maintaining normal serum K(+) improve outcomes in this population.",

        "abstract": "Background Concerns about hyperkalemia limit the use of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE\u2010I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but guidelines conflict regarding potassium\u2010monitoring protocols. We quantified hyperkalemia monitoring and risks after ACE\u2010I/ARB initiation and developed and validated a hyperkalemia susceptibility score. Methods and Results We evaluated 69 426 new users of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy in the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project with medication initiation from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010, and follow\u2010up for 1 year thereafter. Three fourths (76%) of SCREAM patients had potassium checked within the first year. Potassium >5 and >5.5 mmol/L occurred in 5.6% and 1.7%, respectively. As a comparison, we propensity\u2010matched new ACE\u2010I/ARB users to 20 186 new \u03b2\u2010blocker users in SCREAM: 64% had potassium checked. The occurrence of elevated potassium levels was similar between new \u03b2\u2010blocker and ACE\u2010I/ARB users without kidney disease; only at estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 were risks higher among ACE\u2010I/ARB users. We developed a hyperkalemia susceptibility score that incorporated estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline potassium level, sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the concomitant use of potassium\u2010sparing diuretics in new ACE\u2010I/ARB users; this score accurately predicted 1\u2010year hyperkalemia risk in the SCREAM cohort (area under the curve, 0.845, 95% CI: 0.840\u20130.869) and in a validation cohort from the US\u2010based Geisinger Health System (N=19 524; area under the curve, 0.818, 95% CI: 0.794\u20130.841), with good calibration. Conclusions Hyperkalemia within the first year of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy was relatively uncommon among people with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, but rates were much higher with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. Use of the hyperkalemia susceptibility score may help guide laboratory monitoring and prescribing strategies.",

        "abstract": "Data on hyperkalemia frequency among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients receiving renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and its impact on subsequent RAASi treatment are limited. This population-based cohort study sought to assess the incidence of clinically significant hyperkalemia among adult CKD patients who were prescribed a RAASi and the proportion of patients with RAASi medication change after experiencing incident hyperkalemia. We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study (1 January 2013\u201330 June 2017) using Australian national general practice data from the NPS MedicineWise\u2019s MedicineInsight program. The study included adults aged \u226518 years who received \u22651 RAASi prescription during the study period and had CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73m2). Study outcomes included incident clinically significant hyperkalemia (serum potassium >6 mmol/L or a record of hyperkalemia diagnosis) and among patients who experienced incident hyperkalemia, the proportion who had RAASi medication changes (cessation or dose reduction during the 210-day period after the incident hyperkalemia event). Among 20,184 CKD patients with a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 1,992 (9.9%) patients experienced an episode of hyperkalemia. The overall incidence rate was 3.1 (95% CI: 2.9\u20133.2) per 100 person-years. Rates progressively increased with worsening eGFR (e.g. 3.5-fold increase in patients with eGFR <15 vs. 45\u201359 ml/min/1.73m2). Among patients who experienced incident hyperkalemia, 46.6% had changes made to their RAASi treatment regimen following the first occurrence of hyperkalemia (discontinuation: 36.6% and dose reduction: 10.0%). In this analysis of adult RAASi users with CKD, hyperkalemia and subsequent RAASi treatment changes were common. Further assessment of strategies for hyperkalemia management and optimal RAASi use among people with CKD are warranted.",

        "abstract": "A nanofiber mesh was prepared for the adsorption of indoxyl sulfate (IS), a toxin associated with chronic kidney disease. Removing IS is highly demanded for efficient blood purification. The objective of this study is to develop a zeolite composite nanofiber mesh to remove IS efficiently. Eight zeolites with different properties were used for IS adsorption, where a zeolite with a pore size of 7 A, H+ cations, and a silica to aluminum ratio of 240 mol/mol exhibited the highest adsorption capacity. This was primarily attributed to its suitable silica to aluminum ratio. The zeolites were incorporated in biocompatible poly (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH) nanofibers, and a zeolite composite nanofiber mesh was successfully fabricated via electrospinning. The nanofiber mesh exhibited an IS adsorption capacity of 107 \u03bcg/g, while the adsorption capacity by zeolite increased from 208 \u03bcg/g in powder form to 386 \u03bcg/g when dispersed in the mesh. This also led to an increase in cell viability from 86% to 96%. These results demonstrated that this zeolite composite nanofiber mesh can be safely and effectively applied in wearable blood purification devices.",

The BSA-CTA was used as a starting point for poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) through reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The research investigations suggest that the thermally responsive behavior of PNIPAAm was controlled by the monomer ratio to CTA, as well as the amount of CTA introduced to BSA. The study further synthesized the human serum albumin (HSA)-PNIPAAm conjugate, taking the advantage that HSA can specifically adsorb indoxyl sulfate (IS) as a uremic toxin. The HSA-PNIPAAm conjugate could capture IS and decreased the concentration by about 40% by thermal precipitation. It was also revealed that the protein activity was not impaired by the conjugation with PNIPAAm. The proposed strategy is promising in not only removal of uremic toxins but also enrichment of biomarkers for early diagnostic applications.",

        "abstract": "Early diagnosis of infectious diseases is still challenging particularly in a nonlaboratory environment or limited resources areas. Thus, sensitive, inexpensive, and easily handled diagnostic approaches are required. The lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is commonly used in the screening of infectious diseases despite its poor sensitivity, especially with low pathogenic loads (early stages of infection). This article introduces a novel polymeric material that might help in the enrichment and concentration of pathogens to overcome the LFIA misdiagnosis. To achieve this, we evaluated the efficiency of introducing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) into immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a model antibody using two different conjugation methods: grafting to (GT) and grafting from (GF). The IgG\u2013PNIPAAm conjugates were characterized using SDS-PAGE, DLS, and temperature-responsive phase transition behavior. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the GF method was more efficient in introducing the polymer than the GT method, with calculated polymer introduction ratios of 61% and 34%, respectively. The GF method proved to be less susceptible to steric hindrance and more efficient in introducing high-molecular-weight polymers into proteins. These results are consistent with previous studies comparing the GT and GF methods in similar systems. This study represents an important step toward understanding how the choice of polymer incorporation method affects the properties of IgG\u2013PNIPAAm conjugates. The synthesized polymer allowed binding and enrichment of mouse IgG that was used as a model antigen with a clear LFIA band. On the basis of our findings, this system might help in improving the sensitivity of simple diagnostics.",
