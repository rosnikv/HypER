        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nPeripheral arterial occlusive diseases (PAODs) not only compromise blood flow but lead to a series of subsequent metabolic and structural changes in the relevant muscles. Changes in myofibrillar proteins (eg, of myosin heavy chain [MHC] isoforms), one of the determinants of muscle structure as well as of muscular function, have not been reported in patients with PAOD and were therefore the aim of this study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirteen consecutive patients with PAOD were examined (clinical stage according to Fontaine II, three patients; III, three patients, and IV, seven patients) and compared with five age-matched control patients who had been in traffic accidents. A calf muscle sample (gastrocnemius muscle) in the ischemic region was taken for MHC isoform analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain, and the relative content of MHC isoforms was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control patients, there was no significant change of MHC isoforms in patients with PAOD II. In patients with PAOD III, MHC IIb decreased significantly (P <.05) although MHC IIa remained unchanged; in patients with PAOD IV, both MHC IIa and IIb decreased significantly (P <.05). Accordingly, there was a progressive increase of the relative amount of MHC I with more critical ischemia in PAOD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with PAOD, the content of MHC II decreased with a higher grade of ischemia. That seems to be consistent with an increased resistance to ischemia for myosin isoforms in the order of I more than in IIa more than IIb. Whether the decrease of MHC II in patients with PAOD is related to atrophy of muscle fibers or to muscle-fiber transition must be investigated further.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a progressive resistance training program on myosin heavy chain isoform expression, fiber type, and capillarization in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were randomized to either a training group (n = 11, mean +/- SD, 70 +/- 6 years, 4 men, 7 women) or a control group (n = 9, 66 +/- 6 years, 5 men, 4 women). The training sessions were completed 3 times/week, using 2 sets of various exercises, each performed for 8-15 repetitions. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after 24 weeks from the medial gastrocnemius. Following the 24-week training program, the training group had significantly decreased the percentage of myosin heavy chain type IIB. The proportion of type IIB/AB fibers as measured by using myosin adenosine triphosphatase histochemistry decreased significantly in the training group. There were significant increases in type I and type II fiber areas, and capillary density also increased significantly in the training group. There were significant increases in 10 repetition maximum leg press and calf press strengths in the trained subjects. There were no significant changes in any of the measurements in the control group. It is concluded that progressive resistance training results in significant increases in muscle strength and alters skeletal muscle composition of subjects with peripheral arterial disease.",

Epidemiological studies have recently shown that UA may be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and a negative prognostic marker for mortality in subjects with pre-existing heart failure.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe evaluate a relationship between UA levels and several inflammatory markers in 957 subjects, free of severe renal failure, from a representative Italian cohort of persons aged 65-95. Plasma levels of UA and white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6r), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured. Complete information on potential confounders was collected using standard methods.

Risk of CVD death and other causes subsequent to the sixth annual examination associated with gout was assessed by means of Cox proportional hazards regressions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe unadjusted mortality rates from CVD among those with and without gout were 10.3 per 1000 person-years and 8.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively, representing an approximately 30% greater risk. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, use of diuretics and aspirin, and serum creatinine level, the hazard ratio (gout vs no gout) for coronary heart disease mortality was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.72). The hazard ratio for death from myocardial infarction was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.94-1.93); for death from CVD overall, 1.21 (95% CI, 0.99-1.49); and for death from any cause, 1.09 (95% CI, 1.00-1.19) (P = .04).

Recent studies have implicated hyperuricemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that lowering uric acid in subjects with asymptomatic hyperuricemia with allopurinol might improve endothelial dysfunction, BP, estimated GFR (eGFR), and inflammatory markers.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nSubjects with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and no history of gout and 30 normouricemic control subjects were enrolled in this 4-month randomized prospective study. Thirty hyperuricemic patients received 300 mg/d allopurinol and were compared with 37 hyperuricemic patients and 30 normouricemic subjects in matched control groups. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), eGFR, ambulatory BP monitoring, spot urine protein-creatine ratio, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein were measured at baseline and at 4 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAge, gender, lipid profile, eGFR, hemoglobin, glucose, and level of proteinuria were similar in hyperuricemic subjects and controls at baseline. As expected, hyperuricemic patients had higher levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein and lower FMD compared with normouricemic patients. Allopurinol treatment resulted in a decrease in serum uric acid, a decrease in systolic BP, an increase in FMD, and an increase in eGFR compared with baseline. No significant difference was observed in the control hyperuricemic and normouricemic groups. In a multiple regression analysis, FMD levels were independently related to uric acid both before (beta = -0.55) and after (beta = -0.40) treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment of hyperuricemia with allopurinol improves endothelial dysfunction and eGFR in subjects with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

        "abstract": "Background Arterial stiffness is increased in patients with CKD and is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Use of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and possibly improve cardiovascular outcome. We explored the relationship between use of allopurinol and arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods Cross-sectional observational study of 422 patients with CKD with evidence of, or at high risk of, renal disease progression. Arterial stiffness was determined by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results The mean age was 63\u00b116 years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate was 25 (interquartile range: 19\u201331) ml/min/1.73 m2 and mean PWV was 10.2\u00b12.4 m/s. Seventy-seven patients (18%) were receiving regular allopurinol, 61% at a dose of 100 mg/day (range: 50\u2013400 mg/day). Patients receiving allopurinol had significantly lower peripheral pulse pressure, central pulse pressure, central systolic blood pressure, serum uric acid level tissue advanced glycation end product levels but comparable high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Use of allopurinol was associated with lower PWV. After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, tissue advanced glycation end product level, peripheral pulse pressure, smoking pack years, presence of diabetes mellitus and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, the use of allopurinol remained a significant independent determinant of PWV (mean difference: \u22120.63 m/s; 95% CI, \u22120.09 to \u22121.17 m/s, p\u200a=\u200a0.02).

We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the impacts of allopurinol treatment on arterial stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx). Material/Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of allopurinol on arterial stiffness were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library for Central Register of Clinical Trials, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure up to December 2015. The primary endpoints were the change of PWV and AIx after allopurinol treatment. The weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of each study were pooled for meta-analysis. Results A total of 11 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. Eight RCTs with 1,111 patients were pooled for PWV; eight RCTs with 397 patients were pooled for PWV. Allopurinol administration did not significantly change PWV (WMD=\u22120.19 m/s, 95% CI: \u22120.49 to 0.12, Z=1.21, p=0.23), but significantly reduced AIx (SMD=\u22120.34, 95% CI: \u22120.54 to \u22120.14, Z=3.35, p=0.0008).

        "abstract": "Consumption of a high-fat, high-fructose diet [Western diet (WD)] promotes vascular stiffness, a critical factor in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obese and diabetic women exhibit greater arterial stiffness than men, which contributes to the increased incidence of CVD in these women. Furthermore, high-fructose diets result in elevated plasma concentrations of uric acid via xanthine oxidase (XO) activation, and uric acid elevation is also associated with increased vascular stiffness. However, the mechanisms by which increased xanthine oxidase activity and uric acid contribute to vascular stiffness in obese females remain to be fully uncovered. Accordingly, we examined the impact of XO inhibition on endothelial function and vascular stiffness in female C57BL/6J mice fed a WD or regular chow for 16 wk. WD feeding resulted in increased arterial stiffness, measured by atomic force microscopy in aortic explants (16.19 \u00b1 1.72 vs. 5.21 \u00b1 0.54 kPa, P < 0.05), as well as abnormal aortic endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation. XO inhibition with allopurinol (widely utilized in the clinical setting) substantially improved vascular relaxation and attenuated stiffness (16.9 \u00b1 0.50 vs. 3.44 \u00b1 0.50 kPa, P < 0.05) while simultaneously lowering serum uric acid levels (0.55 \u00b1 0.98 vs. 0.21 \u00b1 0.04 mg/dL, P < 0.05). In addition, allopurinol improved WD-induced markers of fibrosis and oxidative stress in aortic tissue, as analyzed by immunohistochemistry and transmission electronic microscopy. Collectively, these results demonstrate that XO inhibition protects against WD-induced vascular oxidative stress, fibrosis, impaired vasorelaxation, and aortic stiffness in females. Furthermore, excessive oxidative stress resulting from XO activation appears to play a key role in mediating vascular dysfunction induced by chronic exposure to WD consumption in females.",

        "title": "Sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated endothelial ENaC activity and stiffening in mice.",
        "abstract": "Obesity and insulin resistance stiffen the vasculature with females appearing to be more adversely affected. As augmented arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the increased predisposition of obese and insulin-resistant women to arterial stiffening may explain their heightened risk for CVD. However, the cellular mechanisms by which females are more vulnerable to arterial stiffening associated with obesity and insulin resistance remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that female mice are more susceptible to Western diet-induced endothelial cell stiffening compared to age-matched males. Mechanistically, we show that the increased stiffening of the vascular intima in Western diet-fed female mice is accompanied by enhanced epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in endothelial cells (EnNaC). Our data further indicate that: 1) estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) increases EnNaC activity to a larger extent in females compared to males, 2) estrogen-induced activation of EnNaC is mediated by the serum glucocorticoid inducible-kinase 1 (SGK-1), and 3) estrogen signaling stiffens endothelial cells when nitric oxide is lacking and this stiffening effect can be reduced with amiloride, an ENaC inhibitor. In aggregate, we demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated endothelial stiffening, whereby females are more vulnerable than males. In females, endothelial stiffening with obesity may be attributed to estrogen signaling through the ER\u03b1-SGK-1-EnNaC axis, thus establishing a putative therapeutic target for female obesity-related vascular stiffening.",

        "abstract": "Consumption of a western diet (WD) induces central aortic stiffening that contributes to transmittance of pulsatile blood flow to end organs including the kidney. Our recent work support that endothelial epithelial sodium channel (EnNaC) expression and activation enhances aortic endothelial cell stiffening through reductions in endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and bioavailable NO that result in inflammatory/oxidant responses and perivascular fibrosis. However, the role that EnNaC activation has on endothelial responses in the renal circulation remain unknown. We hypothesized that cell-specific deletion of the \u03b1 subunit of EnNaC would prevent WD-induced central aortic stiffness and protect the kidney from endothelial dysfunction and vascular stiffening. 28-week-old female \u03b1EnNaC KO and wild-type mice were fed either mouse chow or WD containing excess fat (46%), sucrose and fructose (17.5% each). WD feeding increased fat mass, indices of vascular stiffening in the aorta and renal artery (in vivo pulse wave velocity and ultrasound) and renal endothelial cell stiffening (ex vivo atomic force microscopy). WD further impaired aortic endothelial-dependent relaxation and renal artery compliance (pressure myography) without changes in blood pressure. WD-induced renal arterial stiffening occurred in parallel to attenuated eNOS activation, increased oxidative stress and aortic and renal perivascular fibrosis. \u03b1EnNaC deletion prevented these abnormalities and support a novel mechanism by which WDs contribute to renal arterial stiffening that is endothelial- and sodium channel-dependent. These results demonstrate that cell-specific EnNaC is important in propagating pulsatility into the renal circulation generating oxidant stress, reduced bioavailable NO and renal vessel wall fibrosis and stiffening.",

The source paper establishes a link between EnNaC activity and vascular stiffening in females, and this paper builds on that finding by investigating the role of EnNaC in renal artery endothelial stiffening."

        "abstract": "The maintenance of endothelial health is required for normal vascular function and blood pressure regulation. The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in endothelial cells has emerged as a new molecular player in the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide production and vascular stiffness. While ENaC expression in the kidney is negatively regulated by high [Na+], ENaC expression in isolated endothelial cells has been shown to increase in response to a high extracellular [Na+]. In culture, this increased expression leads to cellular stiffening and decreased nitric oxide release. In vivo, the effects of high salt diet on endothelial ENaC expression and activity have varied depending on the animal model utilized. Our aim in the present study was to examine the role of endothelial ENaC in mediating vasorelaxation in the C57Bl/6 mouse strain. We utilized pressure myography to test the responsiveness of thoracodorsal arteries to acetylcholine in mice with increased sodium consumption both in the presence and absence of increased aldosterone. ENaC\u2019s contribution was assessed with the use of the specific inhibitor amiloride. We found that while aldosterone had very little effect on ENaC's contribution to acetylcholine sensitivity, a high salt diet led to an amiloride\u2010dependent shift in the acetylcholine response of vessels. However, the direction of this shift was dependent on the length of high salt diet administration. Overall, our studies reveal that ENaC's role in the endothelium may be more complicated than previously thought. The channel does not simply inhibit nitric oxide generation, but instead helps preserve a homeostatic response.",
