        "title": "Ibuprofen in rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical study of analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.",
        "abstract": "Ibuprofen (2-4'-isobutylphenylpropionic acid) is one of a series of phenylalkanoic acids which have been found to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. The first of these to be successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was Ibufenac (isobutylphenylacetic acid) (Chalmers, 1963; Thompson, Stephenson, and Percy, 1964; Hart and Boardman, 1965) and the most recent of the series is Ibuprofen. Pharmacological studies have shown that the compound is between two to eight times more potent than aspirin (Adams, Cliffe, Lessel, and Nicholson, 1967). In this paper we report a double-blind cross-over study of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis of a daily dose of 750 mg. Ibuprofen compared with aspirin 5g./day and prednisolone 15 mg./day; each drug being administered orally for a period of one week.",
