        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAntithrombotic drugs are used after coronary-artery stenting to prevent stent thrombosis. We compared the efficacy and safety of three antithrombotic-drug regimens - aspirin alone, aspirin and warfarin, and aspirin and ticlopidine - after coronary stenting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 1965 patients who underwent coronary stenting at 50 centers, 1653 (84.1 percent) met angiographic criteria for successful placement of the stent and were randomly assigned to one of three regimens: aspirin alone (557 patients), aspirin and warfarin (550 patients), or aspirin and ticlopidine (546 patients). All clinical events reflecting stent thrombosis were included in the prespecified primary end point: death, revascularization of the target lesion, angiographically evident thrombosis, or myocardial infarction within 30 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point was observed in 38 patients: 20 (3.6 percent) assigned to receive aspirin alone, 15 (2.7 percent) assigned to receive aspirin and warfarin, and 3 (0.5 percent) assigned to receive aspirin and ticlopidine (P=0.001 for the comparison of all three groups). Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 10 patients (1.8 percent) who received aspirin alone, 34 (6.2 percent) who received aspirin and warfarin, and 30 (5.5 percent) who received aspirin and ticlopidine (P<0.001 for the comparison of all three groups); the incidence of vascular surgical complications was 0.4 percent (2 patients), 2.0 percent (11 patients), and 2.0 percent (11 patients), respectively (P=0.01). There were no significant differences in the incidence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (overall incidence, 0.3 percent) among the three treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs compared with aspirin alone and a combination of aspirin and warfarin, treatment with aspirin and ticlopidine resulted in a lower rate of stent thrombosis, although there were more hemorrhagic complications than with aspirin alone. After coronary stenting, aspirin and ticlopidine should be considered for the prevention of the serious complication of stent thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "In response to physiological stimuli (eg, wound healing), normally quiescent smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the vessel wall can be activated to migrate and proliferate to produce new blood vessels. In addition to this physiological response, pathological migration and proliferation within the vessel wall can occur in disease states. Examples of such disease states include tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, accelerated arteriopathy after cardiac transplantation, and neointimal proliferation after balloon angioplasty (PTCA) and stent placement. An important limitation of PTCA is restenosis, which is due in large part to luminal narrowing; restenosis occurs in 20% to 40% of patients within the first few months after a successful intervention.1,2 The percentage of patients that develop early restenosis after PTCA can be reduced by stent implantation. However, stents actually increase the amount of late luminal narrowing due to intimal hyperplasia,3 and the overall rate of stent restenosis remains unacceptably high (\u224830%).\n\nNumerous pharmacological agents, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors, and cytotoxic agents, have failed to adequately reduce restenosis after PTCA and stenting. Novel therapeutic approaches based on understanding the molecular mechanisms that cause intimal hyperplasia are needed to reduce the high incidence of stent restenosis. Arterial injury is associated with SMC activation and re-entry into the cell cycle. Multiple approaches to inhibiting SMC proliferation have been and are being evaluated. Gene delivery systems aimed at blocking SMC proliferation after PTCA have been tested4,5; however, the low efficiency and/or potential hazards of this approach may limit its usefulness. Radiation therapy has been evaluated in numerous studies and has shown considerable promise as a nonpharmacological, antiproliferative approach for the reduction of restenosis. However, significant side effects, including late stent thrombosis, may also limit its usefulness.6\u20138 The unusually late stent thrombosis seen in the patients treated with \u2026",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPreliminary reports of studies involving simple coronary lesions indicate that a sirolimus-eluting stent significantly reduces the risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard stent in 1058 patients at 53 centers in the United States who had a newly diagnosed lesion in a native coronary artery. The coronary disease in these patients was complex because of the frequent presence of diabetes (in 26 percent of patients), the high percentage of patients with longer lesions (mean, 14.4 mm), and small vessels (mean, 2.80 mm). The primary end point was failure of the target vessel (a composite of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, and repeated percutaneous or surgical revascularization of the target vessel) within 270 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rate of failure of the target vessel was reduced from 21.0 percent with a standard stent to 8.6 percent with a sirolimus-eluting stent (P<0.001)--a reduction that was driven largely by a decrease in the frequency of the need for revascularization of the target lesion (16.6 percent in the standard-stent group vs. 4.1 percent in the sirolimus-stent group, P<0.001). The frequency of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent was also decreased in the group that received sirolimus-eluting stents, as assessed by both angiography and intravascular ultrasonography. Subgroup analyses revealed a reduction in the rates of angiographic restenosis and target-lesion revascularization in all subgroups examined.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this randomized clinical trial involving patients with complex coronary lesions, the use of a sirolimus-eluting stent had a consistent treatment effect, reducing the rates of restenosis and associated clinical events in all subgroups analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the efficacy and safety of biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents with those of bare metal stents and durable polymer drug eluting stents. Design Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of 258\u2009544 patient years of follow-up from randomized trials. Data sources and study selection PubMed, Embase, and Central were searched for randomized trials comparing any of the Food and Drug Administration approved durable polymer drug eluting stents (sirolimus eluting, paclitaxel eluting, cobalt chromium everolimus eluting, platinum chromium everolimus eluting, zotarolimus eluting-Endeavor, and zotarolimus eluting-Resolute) or biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents, with each other or against bare metal stents. Outcomes Long term efficacy (target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis). Landmark analysis at more than one year was evaluated to assess the potential late benefit of biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents. Results From 126 randomized trials and 258\u2009544 patient years of follow-up, for long term efficacy (target vessel revascularization), biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to paclitaxel eluting stents (rate ratio 0.66, 95% credibility interval 0.57 to 0.78) and zotarolimus eluting stent-Endeavor (0.69, 0.56 to 0.84) but not to newer generation durable polymer drug eluting stents (for example: 1.03, 0.89 to 1.21 versus cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents). Similarly, biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to paclitaxel eluting stents (rate ratio 0.61, 0.37 to 0.89) but inferior to cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents (2.04, 1.27 to 3.35) for long term safety (definite stent thrombosis). In the landmark analysis after one year, biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to sirolimus eluting stents for definite stent thrombosis (rate ratio 0.29, 0.10 to 0.82) but were associated with increased mortality compared with cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents (1.52, 1.02 to 2.22). Overall, among all stent types, the newer generation durable polymer drug eluting stents (zotarolimus eluting stent-Resolute, cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents, and platinum chromium everolimus eluting stents) were the most efficacious (lowest target vessel revascularization rate) stents, and cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents were the safest with significant reductions in definite stent thrombosis (rate ratio 0.35, 0.21 to 0.53), myocardial infarction (0.65, 0.55 to 0.75), and death (0.72, 0.58 to 0.90) compared with bare metal stents. Conclusions Biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents are superior to first generation durable polymer drug eluting stents but not to newer generation durable polymer stents in reducing target vessel revascularization. Newer generation durable polymer stents, and especially cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents, have the best combination of efficacy and safety. The utility of biodegradable polymer stents in the context of excellent clinical outcomes with newer generation durable polymer stents needs to be proven.",

        "abstract": "Background and study aims: The optimal method of perioperative management of antiplatelet agents during endoscopic procedures that carry a high risk of bleeding is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of continuing aspirin treatment during these procedures in an Asian population. Patients and methods: A multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at six high volume endoscopy centers in Japan. The study included patients at high risk of thromboembolism who were regularly taking antiplatelet agents (e.\u200ag. thienopyridine derivatives and aspirin). Enrolled patients continued their aspirin therapy, and underwent endoscopic procedures that had a high risk of bleeding for treatment of lesions in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. The primary end point was the rate of major bleeding complications after endoscopic procedures. Results: The study was terminated in accordance with predetermined safety criteria because 7 of 28 consecutive patients experienced major bleeding complications (25.0\u200a%; 95\u200a% confidence interval 10.7\u200a%\u200a\u2013\u200a44.9\u200a%). All major bleeding complications occurred following endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD; 6 stomach, 1 colon). Univariate analysis showed that postoperative administration of thienopyridine derivatives was the only significant factor associated with postoperative bleeding (P\u200a=\u200a0.01). Subanalysis of gastric ESD (23 lesions in 19 patients) confirmed that the administration of thienopyridine derivatives (P\u200a=\u200a0.01) and that of multiple agents (P\u200a=\u200a0.02) were the significant factors. All bleeding complications (postoperative day 11.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.5) occurred after resuming thienopyridine derivative therapy postoperatively (postoperative day 2.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.4). Conclusion: In Asian patients taking thienopyridine derivatives with aspirin, cautious postoperative care is necessary for those undergoing endoscopic procedures that are associated with a high risk of bleeding, especially gastric ESD. Continuation of aspirin alone during these endoscopic procedures may be acceptable. Study registration: UMIN000009176.",

        "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a widely used procedure as curative treatment for superficial gastric neoplasms, including early gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis. However, ESD requires advanced endoscopic skill and there is a major concern regarding complications from bleeding. So far, extensive efforts have been made to develop strategies to reduce post-ESD bleeding. Use of proton pump inhibitors and coagulating exposed vessels on the ulcer \ufb02oor after ESD are strategies known to reduce the risk of delayed bleeding. Second-look endoscopy (SLE) is also carried out to reduce delayed bleeding following ESD in many institutions. However, the incidence of bleeding still remains around 5%, and further measures are needed to reduce delayed bleeding after gastric ESD. Recently, three randomized studies indicated that routine SLE was unnecessary. Although routine SLE may not be recommended for all patients after gastric ESD, SLE might be an important tool for the prevention of the delayed bleeding in selected high-risk patients. Thus, the identification of the risk factors, such as large size of resected specimen and treatment with multiple antiplatelet medications, may help to further guide clinicians in deciding whether to perform SLE. Studies carried out on larger cohorts are necessary to clarify the efficacy of SLE after ESD in the prevention of post-ESD bleeding in potentially high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Balancing the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events for patients who use aspirin and need to undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms is a delicate process. The current guidelines from different associations provide inconsistent recommendations. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2017 for studies that compared the risk of post-ESD bleeding in patients who continued aspirin vs. those who discontinued aspirin preoperatively. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results: A total of five studies that included 700 patients were identified. Our meta-analysis could not demonstrate a significantly increased risk of post-ESD bleeding among the aspirin-continued group compared to the aspirin-interrupted group, the pooled OR being 1.81 (95%CI 0.85-3.83). The statistical heterogeneity was insignificant, with an I2 of 25%. Nine thrombotic events occurred in the aspirin-interrupted group whereas none occurred in the aspirin-continued group. Conclusions: This meta-analysis could not demonstrate that continuation of aspirin significantly increases the risk of post-ESD bleeding. However, the analysis was restricted by the small sample size and the observational nature of the primary studies. Randomized controlled trials are still needed to clarify this risk.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The periprocedural management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) using a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) undergoing elective gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedure remains uncertain. We investigated the safety of a standardized periprocedural DOAC management strategy. METHODS: The Periprocedural Anticoagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation cohort study enrolled adult patients receiving a DOAC (apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran) for AF scheduled for an elective procedure or surgery. This analysis addresses patients undergoing digestive endoscopy. Standardized periprocedural management consisted of DOAC interruption 1 day preendoscopy with resumption 1 day after procedure at low-moderate risk of bleeding or 2 days in case of a high bleeding risk. Thirty-day outcomes included GI bleeding, thromboembolic events, and mortality. RESULTS: Of 556 patients on a DOAC (mean [SD] age of 72.5 [8.6] years; 37.4% female; mean CHADS2 score 1.7 [1.0]), 8.6% were also on American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) and 0.7% on clopidogrel. Most of the patients underwent colonoscopies (63.3%) or gastroscopies (14.0%), with 18.9% having both on the same procedural day. The mean total duration of DOAC interruption was 3.9 \u00b1 1.6 days. Four patients experienced an arterial thromboembolic event (0.7%, 0.3%\u20131.8%) within 24.2 \u00b1 5.9 days of DOAC interruption. GI bleeding events occurred in 2.5% (1.4%\u20134.2%) within 11.1 \u00b1 8.1 days (range: 0.6; 25.5 days) of endoscopy, with major GI bleeding in 0.9% (0.4%\u20132.1%). Three patients died (0.5%; 0.2%\u20131.6%) 15.6\u201322.3 days after the endoscopy.
