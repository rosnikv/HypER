        "title": "Direct comparison of two different mesalamine formulations for the induction of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis: A double-blind, randomized study",
        "abstract": "Background: Mesalamine is the first\u2010line drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We directly compared the efficacy and safety of two mesalamine formulations for the induction of remission in patients with UC. Methods: In a multicenter, double\u2010blind, randomized study, 229 patients with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate active UC were assigned to 4 groups: 66 and 65 received a pH\u2010dependent release formulation of 2.4 g/day (pH\u20102.4 g) or 3.6 g/day (pH\u20103.6 g), respectively; 65 received a time\u2010dependent release formulation of 2.25 g/day (Time\u20102.25 g), and 33 received placebo (Placebo). The drugs were administered three times daily for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was a decrease in the UC disease activity index (UC\u2010DAI). Results: In the full analysis set (n = 225) the decrease in UC\u2010DAI in each group was 1.5 in pH\u20102.4 g, 2.9 in pH\u20103.6 g, 1.3 in Time\u20102.25 g and 0.3 in Placebo, respectively. These results demonstrate the superiority of pH\u20103.6 g over Time\u20102.25 g (P = 0.003) and the noninferiority of pH\u20102.4 g to Time\u20102.25 g. Among the patients with proctitis\u2010type UC, a significant decrease in UC\u2010DAI was observed in pH\u20102.4 g and pH\u20103.6 g as compared to Placebo, but not in Time\u20102.25 g. No differences were observed in the safety profiles. Conclusions: Higher dose of the pH\u2010dependent release formulation was more effective for induction of remission in patients with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate active UC. Additionally, the pH\u2010dependent release formulation was preferable to the time\u2010dependent release formulation for patients with proctitis\u2010type UC (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, no. C000000288). (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2010)",

        "title": "Concentration dependence of 5-aminosalicylic acid pharmacological actions in intestinal mucosa after oral administration of a pH-dependent formulation.",
        "abstract": "Asacol, a medication that delivers delayed release 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is a useful therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the relationship between its pharmacological actions and intestinal concentrations has not been studied in detail. Therefore, our aim was to assess 5-ASA's pharmacological actions as a function of its concentration at its target site. We first evaluated 5-ASA's release profiles in vitro by the paddle method and found that Asacol starts to release 5-ASA at pH \u2265 7. Orally administered Asacol pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in dogs. Asacol's T(max) was much longer than that of the time-dependent release 5-ASA formulation. We also determined 5-ASA's distribution in the intestinal mucosa and found that it is effectively delivered there by Asacol. These results indicated that Asacol released 5-ASA in a pH-dependent manner, resulting in efficient delivery to the large intestine. We also compared the mucosal 5-ASA concentrations with the IC(50) values for scavenging free radicals or suppressing LTB(4) production. The 5-ASA concentration in the large intestine was higher than IC(50) values necessary to suppress inflammatory processes. We also report the release characteristics of Asacol and the targeted delivery of 5-ASA to affected sites in IBD patients.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the concentration dependence of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) pharmacological actions in intestinal mucosa after oral administration of a pH-dependent formulation. Although it does not directly build on or use the findings of the source paper as a sub-hypothesis, it is related to the source paper's topic of mesalamine formulations for ulcerative colitis treatment. The source paper compares the efficacy and safety of two mesalamine formulations, while this paper investigates the pharmacological actions of 5-ASA, which is the active component of mesalamine. Thus, the key hypothesis in this paper is inspired by the topic of the source paper."

        "title": "Influence of Pharmaceutical Formulation on the Mucosal Concentration of 5-Aminosalicylic Acid and N-Acetylmesalamine in Japanese Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.",
        "abstract": "The efficacy of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) as the first-line therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC) is determined by the extent of drug delivery to the inflamed region. Moreover, differences among the various formulations influence delivery of the drug. In this study, we examined the clinical significance of colonic mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA and N-acetylmesalamine (Ac-5-ASA) in UC patients receiving a pH-dependent or time-dependent release formulation of 5-ASA. The subjects were 67 patients with UC who were treated with a pH-dependent or time-dependent formulation of 5-ASA between December 2011 and April 2014. A retrospective observational analysis of clinical outcomes was performed using the clinical activity index (CAI) obtained on the day of biopsy. Colonic mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA in biopsy samples were measured by LC-tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Patients who were treated with the pH-dependent formulation had higher colon mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA than those who were treated with the time-dependent formulation. Additionally, 5-ASA concentration was significantly higher in patients with CAI scores \u22643. A higher concentration of Ac-5-ASA was achieved with the time-dependent formulation than with the pH-dependent formulation. Furthermore, patients with CAI scores \u22643 had higher concentrations of 5-ASA than those with CAI scores \u22654. The colonic mucosal concentration of 5-ASA in patients with UC is influenced by the pharmaceutical formulation and the remission status of UC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Five-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is an anti-inflammatory drug indicated in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Among the analytical methods of quantification of 5-ASA described in the literature, the High Efficiency Liquid Chromatography stands out, a sensitive technique but with a high cost. In recent years, alternative methods have been developed, presenting efficiency and reduced cost, such as UV/visible spectrophotometric, spectrofluorescent, and electrochemical methods, techniques recommended for the application in quality control and quantification of 5-ASA in pharmaceutical forms and biological fluids. This article aims to review the physicochemical characteristics, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, controlled release systems, and the different analytical and bioanalytical methods for the quantification of 5-ASA.",
