        "title": "Intramuscular interferon beta-1a in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy",
        "abstract": "Objective: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) shares immunologic features with multiple sclerosis (MS). Because IM interferon beta-1a (IM IFN\u03b2-1a) is an effective and safe treatment for MS, we conducted a dose-ranging efficacy study of IFN\u03b2-1a in patients with CIDP. Methods: Adults with IV immunoglobulin (IVIg)-dependent CIDP (n = 67) were enrolled in this 32-week double-blind trial and randomized to IM IFN\u03b2-1a. Patients received 30 \u03bcg once weekly plus placebo (n = 12), IM IFN\u03b2-1a 60 \u03bcg once weekly plus placebo (n = 11), IM IFN\u03b2-1a 30 \u03bcg twice weekly (n = 11), IM IFN\u03b2-1a 60 \u03bcg twice weekly (n = 11), or placebo twice weekly (n = 22). Participants were maintained on IVIg through week 16, when IVIg was discontinued. Patients who worsened were restarted on IVIg. The primary outcome was total IVIg dose (g/kg) administered from week 16 to 32. Results: There was no difference in total IVIg dose administered after week 16 for patients treated with IFN\u03b2-1a (1.20 g/kg) compared with placebo (1.34 g/kg; p = 0.75). However, exploratory analyses suggested IFN\u03b2-1a significantly reduced total dose of IVIg compared with placebo for participants who required either high-dose IVIg (>0.95 g/kg per month) or had greater weakness at baseline (Medical Research Council sum score <51). Adverse events included flu-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue in the IFN\u03b2-1a groups. Conclusions: Interferon beta-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a) therapy did not provide significant benefit over IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy alone for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. However, IFN\u03b2-1a might be beneficial for patients with more severe disability or those needing high doses of IVIg. Level of evidence: This study was designed to provide Class I evidence for the safety and efficacy of IM IFN\u03b2-1a in the treatment of CIDP but has been subsequently classified as Class II due to a >20% patient dropout rate. Thus, this randomized, controlled clinical trial provides Class II evidence of no effect on primary and secondary endpoints of 4 dosage regimens of IM IFN\u03b2-1a added to IVIg in persons with CIDP.",

        "abstract": "Early pathological studies in patients with acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, and the animal model experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) showed similarities in the process of demyelination. These studies focused on compact myelin proteins and peptides as targets of immune attack in Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and EAN. However, serological studies in patients with subsets of GBS highlighted the importance of gangliosides \u2013 glycolipids enriched in non\u2010compact Schwann cell regions and the node, paranodal, and internodal axolemma. In the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) rabbit model, antibodies to the ganglioside GM1 bind in the nodal region, impair Na channel clustering and disturb Schwann cell/axon organisation. Schwann cell neurobiological studies now highlight the importance of adhesion molecules, including neurofascins, gliomedin, contactins, and NrCAM to Schwann cell/axon integrity. Changes to nodal fine structure by immune responses against such molecules may provide a mechanism for reversible conduction failure or block. Recovery of patients with CIDP or multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) following treatment may sometimes be better explained by reversal of conduction failure than remyelination or regeneration. This review considers the importance of the intricate molecular arrangements at the nodal and paranodal regions in inflammatory neuropathies such as CIDP. Early images of compact myelin stripping and phagocytosis, may have diverted the research focus away from these vital non\u2010compact myelin Schwann cell areas.",

Methods: Patients with CIDP and IgG4 anti\u2013contactin-1 (CNTN1) or anti\u2013neurofascin-155 (NF155) antibodies who were resistant to IV immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were treated with rituximab and followed prospectively. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect anti-CNTN1 and anti-NF155 antibodies and ELISA with human recombinant CNTN1 and NF155 proteins was used to determine antibody titers. Results: Two patients had a marked improvement; another patient improved slightly after 10 years of stable, severe disease; and the fourth patient had an ischemic stroke unrelated to treatment and was lost to follow-up. Autoantibodies decreased in all patients after rituximab treatment. Conclusions: Rituximab treatment is an option for patients with CIDP with IgG4 anti-CNTN1/NF155 antibodies who are resistant to conventional therapies.

        "title": "Autoantibodies to nodal isoforms of neurofascin in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy",
        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory demyelination polyneuropathy is a heterogeneous and treatable immune-mediated disorder that lacks biomarkers to support diagnosis. Recent evidence indicates that paranodal proteins (contactin 1, contactin-associated protein 1, and neurofascin-155) are the targets of autoantibodies in subsets of patients showing distinct clinical presentations. Here, we identified neurofascin-186 and neurofascin-140 as the main targets of autoantibodies in five patients presenting IgG reactivity against the nodes of Ranvier. Four patients displayed predominantly IgG4 antibodies, and one patient presented IgG3 antibodies that activated the complement pathway in vitro. These patients present distinct clinical features compared to those with anti-neurofascin-155 IgG4. Most patients had a severe phenotype associated with conduction block or decreased distal motor amplitude. Four patients had a subacute-onset and sensory ataxia. Two patients presented with nephrotic syndromes and one patient with an IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were effective in three patients, and one patient remitted following rituximab treatment. Clinical remission was associated with autoantibody depletion and with recovery of conduction block and distal motor amplitude suggesting a nodo-paranodopathy. Our data demonstrate that the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for chronic inflammatory demyelination polyneuropathy are broad and may include dysfunctions at the nodes of Ranvier in a subgroup of patients.",

Methods Antibodies to neurofascin-155 (Nfasc155), neurofascin-140/186 (Nfasc140/186), contactin-1 (CNTN1), and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) were detected with ELISA and/or cell-based assay. Antibody pathogenicity was tested by immunohistochemistry on skin biopsy, intraneural injection, and cell aggregation assay. Results Of 342 patients with CIDP, 19 (5.5%) had antibodies against Nfasc155 (n = 9), Nfasc140/186 and Nfasc155 (n = 1), CNTN1 (n = 3), and Caspr1 (n = 6). Antibodies were absent from healthy and disease controls, including neuropathies of different causes, and were mostly detected in patients with European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) definite CIDP (n = 18). Predominant antibody isotypes were immunoglobulin G (IgG)4 (n = 13), IgG3 (n = 2), IgG1 (n = 2), or undetectable (n = 2). IgG4 antibody-associated phenotypes included onset before 30 years, severe neuropathy, subacute onset, tremor, sensory ataxia, and poor response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immunosuppressive treatments, including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate, proved effective if started early in IVIG-resistant IgG4-seropositive cases. Five patients with an IgG1, IgG3, or undetectable isotype showed clinical features indistinguishable from seronegative patients, including good response to IVIG. IgG4 autoantibodies were associated with morphological changes at paranodes in patients' skin biopsies. We also provided preliminary evidence from a single patient about the pathogenicity of anti-Caspr1 IgG4, showing their ability to penetrate paranodal regions and disrupt the integrity of the Nfasc155/CNTN1/Caspr1 complex. Conclusions Our findings confirm previous data on the tight clinico-serological correlation between antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins and CIDP. Despite the low prevalence, testing for their presence and isotype could ultimately be part of the diagnostic workup in suspected inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment. Classification of evidence This study provides Class III evidence that antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins identify patients with CIDP (sensitivity 6%, specificity 100%).",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have described the clinical, serological and pathological features of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and antibodies directed against the paranodal proteins neurofascin-155, contactin-1 (CNTN1), contactin-associated protein-1 (Caspr1), or nodal forms of neurofascin. Such antibodies are useful for diagnosis and potentially treatment selection. However, antibodies targeting Caspr1 only or the Caspr1/CNTN1 complex have been reported in few patients with CIDP. Moreover, it is unclear if these patients belong to the same pathophysiological subgroup. Using cell-based assays in routine clinical testing, we identified sera from patients with CIDP showing strong membrane reactivity when both CNTN1 and Caspr1 were co-transfected (but not when CNTN1 was transfected alone). Fifteen patients (10 male; aged between 40 and 75) with antibodies targeting Caspr1/CNTN1 co-transfected cells were enrolled for characterization. The prevalence of anti-Caspr1/CNTN1 antibodies was 1.9% (1/52) in the Sant Pau CIDP cohort, and 4.3% (1/23) in a German cohort of acute-onset CIDP. All patients fulfilled European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) definite diagnostic criteria for CIDP. Seven (47%) were initially diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome due to an acute-subacute onset. Six (40%) patients had cranial nerve involvement, eight (53%) reported neuropathic pain and 12 (80%) ataxia. Axonal involvement and acute denervation were frequent in electrophysiological studies. Complete response to intravenous immunoglobulin was not observed, while most (90%) responded well to rituximab. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and teased nerve fibre immunohistochemistry confirmed reactivity against the paranodal Caspr1/CNTN1 complex. Weaker reactivity against Caspr1 transfected alone was also detected in 10/15 (67%). Sera from 13 of these patients were available for testing by ELISA. All 13 samples reacted against Caspr1 by ELISA and this reactivity was enhanced when CNTN1 was added to the Caspr1 ELISA. IgG subclasses were also investigated by ELISA. IgG4 was the predominant subclass in 10 patients, while IgG3 was predominant in other three patients. In conclusion, patients with antibodies to the Caspr1/CNTN1 complex display similar serological and clinical features and constitute a single subgroup within the CIDP syndrome. These antibodies likely target Caspr1 primarily and are detected with Caspr1-only ELISA, but reactivity is optimal when CNTN1 is added to Caspr1 in cell-based assays and ELISA.",

        "title": "Antibody-Mediated Nodo- and Paranodopathies",
        "abstract": "The recent discovery of pathogenic antibodies targeting cell adhesion molecules of the node of Ranvier has prompted efforts to develop a new classification for a subset of antibody-mediated peripheral neuropathies. These autoimmune nodo- and paranodopathies encompass epitopes such as neurofascin 155, neurofascin 186, contactin-1, and contactin-associated protein 1, with a high likelihood of involving additional yet unidentified proteins. So far, the investigation of this subset of patients was primarily focused on adults, with only rare reports of pediatric cases. Low awareness among pediatricians and insufficient availability of appropriate diagnostic methods in many laboratories may mask a higher pediatric incidence than currently observed. Diagnosis is made by transfected cell-based assays and ELISA to characterize the specific target antigen and antibody subclass that provides insight into the pathophysiology. Clinical features often resemble those of CIDP or GBS in adults, whilst in pediatric patients, although rare, an atypical CIDP phenotype has predominantly been reported. Yet, in contrast to classical immune-mediated neuropathies, the clinical course is usually rapidly progressive, and response to classical first-line therapy often poor. Although electrophysiological signs of demyelination are observed, segmental demyelination and inflammation are not present on pathological examination. Rather, few neuropathological reports demonstrate features of axonal neuropathy without signs of true de- or remyelination. This review aims to summarize recent findings on such nodo- and paranodoneuropathies, shining light on features of these disorders in pediatric patients, a still little-explored field with only a few reports currently present.",
