        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate a simulated acupuncture technique for use in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of acupuncture for low-back pain.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe clinic of an accredited acupuncture college in Seattle, Washington.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nAcupuncture-na\u00efve enrollees of Group Health Cooperative who had visited their primary care provider with a complaint of back pain that persisted for at least 3 months.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nIn the first experiment, subjects received six insertions of real needles and six pokes with a toothpick in a guidetube in a two-period crossover design. In the second experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a complete treatment with real acupuncture needles or a simulated treatment using a toothpick in a guidetube.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nIn the first experiment, we compared subjects' perceptions about which implement was used for each \"insertion\" while in the second, we compared the perceptions (e.g., acupuncturist's warmth and caring, the reasonableness of acupuncture as a treatment) and pain relief of those who received an acupuncture treatment using needles to those receiving simulated acupuncture.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the first experiment, the toothpick insertions were perceived as slightly more like real needling than the real needling (mean ratings of 2.8 and 2.1, respectively; p = 0.08). In the second experiment, 52% percent of those receiving the simulated needling versus 65% of those receiving real acupuncture believed they were \"definitely\" or \"probably\" receiving real acupuncture (p = 0.33). Perceptions of acupuncture, as measured by a credibility questionnaire, were similar in the two groups. Those receiving real acupuncture were more likely to report immediate pain relief, and this was the factor most predictive of the subject's belief about which treatment they had received (p = 0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe simulated acupuncture procedure evaluated in this study represents a reasonable control treatment for acupuncture-na\u00efve individuals in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of acupuncture for low-back pain.",

        "title": "Designing an acupuncture study to meet evidence-based medical criteria: methodological considerations for logistic design and development of treatment interventions arising from the German randomized controlled acupuncture trial on chronic shoulder pain (GRASP).",
        "abstract": "The results from studies on potential treatment effects of acupuncture are often limited due to serious difficulties in methodology. Randomized controlled trials on acupuncture should test a widely accepted treatment strategy of verum and sham acupuncture. However, in clinical practice various patterns of acupuncture techniques are employed, and up to now no generally accepted guidelines on how to perform a reliable verum or sham treatment have been established. Another limitation is that in most studies the study populations are too small to obtain reliable data and to detect subtle differences between the unspecific needling of sham acupuncture and specific needling of verum acupuncture with sufficient statistical power. Moreover, only a multicenter trial in an outpatient setting would guarantee a naturalistic environment in which acupuncture is used in clinical practice. In the present report we discuss such methodological aspects in detail and summarize some practical considerations for planning an acupuncture trial that fulfills evidence-based medical criteria. The largest German study on the treatment effects of acupuncture in patients with chronic shoulder pain (recruited patients n = 452), might serve as an example for such a well-designed study. Before we could conduct our study, clear definitions and protocols for the verum and sham acupuncture treatments as well as adequate endpoints had to be developed. For this we used a combination of a comprehensive study of the literature and structured interviews with experienced physicians followed by an expert panel. A total of 41 physicians had to be trained to achieve a homogeneously high quality of acupuncture treatment. The latter represents a prerequisite for reproducibility, constituting a critical component of rigorous efficacy trials in scientific acupuncture research.",

        "title": "Is There a Role for Acupuncture in the Symptom Management of Patients Receiving Palliative Care for Cancer? A Pilot Study of 20 Patients Comparing Acupuncture with Nurse-Led Supportive Care",
        "abstract": "Purpose A pilot study to document changes in symptoms after acupuncture or nurse-led supportive care in patients with incurable cancer. Methods Patients receiving palliative care with estimated survival of at least 3 months were screened with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). Patients (n=20) with significant symptoms were randomised to receive weekly acupuncture or nurse-led supportive care for 4 weeks. ESAS scores were obtained before and after each treatment, and weekly for 6 weeks after treatment by telephone. Results 42 of 170 patients screened were eligible. 20 gave consent for recruitment. The compliance rate was 90% for acupuncture and 80% for nurse-led supportive care. Total symptom scores were reduced by an average of 22% after each acupuncture visit and by 14% after each supportive care visit. Compared with baseline, ESAS scores at the end of the follow-up period were reduced by 19% for the acupuncture arm and 26% for nurse-led supportive care. Conclusion Patients appear to benefit from incorporating acupuncture in the treatment of advanced incurable cancer. Acupuncture was well tolerated with no significant or unexpected side effects. Acupuncture had an immediate effect on all symptoms, whereas nurse-led supportive care had a larger impact 6 weeks after the final session. Both interventions appear helpful to this population and warrant further study.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewAlthough clinicians and researchers acknowledge symptom clusters, the focus has been on relieving a single symptom. This review summarizes the recent literature on interventions that focus on relief of symptom clusters in patients with cancer. Recent findingsTwelve intervention studies meeting inclusion criteria were published in 2011\u20132012. The timeframe was expanded to 2009\u20132012 and 24 studies met the criteria: 18 in early stage and 6 in advanced-stage cancer patients. Several cognitive behavioral therapy, complementary therapy, and exercise interventions demonstrated positive outcomes in relieving a variety of symptom clusters in several cancer types. Most psychoeducational interventions using traditional formats or those combined with automated clinician alerts demonstrated effectiveness in reducing a variety of clusters. Clusters that included fatigue and anxiety or depression were reduced by exercise in early stage patients and by methylphenidate in advanced-stage patients. Current NIH R01 funded studies verified the trends in the types of interventions being tested. SummaryFew interventions have been tested and found to be effective in relieving the specific symptom clusters in early and advanced-stage cancer patients. Future research needs to expand our understanding of the mechanisms that initiate co-occurring symptoms. Mechanism-targeted interventions need to be identified and tested in homogeneous samples with specific symptom clusters. Interventions need to be replicated before guidelines can be established.",

        "title": "Auricular Point Acupressure (APA) to Manage a Symptom Cluster of Pain, Fatigue, and Disturbed Sleep in Breast Cancer Patients: A Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "Purpose: To examine the feasibility of an auricular point acupressure (APA) to manage a symptom cluster of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance; to explore the potential utility of APA for reducing these symptoms in breast cancer patients. \nDesign/Research approach: This was an open-pilot trial, with repeated observational research design. Setting: Participants were recruited from cancer outpatient clinics in an urban setting. Sample: Breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment (n=31). \nMethods: The APA treatment protocol was designed to manage a pre-selected symptom cluster of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance in breast cancer patients. Participants received one in-person APA treatment, and the participants were taught to press the seeds three times a day for 3 minutes each time for 7 days to allow them to continue the treatment on their own at home to manage symptoms. Main Research Variables: Symptom severity, analgesic use, and functional status. \nFindings: The retention and adherence rate was 93%. After 7 days of APA treatment, pain, fatigue, sleep, and other symptoms decreased by a clinically significant amount (symptom severity decrease \u2265 30%). Analgesic use was a statistically significant predictor for the symptom cluster of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. However, functional status and perceived efficacy of APA treatment had no statistically significant influence on the symptom cluster. \nConclusions: APA may provide an inexpensive and effective complementary approach for the management of specific symptom cluster of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance for breast cancer patients receiving cancer treatment; further study is warranted. Implication for Nursing: APA is a non-invasive method which can be used to self-manage cancer symptoms. Nurses without formal training in acupuncture easily can be trained to administer APA.",

        "title": "The Effects of Auricular Acupressure on Joint Pain and Shoulder Range of Motion in Older Adults",
        "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effects of auricular acupressure on shoulder pain and shoulder joint Range of Motion (ROM) in older adults. Methods: This is an experimental, single-blind, randomized study with a placebo-controlled approach. The participants were older adults with shoulder pain. Each group was assigned 27 participants. The experimental group received auricular acupressure on shoulder pain-related points and the placebo-control group received auricular acupressure on shoulder pain-unrelated points. The intervention was implemented for eight weeks. To validate the effects of the treatment, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPTs), and ROM were conducted. VAS was measured before and after every intervention. SPADI, PPTs, and ROM were measured at the beginning and end of every intervention. Results: The VAS scores in the experimental group with auricular acupressure significantly decreased with time ( p < .001) and SPADI scores also significantly decreased ( p < .001) compared with the scores of the placebo-control group. The experimental group's PPTs for their upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboideus major increased significantly, compared to that of the placebo-control group. The experimental group's ROM of flexion, abduction, and external rotation increased significantly compared to the placebo-control group. but there were no significant differences in internal rotation. Conclusion: Auricular acupressure, applied for eight weeks, was found to effectively reduce shoulder joint pain and shoulder ROM. Consequently, auricular acupressure can be used as a nursing intervention method to reduce joint pain and improve shoulder ROM in elders.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the effects of auricular acupressure (AA) therapy on psychological factors, sleep quality, and salivary cortisol levels in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: This was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled comparative pretest-posttest study that applied AA for three weeks. The experimental group received AA on the shenmen, sympathetic, subcortical, and adrenal areas, while the control group received acupuncture in four areas along the helix. Nineteen participants were assigned to the experimental group and 21 to the control group. All participants were community-dwelling seniors aged 65 years or older who had an Insomnia Severity Index score of 8 or higher and experienced psychological stress. Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the Korean version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale for psychological factors, and the Korean version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and morning salivary cortisol levels were measured to evaluate sleep quality. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for depression (t=5.56, p<.001), anxiety (t=3.53, p=.001), and stress (t=3.55, p=.001). The PSQI (t=4.72, p<.001) and salivary cortisol levels (z=-4.21, p<.001) showed statistically significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: AA demonstrated its effectiveness as an intervention for addressing complex symptoms in community-dwelling older adults. It was found to alleviate depression, anxiety, and stress, enhance sleep quality, and reduce salivary cortisol levels.",
