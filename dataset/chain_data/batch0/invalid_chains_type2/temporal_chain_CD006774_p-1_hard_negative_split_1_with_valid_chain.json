        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases, which largely comprise ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, are increasingly posing as a global threat because of the incompetence of the current therapy in the entire patient population. This necessitates the identification of alternative therapeutic molecules or their combinations, which may serve as effective first-line or maintenance therapeutics. In this quest, celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibiting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent and curcumin, a natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, have both been found to be useful in alleviating UC. Furthermore, studies involving their combination have proved synergistic action of these two agents. In the current investigation, we have formulated pH-sensitive nanoparticles of curcumin-celecoxib combination as a potential therapy for UC. Synergistic action of the drug combination, delivery advantages of nanosized carriers, and pH-sensitive nature of the polymer were collectively hypothesized to reduce the overall toxicity and total dose of celecoxib and provide enhanced efficacy for mitigating UC. The hypothesis was confirmed in a UC model in rats, where pH-sensitive nanoparticles of the drug combination were found to be more efficacious than nanoparticles of either drugs or drug/s suspension. Further, the blank nanoparticles did not exhibit any therapeutic effect, thereby confirming efficacy of the drug combination for treating UC.",

        "title": "Therapeutic Applications of Curcumin Nanoformulations",
        "abstract": "Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a bioactive and major phenolic component of turmeric derived from the rhizomes of curcuma longa linn. For centuries, curcumin has exhibited excellent therapeutic benefits in various diseases. Owing to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin plays a significant beneficial and pleiotropic regulatory role in various pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inflammatory disorders, neurological disorders, and so on. Despite such phenomenal advances in medicinal applications, the clinical implication of native curcumin is hindered due to low solubility, physico-chemical instability, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and poor pharmacokinetics. However, these issues can be overcome by utilizing an efficient delivery system. Active scientific research was initiated in 2005 to improve curcumin\u2019s pharmacokinetics, systemic bioavailability, and biological activity by encapsulating or by loading curcumin into nanoform(s) (nanoformulations). A significant number of nanoformulations exist that can be translated toward medicinal use upon successful completion of pre-clinical and human clinical trials. Considering this perspective, current review provides an overview of an efficient curcumin nanoformulation for a targeted therapeutic option for various human diseases. In this review article, we discuss the clinical evidence, current status, and future opportunities of curcumin nanoformulation(s) in the field of medicine. In addition, this review presents a concise summary of the actions required to develop curcumin nanoformulations as pharmaceutical or nutraceutical candidates.",

        "title": "Ameliorative Effect of Curcumin-Encapsulated Hyaluronic Acid\u2013PLA Nanoparticles on Thioacetamide-Induced Murine Hepatic Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "In this study, we developed curcumin-encapsulated hyaluronic acid\u2013polylactide nanoparticles (CEHPNPs) to be used for liver fibrosis amelioration. CD44, the hyaluronic acid (HA) receptor, is upregulated on the surface of cancer cells and on activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) rather than normal cells. CEHPNPs could bind to CD44 and be internalized effectively through endocytosis to release curcumin, a poor water-soluble liver protective agent. Thus, CEHPNPs were potentially not only improving drug efficiency, but also targeting aHSCs. HA and polylactide (PLA) were crosslinked by adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH). The synthesis of HA\u2013PLA was monitored by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The average particle size was approximately 60\u201370 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Zeta potential was around \u221230 mV, which suggested a good stability of the particles. This drug delivery system induced significant aHSC cell death without affecting quiescent HSCs, hepatic epithelial, and parenchymal cells. This system reduced drug dosage without sacrificing therapeutic efficacy. The cytotoxicity IC50 (inhibitory concentration at 50%) value of CEHPNPs was approximately 1/30 to that of the free drug treated group in vitro. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of CEHPNPs were as effective as the group treated with the same curcumin dose intensity in vivo. CEHPNPs significantly reduced serum aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (ALT/AST) significantly, and attenuated tissue collagen production and cell proliferation as revealed by liver biopsy. Conclusively, the advantages of superior biosafety and satisfactory therapeutic effect mean that CEHPNPs hold great potential for treating hepatic fibrosis.",

        "title": "Macrophage repolarization using CD44-targeting hyaluronic acid\u2013polylactide nanoparticles containing curcumin",
        "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of using a natural substance, curcumin, encapsulated in CD44-targeting hyaluronate\u2013polylactide (HA-PLA) nanoparticles (NPs) for the modulation of macrophage polarity from the pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. For this purpose, the characterization of the NPs was monitored using 1HNMR, FTIR, DLS and FE-SEM. The effects of curcumin-encapsulated HA-PLA NPs on the viability of LPS/IFN-\u03b3 stimulated peritoneal macrophages were determined using MTT assay. The cellular uptake of free curcumin and nano-formulated curcumin was assessed using confocal microscopy. Also, the expression levels of iNOS-2 (M1 marker), Arg-1 (M2 marker) and also pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by real-time PCR. Data showed that the nano-formulated curcumin with spherical shape, an average diameter of 102.5\u2009nm and high cellular uptake was significantly less toxic to peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, the nano-formulated curcumin effectively indicated a reduction in iNOS-2 and an increase in Arg-1 levels than free curcumin. The change in macrophage phenotype by curcumin-encapsulated HA-PLA NPs could suppress the inflammation in LPS/IFN-\u03b3 stimulated macrophages as evidenced by a major reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusively, the results suggested that the curcumin formulation with CD44-targeting HA-PLA NPs might be a promising platform for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

        "title": "Spotlight on 17\u2010AAG as an Hsp90 inhibitor for molecular targeted cancer treatment",
        "abstract": "Hsp90 is a ubiquitous chaperone with important roles in the organization and maturation of client proteins that are involved in the progression and survival of cancer cells. Multiple oncogenic pathways can be affected by inhibition of Hsp90 function through degradation of its client proteins. That makes Hsp90 a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. 17\u2010allylamino\u201017\u2010demethoxy\u2010geldanamycin (17\u2010AAG) is a potent Hsp90 inhibitor that binds to Hsp90 and inhibits its chaperoning function, which results in the degradation of Hsp90's client proteins. There have been several preclinical studies of 17\u2010AAG as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer agents for a wide range of human cancers. Data from various phases of clinical trials show that 17\u2010AAG can be given safely at biologically active dosages with mild toxicity. Even though 17\u2010AAG has suitable pharmacological potency, its low water solubility and high hepatotoxicity could significantly restrict its clinical use. Nanomaterials\u2010based drug delivery carriers may overcome these drawbacks. In this paper, we review preclinical and clinical research on 17\u2010AAG as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents. In addition, we highlight the potential of using nanocarriers and nanocombination therapy to improve therapeutic effects of 17\u2010AAG.",

        "title": "17-AAG synergizes with Belinostat to exhibit a negative effect on the proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies that threaten the health of women. Although there are a few chemotherapies for the clinical treatment of breast cancer, these therapies are faced with the problems of drug-resistance and metastasis. Drug combination can help to reduce the adverse side effects of chemotherapies using single drugs, and also help to overcome common drug-resistance during clinical treatment of breast cancer. The present study reported the synergistic effect of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17-AAG and the histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor Belinostat in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cells, by detection of proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest following treatment with this combination. Subsequently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data was collected and analyzed to investigate the synergistic mechanism of this combination. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways revealed by RNA-seq data analysis, a wound-healing assay was used to investigate the effect of this combination on the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared with treatment with 17-AAG or Belinostat alone, both the viability inhibition and apoptosis rate of MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly enhanced in the combination group. The combination index values were <1 in three concentration groups. Revealed by the RNA-seq data analysis, the most significantly enriched KEGG pathways in the combination group were closely associated with cell migration. Based on these findings, the anti-migration effect of this combination was investigated. It was revealed that the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly suppressed in the combination group compared with in the groups treated with 17-AAG or Belinostat alone. In terms of specific genes, the mRNA expression levels of TEA domain family proteins were significantly decreased in the combination group, whereas the phosphorylation of YY1 associated protein 1 and modulator of VRAC current 1 was significantly enhanced in the combination group. These alterations may help to explain the anti-migration effect of this combination. Belinostat has already been approved as a treatment for T-cell lymphoma and 17-AAG is undergoing clinical trials. These findings could provide a beneficial reference for the clinical treatment of patients with TNBC.",

        "title": "CXCL1 Clone Evolution Induced by the HDAC Inhibitor Belinostat Might Be a Favorable Prognostic Indicator in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer",
        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer due to its lack of treatment options. Patients with TNBC frequently develop resistance to chemotherapy. As epigenetic-based antineoplastic drugs, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have achieved particular efficacy in lymphoma but are less efficacious in solid tumors, and the resistance mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, the GSE129944 microarray dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was downloaded, and fold changes at the transcriptome level of a TNBC line (MDA-MB-231) after treatment with belinostat were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were used to identify the critical biological processes. Construction and analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed to screen candidate genes related to cancer prognosis. A total of 465 DEGs were identified, including 240 downregulated and 225 upregulated genes. The cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway was identified as being significantly changed. Furthermore, the expression of CXCL1 was implicated as a favorable factor in the overall survival of breast cancer patients. With in vitro approaches, we also showed that belinostat could induce the expression of CXCL1 in another 2 TNBC cell lines (BT-549 and HCC-1937). We speculate that belinostat-induced CXCL1 expression could be one of the results of the stress clone evolution of cells after HDACi treatment. These findings provide new insights into clone evolution during HDACi treatment, which might guide us to a novel perspective that various mutation-targeted treatments should be implemented during the whole treatment cycle.",
