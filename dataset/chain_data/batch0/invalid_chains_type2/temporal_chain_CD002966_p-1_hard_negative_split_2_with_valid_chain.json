        "abstract": "In order to compare the effects of metformin and gliclazide on fasting serum insulin, 60 non-insulin dependent diabetics were included in a multi-centre study. Patients on a diabetic diet alone or a diabetic diet together with a sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agent, with a fasting glucose greater than 1.4 g/l, on two measurements were included in the study. They were randomly allocated to two parallel groups and received either gliclazide or metformin. They were treated for three months and attended for consultation at one month and three months. The fasting serum insulin level decreased significantly in the group receiving metformin (26.2 +/- 3.2 mlU/L at entry versus 19.8 +/- 2.3 mlU/L after three months: less than 0.01), and increased in a non-significant way in the group receiving gliclazide (21.6 +/- 3 mlU/L versus 26.5 +/- 5 mlU/L after three months: NS). The difference between the two groups was significant (p less than 0.01). There was a comparable significant improvement in blood sugar levels during the three months in both patients receiving gliclazide and metformin. However, significant weight loss (p less than 0.05) occurred only in patients receiving metformin. There was an identical improvement in blood sugar control in both patients receiving gliclazide and metformin over the three months. On the other hand, fasting serum insulin levels decreased significantly in patients receiving metformin compared to gliclazide. The effect of metformin on serum insulin levels is probably due to its action on insulin resistance and its lack of effect on insulin secretion, in contrast to sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents like gliclazide.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate whether patients previously treated with insulin or sulfonylureas alone can be transferred to a combination of sulfonylureas and metformin therapy and realize a prolonged weight loss.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a retrospective review of medical records to identify three groups of patients with type 2 diabetes: group 1, those requiring insulin who had remained on a daily regimen of two injections of mixed insulin; group 2, patients whose regimen had been changed from sulfonylureas alone to a combination of a sulfonylurea and metformin; and group 3, patients whose regimen had been converted from twice-daily mixed insulin alone to a sulfonylurea-metformin combination. Results relative to loss of weight in these three groups were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor a 12-month period, no significant weight loss was noted in group 1, and group 2 showed a small nonsignificant weight loss in 6 months. Only group 3 had a significant weight loss at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, maximizing at a mean weight loss of 22 lb (10 kg) at 12 months. In addition, in those patients in whom data were available, a significant weight loss was found at 18 and 21 months. At 21 months, however, weight began to increase. Percentage weight loss followed a pattern similar to that seen with total weight loss. The proportion of patients losing weight did not differ significantly in groups 1 and 2; however, in group 3, after 3 and 12 months a significant proportion of patients (79% and 86%, respectively) had lost weight. Race, gender, or baseline body weight had no effect on weight loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrom this retrospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes, we conclude that conversion from insulin to combination oral therapy with sulfonylureas and metformin results in a significant weight loss for up to 21 months.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effective longevity of combination double oral therapy before insulin or triple oral therapy is needed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of our first 100 patients with type 2 diabetes who were successfully transferred from twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin to a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 100 study patients, 40 had well-controlled plasma glucose (glycosylated hemoglobin levels <8.0%) with use of metformin and a sulfonylurea. Good glycemic control was achieved with triple oral therapy (a sulfonylurea, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione) in 14 patients and with a sulfonylurea, metformin, and evening-administered mixed NPH and regular insulin in 7. In addition, plasma glucose was effectively controlled with twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin in conjunction with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (or both) in 22 patients and with twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin alone in 17. The mean time (+/- standard error) from primary failure of sulfonylurea monotherapy to the time when a third hypoglycemic agent was needed was 7.9 +/- 1.1 years (95% confidence interval, 5.7 to 10.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhen oral monotherapy fails (that is, glycosylated hemoglobin values exceed 8.0%) in patients with type 2 diabetes, combination therapy with a sulfonylurea and metformin is potentially effective in maintaining glycemic control and avoiding the addition of insulin or a thiazolidinedione for a mean duration of 7.9 years.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo report the status of 35 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 3 years after the initiation of triple oral antidiabetic therapy--with a sulfonylurea, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudy patients were assessed for the need for the addition of insulin, and follow-up clinical and laboratory findings were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt a mean follow-up of 37 months (range, 18 to 45), 26 (74%) of 35 patients (group A) had well-controlled blood glucose levels on triple oral therapy, with a mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 6.9 +/- 0.3% (upper limit of normal, 6.5%). In the nine other patients (group B), triple oral therapy failed and the use of insulin was necessary after a mean duration of 30 months (range, 18 to 42); the mean HbA1c in these patients was 8.8 +/- 0.5%. Both group A and B gained similar amounts of weight during the study period (14.2 +/- 2.1 lb versus 11.6 +/- 3.8 lb, respectively; P = 0.54). A search for potential predictors of success or failure revealed that both groups had similar baseline characteristics, including age, duration of diabetes, weight, body mass index, HbA1c, and baseline stimulated C-peptide levels, and none of these factors demonstrated a significant correlation with the response to therapy. The only difference found between the two groups was a significant increase in the stimulated C-peptide levels (from 3.6 +/- 0.9 ng/mL to 5.2 +/- 1.1 ng/mL; P = 0.002) during follow-up in the group that had good glycemic control with triple oral therapy, in comparison with a nonsignificant increase (from 3.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mL to 4.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL; P = 0.46) in the group that failed to maintain glycemic control on triple oral therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTriple oral antidiabetic therapy is an effective long-term treatment for a substantial proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes who initially achieve glycemic control with triple oral therapy, particularly those in whom production of endogenous insulin is increased when a thiazolidinedione is added.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nIn a previous study, we found observational evidence of improvement in beta-cell function when rosiglitazone was added to a failing oral antihyperglycemic regimen consisting of sulfonylureas and metformin. To confirm our previous observations, we designed and performed a prospective, randomized, and controlled study.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 17 subjects with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on a maximized oral antihyperglycemic double regimen of glimepiride and metformin, were randomized to the addition of rosiglitazone or insulin to their treatment regimens for a period of 6 months. At baseline and at 6 months, the following were performed: measurement of fasting plasma glucose, fasting proinsulin, and insulin levels; frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test; and glucagon stimulation test for C-peptide.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine subjects were randomized to the addition of 8 mg rosiglitazone, and eight subjects were randomized to the addition of one injection of insulin (premixed 70/30) before their evening meal. The treatment groups were well matched for age, duration of diabetes, and BMI. Most important, the HbA(1c) was well matched between groups before treatment (8.7 +/- 0.3 and 9.0 +/- 0.3%; NS) and at the end of the 6 months (7.8 +/- 0.5 and 7.8 +/- 0.3%; NS). After 6 months, at the end of the study, there was a significant improvement in acute insulin response to glucose in the rosiglitazone group (+15.3 microIU x ml(-1) x 10 min(-1); P < 0.001) that led to an increase in the disposition index from 0.18 at baseline to 4.18 at 6 months (P = 0.02). Furthermore, at the end of the study, the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio had decreased in the rosiglitazone group by 36% (P = 0.03) but did not change significantly in the insulin treatment group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRosiglitazone, but not insulin, induced a recovery of pancreatic beta-cell function, as evidenced by the restoration of the first-phase insulin response to glucose, improvement in the disposition index, and a decrease in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio in subjects with type 2 diabetes in whom oral antihyperglycemic therapy failed. This improvement was independent of the correction of glucotoxicity.",
