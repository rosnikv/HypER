        "title": "Glutamine supplementation for critically ill adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGlutamine is a non-essential amino acid which is abundant in the healthy human body. There are studies reporting that plasma glutamine levels are reduced in patients with critical illness or following major surgery, suggesting that glutamine may be a conditionally essential amino acid in situations of extreme stress. In the past decade, several clinical trials examining the effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with critical illness or receiving surgery have been done, and the systematic review of this clinical evidence has suggested that glutamine supplementation may reduce infection and mortality rates in patients with critical illness. However, two recent large-scale randomized clinical trials did not find any beneficial effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with critical illness.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this review was to:1. assess the effects of glutamine supplementation in critically ill adults and in adults after major surgery on infection rate, mortality and other clinically relevant outcomes;2. investigate potential heterogeneity across different patient groups and different routes for providing nutrition.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group (CARG) Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2013); EMBASE (1980 to May 2013) and Web of Science (1945 to May 2013).\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included controlled clinical trials with random or quasi-random allocation that examined glutamine supplementation versus no supplementation or placebo in adults with a critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. We excluded cross-over trials.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors independently extracted the relevant information from each included study using a standardized data extraction form. For infectious complications and mortality and morbidity outcomes we used risk ratio (RR) as the summary measure with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We calculated, where appropriate, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH). We presented continuous data as the difference between means (MD) with the 95% CI.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nOur search identified 1999 titles, of which 53 trials (57 articles) fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The 53 included studies enrolled a total of 4671 participants with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. We analysed seven domains of potential risk of bias. In 10 studies the risk of bias was evaluated as low in all of the domains. Thirty-three trials (2303 patients) provided data on nosocomial infectious complications; pooling of these data suggested that glutamine supplementation reduced the infectious complications rate in adults with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.87, P \uff1c 0.00001, I\u00b2 = 8%, moderate quality evidence). Thirty-six studies reported short-term (hospital or less than one month) mortality. The combined rate of mortality from these studies was not statistically different between the groups receiving glutamine supplement and those receiving no supplement (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02, P = 0.10, I\u00b2 = 22%, low quality evidence). Eleven studies reported long-term (more than six months) mortality; meta-analysis of these studies (2277 participants) yielded a RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12, P = 0.94, I\u00b2 = 30%, moderate quality evidence). Subgroup analysis of infectious complications and mortality outcomes did not find any statistically significant differences between the predefined groups. Hospital length of stay was reported in 36 studies. We found that the length of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (MD -3.46 days, 95% CI -4.61 to -2.32, P < 0.0001, I\u00b2 = 63%, low quality evidence). Slightly prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in the glutamine supplemented group from 22 studies (2285 participants) (MD 0.18 days, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29, P = 0.002, I\u00b2 = 11%, moderate quality evidence). Days on mechanical ventilation (14 studies, 1297 participants) was found to be slightly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (MD - 0.69 days, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.02, P = 0.04, I\u00b2 = 18%, moderate quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups for side effects and quality of life, however results were imprecise for serious adverse events and few studies reported on quality of life. Sensitivity analysis including only low risk of bias studies found that glutamine supplementation had beneficial effects in reducing the length of hospital stay (MD -2.9 days, 95% CI -5.3 to -0.5, P = 0.02, I\u00b2 = 58%, eight studies) while there was no statistically significant difference between the groups for all of the other outcomes.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis review found moderate evidence that glutamine supplementation reduced the infection rate and days on mechanical ventilation, and low quality evidence that glutamine supplementation reduced length of hospital stay in critically ill or surgical patients. It seems to have little or no effect on the risk of mortality and length of ICU stay, however. The effects on the risk of serious side effects were imprecise. The strength of evidence in this review was impaired by a high risk of overall bias, suspected publication bias, and moderate to substantial heterogeneity within the included studies.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To determine whether glutamine (GLN)-supplemented parenteral nutrition (PN) improves clinical outcomes in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients. Summary Background Data:GLN requirements may increase with critical illness. GLN-supplemented PN may improve clinical outcomes in SICU patients. Methods:A parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial in 150 adults after gastrointestinal, vascular, or cardiac surgery requiring PN and SICU care. Patients were without significant renal or hepatic failure or shock at entry. All received isonitrogenous, isocaloric PN [1.5\u200ag/kg/d amino acids (AAs) and energy at 1.3\u00d7 estimated basal energy expenditure]. Controls (n\u200a=\u200a75) received standard GLN-free PN (STD-PN); the GLN group (n\u200a=\u200a75) received PN containing alanyl-GLN dipeptide (0.5\u200ag/kg/d), proportionally replacing AA in PN (GLN-PN). Enteral nutrition (EN) was advanced and PN weaned as indicated. Hospital mortality and infections were primary endpoints. Results:Baseline characteristics, days on study PN and daily macronutrient intakes via PN and EN, were similar between groups. There were 11 hospital deaths (14.7%) in the GLN-PN group and 13 deaths in the STD-PN group (17.3%; difference, \u22122.6%; 95% confidence interval, \u221214.6% to 9.3%; P\u200a=\u200a0.66). The 6-month cumulative mortality was 31.4% in the GLN-PN group and 29.7% in the STD-PN group (P\u200a=\u200a0.88). Incident bloodstream infection rate was 9.6 and 8.4 per 1000 hospital days in the GLN-PN and STD-PN groups, respectively (P\u200a=\u200a0.73). Other clinical outcomes and adverse events were similar. Conclusions:PN supplemented with GLN dipeptide was safe, but did not alter clinical outcomes among SICU patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSepsis is a severe inflammatory response to infection. Excessive compensation to inflammation leads to dysregulated immune response that ultimately results in organ damage and lethality of sepsis. This study administered glutamine (GLN) in the early or late phase of sepsis to investigate its effects on regulating leukocyte programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) expression, macrophage function, inflammation, and acute kidney injury in sepsis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMice were randomly assigned to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham-operated groups. Septic mice were respectively injected once with saline or 0.75 g GLN/kg body weight at 3 or 10 hours post-CLP via tail vein. All mice were sacrificed 24 hours after CLP.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSepsis enhanced the percentage of interferon-\u03b3-expressing and interleukin (IL)-17A-expressing CD4+ T cells, expression of PD-1 on T cells, and PD-L1 on B cells and monocytes. Inflammatory mediator messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in kidney tissues and proapoptotic caspase-3 mRNA expression in mesenteric lymph nodes were also upregulated. GLN administration decreased plasma IL-6 level, downregulated the percentage of IL-17A-expressing CD4+ T cells, attenuated macrophage dysfunction, decreased caspase-3 mRNA expression, and reduced PD-1/PD-L1 expression by T and B cells. Histological findings also showed that kidney damage was attenuated. GLN administered at 3 and 10 hours after CLP offered nearly equal effects on PD-1/PD-L1 and inflammatory mediator expression after CLP.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that a single dose of GLN administration in either the early or late phase during sepsis promotes a more balanced immune regulation and reduced systemic and kidney inflammatory responses in mice.",

        "title": "Effects of Early Enteral Nutrition on Immune Function and Prognosis of Patients With Sepsis on Mechanical Ventilation",
        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the therapeutic effects of early enteral nutrition (EEN) on patients with sepsis on mechanical ventilation. Methods: Patients with sepsis on mechanical ventilation in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) from January 2013 to March 2016 were treated with enteral nutrition. Patients treated within 48 hours of initiation of mechanical ventilation were assigned to the EEN group, and the rest were assigned to the delayed enteral nutrition (DEN) group. Peripheral blood Th17 cells and Treg cells, endotoxin (ET) level, 28-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, lengths of ICU stay and hospital stay, and incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) were analyzed between the 2 groups. Results: The proportion of Th17 cells and ET levels in the EEN group were significantly lower than those in the DEN group, whereas the proportion of Treg cells in the EEN group was remarkably higher than that in the DEN group (P < .05). The duration of mechanical ventilation, lengths of ICU stay and hospital stay, and incidence of ICU-AW were higher in the DEN group than in the EEN group (P < .05), but there was no significant difference in the 28-day mortality between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Patients with sepsis mainly present with an increased proportion of Th17 cells in the early stage, manifesting as enhanced immune response. Early enteral nutrition can inhibit the excessive immune response, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, lengths of ICU stay and hospital stay, and reduce the incidence of ICU-AW, but it has no obvious effect on 28-day mortality.",

        "title": "Effect of early activity combined with early nutrition on acquired weakness in ICU patients",
        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) occurs in 25% to 100% of critically ill patients, and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, extended ICU stay, and total hospital stay, increased hospital costs, higher risk of death, impaired physical function, and decreased quality of life. However, there are not any current guidelines that mention management of ICU-AW. The present study will evaluate the effects of a combination of early nutrition and early exercise compared to those of either early exercise alone or the standard care for patients in ICUs. Methods: This is a 3-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial including an estimated 147 critically ill patients aged \u226518 years recruited from the ICUs of 2 hospitals in Heilongjiang, China. Patients will be prospectively randomized 1:1:1 to receive early mobilization, early nutrition combined with early mobilization, or standard care (minimal exercises, experience-based initiation and enrollment of nutrition support). Outcomes are assessed at ICU discharge after baseline. The primary outcome is occurrence of ICU-AW according to the Medical Research Council scale at the end of treatment. Muscle strength, organ failure, functional independence, self-care ability, time of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU mortality are secondary outcome measures. Discussion: This trial has the potential to identify a novel strategy for preventing or managing ICU-AW. The findings may increase the clinical knowledge about nutrition and mobilization interventions for people with ICU-AW, and contribute to the formation of practice guidelines for managing this condition.

        "abstract": "Objective This study focused on elucidating the influence of early multidisciplinary collaboration on preventing intensive care unit- (ICU-) acquired weakness (AW) in critically ill patients (CIPs). Methods Ninety-five CIPs admitted between December 2018 and December 2021 were selected and assigned to the following two groups according to the intervention pattern: the control group (the Con; n = 40) treated with routine early rehabilitation intervention, and the research group (the Res; n = 55) intervened by early multidisciplinary collaborative intervention. The incidence of complications (ICU-AW, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers (PSs)) and recovery indices (days of ventilator use, ICU treatment time, and length of hospital stay (LOS)) were recorded. Besides, patients' activity function and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated and compared, among which the former was evaluated by the Barthel Index (BI), ICU Mobility Scale (IMS), and Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale, and the latter was assessed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (100-item version) (WHOQOL-100). Results The data identified statistically a lower incidence of complications (ICU-AW, DVT, and PSs) and shorter time of ventilator use, ICU residence, and LOS in the Res compared with the Con. In addition, BI, IMS, MRC, and WHOQOL-100 scores in the Res elevated statistically after treatment and were higher than those of the Con. Conclusions Early multidisciplinary collaboration can validly prevent ICU-AW in CIPs, reduce the incidence of DVT and PSs, and promote patients' rehabilitation, mobility, and QoL.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIntensive care unit acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is a secondary neuromuscular complication in critically ill patients, characterized by profound weakness in all four limbs. Studies have shown that bundles of care are nursing strategies that combine a series of evidence-based interventions, which collectively optimize patients' clinical outcomes compared to individual interventions.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of bundle interventions on ICU-AW deeply exploring the characteristics of bundle interventions, patient outcomes related to ICU-AW, and primarily investigating the effects of bundle interventions on ICU-AW. The main focus is to explore the clinical value of bundle interventions in treatment of ICU-acquired weakness in patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nComputer and manual searches were conducted using keywords to retrieve relevant studies on the effects of bundle interventions on ICU-AW from databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and EMbase. The search period ranged from database inception to the present. The control group received standard ICU care, including basic nursing, while the intervention group received bundle nursing interventions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1545 participants (790 in the intervention group and 755 in the control group) were included. Meta-analysis results showed that the intervention group had significantly higher muscle strength (MD = 7.41, 95% CI: 6.65-8.16, P< 0.00001) and daily living ability (MD = 34.01, 95% CI: 32.54-35.48, P< 0.00001) than the control group. Additionally, the incidence of ICU-AW (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.26-0.59, P< 0.00001), mechanical ventilation time (MD =-3.71, 95% CI: -3.58\u223c-2.76, P< 0.0001), and ICU length of stay (MD =-2.73, 95% CI: -3.14\u223c-2.31, P< 0.00001) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nICU-AW has a severe negative impact on the recovery and functional restoration of ICU patients, increasing the treatment complexity for healthcare providers and the mortality and disability rates for patients. The bundled care approach may help reduce the incidence of ICU-AW, promote the restoration of daily activity function, enhance muscle strength, and reduce ICU stay and mechanical ventilation time for ICU patients. However, the long-term effects of bundle interventions still require further in-depth research.",
