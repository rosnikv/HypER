        "abstract": "AIMS\nWe studied a novel sirolimus eluting stent with a bioabsorbable coating (SES) in >3 months old chronic total coronary occlusions (CTO).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nNinety-five patients were randomised to either BMS (n=47) or SES (n=48). The primary endpoints were late lumen loss (LLL) and in-segment restenosis (ISR) after six months. Secondary endpoints were target vessel revascularisation after six and 24 months. Occlusion length (37.6 mm), reference diameter (2.8 mm) as well as the stented segment (45.5 mm) were similar in both groups. Up until six months no death, myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis occurred in either group. Angiographic follow-up (45BMS/46SES): LLL 1.8 mm/0.77 mm (p<0.0001), ISR 60%/17.4% (p<0.0001). In-segment re-occlusion 15.5%/0% and TVR 53.3%/10.8% (p<0.0001). After 24 months: 1 BMS, 2 SES patients died; 0 BMS, 0 SES infarction; 0 BMS, 0 SES stent thrombosis and 3 BMS, 0 SES TVR between six and 24 months. Thus total TVR after 24 months was 60% for BMS and 10.8% for SES (p<0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe alternative sirolimus-coated stent was shown to reduce the relative risk of restenosis after six months by 71%, and of TVR after 24 months by 82%. Between six and 24 months, neither stent thrombosis occurred, nor repeat revascularisation was required in patients who received a SES.",

        "title": "Outcomes following successful recanalization of chronic total coronary occlusions",
        "abstract": "A chronically occluded coronary lesion is observed in approximately 20\u201330% of patients in whom the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is established by coronary angiography. By contrast, a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) as a target of a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) constitutes less than 10% of the PCI volume in current practice. This discrepancy is explained in part by the specific technical challenges posed by a CTO with a low primary success rate, and a high lesion recurrence rate. The latter is addressed by the use of drug-eluting stents, and the former is improved considerably with recent technical advancements and specialization of operators. There are three principal indications to revascularize a CTO, which are the relief of clinical symptoms, the improvement of impaired left ventricular function, and a potential improvement in survival. Despite the absence of a randomized clinical comparison between conservative and interventional treatment of CTOs, numerous nonrandomized stu...",
