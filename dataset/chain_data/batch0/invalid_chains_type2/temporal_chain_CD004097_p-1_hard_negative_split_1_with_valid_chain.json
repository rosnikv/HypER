        "abstract": "Objectives.The objective of this work was to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of a brief behavioral dietary intervention and 2 supplemental components of diabetes self-management support: telephone follow-up calls and community resources enhancement. Design and Subjects.This was a 2 \u00d7 2 randomized, controlled trial investigating the incremental effects of telephone follow-up and community resources enhancement with 320 adult type 2 diabetes outpatients. Methods.Key outcomes included behavioral (dietary patterns, fat intake), physiologic (HbA1C, lipids), and quality-of-life/patient satisfaction measures and were collected at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results.Despite high reach (76% patient participation), excellent adoption (all 12 primary care practices approached participated), and good implementation, there were few outcome differences among treatment conditions. There was significant improvement across conditions in most outcomes in each category at both follow-ups. Conclusions.A brief, computer-assisted, dietary goal\u2013setting intervention basic treatment condition was moderately successful in producing dietary improvements but less so in producing biologic or quality-of-life outcomes. Additions of follow-up phone calls or a community resources enhancement component did not produce incremental improvements over this basic intervention.",

        "title": "Randomized Trial of a Brief Dietary Intervention to Decrease Consumption of Fat and Increase Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables",
        "abstract": "Purpose. This study tested the efficacy of a computer-assisted counseling intervention to reduce diet-related cancer risk. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Subjects. Healthy women HMO members (n = 616) aged 40 to 70. Intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to nutrition intervention or an attention-control intervention unrelated to diet. Intervention consisted of two 45-minute counseling sessions plus two 5- to 10-minute follow-up telephone contacts. Counseling sessions included a 20-minute, interactive, computer-based intervention using a touchscreen format. Intervention goals were reducing dietary fat and increasing consumption of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Measures. Twenty-four hour diet recalls and the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire (FFB). Results. Four-month follow-up data were collected from 94% of the intervention participants and 91% of the controls. Testing with a multivariate general linear models analysis showed improvements on all dietary outcome variables. Compared to the control, intervention participants reported significantly less fat consumption (2.35 percentage points less for percentage of energy from fat), significantly greater consumption of fruit and vegetables combined (1.04 servings per day), and a significant reduction in a behavioral measure of fat consumption (.24 point change in the FFB). Conclusions. These 4-month results are comparable to several other moderate-intensity studies showing that, in the appropriate circumstances, moderate-intensity dietary interventions can be efficacious. Study limitations include the short follow-up period and the use of self-reported outcome measures.",

        "title": "Behavioural, attitudinal and dietary responses to the consumption of wholegrain foods",
        "abstract": "Whole grains are important dietary constituents as they provide a plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals that may have synergistic actions in promoting health. Regular consumption of wholegrain foods has been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases such as CHD and certain cancers, although their exact role in disease prevention is not yet fully elucidated. Studies reporting levels of whole grain consumption reveal that those subjects who include higher levels of whole grain foods in their diets also have many other favourable dietary and lifestyle practices. While the actions of these practices and whole grains may not be mutually exclusive, these variables do not appear to explain the reduction in risk of disease observed for high-whole grain consumers. Actual whole grain consumption levels are extremely low and many practical barriers exist to consumer uptake of these foods. Effective communication of the whole grain health message is an important strategy to increase awareness of the importance of whole grains in the diet. Increasing the variety and availability of acceptable wholegrain foods is also important. Whole grain consumption at breakfast can have an important impact on total daily nutrient intakes. This simple dietary modification is potentially relatively easy to achieve and could greatly contribute to increased whole grain intake for many individuals.",

        "title": "Whole-grain rye bread consumption by women correlates with plasma alkylresorcinols and increases their concentration compared with low-fiber wheat bread.",
        "abstract": "Whole-grain rye and wheat products are rich in lignans, the precursors of enterolactone (ENL) and alkylresorcinols (ARs), which are phenolic lipids. In this crossover trial, we examined the effect of whole-grain rye bread compared with low-fiber wheat bread on plasma AR levels. Women (n = 39) aged 59 +/- 0.94 y (mean +/- SEM) were advised to consume rye (214 +/- 7.1 g/d) or wheat (178 +/- 6.5 g/d) bread (20% of total daily energy intake) in random order for 8 wk. The test periods were separated by an 8-wk washout period. ARs with different homologues and ENL were measured in plasma collected at the beginning (habitual diet) and end of the test bread periods. AR concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) after the rye bread (352 +/- 24.7 nmol/L) and habitual diet (97.7 +/- 12.1 and 88.3 +/- 8.7 nmol/L) periods than after the wheat bread period (36.6 +/- 4.2 nmol/L). Plasma AR concentrations were correlated with intake of rye bread (r = 0.34, P = 0.037), and with insoluble fiber from the whole diet during the rye (r = 0.39, P = 0.013) and wheat (r = 0.32, P = 0.047) bread periods. The plasma AR 17:0/21:0 ratio differed after the rye (0.84 +/- 0.04) and wheat (0.53 +/- 0.08) bread diet periods (P < 0.001). These data strongly suggest that plasma ARs could be used as specific biomarkers for whole-grain rye intake, and their homologue pattern could be used as an indicator of the bread type consumed.",

        "abstract": "Alkylresorcinols with alkyl chains C17:0-C25:0 are abundant in whole-grain wheat and rye. Concentrations in human plasma have been suggested to be biomarkers of dietary whole-grain intake. We measured human plasma, erythrocyte, and lipoprotein alkylresorcinol concentrations and alkylresorcinol homolog distribution, and evaluated the use of plasma alkylresorcinol concentration as a dietary biomarker of whole-grain intake compared with serum enterolactone. A total of 15 subjects (8 women) consumed whole-grain wheat or whole-grain rye crisp bread ( approximately 100 g/d) in a crossover design for 1 wk. The test bread periods were preceded by 1-wk periods of consuming refined wheat bread. Plasma, erythrocyte, lipoprotein alkylresorcinol, and serum enterolactone concentrations were measured before and after each period, and plasma alkylresorcinols and serum enterolactone were measured after habitual diet intake before and 1 wk after the trial. Plasma alkylresorcinols are transported in lipoproteins with VLDL and HDL being the main carriers. AR concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, and lipoproteins were increased (P < 0.05) by whole-grain wheat bread and even more so with rye crisp bread, although interindividual variation was high. The alkylresorcinol homolog C17:0 to C21:0 ratio in plasma was higher after the whole-grain rye diet period compared with the whole-grain wheat diet period (P < 0.05). Serum enterolactone concentrations were increased significantly by whole-grain rye intake only in men. This is the first report to show that alkylresorcinols in human plasma are mainly transported in lipoproteins. The plasma alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 ratio reflects intake of whole-grain wheat and rye, and the plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration appears to be a useful biomarker of whole-grain cereal intake.",

        "abstract": "Consumption of energy-containing beverages may lead to weight gain, yet research investigating this issue is limited. An easily-administered beverage intake assessment tool could facilitate research on this topic. The purpose of this cross-sectional investigation was to determine the validity and reliability of a self-administered beverage intake questionnaire (BEVQ), which estimates mean daily intake of beverages consumed (g, kcals) across 19 beverage categories. Participants (n=105; aged 39+2 yrs) underwent assessments of height, weight, body mass index and dietary intake using 4-day food intake records (FIR) from June 2008-June 2009. The BEVQ was completed at two additional visits (BEVQ1, BEVQ2). Urine samples were collected to objectively determine total fluid intake and encourage accurate selfreporting. Relative validity was assessed by comparing BEVQ1 with FIR results; test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing BEVQ1 and BEVQ2. Analyses included descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, paired sample t tests and independent sample t tests. Selfreported water and total beverage intake (g) were not different between the BEVQ1 and FIR (mean difference: 129+77 g [P=0.096] and 61+106 g [P=0.567], respectively). Total beverage and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) energy intake were significantly different, although mean differences were small (63 and 44 kcal, respectively). Daily consumption (g) of water (R=0.53), total beverages (R=0.46) and SSB (R=0.49) determined by the BEVQ1 were correlated with reported intake determined by the FIR, as was energy from total beverages (R=0.61) and SSB (R=0.59) (all P<0.001).

        "abstract": "Several environmental level factors exacerbate poor health outcomes in rural populations in the United States, such as lack of access to healthy food and locations to be physically active, which support healthy choices at the individual level. Thus, utilizing innovative place-based approaches in rural locations is essential to improve health outcomes. Leveraging community assets, like Cooperative Extension, is a novel strategy for implementing community-driven interventions. This prospective cohort study (n\u2009=\u2009152), recruited in 2019 and surveyed again in 2020 and 2021, examined individual level changes in diet and physical activity in one rural Appalachian county. During this time, multiple community-driven interventions were implemented alongside Cooperative Extension and several community partners. Across the three-year study, the cohort indicated increases in other vegetables and water and reductions in fruits and legumes. There were also reductions in less healthy items such as French fries and sugar-sweetened beverages. The cohort also reported being less likely to engage in physical activity. Our findings suggest that key community-driven programs may have indirect effects on dietary and physical activity choices over time. Outcomes from this study are relevant for public health practitioners and community organizations working within rural Appalachian communities to address health-related behaviors.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic produced acute effects on health inequities, yet more enduring impacts in vulnerable populations in rural Appalachia are understudied. This qualitative study included three focus groups with thirty-nine adults (74% female, mean age 52.7 years) to obtain perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being in Martin County, Kentucky, in fall 2022. Grounded Theory was employed using an iterative inductive-deductive approach to capture the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health practices and status. Three prominent themes emerged: (1) increased social isolation; (2) household cost of living strains caused by inflation; and (3) higher food prices and diminished food availability causing shifts in food purchasing and consumption. Participants noted that the rising cost of living resulted in residents having to \u201cchoose between medication, food and utilities\u201d. Increased food prices resulted in residents \u201cstretching\u201d their food, modifying how they grocery shopped, and limiting meat consumption. Persistent food shortages were exacerbated by there being few grocery stores in the county. Lastly, increased social isolation was profoundly articulated as widely impacting mental health, especially among youth. Our findings underscore the ongoing deleterious effects of inflation and food supply chain disruptions in this rural, geographically isolated community, which resulted in difficult spending choices for residents.",
