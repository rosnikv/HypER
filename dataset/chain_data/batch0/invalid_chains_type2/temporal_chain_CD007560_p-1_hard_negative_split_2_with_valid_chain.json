        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUncontrolled studies have suggested that methotrexate may be effective in patients with active ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral methotrexate in chronic steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with active ulcerative colitis who have received steroids and/or immunosuppressives for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months with a current Mayo Clinic score of > or = 7 were included in the study. Methotrexate (12.5 mg) or placebo was added to their treatment once weekly for 9 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-seven patients were included (methotrexate, 30 patients, placebo, 37 patients). The proportion of patients entering first remission (methotrexate, 46.7%; placebo, 48.6%), the time to reach first remission (methotrexate, 4.1 +/- 1.9 months; placebo, 3.4 +/- 1.7 months), as well as the proportions of patients having a relapse after first remission (methotrexate, 64.3%; placebo, 44.4%) were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean Mayo Clinic score, the mean monthly steroid dose, and the proportion of abnormal laboratory results during the study were also similar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg was not found to be better than placebo in the induction or maintenance of remission in patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis.",

        "title": "The SIBDQ: further validation in ulcerative colitis patients",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is an instrument that assesses quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It has 32 items in four domains. The short form of the IBDQ (SIBDQ) was developed in Canadian Crohn's disease patients for use in clinical practice. Patients with ulcerative colitis might require a different form of the SIBDQ. Our aim was to design and validate a SIBDQ for patients with ulcerative colitis and to compare this to the Crohn's SIBDQ.METHODS:We recruited 122 patients with colitis as an initial sample. Using linear regression modeling, the 10 items that best predicted the total IBDQ score were identified. The colitis and Crohn's versions of the SIBDQ were compared by univariate linear regression with the total IBDQ score in two other cohorts of colitis patients.RESULTS:Ten items explained 97% of the variance of the total IBDQ score in our first cohort. These were items 1 and 9 (bowel); 7, 11, 21, 30 (emotional); 2 and 10 (systemic); and 12 and 28 (social). Only three items were shared with the Crohn's SIBDQ. The R2 for both SIBDQs with the total IBDQ score in the other cohorts were very high (\u22650.95), although the Colitis SIBDQ showed better internal consistency.CONCLUSIONS:The development of a SIBDQ for patients with ulcerative colitis did not reveal any clear advantage over the original version of the SIBDQ. Further studies are required to determine the role of the SIBDQ in routine clinical practice.",

        "title": "The short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire is reliable and responsive to clinically important change in ulcerative colitis",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) is a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) tool measuring physical, social, and emotional status (score 10\u201370, poor to good HRQoL). The SIBDQ has been predominantly used in trials for Crohn's disease, and further validation of the SIBDQ is desirable in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The primary objective was to further validate the SIBDQ by examining discriminant ability against measures of disease activity. The secondary objectives were to examine reliability and responsiveness to change.METHODS:UC patients attending hospital completed the SIBDQ and two activity indices. Patients\u2019 disease status (remission, mild, moderate, or severe relapse) was determined subjectively by the patients and their physician.RESULTS:Scores were obtained for 69 events in 61 patients, mean age 47.8 yr (range 16\u201379). All classes of disease extent were represented. The mean SIBDQ score was 48.4 (13\u201370). The difference between mean score in patients in remission and relapse was \u221220.1 (95% CI =\u221225.1 to \u221215.1). The difference for remission and mild relapse was \u221214.6 (95% CI =\u22128.9 to \u221220.2). The correlation between SIBDQ and the activity indices were good, r = \u22120.83 and r = \u22120.61. Eight patients presented twice. Those with unchanged disease status showed no significant difference in the mean SIBDQ score. Patients whose disease status had deteriorated from remission to mild relapse, or from mild to moderate relapse demonstrated a mean reduction of 11.8 points (95% CI = 20.1\u20133.4).CONCLUSIONS:This study contributes to the validation of the SIBDQ as a HRQoL tool in UC. It is reproducible and responsive to changes in disease activity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:Despite advances in treatment for Crohn's disease (CD), some patients suffer from chronic pain. We sought to characterize the prevalence of narcotic use and contributing factors in CD patients at a referral center.METHODS:A retrospective analysis of 291 CD patients followed over a 5-yr period was performed. Clinical status was evaluated with the Harvey\u2013Bradshaw index (HBI) of disease activity and the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ).RESULTS:Narcotic use was identified in 13.1% of patients. Narcotic users were more likely to be female, 72% versus 49% (p = 0.01), had higher rates of disability, 15.4% versus 3.6% (p = 0.001), and a longer duration of disease, 17.0 versus 12.9 yr (p = 0.03). In addition, they took more medications 6.97 versus 4.7 (p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric drug use, 37% versus 19% (p = 0.01). CD patients receiving narcotics had worse disease activity (HBI 9.1 vs 5.0, p < 0.001) and diminished quality of life (SIBDQ 44.2 vs 51.6 (p = 0.04)). However, logistic regression analysis found that active disease [HBI score of \u2265 4 (OR 3.9)], polypharmacy [use of \u2265 5 drugs (OR 5.5)], and smoking (OR 2.8) were associated with narcotic use.CONCLUSIONS:Narcotic use may be an indicator of more severe disease since it is associated with increased disease activity and decreased quality of life. Factors correlating with narcotic use include smoking and PP. Our data emphasize the need for further work to characterize chronic pain in CD patients.",

        "abstract": "Background:The rate of narcotic misuse in the inflammatory bowel disease population is not well studied. The primary aim of this study was to determine in Crohn's disease (CD) whether a concurrent functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) was associated with increased rates of chronic narcotic use. Second, we aimed to identify potential risk factors for narcotic misuse. Methods:A retrospective chart review of patients with CD followed at the University of Virginia's Gastroenterology Clinic from 2006 to 2011 was performed. The prescription monitoring program was accessed to confirm narcotic prescription filling histories. Narcotic misuse was defined as narcotic prescriptions filled from 4 or more prescribers and at 4 or more different pharmacies. Results:Nine hundred thirty-one patients with CD were included in the study cohort. Eighty-seven (9.3%) patients were identified as having a concurrent FGID, and 192 (20%) were taking chronic narcotics. Patients with FGID were more likely to be taking chronic narcotics (44% versus 18%, P < 0.001). Thirty-seven percent (32/87) of patients with an FGID were misusing narcotics, compared with 9.6% (81/844) (P < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant association of misuse in patients with a concurrent FGID (odds ratio = 3.33, 95% confidence interval, 1.87\u20135.93). Conclusions:Twenty percent of patients with CD were using chronic narcotics with higher rates in those with FGID. Using the prescription monitoring program, a significant proportion of patients with CD with an FGID were misusing narcotics. We would recommend screening for narcotic misuse in patients with CD with a concomitant FGID and consider using prescription monitoring programs to identify others at risk for misuse.",

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess possible associations between postoperative outcomes and demographic and clinical variables, including preoperative narcotic use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 1331 patients included, the mean age for patients who had at least 1 pharmacy claim for narcotics within 1 month before surgery was 41.5 years and 41.1 years for patients without a pharmacy claim. Of 1461 abdominal operations for CD, 267 (18.3%) were performed on patients receiving preoperative narcotics. Patients receiving narcotics were more likely to have a current smoking habit (P\u2009<\u2009.001) with perianal disease (P\u2009=\u2009.046) and undergoing treatment with biologics (P\u2009=\u2009.04).

Because preoperative narcotics use is associated with increased surgical morbidity and increased readmission rates, there is a compelling need to categorize health outcomes of patients maintaining an active opioid prescription. The purpose of this study is to determine the health outcomes of preoperative narcotic users who undergo colorectal surgery within the enhanced recovery (ER) protocol, a set of multimodal interventions designed to reduce postoperative complications. Five hundred and five colorectal surgery patients were identified within the ER protocol at Carilion Clinic. Opioid dependence was defined as an active prescription for 30 days before surgery. Thirty-day outcome variables were defined by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. One hundred and one patients were identified as opioid dependent and 404 as opioid na\u00efve. Groups were comparable in terms of age at surgery, mean body mass index, and presurgical physical classification. Groups fared similarly with regard to readmission (\u03c72, P > 0.999), reoperation (\u03c72, P = 0.869), and average length of stay [t(135) = 1.49, P = 0.137].

        "abstract": "The prevalence of substance use disorder in the liver transplantation (LT) population makes postoperative pain management challenging. We report our initial experience with a novel, comprehensive, multidisciplinary opioid avoidance pathway in 13 LT recipients between January 2018 and September 2019. Patients received comprehensive pre\u2010LT education on postoperative opioid avoidance by the surgeon, pharmacist, and psychologist at the time of listing. Immediately after LT, patients received a continuous incisional ropivacaine infusion, ketamine, acetaminophen, and gabapentin as standard nonopioid medications; rescue opioids were used as needed. We compared outcomes with a historical cohort of 27 LT recipients transplanted between August 2016 and January 2018 managed primarily with opioids. On average, opioid avoidance patients used 92% fewer median (interquartile range [IQR]) morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) versus the historical cohort (7 [1\u201011] versus 87 [60\u2010130] MME; P < 0.001) per postoperative day over a similar length of stay (8 [7\u201010] versus 6 [6\u201010] days; P = 0.14).
