        "abstract": "Background:Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder. Currently, the main goals of treatment are to induce and maintain clinical and/or endoscopic remission. However, evidence indicates that persistent disease activity on colonic biopsies in the setting of clinical or endoscopic remission is an independent predictor of poor outcomes. A number of previous studies have proposed histologic indices for use in specific trials of UC. The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing histological indices for UC and assess their potential use in both patient management and clinical trials. Methods:We performed a systematic review of histological indices evaluating disease activity in UC. MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PubMed, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) abstracts of randomized and/or controlled trials clinical trials were searched from inception to February 2013 for applicable studies. Data from these studies were reviewed and analyzed. Results:After systematically applying inclusion criteria, we identified 108 scientific articles including 88 clinical studies and 21 related clinical reviews. Eighteen indices of histological activity in UC were identified and reviewed. Conclusions:Although multiple histological scoring indices for assessment of UC disease activity currently exist, none of these instruments were developed using a formal validation process and their operating properties remain poorly understood. Future studies are needed to address this deficiency.",

        "title": "Beyond endoscopic mucosal healing in UC: histological remission better predicts corticosteroid use and hospitalisation over 6\u2005years of follow-up",
        "abstract": "Background Endoscopic mucosal healing is an established treatment target for UC, yet the value of achieving histological remission remains unclear. Aims To evaluate histological remission compared to endoscopic mucosal healing for predicting patient outcomes in UC. Methods Blinded assessment of endoscopic and histological measures of disease activity was performed on patients with established UC at baseline. Concordance and prognostic values of endoscopic mucosal healing (defined by Baron score \u22641) and histological remission (defined by Truelove and Richards\u2019 index) for predicting outcomes of corticosteroid use, hospitalisation and colectomy were determined over a median 6\u2005years follow-up, including \u03ba statistics and Cox regression multivariate analysis. Results 91 patients with UC were followed up for a median 72\u2005months (IQR 54\u201375\u2005months). Overall, concordance between endoscopic and histological remission was moderate (\u03ba=0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.77); 24% patients had persistent inflammation despite endoscopic remission. Histological remission predicted corticosteroid use and acute severe colitis requiring hospitalisation over the follow-up period (HR 0.42 (0.2 to 0.9), p=0.02; HR 0.21 (0.1 to 0.7), p=0.02; respectively), whereas endoscopic mucosal healing did not (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.7, p0.65; HR 0.83 95% CI 0.3 to 2.4, p0.74; respectively). Conclusions Histological remission is a target distinct from endoscopic mucosal healing in UC and better predicts lower rates of corticosteroid use and acute severe colitis requiring hospitalisation, over a median of 6\u2005years of follow-up. Our findings support the inclusion of histological indices in both UC clinical trials and practice, towards a target of \u2018complete remission\u2019.",

        "abstract": "Background\nEndoscopic monitoring is fundamental for evaluating the therapeutic response in IBD, but a validated endomicroscopic mucosal healing (MH) score is not available to date. However, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) might define MH more precisely than conventional endoscopy. The major aim was to establish and validate an MH score for ulcerative colitis (UC), based on CLE.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an initial pilot study (n = 10), various CLE changes were analyzed for identification of reproducible criteria for establishing a CLE score. Four reproducible CLE criteria were implemented in a following validation study. Subsequently, active UC patients (n = 23, Mayo score \u22656) were prospectively included and underwent colonoscopy with CLE before and after 3 anti-TNF applications. Patients were clinically followed over a period of 3 years. The endomicroscopic MH score (eMHs; range, 0-4) was compared with histopathology and endoscopy scores from the same colonic location.\n\n\nResults\nThe eMHs showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values (100% with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 15.81%-100%; 93.75% with 95% CI of 69.77%-99.84%, and 94.44%, respectively). The eMHs showed a good correlation with the histological Gupta score (rs = 0.82, P < 0.0001) and the endoscopic Mayo subscore (rs = 0.81%, P < 0.0001). Sixty percent of therapy responders presented an eMHs <1, which translated into long-lasting clinical remission and reduced hospitalization, steroid, and surgery need.\n\n\nConclusions\nCLE can accurately assess MH based on the newly developed and statistically validated eMHs in UC, and it is superior in predicting the long-lasting clinical outcome based on both descriptive and functional barrier imaging (NCT01417728).",

        "title": "Can advanced endoscopic techniques for assessment of mucosal inflammation and healing approximate histology in inflammatory bowel disease?",
        "abstract": "The targets of therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have transformed in the last few years. The standard definition of mucosal healing assessed using white light standard definition endoscopy is being challenged because even when endoscopy suggests mucosal healing, the presence of histological activity can often still be observed. Of note, microscopic signs of inflammation correlate with clinical outcomes such as risk of relapse, hospitalization and colorectal cancer. Therefore, histological healing has increasingly become an important target to achieve. Advanced endoscopic technologies have been developed and many are starting to be adopted in daily clinical practice. They can provide a more detailed view of the mucosal and vascular architecture almost at the histology level, including crypt, vessel architecture and cellular infiltration. So, these can provide a more accurate definition of mucosal and histological healing. In this review we focus on new advanced endoscopic techniques, and how these have the potential to reduce the gap between histological and mucosal healing.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUstekinumab induces and maintains histologic improvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The clinical relevance of this endpoint alone, and in combination with endoscopic improvement, is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHistologic disease activity were evaluated in 2630 colonic biopsy samples from patients with UC treated in the UNIFI phase 3 UC clinical studies of ustekinumab. We evaluated associations between histologic improvement (defined as the composite of neutrophil infiltration in less than 5% of crypts and no crypt destruction, erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue) and clinical endpoints at the end of induction (week 8 and 16) and maintenance (week 44) periods. We assessed the validity of a combined histologic and endoscopic (Mayo endoscopy subscore, 0 or 1) improvement endpoint which we called histo-endoscopic mucosal healing (or histo-endoscopic mucosal improvement).\n\n\nRESULTS\nHistologic improvement was significantly (P<.0001) associated with clinical remission, lower mean disease activity scores, and greater improvement in disease activity at the end of induction and maintenance studies. Ustekinumab induced and maintained significantly higher rates of histologic improvement at induction week 8 and maintenance week 44 than placebo when more stringent definitions of histologic improvement were used. Histologic improvement and endoscopic improvement following induction were associated with 10%-20% higher rates of histo-endoscopic mucosal healing, clinical remission, and corticosteroid-free remission at week 44 (all P<.05) in patients who received ustekinumab maintenance therapy. At week 44, 61% of patients (56/92) with histo-endoscopic mucosal healing after induction therapy achieved clinical remission, vs 39% of patients (9/23, P=.0983) and 34% of patients (24/71, P=.0009) with endoscopic or histologic improvement alone after induction, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nData from the UNIFI program of ustekinumab in patient with UC treated with ustekinumab indicated the achievement of histo-endoscopic mucosal healing after induction therapy is associated with lower disease activity at the end of maintenance therapy than either histologic or endoscopic improvement alone.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nHistopathology is an emerging treatment target in ulcerative colitis (UC) clinical trials. We aim to provide guidance on standardizing biopsy collection protocols, identifying optimal evaluative indices, and defining thresholds for histologic response and remission after treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn international, interdisciplinary expert panel of 19 gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal pathologists was assembled. A modified RAND/University of California Los Angeles appropriateness methodology was used to address relevant issues. A total of 138 statements were derived from a systematic review of the literature and expert opinion. Each statement was anonymously rated as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate using a 9-point scale. Survey results were reviewed and discussed prior to a second round of voting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHistologic measurements collected using a uniform biopsy strategy are important for assessing disease activity and determining therapeutic efficacy in UC clinical trials. Multiple biopsy strategies were deemed acceptable, including segmental biopsies collected according to the endoscopic appearance. Biopsies should be scored for architectural change, lamina propria chronic inflammation, basal plasmacytosis, lamina propria and epithelial neutrophils, epithelial damage, and erosions/ulcerations. The Geboes Score, Robarts Histopathology Index, and Nancy Index were considered appropriate for assessing histologic activity; use of the modified Riley Score and Harpaz Index were uncertain. Histological activity at baseline should be required for enrollment, recognizing this carries operational implications. Achievement of histologic improvement or remission were considered appropriate and realistic therapeutic targets. Current histological indices require validation for pediatric populations.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese recommendations provide a framework for standardized implementation of histopathology in UC trials. Additional work is required to address operational considerations and areas of uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Histological remission is evolving as an important treatment target in UC. We aimed to develop a simple histological index, aligned to endoscopy, correlated with clinical outcomes, and suited to apply to an artificial intelligence (AI) system to evaluate inflammatory activity. Methods Using a set of 614 biopsies from 307 patients with UC enrolled into a prospective multicentre study, we developed the Paddington International virtual ChromoendoScopy ScOre (PICaSSO) Histologic Remission Index (PHRI). Agreement with multiple other histological indices and validation for inter-reader reproducibility were assessed. Finally, to implement PHRI into a computer-aided diagnosis system, we trained and tested a novel deep learning strategy based on a CNN architecture to detect neutrophils, calculate PHRI and identify active from quiescent UC using a subset of 138 biopsies. Results PHRI is strongly correlated with endoscopic scores (Mayo Endoscopic Score and UC Endoscopic Index of Severity and PICaSSO) and with clinical outcomes (hospitalisation, colectomy and initiation or changes in medical therapy due to UC flare-up). A PHRI score of 1 could accurately stratify patients\u2019 risk of adverse outcomes (hospitalisation, colectomy and treatment optimisation due to flare-up) within 12 months. Our inter-reader agreement was high (intraclass correlation 0.84). Our preliminary AI algorithm differentiated active from quiescent UC with 78% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity and 86% accuracy. Conclusions PHRI is a simple histological index in UC, and it exhibits the highest correlation with endoscopic activity and clinical outcomes.

        "abstract": "Background and Aims: We previously reported clinical features associated with outcomes in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Here we developed a histopathology model to predict corticosteroid-free remission (CSFR) on mesalamine therapy alone. Methods: Pre-treatment rectal biopsy slides were digitized in training and validation groups of 292 and 113 pediatric UC patients, respectively. Whole slide images (WSI) underwent pre-processing. Thirteen machine learning (ML) models were trained using 250 histomic features including texture, color, histogram, and nuclei. Feature importance was determined by the Gini index with the classifier re-trained using the top features. Results: 187571 informative patches from 292 training group patients (Male:53%; Age:13y (IQR:11-15); CSFR:41%) were trained on 13 ML classifiers. The best model was random forest (RF). Eighteen optimal histomic features were identified and trained, and the corresponding WSI AUROC was 0.89 (95%CI:0.71, 0.96), accuracy of 90% for CSFR. Features were re-trained on an independent real-world dataset of 113 patients and the model WSI AUROC was 0.85 (95%CI:0.75, 0.95), accuracy of 85%.
