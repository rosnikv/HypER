        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 dosage regimens of lyophilized certolizumab pegol (a novel PEGylated anti-tumor necrosis factor agent) as adjunctive therapy to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an inadequate response to MTX therapy alone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this 52-week, phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 982 patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive treatment with subcutaneous certolizumab pegol at an initial dosage of 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2, and 4, with a subsequent dosage of 200 mg or 400 mg given every 2 weeks, plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX. Co-primary end points were the response rate at week 24 according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% criteria for improvement (ACR20) and the mean change from baseline in the modified total Sharp score at week 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 24, ACR20 response rates using nonresponder imputation for the certolizumab pegol 200-mg and 400-mg groups were 58.8% and 60.8%, respectively, as compared with 13.6% for the placebo group. Differences in ACR20 response rates versus placebo were significant at week 1 and were sustained to week 52 (P < 0.001). At week 52, mean radiographic progression from baseline was reduced in patients treated with certolizumab pegol 200 mg (0.4 Sharp units) or 400 mg (0.2 Sharp units) as compared with that in placebo-treated patients (2.8 Sharp units) (P < 0.001 by rank analysis). Improvements in all ACR core set of disease activity measures, including physical function, were observed by week 1 with both certolizumab pegol dosage regimens. Most adverse events were mild or moderate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with certolizumab pegol 200 or 400 mg plus MTX resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in RA signs and symptoms, inhibited the progression of structural joint damage, and improved physical function as compared with placebo plus MTX treatment in RA patients with an incomplete response to MTX.",

        "title": "How tumour necrosis factor blockers interfere with tuberculosis immunity",
        "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immunity to numerous bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept are anti\u2010TNF agents used to treat a range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The use of some of these drugs has been linked to reactivation TB. In addition to blocking TNF\u2010mediated immune responses, some anti\u2010TNF drugs have been found to interfere with innate immune responses, such as phagolysosomal maturation and monocyte apoptosis, as well as cell\u2010mediated responses, including interferon\u2010\u03b3 secretion by memory T cells, complement\u2010mediated lysis of Mtb\u2010reactive CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cell activity. This review summarizes some of the reported effects of TNF blockers on immune cell responses in the context of the observed clinical data on TB reactivation in patients on anti\u2010TNF therapy.",

        "title": "Incidence of Tuberculosis Among Korean Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis Who Are Taking Tumor Necrosis Factor Blockers",
        "abstract": "Objective. To assess the incidence and relative risk of new tuberculosis (TB) infections in Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and patients with AS who are undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Methods. New cases of TB were identified by reviewing the medical records of 919 patients with AS not treated with TNF blockers and those of 354 patients with AS treated with adalimumab (n = 66), infliximab (n = 78), or etanercept (n = 210) between 2002 and 2009. Reference data were obtained from the Korean National Tuberculosis Association. Results. The mean incidence rate of TB was 69.8 per 100,000 person-years (PY) in the general population, 308 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, and 561 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort. The incidence rate of TB in the infliximab-treated AS cohort (540 per 100,000 PY) was higher than that in the adalimumab-treated AS cohort (490 per 100,000 PY). No cases of TB occurred in the etanercept-treated AS cohort. Comparing the relative risks of TB infections between the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort and the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, no statistically significant difference was identified (risk ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.144\u20131.913). Conclusion. The risk of TB was higher in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort than it was in the general population. However, the risk of TB was not increased in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort compared with the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort. Among patients with AS, etanercept is associated with a lower risk of TB compared with monoclonal antibodies.",

        "title": "Potential risk of TNF inhibitors on the progression of interstitial lung disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",
        "abstract": "Objectives Biological therapy represents important advances in alleviating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the effect on interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of such treatment for patients with ILD. Design Case\u2013control cohorts. Setting Single centre in Japan. Participants This study included 163 patients with RA who underwent biological therapy. Outcome measured We assessed chest CT before initiation of biological therapy and grouped 163 patients according to the presence of ILD (with (n=58) and without pre-existing ILD (n=105)). Next, we evaluated serial changes of chest CT after treatment and visually assessed the emergence of ILD or its progression, which was referred to as an \u2018ILD event\u2019. Then, we also classified the patients according to the presence of ILD events and analysed their characteristics. Results Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors were administered to more patients with ILD events than those without ILD events (88% vs 60%, p<0.05), but recipients of tocilizumab or abatacept did not differ in this respect. Of 58 patients with pre-existing ILD, 14 had ILD events, and that proportion was greater than for those without pre-existing ILD (24% vs 3%, p<0.001). Of these 14 patients, all were treated with TNF inhibitors. Four patients developed generalised lung disease and two died from ILD progression. Baseline levels of KL-6 were similar in both groups, but increased in patients with ILD events. Conclusions TNF inhibitors have the potential risk of ILD events, particularly for patients with pre-existing ILD, and KL-6 is a valuable surrogate marker for detecting ILD events. Our data suggest that non-TNF inhibitors are a better treatment option for these patients.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Golimumab is a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody that was derived from human antibody-transgenic mice. Golimumab demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit and tolerable safety in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were methotrexate (MTX)-na\u00efve, or who inadequately responded to MTX or who had previously been treated with a TNF inhibitor. Areas covered: This review summarizes published data on the clinical efficacy and safety for golimumab (including its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics) from multiple global phase III and Japanese phase II/III clinical trials. In the long term extension of three Phase III studies with subcutaneous golimumab, the reported retention rate is high. Expert opinion: Golimumab binds TNF with high affinity and can be delivered subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Like other IgG1 antibodies, Fc\u03b3R functions suggests that antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity is observed but the contribution of cell lysis to efficacy is unclear. Although anti-TNF\u03b1 agents made it possible to achieve clinical remission in RA patients, there is still an unmet need to develop treatments that will enable them to discontinue all RA medication and maintain drug-free remission.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been associated with inflammation and joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and several anti-TNF agents, including golimumab, are currently in clinical use. This postmarketing surveillance (PMS) study was carried out at six rheumatology centers in India to assess the safety and efficacy of golimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, in a real-world setting.\n \n \n \n This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, PMS study, where golimumab 50 mg subcutaneous was administered monthly as per locally approved prescribing regulations. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety of golimumab. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), auto-injector satisfaction/user-friendliness, injection-site pain/reactions, and 28-joint Disease activity score (DAS-28) including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (DAS-28-ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (DAS-28 CRP), were evaluated as per investigator\u2019s routine practice.\n \n \n \n Over 6 months, 120 patients were enrolled and 109 completed the study. Sixty-two (51.7%) patients experienced \u22651 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The majority of TEAEs reported in the study were mild to moderate in severity. No deaths were reported. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) change from baseline in HAQ-DI (\u22120.9 [0.65]) and FACIT-F (14.8 [10.20]) suggested improvement in physical function and fatigue, respectively. The majority of patients (n = 77 [64.2%]) were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d on the satisfaction/user-friendliness parameters of auto-injector and majority (n = 99 [91.7%]) did not experience injection-site reactions. Mean (SD) change from baseline of DAS-28 scores (not assessed for all patients; DAS-28 ESR [n = 62]: \u22122.0 [1.25]) indicated an improvement in disease activity.\n \n \n \n Golimumab (50 mg) in combination with methotrexate was found to be safe and well-tolerated in Indian patients with moderate-to-severe RA. No new safety signals emerged.\n",
