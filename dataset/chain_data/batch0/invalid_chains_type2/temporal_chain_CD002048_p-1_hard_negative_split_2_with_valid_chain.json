        "abstract": "The efficacy, toxicity and possible steroid-sparing properties of auranofin in the treatment of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) were studied in a 2 yr prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty-five patients with onset of arthritis after the age of 60 yr were randomized to either auranofin 3 mg b.i.d. [n = 31, age 70 (61-84) yr, median (range)] or placebo tablets [n = 34, age 72 (60-81) yr]. Oral prednisolone, starting dose 7.5 or 20 mg daily, was used as a rescue drug in patients with intolerable joint pain and stiffness and with C-reactive protein (CRP) > or = 20 mg/l, and was tapered down according to protocol guidelines. Patients receiving auranofin continued therapy for a longer period of time (55% completers) than those on placebo medication (18% completers). The auranofin group consumed significantly less prednisolone, 2.64 (0-11.85) mg/day [median (range)], compared to 5.0 (0-18.33) mg/day in the placebo group (P = 0.006). No group differences at 2 yr follow-up were found for changes in joint pain (P = 0.49), number of swollen joints (P = 0.61), Health Assessment Questionnaire score (P = 0.18) and radiographic damage score (Larsen-Dale index) of the hands (P = 0.84). Within-group changes in radiographic scores were also insignificant. The drop-out rate due to adverse events was surprisingly higher in the placebo group (41%) than in the auranofin group (10%) and, as expected, higher due to lack of effect (29 and 16%). The results indicate that auranofin is safe, superior to placebo and has steroid-sparing capacity in the treatment of EORA. The favourable radiographic outcome in both groups needs confirmation in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To compare three therapeutic strategies using slow acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for their disease modifying properties, toxicity, and lag time until treatment effect. METHODS Patients with recent onset RA from six hospitals were randomly assigned to immediate initiation of one of three treatment strategies: (I) a \u201cmild SAARD with a long lag time\u201d (hydroxychloroquine, if necessary replaced by auranofin); (II) a \u201cpotent SAARD with a long lag time\u201d (intramuscular gold, if necessary replaced byd-penicillamine); (III) a \u201cpotent SAARD with a short lag time\u201d (methotrexate, if necessary replaced by sulfasalazine). Comparisons included two years of follow up. RESULTS All SAARD strategies reduced mean disease activity. A greater percentage of patients improved clinically with strategies II and III than with strategy I: percentages of patients improved on joint score with strategies II and III (79% and 82%, respectively), which was statistically different from strategy I (66%). The same was true for remission percentages: 31% and 24% v 16%, respectively). Longitudinal analysis showed significantly less disability with strategy III, and a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate with strategy II than with strategy I. In addition, radiological damage after one and two years, was significantly lower in strategies II and III (at two years median scores were 11 and 10v 14 in strategy I, p<0.05). Toxicity was increased in strategy II compared with the other strategies. CONCLUSION Strategy III, comprising methotrexate or sulfasalazine, produced the best results weighing effectiveness and toxicity. Strategy I (hydroxychloroquine or auranofin) was slightly less effective, and strategy II (intramuscular gold or d-penicillamine) was associated with increased toxicity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHeightened levels of anxiety and depressed mood are known to be common consequences of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the role of stress vulnerability factors in the longterm course of anxiety and depressed mood in patients with early RA. Specifically, the role of personality characteristics (neuroticism, extraversion), physical and psychological stressors (clinical status, disease influence on daily life, major life events), and coping and social support at the time of diagnosis were studied to predict changes in anxiety and depressed mood 3 and 5 years later.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnxiety and depressed mood, predicted from clinical and self-reported assessments of stress vulnerability factors at the time of diagnosis in 78 patients with RA were assessed again after 3 and 5 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA worse clinical status, more neuroticism, and lower education level at the time of diagnosis were all significantly related to increased psychological distress at the 3 and 5 year followup. However, the personality characteristics of neuroticism proved to be the most consistent and effective predictor of anxiety and depressed mood after 3 and 5 years, irrespective of initial distress levels, biomedical factors, use of medication, and other stressors or vulnerability factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults indicate the prognostic value of personality characteristics for longterm susceptibility to distress in patients with early RA, and emphasize the importance of paying close attention to factors unrelated to RA when screening for patients at risk.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the strength and stability of the relationships between disease-related factors (joint tenderness, pain, and functional disability), social support, and distress over time, and to investigate to what extent disease-related factors and social support can predict distress in short-term and long-term rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was a Dutch extension of the European Research on Incapacitating Diseases and Social Support and started with 292 patients. After 5 waves of data collection, 129 patients remained. Composite measures were computed following the area under the curve approach. Interaction terms were computed between functional disability and social support satisfaction. Correlational and hierarchical regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn patients with short-term RA, disease-related factors and social support were important in determining distress. Also, a buffering effect of social companionship was found. In total, 51% of the variance in distress in short-term RA could be explained primarily by mean distress over the previous years. In patients with long-term RA, disease-related factors remained important in determining distress, but to a lesser extent. Seventeen percent of the variance in distress in long-term RA could be explained primarily by mean distress over the years before.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDuring the course of the disease, patients may learn to adjust to their disease and its consequences and are able to maintain a normal distress level. The effect of the disease on psychological distress decreased over the years. Some support for the buffering hypothesis of social support was found in short-term RA, but not in long-term RA.",

Several clinical variables [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), visual analog scale (VAS) pain, VAS general well-being, Thompson joint score, and morning stiffness] had been assessed at diagnosis and at followup. In addition, the Impact of Rheumatic diseases on General health and Lifestyle questionnaire, comprising different domains of psychological distress, was assessed at diagnosis. Spearman correlations were calculated to determine associations between functional HAQ and clinical and psychological variables at baseline and to determine the associations between clinical variables and the HAQ and PSHAQ score at followup. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify possible predictors at diagnosis for a worse HAQ score and PSHAQ score (score > 1) at followup.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt followup the functional HAQ score was associated with all clinical variables, whereas the PSHAQ was only associated with more subjective patient related variables (VAS pain, VAS general well-being, and morning stiffness). The final model of the multivariate regression analyses to predict a worse HAQ score at followup only included worse functional ability [odds ratio (OR) 2.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-5.32, p = 0.007]. Anxiety (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24, p = 0.007) and a lower ESR value (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00, p = 0.05) assessed at diagnosis were included into the final model as predictors for a high PSHAQ score.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall, the HAQ score, reflecting limitations of daily functioning, is a good representation of disease activity at diagnosis and after a mean disease duration of 7 years, whereas PSHAQ is not.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo define the characteristics of a population of veterans with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have stopped or switched their first biologic agent, and to assess if measures of disease activity are predictors in the decision to alter the regimen.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective analysis of the VA electronic medical record system identified RA patient demographic and disease activity parameters from 1999 to 2007. Demographic data included age, race/ethnicity, sex, and tobacco use. Disease-specific data included date of RA onset, past DMARD therapies, prednisone use, as well as the disease activity score (DAS-28) and the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) at each clinic visit. The use of six biologicals (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, abatacept, rituximab, anakinra) was identified in order to compare those who continued with the medication to those discontinuing or switching to another biological. Descriptive and parametric statistics were applied to define differences between the two groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 454 RA patients identified, 212 have been on a biologic agent at one point in time, and 100 patients (47%) had either stopped or switched their first biologic agent. Among these 100 patients, the most common reasons for stopping or switching a biologic agent were adverse events (in 48%) and inefficacy (43%) Adverse events included malignancies (23% of 48 patients), rash (23%), infections (18.8%), and cardiac complications (18.8%). When comparing the 100 patients versus the 112 that did not stop or switch their first agent, the DAS-28 correlated significantly with a change of regimen with an OR 2.1 (p<0.001). The HAQ score had an OR of 2.0 (p<0.04).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRA patients who continue taking their initial biologic medication have similar age, RA disease duration, ethnicity, and smoking status to those requiring switching or discontinuation. The DAS28 and HAQ scores significantly correlated with stopping or switching of a first biologic agent. Adverse event rates were high and their distributions differed in this population compared to previous studies of younger Caucasian females.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To evaluate persistence with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and predictors of discontinuation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. This retrospective analysis used data from RADIUS 1, a 5-year observational registry of patients with RA, to determine time to first- and second-course discontinuation of etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. First-course therapy was defined as first exposure to anti-TNF therapy, and second-course therapy was defined as exposure to anti-TNF therapy after the first discontinuation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess persistence, log-rank tests were used to compare therapies, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess potential predictors of treatment discontinuation. Results. This analysis included 2418 patients. Mean persistence rates were similar among treatments [first-course: etanercept, 51%; infliximab, 48%; adalimumab, 48% (followup was 54 weeks for etanercept and infliximab and 42 weeks for adalimumab); second-course: 56%, 50%, 46%, respectively (followup was 36 weeks for etanercept and infliximab and 30 weeks for adalimumab)]. Discontinuations of first-course therapy due to ineffectiveness were similar among treatments (etanercept, 19%; infliximab, 19%; adalimumab, 20%) and discontinuations due to adverse events were significantly (p = 0.0006) lower for etanercept than for infliximab (etanercept, 14%; infliximab, 22%; adalimumab, 17%). Predictors from univariable analysis of first- or second-course therapy discontinuation included increased comorbidities (etanercept), female sex (infliximab), Clinical Disease Activity Index > 22 (infliximab), and a Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire score > 0.5 (adalimumab). Conclusion. In this population, first- and second-course persistence was similar among anti-TNF therapies. First-course discontinuation due to adverse events was lower with etanercept compared with infliximab.",

Patients RA patients treated with anti-TNF therapy between January 2011 and January 2012. Measurements Demographic information and therapy assessments were gathered from medical and pharmaceutical records. Data is expressed as means (standard deviations) for quantitative variables and frequency distribution for qualitative variables.

Results In total, 126 treatment series with infliximab (n = 53), etanercept (n = 51) or adalimumab (n = 22) were administered to 91 patients. Infliximab has mostly been used as a first-line treatment, but it was the drug with the shortest time until a change of treatment. Significant predictors of drug survival were: age; the anti-TNF agent; and the previous response to an anti-TNF drug. Limitation The small sample size.

Methods This retrospective nationwide population-based cohort study identified 4,592 anti-TNF-na\u00efve RA patients in whom ETN (n=2,609) or ADA (n=1,983) was initiated using National Health Insurance claims data. After adjustment for prior medication, concomitant medication, and baseline demographic data, the relative risk of drug discontinuation in ADA users compared with ETN users was quantified by calculating adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, stratified by the follow-up time (\u22641 year, >1 year) and/or concomitant MTX dose (\u226410 mg/wk, >10 mg/wk). Results ADA users had a higher risk of drug discontinuation compared with ETN users during the first year of follow-up (aHR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.27), but not during all treatment periods (aHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98\u20131.16) or after 1 year (aHR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87\u20131.13). However, ADA users had a significantly higher risk of drug discontinuation compared with ETN users among patients on concomitant MTX >10 mg/wk during all treatment periods (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10\u20131.47), during the first year of follow-up (aHR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.22\u20131.78), or after 1 year (aHR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06\u20131.90), but not among patients on concomitant MTX 0\u201310 mg/wk. Conclusion This population-based cohort study demonstrated a modification effect of concomitant MTX dose on the relative risk of anti-TNF discontinuation for ADA compared with ETN among anti-TNF-na\u00efve RA patients.
