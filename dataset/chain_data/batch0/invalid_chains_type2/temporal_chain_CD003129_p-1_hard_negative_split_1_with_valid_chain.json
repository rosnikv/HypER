        "title": "Randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of low-dose oral methotrexate in children with extended oligoarticular or systemic arthritis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can persist through adolescence and adulthood, resulting in significant disability. The use of low-dose oral methotrexate (MTX) for persistent polyarthritis has been shown to be effective by the USA/USSR collaborative study group. However, 2 of the most disabling subgroups of JIA, systemic and extended oligoarthritis, were underrepresented in that study. The present study was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of MTX in these 2 subgroups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients under the age of 16 years who fulfilled the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria for systemic or extended oligoarticular arthritis were eligible for this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Forty-five patients with systemic and 43 with extended oligoarticular arthritis were enrolled. The dosage of MTX or placebo was 15 mg/m2, which could be increased to 20 mg/m2 after 2 months. Core outcome variables were considered as primary measures, giving a final score of \"improved\" or \"not improved.\" Secondary measures included scores of systemic features and biochemical laboratory measures. Assessment of function was not included since there were no validated functional measures at the start of this trial in 1991.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the extended oligoarticular arthritis group, MTX treatment produced significant improvement in 3 of 5 core variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, physician's global assessment of disease activity, and parent's global assessment of disease activity). By the primary improvement criteria, there was significant overall improvement during MTX treatment. In the systemic arthritis group, only 2 of 5 core variables were significantly improved (physician's and parent's global assessment of disease activity). Systemic features were not part of the core variables, but the systemic feature score was not significantly different between MTX and placebo treatment. There was no significant overall improvement in this group during MTX treatment. However, no significant interaction between disease subgroup and treatment effect was demonstrated. When the data from both disease subgroups were combined, there was significant clinical improvement during MTX treatment (P = 0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMTX 15-20 mg/m2 given orally once a week was found to be an effective treatment for both extended oligoarticular and systemic JIA in this shortterm trial. Long-term efficacy needs to be addressed in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate hepatotoxicity in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) receiving methotrexate (MTX) therapy with doses of 20-30 mg/m2 of body surface area.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe graded the histology of percutaneous liver biopsies from 34 patients with JIA receiving longterm (> 2.4 years) MTX therapy at the Rheumatism Foundation Hospital, Heinola, Finland, using the Roenigk classification scale. Medical records of the patients with JIA were retrospectively analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 10 patients with MTX doses >/= 20 mg/m2, 4 had grade II, 5 had grade I histology, and one specimen with extensive steatosis as the only pathologic finding could not be classified. All 24 patients treated with low dose MTX had grade I histology. No specimen showed fibrosis or cirrhosis. In 2 patients with grade II histology, extensive portal tract inflammation resolved when MTX was discontinued for 6 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAggressive medical treatment of JIA with MTX at 20-30 mg/m2 with concomitant disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and corticosteroids may contribute to minor liver abnormalities that seem to be reversible.",

        "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although associated with many mild adverse effects, the short and long-term safety of MTX in JIA has been excellent. While many JIA children treated with MTX develop liver enzyme abnormalities, no cases of irreversible liver damage or of severe non-infectious hepatitis with Reye-like features have been reported in non-systemic JIA. We report a 2-year-old girl with oligoarthritis whose liver enzyme increased to greater than 45 times the upper limit of normal, and developed hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia after 10 months of MTX and naproxen therapy. An infectious and metabolic work-up for other causes was unremarkable. She recovered completely after folinic acid therapy; MTX and naproxen was not restarted. While very rare in JIA, MTX in synergism with naproxen can induce severe liver toxicity and it is important to screen children for liver enzyme abnormalities.",

Although the paper focuses on a rare case of severe hepatitis, it builds upon the source paper's findings regarding the hepatotoxicity of long-term MTX therapy in JIA patients. The paper's hypothesis is at least partially dependent on the source paper's findings, as it highlights the importance of screening for liver enzyme abnormalities in JIA patients treated with MTX."

        "title": "Incidence of Chronic Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases After Diagnosis with Kawasaki Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nKawasaki disease (kDa) is an immune-mediated vasculitis of childhood with multi-organ inflammation. We determined the risk of subsequent immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), including arthritis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune liver disease (ALD), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a matched population-based cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Children aged <18\u2009years born between 1991-2016 diagnosed with kDa (n\u2009=\u20093,753) were matched to 5 non-kDa controls from the general population (n\u2009=\u200918\u2009749). We determined the incidence of IMIDs after resolution of kDa. Three- and 12-month washout periods were used to exclude kDa-related symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was an elevated risk of arthritis in kDa patients compared with non-kDa controls starting three months after index date (103.0 vs 12.7 per 100\u2009000 person-years (PYs); incidence rate ratio (IRR) 8.07 (95% CI 4.95-13.2); hazard ratio (HR) 8.08 (95% CI 4.95-13.2), resulting in the overall incidence of IMIDs being elevated in kDa patients (175.1 vs 68.0 per 100\u2009000 PYs; IRR 2.58 (95% CI 1.93-3.43); HR 2.58, 95% CI 1.94-3.43). However, there was no increased risk for diabetes, IBD, ALD, PSC or MS in kDa patients. Similar results were observed using a 12-month washout period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren diagnosed with kDa were at increased risk of arthritis following the acute kDa event, but not other IMIDs. Health care providers should monitor for arthritis in children following a diagnosis of kDa.",

        "title": "Impact of Kawasaki disease on juvenile idiopathic arthritis in real-world patients: A population-based cohort study",
        "abstract": "Objectives Recent research has demonstrated the commonality of several biological markers between Kawasaki disease (KD) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), including interleukin-1\u03b2 and -6. Therefore, in this cohort study, we assessed whether KD increases the risk of JIA. Methods This study enrolled 7009 patients with and 56 072 individuals without KD in the period 2010\u20132018 from Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. On the basis of sex, age, and comorbidities, we executed propensity score matching at the ratio 1:8. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for JIA was determined through multiple Cox regression. Stratified analysis and sensitivity tests were also employed. Results When adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the JIA risk was noted to be 2.02-fold greater in children with KD than it was in those without (aHR: 2.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.12\u20133.67, p = 0.0205). The sensitivity test and subgroup analysis obtained consistent findings in the different sex and comorbidity subgroups. Conclusion Children\u2019s risk of JIA is higher if they have KD. Pediatricians should consider the possibility of JIA in this population. More investigations are necessary to identify the pathological mechanisms that link JIA and KD.",
