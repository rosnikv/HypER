        "abstract": "Albuminuria reduction could be renoprotective in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, the current use of renin-angiotensin-system intervention is targeted to BP only. Therefore, this study investigated the adequacy of this approach in 1428 patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy from the placebo-controlled Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. Investigated were the extent of discordance in treatment effects on systolic BP (SBP) and albuminuria and its association with renal outcome in a multivariate Cox model. Among patients with a reduced SBP during treatment, a lack of albuminuria reduction was observed in 37, 26, and 51% (total, losartan, and placebo, respectively) at month 6. SBP or albuminuria reduction was associated with a lower risk for ESRD, whereas combined SBP and albuminuria reduction was associated with the lowest risk for events. Across all categories of SBP change, a progressively lower ESRD hazard ratio was observed with a larger albuminuria reduction. A lower residual level of albuminuria was also associated with lower ESRD risk. In conclusion, changes in albuminuria are not concordant in a substantial proportion of patients when titrated for BP. Meanwhile, the ESRD risk showed a clear dependence on albuminuria reduction. The ESRD risk also showed dependence on the residual level of albuminuria, even in patients who reached the current SBP target. Antihypertensive treatment that is aimed at improving renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy may therefore require a dual strategy, targeting both SBP and albuminuria reduction.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, patients of Hispanic descent have higher rates of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality than patients from other ethnic groups even though the prevalence of hypertension among Hispanics is lower. This discrepancy likely reflects lower rates of hypertension awareness and control among Hispanics as well as a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors in this population. Although available data suggest that patients of Hispanic descent who receive antihypertensive therapy experience responses and treatment benefits similar to those achieved by other ethnic groups, clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have typically enrolled only small numbers of Hispanic patients. Agents targeting the renin-angiotensin system, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, may be particularly useful in the Hispanic population given the ability of these drugs to protect against hypertension-related and diabetes-related end-organ damage independent of their blood pressure-lowering effects.",

Among these, 127 (64.1%) were identified as having AH, 54 (42.5%) of whom had no prior diagnosis. From those who were previously diagnosed, only 31.3% had good blood pressure control. Higher prevalence was observed in those individuals with lower incomes, higher body mass indexes (BMI), and those with metabolic syndrome (MS).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data demonstrated that there was a high prevalence of AH in the urban, low education and income levels adult population of Triunfo, strongly associated with lower income levels, elevated BMI, and the presence of MS; and a high prevalence of bad blood pressure control among the previously diagnosed cases. These results indicate that more effective interventions for early detection and adequate control of this disease and its comorbidities are necessary.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWe aimed to obtain overall and regional estimates of hypertension prevalence, and to examine the pattern of this disease condition across different socio-demographic characteristics in low-and middle-income countries.We searched electronic databases from inception to August 2015. We included population-based studies that reported hypertension prevalence using the current definition of blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. We used random-effects meta-analyses to pool prevalence estimates of hypertension, overall, by World Bank region and country income group. Meta-regression analyses were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity across the included studies.A total of 242 studies, comprising data on 1,494,609 adults from 45 countries, met our inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 32.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29.4\u201335.3), with the Latin America and Caribbean region reporting the highest estimates (39.1%, 95% CI 33.1\u201345.2). Pooled prevalence estimate was also highest across upper middle income countries (37.8%, 95% CI 35.0\u201340.6) and lowest across low-income countries (23.1%, 95% CI 20.1\u201326.2). Prevalence estimates were significantly higher in the elderly (\u226565 years) compared with younger adults (<65 years) overall and across the geographical regions; however, there was no significant sex-difference in hypertension prevalence (31.9% vs 30.8%, P\u200a=\u200a0.6). Persons without formal education (49.0% vs 24.9%, P\u200a<\u200a0.00001), overweight/obese (46.4% vs 26.3%, P\u200a<\u200a0.00001), and urban settlers (32.7% vs 25.2%, P\u200a=\u200a0.0005) were also more likely to be hypertensive, compared with those who were educated, normal weight, and rural settlers respectively.This study provides contemporary and up-to-date estimates that reflect the significant burden of hypertension in low- and middle-income countries, as well as evidence that hypertension remains a major public health issue across the various socio-demographic subgroups. On average, about 1 in 3 adults in the developing world is hypertensive. The findings of this study will be useful for the design of hypertension screening and treatment programmes in low- and middle-income countries.",

To determine association of measures of socioeconomic status (wealth, education, and social capital) with hypertension awareness, treatment, and control among urban and rural subjects in these countries we performed the present study. METHODS We enrolled 33,423 subjects aged 35\u201070 years (women 56%, rural 53%, low\u2010education status 51%, low household wealth 25%, low\u2010social capital 33%) in 150 communities in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh during 2003\u20102009. Prevalence of hypertension and its awareness, treatment, and control status and their association with wealth, education, and social capital were determined. RESULTS Age\u2010, sex\u2010, and location\u2010adjusted prevalence of hypertension in men was 31.5% (23.9\u201040.2%) and women was 32.6% (24.9\u201041.5%) with variations in prevalence across study sites (urban 30\u201056%, rural 11\u201043%). Prevalence was significantly greater in urban locations, older subjects, and participants with more wealth, greater education, and lower social capital index. Hypertension awareness was in 40.4% (urban 45.9, rural 32.5), treatment in 31.9% (urban 37.6, rural 23.6), and control in 12.9% (urban 15.4, rural 9.3). Control was lower in men and younger subjects. Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control were significantly lower, respectively, in lowest vs. highest wealth index tertile (26.2 vs. 50.6%, 16.9 vs. 44.0%, and 6.9 vs. 17.3%, P < 0.001) and lowest vs. highest educational status tertile (31.2 vs. 48.4%, 21.8 vs. 42.1%, and 7.8 vs. 19.2%, P < 0.001) while insignificant differences were observed in lowest vs. highest social capital index (38.2 vs. 36.1%, 35.1 vs. 27.8%, and 12.5 vs. 9.1%).

We summarize unique features of hypertension in India.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nTwo recent nationwide studies to determine hypertension prevalence have been performed-Fourth National Family Health Survey and Fourth District Level Health Survey/Annual Health Survey. Age-adjusted hypertension was more in men (24.5%) than women (20.0%). Hypertension is more common in developed states of the country, urban populations and better socioeconomic status individuals. Urban-rural convergence and greater hypertension in younger men and women are unique findings. There is low status of its awareness, treatment and control. Diabetes prevalence is high in hypertension suggesting importance of insulin resistance. Prevalence of resistant hypertension is high. Pharmacoepidemiology studies have reported widespread use of all classes of antihypertensive drugs with increasing use of renin-angiotensin system blockers. There are limited studies focused on genetic epidemiology.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nHypertension is widely prevalent in India with large regional variation, greater prevalence in urban areas and the young.

It is not yet clear if salt substitutes reduce blood pressure (BP) among Indian hypertensive patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nExamine the acceptability, usage, and BP effects of a reduced-sodium and added-potassium salt substitute among hypertensive patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 502 participants with hypertension (aged 61.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0 y, 58.8% women) from 7 villages in rural India. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either regular salt (100% sodium chloride) or the salt substitute (70% sodium chloride/30% potassium chloride blend), and advised to replace all home salt use. The primary outcome was the change in systolic BP (SBP) from baseline to 3 mo comparing the salt substitute and regular salt groups. Secondary outcomes included the change in diastolic BP (DBP), 24-h urinary biomarkers, and self-reported use and satisfaction with the study salt provided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 494 (98%) participants completed 1 mo and 476 (95%) participants completed the 3-mo follow-up. At 3 mo, the salt substitute intervention significantly decreased the average SBP by 4.6 mmHg (95% CI: 3.0, 6.2, P\u00a0< 0.001) and DBP by 1.1 mmHg (95% CI: 0.2, 2.1 mmHg, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There was a significant increase in 24-h urinary potassium excretion in the salt substitute group by 0.24 g/d (95% CI: 0.12, 0.35 g/d, P\u00a0< 0.001) and a decrease in the urinary sodium to potassium ratio by 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.87, P\u00a0< 0.0001) compared with the control group. Participants reported that they used the study salt nearly every day of the week (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, 6.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 d) and rated the taste of the study salts similarly.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe reduced-sodium added-potassium salt led to a substantial reduction in SBP in hypertensive patients, supporting salt substitution as an effective, low-cost intervention for BP lowering in rural India.

        "abstract": "Background: Salt substitution (ie, replacement of table and cooking salt with potassium-enriched salt substitutes) is a promising strategy to reduce blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular disease, particularly in countries like India where there is high sodium intake, mainly from discretionary salt, and low potassium intake. Life-threatening hyperkalemia from increased potassium intake is a postulated concern for individuals with chronic kidney disease. methods: We used comparative risk assessment models to estimate the number of (1) cardiovascular deaths averted due to blood pressure reductions; (2) potential hyperkalemia-related deaths from increased potassium intake in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease; and (3) net averted deaths from nationwide salt substitution in India. We evaluated a conservative scenario, based on a large, long-term pragmatic trial in rural China; and an optimistic scenario informed by our recent trial in India. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Results: In the conservative scenario, a nationwide salt substitution intervention was estimated to result in \u2248214\u2009000 (95% uncertainty interval, 92\u2009764\u2013353\u2009054) averted deaths from blood pressure reduction in the total population and \u224852\u2009000 (22\u2009961\u201380\u2009211) in 28 million individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease, while \u224822\u2009000 (15\u2009221\u201331\u2009840) hyperkalemia-deaths might be caused by the intervention. The corresponding estimates for the optimistic scenario were \u2248351\u2009000 (130\u2009470\u2013546\u2009255), \u224866\u2009000 (24\u2009925\u2013105\u2009851), and \u22489000 (4251\u201314\u2009599). Net benefits were consistent across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Modeling nationwide salt substitution in India consistently estimated substantial net benefits, preventing around 8% to 14% of annual cardiovascular deaths. Even allowing for potential hyperkalemia risks there were net benefits estimated for individuals with chronic kidney disease.",

        "abstract": "Salt plays a critical role in India's past as well as its present, from Dandi March to its role as a vehicle for micronutrient fortification. However, excess salt intake is a risk factor for high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Indians consume double the World Health Organization recommended daily salt (<5 g). India has committed to a 30 per cent reduction in sodium intake by 2025. Evidence based strategies for population sodium intake reduction require a moderate reduction in salt in \u2013 home cooked foods, packaged foods and outside-home foods. Reducing the sodium content in packaged food includes policy driven interventions such as front-of-package warning labels, food reformulation, marketing restrictions and taxation on high sodium foods. For foods outside of the home, setting standards for foods purchased and served by schemes like mid-day meals can have a moderate impact. For home cooked foods (the major source of sodium), strategies include advocacy for reducing salt intake. In addition to mass media campaigns for awareness generation, substituting regular salt with low sodium salt (LSS) has the potential to reduce salt intake even in the absence of a major shift in consumer behaviour. LSS substitution effectively lowers blood pressure and thus reduces the risk of CVDs. Further research is required on the effect of LSS substitutes on patients with chronic kidney disease. India needs an integrated approach to sodium reduction that uses evidence based strategies and can be implemented sustainably at scale. This will be possible only through scientific research, governmental leadership and a responsive evidence-to-action approach through a multi-stakeholder coalition.",
