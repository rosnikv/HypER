        "title": "Phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine excretion is increased in children with cystic fibrosis and is associated with plasma homocysteine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHepatic steatosis and fat malabsorption are common in cystic fibrosis (CF). Choline deficiency results in decreased phosphatidylcholine synthesis through the cytidine diphosphocholine-choline pathway and hepatic steatosis and in increased synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine using methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine. The intestinal absorption of phosphatidylcholine in CF is unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective was to determine whether excretion of choline phosphoglyceride (phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine) is increased in CF and whether loss of fecal choline phosphoglyceride is associated with altered plasma methionine cycle metabolites.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cross-sectional study involved 53 children with CF and 18 control children without CF. Blood was collected from all participants. A subset of 18 children with CF and 8 control children provided 72-h fecal samples and 5-d food records.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFat absorption was significantly lower (x+/- SEM: 86.2 +/- 1.6% and 94.1 +/- 1.2%) and excretion of fecal fat (12.9 +/- 1.7 and 3.9 +/- 0.7 g/d), phospholipid (median: 130 and 47.7 mg/d), phosphatidylcholine (19.6 and 2.1 mg/d), and lysophosphatidylcholine (60.3 and 16.9 mg/d) was significantly higher in children with CF than in control children, respectively (P < 0.05). Choline phosphoglyceride excretion was positively correlated with plasma homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine and inversely related with plasma methionine (P < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCholine phosphoglyceride excretion is increased in children with CF and is associated with decreased plasma methionine and increased homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine. These findings suggest choline depletion and an increased choline synthesis by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation in CF, as well as a metabolic link between phosphatidylcholine metabolism and the methionine-homocysteine cycle in humans.",

        "abstract": "S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is the major biological methyl donor. AdoMet's methyl group arises both from the diet (eg, methionine, choline, and betaine) and from de novo synthesis by the process of methylneogenesis. At least 50 AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions have been identified in mammals, and genomic analyses suggest that the final number will be much higher. Such methylation reactions play major roles in biosynthesis, regulation, and detoxification. Creatine synthesis is thought to account for the use of >70% of AdoMet-derived methyl groups in humans. This is not consistent with recent studies in mice, in which the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase gene was deleted (PEMT-/-). Loss of this hepatic enzyme resulted in a 50% decrease in plasma homocysteine, which suggests that it accounts for a major component of whole-body AdoMet utilization. A reexamination of human creatine metabolism showed that dietary creatine can account for as much as 50% of daily creatine requirements in nonvegetarians and, therefore, that estimates of creatine synthesis need to be reduced. We suggest that creatine synthesis is responsible for a smaller proportion of AdoMet-derived methyl groups than has been suggested and that phosphatidylcholine synthesis via phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase is a major consumer of these methyl groups.",

        "title": "Methyl balance and transmethylation fluxes in humans.",
        "abstract": "Various questions have been raised about labile methyl balance and total transmethylation fluxes, and further discussion has been encouraged. This report reviews and discusses some of the relevant evidence now available. The fact that, if needed, labile methyl balance is maintained by methylneogenesis appears to be established, but several aspects of transmethylation remain uncertain: definitive measurements of the rate of total transmethylation in humans of both sexes on various diets and at various ages; the extent to which synthesis of phosphatidylcholine has been underestimated; and the relative contributions of the 2 pathways for the formation of sarcosine (ie, N-methylglycine). The available evidence indicates that the quantitatively most important pathways for S-adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylation in mammals are the syntheses of creatine by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, of phosphatidylcholine by phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, and of sarcosine by glycine N-methyltransferase. Data presented in this report show that S-adenosylmethionine and methionine accumulate abnormally in the plasma of humans with glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency but not of those with guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency or in the plasma or livers of mice devoid of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity. The absence of such accumulations in the latter 2 conditions may be due to removal of S-adenosylmethionine by synthesis of sarcosine. Steps that may help clarify the remaining issues include the determination of the relative rates of synthesis of sarcosine, creatine, and phosphatidylcholine by rapid measurement of the rates of radiolabel incorporation into these compounds from L-[methyl-3H]methionine administered intraportally to an experimental animal; clarification of the intracellular hepatic isotope enrichment value during stable-isotope infusion studies to enhance the certainty of methyl flux estimates during such studies; and definitive measurement of the dietary betaine intake from various diets.",

        "abstract": "In the early 1930s, Banting and Best, the discoverers of insulin, found that choline could prevent the development of fatty liver disease (steatosis) in pancreatectomized dogs treated with insulin. Later work indicated that in rats and mice, diets deficient in labile methyl groups (choline, methionine, betaine, folate) produced fatty liver and that long-term administration of diets deficient in choline and methionine also caused hepatocellular carcinoma. These experiments not only linked steatosis and diabetes but also provided evidence, for the first time, of the importance of labile methyl group balance to maintain normal liver function. This conclusion is now amply supported by the observation of mice devoid of key enzymes of methionine and folate metabolism and in patients with severe deficiencies in these enzymes. Moreover, treatments with various methionine metabolites in experimental animal models of liver disease show hepatoprotective properties.",

        "abstract": "Deletion of glycine N\u2010methyltransferase (GNMT), the main gene involved in liver S\u2010adenosylmethionine (SAM) catabolism, leads to the hepatic accumulation of this molecule and the development of fatty liver and fibrosis in mice. To demonstrate that the excess of hepatic SAM is the main agent contributing to liver disease in GNMT knockout (KO) mice, we treated 1.5\u2010month\u2010old GNMT\u2010KO mice for 6 weeks with nicotinamide (NAM), a substrate of the enzyme NAM N\u2010methyltransferase. NAM administration markedly reduced hepatic SAM content, prevented DNA hypermethylation, and normalized the expression of critical genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. More importantly, NAM treatment prevented the development of fatty liver and fibrosis in GNMT\u2010KO mice. Because GNMT expression is down\u2010regulated in patients with cirrhosis, and because some subjects with GNMT mutations have spontaneous liver disease, the clinical implications of the present findings are obvious, at least with respect to these latter individuals. Because NAM has been used for many years to treat a broad spectrum of diseases (including pellagra and diabetes) without significant side effects, it should be considered in subjects with GNMT mutations. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the anomalous accumulation of SAM in GNMT\u2010KO mice can be corrected by NAM treatment leading to the normalization of the expression of many genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as reversion of the appearance of the pathologic phenotype.

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress damages multiple cellular components including DNA, lipids, and proteins and has been linked to pathological alterations in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission, resulting from nutrient overload and mitochondrial dysfunction, is thought to be a principal mediator in NAFLD progression, particularly toward the development of hepatic insulin resistance. In the context of insulin signalling, ROS has a dual role, as both a facilitator and inhibitor of the insulin signalling cascade. ROS mediate these effects through redox modifications of cysteine residues affecting phosphatase enzyme activity, stress-sensitive kinases, and metabolic sensors. This review highlights the intricate relationship between redox-sensitive proteins and insulin signalling in the context of fatty liver disease, and to a larger extent, the importance of reactive oxygen species as primary signalling molecules in metabolically active cells.",

        "abstract": "While the role of both elevated levels of circulating bacterial cell wall components and adipose tissue in hepatic fat accumulation has been recognized, it has not been considered that the bacterial components-recognizing adipose tissue receptors contribute to the hepatic fat content. In this study we found that the expression of adipose tissue bacterial flagellin (FLG)-recognizing Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5 associated with liver fat content (r = 0.699, p = 0.003) and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.529, p = 0.016) in humans (n = 23). No such associations were found for lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-recognizing TLR4. To study the underlying molecular mechanisms of these associations, human HepG2 hepatoma cells were exposed in vitro to the conditioned culture media derived from FLG or LPS-challenged human adipocytes. The adipocyte-mediated effects were also compared to the effects of direct HepG2 exposure to FLG and LPS. We found that the media derived from FLG-treated adipocytes stimulated fat accumulation in HepG2 cells, whereas either media derived from LPS-treated adipocytes or direct FLG or LPS exposure did not. This is likely due to that FLG-treatment of adipocytes increased lipolysis and secretion of glycerol, which is known to serve a substrate for triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes. Similarly, only FLG-media significantly decreased insulin signaling-related Akt phosphorylation, IRS1 expression and mitochondrial respiratory chain ATP5A. In conclusion, our results suggest that the FLG-induced TLR5 activation in adipocytes increases glycerol secretion from adipocytes and decreases insulin signaling and mitochondrial functions, and increases fat accumulation in hepatocytes. These mechanisms could, at least partly, explain the adipose tissue TLR5 expression associated with liver fat content in humans.",

Therefore, we comprehensively examined the effects of E. cloacae subsp. cloacae (ATCC\u00ae 13047\u2122) administration on host metabolism of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into HFD control, chow control, and E. cloacae treatment groups. The E. cloacae treatment group received live bacterial cells in PBS intragastrically twice a week, every other week for 13 weeks. Both control groups received PBS intragastrically. After the 13-week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed for gene and protein expression and functional analyses. Our results show that E. cloacae administration increased subcutaneous fat mass and the relative proportion of hypertrophic adipocytes. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat had signs of decreased insulin signaling and elevated lipolysis that was reflected in higher serum glycerol levels. In addition, E. cloacae -treated mice had significantly higher hepatic AST and AST/ALT ratio, and their liver histology indicated fibrosis, demonstrating that E. cloacae subsp. cloacae administration promotes hepatic damage in HFD fed mice.",

        "abstract": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) leads to the development of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, but there are currently no potent drugs that inhibit the production or toxicity of TMAO. In this study, high-fat diet-fed ApoE-/- mice were treated with finasteride, ranitidine, and andrioe. Subsequently, the distribution and quantity of gut microbiota in the faeces of the mice in each group were analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V3+V4 regions. Pathological examination confirmed that both ranitidine and finasteride reduced atherosclerosis and renal damage in mice. HPLC analysis also indicated that ranitidine and finasteride significantly reduced the synthesis of TMAO and the TMAO precursor delta-Valerobetaine in their livers. The 16S rRNA sequencing showed that all 3 drugs significantly increased the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in the model mice. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the faeces of mice treated with ranitidine and finasteride, had significant increases in the number of microbes in the families g_Helicobacter, f_Desulfovibrionaceae, Mucispirillum_schaedleri_ASF457, and g_Blautia, whereas the relative abundances of microbes in the families Enterobacter_sp._IPC1-8 and g_Bacteroides were significantly reduced. The microbiota metabolic pathways, such as nucleotide and cofactor and vitamin metabolism were also significantly increased, whereas the activities of metabolic signalling pathways related to glycan biosynthesis and metabolism and cardiovascular diseases were significantly reduced. Therefore, our study indicates that in addition to their known pharmacological effects, ranitidine and finasteride also exhibit potential cardiovascular and renal protective effects. They inhibit the synthesis and metabolism of TMAO and delay the deposition of lipids and endotoxins through improving the composition of the gut microbiota.",

Here, Klotho+/- mice and wild-type mice were treated with low-dose bovine serum albumin (BSA).

The serum levels of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, creatinine, and urea in BSA-Kl-/+ mice were significantly increased. Sequencing of gut microbiota 16S rRNA v3-v4 region indicated that BSA-Kl-/+ mice showed a significantly higher relative abundance of the genera Dubosiella, Akkermansia, Alloprevotella, and Lachnospiraceae and a significantly lower relative abundance of the genera Allobaculum and Muribaculaceae than BSA-WT mice. KEGG analysis revealed that the metabolic pathways of signal transduction, xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, and lipid metabolism increased significantly in BSA-Kl-/+ mice.

Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut-derived uremic toxin. Our previous clinical study demonstrated that the elevation of TMAO was positively correlated with CKD progression. Finasteride, a competitive and specific inhibitor of type II 5a-reductase, has been reported recently to be able to downregulate plasma TMAO level thus preventing the onset of atherosclerosis by our research group. In this study, we established a protein-overload nephropathy CKD mouse model by bovine serum albumin (BSA) injection to investigate whether hyperlipidemia could accelerate CKD progression and the underlying mechanisms. Finasteride was administrated to explore its potential therapeutic effects. The results of biochemical analyses and pathological examination showed that HFD-induced hyperlipidemia led to aggravated protein-overload nephropathy in mice along with an elevated level of circulating TMAO, which can be alleviated by finasteride treatment possibly through inhibition of Fmo3 in liver. The 16 S rRNA sequencing results indicated that HFD feeding altered the composition and distribution of gut microbiota in CKD mice contributing to the enhanced level of TMAO precursor TMA, while finasteride could exert beneficial effects via promoting the abundance of Alistipes_senegalensis and Akkermansia_muciniphila. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) and qRT-PCR results demonstrated the disruption of intestinal barrier by decreased expression of tight junction proteins including Claudin-1 and Zo-1 in HFD-fed CKD mice, which can be rescued by finasteride treatment. Cytokine arrays and redox status analyses revealed an upregulated inflammatory level and oxidative stress after HFD feeding in CKO mice, and finasteride-treatment could alleviate these lesions. To summarize, our study suggested that finasteride could alleviate HFD-associated deterioration of protein-overload nephropathy in mice by inhibition of TMAO synthesis and regulation of gut microbiota.",

However, the underlying mechanism of astrocytic cholesterol metabolism in SD-induced cognitive impairment has not been fully explored.

Nevertheless, how TMAO affects brain cholesterol metabolism remains unclear. In our study, increased FMO3 and brain TMAO levels were observed in the SD mice, and elevated levels of TMAO were confirmed to lead to SD-induced cognitive dysfunction. In addition, we found that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) is decreased in the brain of SD mice, resulting in the reduction in brain cholesterol content, which in turn causes synaptic damage. Moreover, we demonstrated that TMAO inhibits the expression of SREBP2. In contrast, FMO3 inhibitor 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM) alleviates SD-induced cognitive impairment by targeting the liver\u2013brain axis.
