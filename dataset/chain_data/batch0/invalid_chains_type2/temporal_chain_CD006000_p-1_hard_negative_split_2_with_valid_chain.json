        "abstract": "We entered 60 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine whether colchicine is therapeutically effective. Thirty patients had early disease (Stages 1 and 2), and 30 had advanced disease (Stages 3 and 4). Fifteen patients with early disease and 15 with advanced disease received colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily), and the remainder received placebo. Patients were studied about every two months; those remaining in the blind phase at two years underwent repeat liver biopsy and were then placed on open-label colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily). With a few exceptions, the results in patients with early disease were similar to those in patients with advanced disease; hence, data on patients in all stages were combined in the main analysis. During the two-year study period the colchicine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo-treated patients, had improvement in levels of serum albumin, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and aminotransferases. However, there was no such improvement in the severity of symptoms or physical findings; moreover, there was no significant difference in the histologic changes noted at liver biopsy in the two treatment groups. At four years after entry, the cumulative mortality from liver disease was 21 percent in patients given colchicine and 47 percent in those given placebo (P = 0.05). The only side effect of colchicine was diarrhea, noted in three patients. The consistent and significant improvement in a number of markers of liver disease and the apparent decreased mortality from liver disease suggest that colchicine may provide some long-term clinical benefit in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the failure of colchicine to reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis leaves uncertain the effect of the drug on the longterm outcome of this disease.",

        "abstract": "There is preliminary evidence that colchicine, an inhibitor of collagen synthesis, may be beneficial in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. To evaluate the use of colchicine (1 mg per day, five days per week) in the treatment of hepatic cirrhosis, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 patients were followed for up to 14 years. Forty-five patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 41 had posthepatitic cirrhosis, and the remaining 14 had cirrhosis with various other causes. Histologic studies were available for 92 percent of patients. Seventy-three patients were in Child-Turcotte class A, 26 were in class B, and one was in class C. Fifty-four patients received colchicine, and 46 received placebo. The overall survival in the colchicine group was markedly better than in the placebo group (median survival, 11 and 3.5 years, respectively; P less than 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 75 percent in the colchicine group and 34 percent in the placebo group; the corresponding 10-year survival rates were 56 percent and 20 percent. Among the 30 patients treated with colchicine who underwent repeated liver biopsies, histologic improvement was seen in 9; the liver appeared normal in 2, and 7 had minimal portal fibrosis. No histologic improvement was observed in the 14 members of the placebo group who had two or more biopsies. Few side effects were observed in either group.",

        "abstract": "Recurrence is one of the major complications of pericarditis. Treatment of recurrence is often difficult, and immunosuppressive drugs or surgery may be necessary. We conducted an open-label prospective study of nine patients (seven men and two women; age, 18-64 years; mean age, 41.7 +/- 13.7 years). Patients were treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) to prevent recurrences. All patients had suffered at least three relapses despite treatment with acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, prednisone, or a combination. Pericarditis was classified as idiopathic in five patients, postpericardiotomy in two, post-myocardial infarction in one, and associated with disseminated lupus erythematosus in one. For statistical analysis, we conducted a paired comparison design (Student's t test). All patients treated with colchicine responded favorably to therapy. Prednisone was discontinued in all patients after 2-6 weeks (mean, 26.33 +/- 10.9 days), and colchicine alone was continued. After a mean follow-up of 24.3 months (minimum, 10 months; maximum, 54 months), no recurrences were observed in any patient; there was a significant difference between the symptom-free periods before and after treatment with colchicine (p less than 0.002). Our study suggests that colchicine may be useful in avoiding recurrence of pericarditis, although these results need to be confirmed in a larger, double-blind study.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe most troublesome complication of acute pericarditis is recurrent episodes of pericardial inflammation, occurring in 15% to 32% of cases. The cause of the recurrence is usually unknown, although in some cases it may be traced to viral infection or may be a consequence of coronary artery bypass grafting. The optimal method for prevention has not been fully established; accepted modalities include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and pericardiectomy.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nBased on the proven efficacy of colchicine therapy for familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent polyserositis), several small studies have used colchicine successfully to prevent recurrence of acute pericarditis after failure of conventional treatment. Recently, we reported the results from the largest multicenter international study on 51 patients who were treated with colchicine to prevent further relapses and who were followed up for < or = 10 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn light of new trial data that have accumulated in the past decade, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of colchicine for the prevention of recurrent episodes of pericarditis. Clinical and personal experience shows that colchicine may be an extremely promising adjunct to conventional treatment and may ultimately serve as the initial mode of treatment, especially in idiopathic cases.",

        "abstract": "To the Editor: \n\nWe read with great interest the article by Adler et al regarding colchicine treatment for recurrent pericarditis.1 The authors described 51 patients from Israel, Spain, and the United States. The pericarditis was idiopathic in 33 patients and secondary in 18. Recurrences of pericarditis did not respond to conventional therapy consisting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis, or some combination thereof and could only be controlled after the initiation of colchicine treatment. The authors concluded that colchicine was effective and safe for the long-term prevention of recurrent pericarditis, especially in idiopathic cases.\n\nColchicine therapy has been shown to be an effective method for eliminating attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent and self-limited attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of peritoneum, synovium, and pleura.2 Pericardial involvement is a rare but well-known feature of the disease.2 Tauber et al3 reported 2 patients who had recurrent pericarditis \u2026",

HLA typing was done in 21 patients at loci B, DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1. MEFV gene was looked in 23 patients using specific primers. During the follow-up we made a new diagnosis of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome in four patients (8.7%) and of rheumatoid arthritis in one patient (2.2%). HLA B14, DRB1*01 and DQB1*0202 were significantly more prevalent, but we did not find a typical HLA typing. MEFV gene was searched: exon 10 was checked by sequence and the E148Q mutation by restriction site analysis. No mutations were found. In conclusion, the prevalence of definite immunorheumatological diseases and the absence of the mutations linked to FMF reinforce the notion that idiopathic acute recurrent pericarditis is an autoimmune condition.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy of a multidrug protocol in recurrent acute pericarditis. We tried also to assess the specific role of colchicine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 58 patients (34 males) in the largest monocentric observational study. All patients received prolonged courses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; generally we do not start a corticosteroid in recurrent acute pericarditis, but if a steroid had already been started, we planned a very slow tapering; if necessary azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, and other immunosuppressive drugs were used; 44 patients (27 males, 61.4%) were treated also with colchicine and 14 patients (7 males, 50%) were not given this drug.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter starting our protocol recurrences dropped from 0.48 to 0.03 attacks/patient/month (p < 0.00001) within 12 months and remained at the same level till the end of the follow-up (mean 8.1 years) in the whole cohort. In the 44 patients treated with colchicine recurrences dropped from 0.54 to 0.03 attacks/patient/month (p < 0.00001) within 12 months, and in 14 patients not given colchicine recurrences decreased from 0.31 to 0.06 attacks/patient/month (p = 0.002). In patients treated with colchicine the decrease was significantly higher (0.51) than in patients not taking this drug (0.25) (p = 0.006). Colchicine was discontinued by 16.3% of patients because of side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA multidrug protocol including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at high dosage, slow tapering of corticosteroid, colchicine, reassurance and close clinical monitoring is very effective in recurrent pericarditis; this improvement is more dramatic in colchicine treated patients, but also patients who do not tolerate it can achieve good control of the disease.",

The exact recurrence rate is unknown, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, and only routine laboratory testing is required. In many, probably most cases, this is an autoimmune disease, but sometimes it is caused by reactivation of viral pericarditis, an unrelated infection, or is provoked by corticosteroid therapy. Therapeutic modalities are non-specific and varied, and usually the etiology is autoimmunity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with the possible addition of colchicine are the best first-choice treatment, before steroid therapy is tried. Corticosteroid therapy is an independent risk factor for recurrences.

Nevertheless, clinicians are often sceptical about the efficacy of the drug, and concerns have risen on possible side effects and tolerability. In this review, we analyse current evidence to support the use of the drug, as well as possible harms and risks related to drug interactions, reaching the conclusion that colchicine is safe and useful in recurrent pericarditis, if specific precautions are followed, although less evidence supports its use for the treatment of acute pericarditis, where colchicine remains optional and there is a need for further multicentre confirmatory studies.

Background Recurrent pericarditis prevention is a major management goal that may reduce morbidity and management costs. Although empiric anti-inflammatory therapy is considered the mainstay of treatment, no specific drug has been proven to be efficacious for prevention but colchicine. Methods Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included provided they focused on the pharmacologic primary or secondary prevention of pericarditis. We performed a meta-analysis including studies primary outcome, adverse events, and drug withdrawal. Results From the initial sample of 127 citations, five controlled clinical trials were finally included (795 patients): three studies were double-blind randomised controlled trials, and two studies were open-label randomised controlled trials. Trials followed patients for a mean of 13\u2005months. Meta-analytic pooling showed that colchicine use was associated with a reduced risk of pericarditis during follow-up (RR=0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, p for effect <0.001, p for heterogeneity = 0.95, I2=0%) either for primary or secondary prevention without a significant higher risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR=1.22, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.10, p for effect 0.48, p for heterogeneity = 0.44, I2=0%), but more cases of drug withdrawals (RR=1.85, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.29, p for effect 0.04, p for heterogeneity = 0.42, I2=0%). Gastrointestinal intolerance is the most frequent side effect (mean incidence 8%), but no severe adverse events were recorded.

        "abstract": "Many diseases have been described to be associated with inflammatory processes. The currently available anti-inflammatory drug therapy is often not successful or causes intolerable side effects. Thus, new anti-inflammatory substances are still urgently needed. Plants were the first source of remedies in the history of mankind. Since their chemical characterization in the 19th century, herbal bioactive compounds have fueled drug development. Also, nowadays, new plant-derived agents continuously enrich our drug arsenal (e.g., vincristine, galantamine, and artemisinin). The number of new, pharmacologically active herbal ingredients, in particular that of anti-inflammatory compounds, rises continuously. The major obstacle in this field is the translation of preclinical knowledge into evidence-based clinical progress. Human trials of good quality are often missing or, when available, are frequently not suitable to really prove a therapeutical value. This minireview will summarize the current situation of 6 very prominent plant-derived anti-inflammatory compounds: curcumin, colchicine, resveratrol, capsaicin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and quercetin. We will highlight their clinical potential and/or pinpoint an overestimation.

Immunodrugs include organic synthetics, biological agents such as cytokines and antibodies acting on single targets or pathways have been used to treat immune-related diseases but with limited success. Most of immunostimulants and immunosuppressants in clinical use are the cytotoxic drugs which possess serious side effects. There is a growing interest to use herbal medicines as multi-component agents to modulate the complex immune system in the prevention of infections rather than treating the immune-related diseases. Many therapeutic effects of plant extracts have been suggested to be due to their wide array of immunomodulatory effects and influence on the immune system of the human body. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids, polysaccharides, lactones, alkaloids, diterpenoids and glycosides, present in several plants, have been reported to be responsible for the plants immunomodulating properties. Thus the search for natural products of plant origin as new leads for development of potent and safe immunosuppressant and immunostimulant agents is gaining much major research interest. The present review will give an overview of widely investigated plant-derived compounds (curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechol-3-gallate, quercetin, colchicine, capsaicin, andrographolide, and genistein) which have exhibited potent effects on cellular and humoral immune functions in pre-clinical investigations and will highlight their clinical potential.",

Here, it has been shown that one protein-bound \u03b2-glucan (PBG) from the edible mushroom Coriolus versicolor can be a potent anti-obesity component.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPBG can reduce obesity and metabolic inflammation in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). Gut microbiota analysis reveals that PBG markedly increases the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, although it does not rescue HFD-induced change in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. It appears that PBG alters host physiology and creates an intestinal microenvironment favorable for A. muciniphila colonization. Fecal transplants from PBG-treated animals in part reduce obesity in recipient HFD-fed mice. Further, PBG is shown to upregulate expression of a set of genes related to host metabolism in microbiota-depleted mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe data highlight that PBG may exert its anti-obesity effects through a mirobiota-dependent (richness of specific microbiota) and -independent (modulation of host metabolism) manner. The fact that C. versicolor PBGs\u00a0are approved oral immune boosters in cancers and chronic hepatitis with well-established safety profiles may accelerate PBG as a novel use for obesity treatment.",

        "title": "Pigmentation Levels Affect Melanoma Responses to Coriolus versicolor Extract and Play a Crucial Role in Melanoma-Mononuclear Cell Crosstalk",
        "abstract": "Melanoma, the malignancy originating from pigment-producing melanocytes, is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and has a poor prognosis once the disease starts to metastasize. The process of melanin synthesis generates an immunosuppressive and mutagenic environment, and can increase melanoma cell resistance to different treatment modalities, including chemo-, radio- or photodynamic therapy. Recently, we have shown that the presence of melanin pigment inhibits the melanoma cell response to bioactive components of Coriolus versicolor (CV) Chinese fungus. Herein, using the same human melanoma cell line in which the level of pigmentation can be controlled by the L-tyrosine concentration in culture medium, we tested the effect of suppression of melanogenesis on the melanoma cell response to CV extract and investigated the cell death pathway induced by fungus extract in sensitized melanoma cells. Our data showed that susceptibility to CV-induced melanoma cell death is significantly increased after cell depigmentation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that CV extract can induce RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis in depigmented melanoma cells. Moreover, using the co-culture system, we showed that inhibition of the tyrosinase activity in melanoma cells modulates cytokine expression in co-cultured mononuclear cells, indicating that depigmentation of melanoma cells may activate immune cells and thereby influence a host anticancer response.",

        "title": "Melanoma, Melanin, and Melanogenesis: The Yin and Yang Relationship",
        "abstract": "Melanin pigment plays a critical role in the protection against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation and other environmental stressors. It is produced by the enzymatic transformation of L-tyrosine to dopaquinone and subsequent chemical and biochemical reactions resulting in the formation of various 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) oligomers\u2014main constituents of eumelanin, and benzothiazine and benzothiazole units of pheomelanin. The biosynthesis of melanin is regulated by sun exposure and by many hormonal factors at the tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels. While the presence of melanin protects against the development of skin cancers including cutaneous melanoma, its presence may be necessary for the malignant transformation of melanocytes. This shows a complex role of melanogenesis in melanoma development defined by chemical properties of melanin and the nature of generating pathways such as eu- and pheomelanogenesis. While eumelanin is believed to provide radioprotection and photoprotection by acting as an efficient antioxidant and sunscreen, pheomelanin, being less photostable, can generate mutagenic environment after exposure to the short-wavelength UVR. Melanogenesis by itself and its highly reactive intermediates show cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic activities, and it can stimulate glycolysis and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) activation, which, combined with their immunosuppressive effects, can lead to melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapy. On the other hand, melanogenesis-related proteins can be a target for immunotherapy. Interestingly, clinicopathological analyses on advanced melanomas have shown a negative correlation between tumor pigmentation and diseases outcome as defined by overall survival and disease-free time. This indicates a \u201cYin and Yang\u201d role for melanin and active melanogenesis in melanoma development, progression, and therapy. Furthermore, based on the clinical, experimental data and diverse effects of melanogenesis, we propose that inhibition of melanogenesis in advanced melanotic melanoma represents a realistic adjuvant strategy to enhance immuno-, radio-, and chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "UV light causes excessive oxidative stress and abnormal melanin synthesis, which results in skin hyperpigmentation disorders such as freckles, sunspots, and age spots. Much research has been carried out to discover natural plants for ameliorating these disorders. Aronia melanocarpa contains various polyphenolic compounds with antioxidative activities, but its effects on melanogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of fermented Aronia melanocarpa (FA) fermented with Monascus purpureus on melanogenesis and its underlying mechanism in the B16F10 melanoma cell line. Our results indicate that FA inhibited tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis in alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH)-induced B16F10 cells. FA significantly downregulated the PKA/CREB pathway, resulting in decreased protein levels of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and MITF. FA also inhibited the transcription of MITF by increasing the phosphorylation levels of both GSK3\u03b2 and AKT. Interestingly, we demonstrated that these results were owing to the significant increase in gallic acid, a phenolic compound of Aronia melanocarpa produced after the fermentation of Monascus purpureus. Taken together, our research suggests that Aronia melanocarpa fermented with Monascus purpureus acts as a melanin inhibitor and can be used as a potential cosmetic or therapeutic for improving hyperpigmentation disorders.",

        "abstract": "Hyperpigmentation occurs due to irregular secretion of melanin pigment in the skin. This can affect quality of life depending on its severity, so prevention and management are essential. Oats (Avena sativa L.), a grain consumed worldwide, are known to offer improved health benefits upon germination and fermentation. This study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of lactobacilli-fermented sprouted oat extracts on oxidative stress and melanin overproduction in vitro. The anti-melanogenic effect was investigated using melanin content and tyrosinase activity assays in B16F10 cells, as well as a mushroom tyrosinase-based enzyme inhibition assay. The results showed that L. casei-fermented oat extracts were the most effective for reducing melanin formation by reducing the mRNA expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, tyrosinase, and tyrosinase-related protein 2. Furthermore, L. casei fermentation was effective in improving the total phenolic, flavonoid, and avenanthramide A contents of sprouted oat extracts. The results also demonstrated the antioxidant effects of L. casei-fermented sprouted oat extracts in promoting DPPH radical-scavenging activity, superoxide dismutase-like activity, and reduction in reactive oxygen species levels. Overall, the findings indicate that fermented sprouted oat extracts are promising candidates for antioxidant and anti-hyperpigmentation treatments.",
