        "title": "Beta-blockers versus diuretics in hypertensive men: main results from the HAPPHY trial.",
        "abstract": "Men aged 40-64 years with mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100-130 mmHg] were randomized to treatment with a diuretic (n = 3272) or a beta-blocker (n = 3297), with additional drugs if necessary, to determine whether a beta-blocker based treatment differs from thiazide diuretic based treatment with regard to the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Patients with previous CHD, stroke or other serious diseases, or with contraindications to diuretics or beta-blockers were excluded. If normotension (DBP less than 95 mmHg) was not achieved by monotherapy, other antihypertensive drugs were added, but the two basic drugs were not crossed over. Patients were assessed at 6-monthly intervals. The mean follow-up for end-points was 45.1 months. Blood pressure (BP) side effects and end-points were recorded in a standardized manner. Entry characteristics and the BP reduction achieved were very similar in both treatment groups. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. The incidence of CHD did not differ between the two treatment groups. The incidence of fatal stroke tended to be lower in the beta-blocker treated group than in the diuretic treated group. Total mortality and the total number of end-points were similar in both groups. The percentage of patients withdrawn due to side effects was similar, whereas the number of reported symptoms, according to a questionnaire, was higher for patients on beta-blockers. The incidence of diabetes did not differ between the two groups. Subgroup analyses did not detect a difference in the effect of beta-blockers compared with diuretics in smokers as opposed to non-smokers, and beta-blockers also had the same effects as diuretics in the quartile with the highest predicted risk for CHD. Beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics were approximately equally well tolerated. The two drugs had a similar BP reducing effect although additional drugs had to be given more often in the diuretic group. Antihypertensive treatment based on a beta-blocker or on a thiazide diuretic could not be shown to affect the prevention of hypertensive complications, including CHD, to a different extent.",

        "abstract": "The present study of primary prevention in white men aged 40 to 64 years attempts to investigate whether a beta-blocker given as initial antihypertensive treatment would lower total mortality to a greater extent than thiazide diuretics. Patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 1609, 8110 patient-years) or a thiazide diuretic (n = 1625, 8070 patient-years). The median follow-up time was 4.2 years. The mean dose of metoprolol was 174 mg/d, and of thiazide diuretics, 46 mg/d of hydrochlorothiazide or 4.4 mg/d of bendroflumethiazide. Identical control of blood pressure was achieved using a fixed therapeutic schedule. Total mortality was significantly lower for metoprolol than for thiazide diuretics because of fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Total mortality was also significantly lower in smokers randomized to metoprolol. The benefit demonstrated in patients treated with metoprolol seems to have important implications for clinical practice.",

Cases were patients who had high blood pressure treated with medicines and who presented in 1982 to 1984 with angina or fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Controls were a probability sample of health maintenance organization patients with pharmacologically treated hypertension and free of coronary heart disease. Blinded to case-control status, we reviewed the medical records of the 248 cases and 737 controls. The health maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database was used to ascertain the use of \u03b2-blockers. Fewer cases than controls were taking \u03b2-blockers. This difference was confined to those with nonfatal infarctions. After adjustment for confounding, the estimated relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.99).

The 248 cases presented with new coronary heart disease from 1982 through 1984, and the 737 controls were a probability sample of health maintenance organization patients free of coronary heart disease. The health maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database identified recent stoppers--patients who did not fill their prescriptions regularly enough to be at least 80% compliant. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, subjects who had recently stopped using beta-blockers had a transient fourfold increase in the relative risk of coronary heart disease (relative risk, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 18.5).

        "title": "Adherence to Medication Regimens: Updating a Complex Medical Issue",
        "abstract": "Clinicians face nonadherence as the norm in everyday medical practice. The literature suggests a number of techniques that are likely to increase adherence when incorporated into regular clinical practices and routines. Central to these guidelines appears to be the doctor-patient relationship. For instance, the physician who uses understandable language, encourages open doctor-patient exchange, fosters participation by patients in their own medical care, and creates a friendly and efficient environment should increase the likelihood of adherence. Clinicians can also check adherence to medication regimens by requesting patients to bring in their pill bottles (or other prescription containers) for a discussion on how the medication appears to be working for them. This should elicit information from the patient about problems related to medication adherence. Since patient variables and social support affect adherence behaviors, eliciting information from patients about their understanding and beliefs regarding their particular illness and treatment, as well as enlisting the support of family and friends, may encourage adherence. Identifying what individual patients perceive as obstacles in following treatment regimens decreases their likelihood of nonadherence; these are difficulties that can be negotiated during the medical interview. Individualizing the treatment and minimizing its complexity may provide the solution that encourages adherent behavior. Frequent reeducation, reinforcement, and encouragement, as well as training in self-management and self-monitoring, will at the very least maximize the patient's comprehension of the illness and his or her motivation for adherence--an especially important requisite for living with a chronic condition. Some patients may even wish to openly solicit family and friends for help in the management and monitoring of their illness and treatment, and to structure their environment to support adherence. Education programs for the patient featuring handouts and pamphlets that provide information about the illness in written and illustrated form have been used successfully. Education programs such as patient-oriented package inserts to accompany the medications and brief written summaries of complex treatment plans may also be useful. The purpose of such patient education adjuncts to illness and treatment lie in the hope that they will enhance the likelihood of following treatment recommendations. Through their use, the reason for the treatment and its potential effectiveness will, it is hoped, be better understood (Ley 1988). Overall, significant advances have been made in adherence research. Measurement systems have become more finely tuned, and the definitions and criteria for adherent behaviors are more clear and precise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNoncompliance with medications is one of the most serious problems facing health care today. However, methods to measure compliance have many limitations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo measure specific drug compliance and dosing frequency of two asthma medications, we used medical records data and pharmacy claims data from 276 patients who had concurrent prescriptions for inhaled anti-inflammatory agents and oral theophylline. Patients were randomly selected from the pharmacy claims data files of a health maintenance organization. The patients' medical records were reviewed, and records that did not contain clear documentation of the medication, dose, and dosing frequency were excluded. Data from the remaining 119 medical records were compared with data from pharmacy claims to calculate compliance rates for each medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur calculations showed that patients were significantly more compliant with prescribed theophylline medication than with two inhaled anti-inflammatory medications (P = .0001). No significant differences in compliance were found relative to prescribed dosing frequency (twice daily or less compared with three times daily or more) for either medication (P = .6517).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nComparison of medical record data with pharmacy claims data is an effective indirect measure of patients' compliance with prescribed oral theophylline and inhaled anti-inflammatory agents. Additional interventions must be pursued for patients with asthma regarding adherence to regimens for their prescribed inhaled anti-inflammatory agents.",

Prescription rates for inhaled steroids and inhaled bronchodilators declined, but rates for oral bronchodilators (beta-agonists and theophylline) increased. By stepwise multiple regression, higher bronchodilator-inhaled steroid prescription ratios and lower inhaled steroid prescription rates were each significantly associated with ZIP codes in which greater proportions of residents lacked a high school diploma (P < .001); associations that approached statistical significance were found for higher bronchodilator-inhaled steroid ratios and fewer asthma care providers (P = .05) and for lower inhaled steroid prescription rates and lower proportions of asthma specialists (P = .04).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn Philadelphia, a gap exists between optimal asthma drug prescribing and actual prescribing patterns that has widened from July 1991 to June 1993. Underuse of inhaled steroids is most closely associated with lower educational attainment, suggesting that interventions that include addressing the special asthma care needs of a low-literacy population will be required to achieve the goals of the National Asthma Education Program.",

Target parents were known to read at a 5th-grade level, and English was a second language for many of them. Therefore, extensive revision of the existing PEMs was required.

Methods and procedures: Collected data included interviews, artifacts and field notes from four college student survivors, members of their families, college instructors and personnel from institution's offices for students with disabilities. Main outcomes and results: Findings suggest challenges, learning strategies, future perspectives and the need for academic accommodations fluctuate and evolve for many years post-injury.
