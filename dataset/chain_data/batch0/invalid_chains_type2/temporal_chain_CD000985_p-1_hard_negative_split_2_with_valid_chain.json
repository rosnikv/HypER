        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo evaluate the combination of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex receptor inhibitor and urokinase for treatment of recent (<or=6 weeks) arterial occlusion of the legs.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSeventy patients with lower extremity arterial occlusion of less than 6 weeks duration were randomly separated into two treatment groups: urokinase plus abciximab or urokinase plus placebo. Primary end points were the rate of major complications at 30 days after randomization and the rates of amputation-free survival and survival without open surgery or major amputation at follow-up of 90 days. Two readers unaware of the patients' treatment group assignments analyzed digital subtraction angiograms as they related to the study end points, with a final consensus reading.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThrombolysis relative to clot length was faster in the urokinase-plus-abciximab group (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.76; P < .001). There were no procedure-related deaths or intracranial hemorrhages, but the rate of nonfatal major bleeding was higher with urokinase plus abciximab (four of 50 patients) than with urokinase alone (none of 20 patients; P = .32). At 90 days, amputation-free survival was 96% (48 of 50 patients) in the urokinase-plus-abciximab group compared with 80% (16 of 20 patients) in the urokinase alone group. The hazard ratio for the two Kaplan-Meier curves was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.96; P = .04).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with lower extremity arterial occlusion who were undergoing urokinase thrombolysis, adjunctive abciximab treatment resulted in faster thrombus dissolution and improved amputation-free survival, despite an increase in major bleeding.",

        "title": "Adjunctive techniques in percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy.",
        "abstract": "Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is an established method in interventional radiology and refers to the removal of acute embolic or thrombotic occlusive material in arteries, veins, or vascular grafts using percutaneous transluminal methods. However, initial complete removal of occlusive material can be achieved only in a minority of patients. The amount of removed material varies with the age and composition of the occlusive material. To achieve sufficient revascularization, adjunctive use of a variety of percutaneous endovascular recanalization techniques is necessitated. Additional treatment with local intra-arterial fibrinolysis, balloon angioplasty, stent implantation, endoluminal atherectomy, and other measures results in primary technical success rates of 70% to 100% for revascularization of acutely occluded vessels. The above-mentioned different techniques should not be viewed as competitive treatment modalities, rather a synergistic approach should be offered. The aim of this report is to review different adjunctive techniques in percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy with emphasis on techniques, mechanisms of action, experimental and clinical results, potential complications, and their potential role in view of clinical pathways to treat acute limb ischemia.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary treatment of patients with acute limb ischemia includes both open and endovascular techniques, and advances in technology continue to make interventions easier and safer. However, the greatest gains in improving outcomes in these patients will come from more consistent and prompt recognition of the disease followed by rapid, standardized therapy to minimize the risk of limb loss and subsequent reperfusion-related injury. This article uses case reports to highlight critical issues that may arise during the course of diagnosis and treatment and describes clinical factors associated with morbidity and mortality in these patients.",

        "title": "Thrombolysis of occluded infra-inguinal bypass grafts: is it worthwhile ?",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Thrombosis of an infra-inguinal bypass graft often results in a limb-threatening ischemia. There is no consensus on the optimal management strategy. Aim of the study: To analyse safety and efficacy of catheter-guided intra-arterial thrombolysis to re-open thrombosed infra-inguinal bypass grafts and to identify factors that influence graft patency and limb salvage rate after thrombolytic procedures. Methods: A continuous cohort-study of 106 thrombolytic procedures between 1993 to 2008. Results: Despite a high initial success rate (76%), the mid-term results are less convincing, with a 58% re-occlusion rate at 45 months follow-up. Thrombosed vein grafts, old (2 weeks or more) occlusions, poor run-off and failure to identify or rectify an underlying causative stenosis are determinant for a poor long-term outcome of thrombolytic procedures. Comments: The outcome results of author\u2019s experience are consistent with literature reports. Thrombolysis of occluded infra-inguinal bypass grafts should be limited to selective cases (recent occlusion, prosthetic or vein graft in place since 1 year or more, critical limb ischemia). Despite its obvious advantages, the long-term outcome of thrombolytic procedures is deceiving. The inherent risk of hemorrhagic complications should also be taken in account at the decision making of treatment strategy. The question wether, in general, catheter-guided selective intra-arterial thrombolysis offers a significant advantage over operative revascularisation (thrombectomy or new bypass) remains unanswered. A more selective approach seems to favour thrombolysis as most appropriate strategy in the management of recent (< 2 weeks) thromboses of grafts in place since at least 1 year.",

The key hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it aims to identify factors that influence graft patency and limb salvage rate after thrombolytic procedures, building on the understanding of the disease and its treatment options."
