        "abstract": "Summary Many studies suggest a higher incidence of thromboembolic syndromes such as stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with heart failure (HF), particularly those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. As a result, some clinicians have chosen to treat patients with HF with anticoagulants as primary prevention against thromboembolic events. However, this practice is not well-supported by scientific data. Retrospective analyses of large HF trials have yielded contradictory results and randomised trials designed to specifically address this question have been under-populated and under-powered. As a result, there is no general consensus among professional societies in either recommending or advising against anticoagulants in HF. We hope that ongoing clinical trials, WARCEF in particular, will yield results that will guide clinicians in deciding for or against routine use of anticoagulants in HF.",

        "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (HF) with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction is common and remains an extremely serious disorder with a high mortality and morbidity. Many complications related to HF can be related to thrombosis. Epidemiological and pathophysiological data also link HF to an increased risk of thrombosis, leading to the clinical consequences of sudden death, stroke, systemic thrombo\u2010embolism, and/or venous thrombo\u2010embolism. This consensus document of the Heart Failure Association (EHFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis reviews the published evidence and summarizes \u2018best practice\u2019, and puts forward consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and assist management decisions in everyday clinical practice. In HF patients with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation is recommended, and the CHA2DS2\u2010VASc and HAS\u2010BLED scores should be used to determine the likely risk\u2013benefit ratio (thrombo\u2010embolism prevention vs. risk of bleeding) of oral anticoagulation. In HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who are in sinus rhythm there is no evidence of an overall benefit of vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) on mortality, with risk of major bleeding. Despite the potential for a reduction in ischaemic stroke, there is currently no compelling reason to use warfarin routinely for these patients. Risk factors associated with increased risk of thrombo\u2010embolic events should be identified and decisions regarding use of anticoagulation individualized. Patient values and preferences are important determinants when balancing the risk of thrombo\u2010embolism against bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulants that offer a different risk\u2013benefit profile compared with warfarin may appear as an attractive therapeutic option, but this would need to be confirmed in clinical trials.",

The main objective of this study was to determine LXA4 plasma levels in PE women. The correlations among LXA4 levels, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP) levels, and clinical/laboratory parameters of the studied participants were also investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLXA4 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 23 nonpregnant, 26 normotensive pregnant, and 27 PE women (early PE (N = 10) and late PE (N = 17)), according to gestational age (GA) at clinical symptoms onset). The clinical/laboratory parameters included in Spearman's correlation analysis were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, platelet count, proteinuria, and white blood cell count (WBC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nLXA4 levels were higher in PE women than in nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women, and similar between nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women. LXA4 plasma levels were higher in early PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA < 34 weeks) and in late PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA \u2265 34 weeks). No significant differences were detected between early and late PE. LXA4 levels were positively correlated with us-CRP levels, SBP, DBP, and WBC. No significant correlation was detected between LXA4 levels and the other laboratory parameters.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChronic inflammation in PE, in spite of increased levels of LXA4, points to a possible failure in this regulatory pathway. Further studies are necessary to clarify this issue and to evaluate the role of LXA4 and other proresolving mediators of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PE.",

        "title": "Annexin A1 and specialized proresolving lipid mediators: promoting resolution as a therapeutic strategy in human inflammatory diseases",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: The timely resolution of inflammation is essential to restore tissue homeostasis and to avoid chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution of inflammation is an active process modulated by various proresolving mediators, including annexin A1 (AnxA1) and specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), which counteract excessive inflammatory responses and stimulate proresolving mechanisms. Areas covered: The protective effects of AnxA1 and SPMs have been extensively explored in pre-clinical animal models. However, studies investigating the function of these molecules in human diseases are just emerging. This review highlights recent advances on the role of proresolving mediators, and pharmacological opportunities of promoting resolution pathways in preclinical models and patients with various human diseases. Expert opinion: Dysregulation or \u2018failure\u2019 in proresolving mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Altered levels of proresolving mediators were found in a wide range of human diseases. In some cases, AnxA1 and SPMs are up-regulated in human blood and tissues but fail to engage in proresolving signaling and, hence, to regulate excessive inflammation. Thus, the new concept of \u2018resolution pharmacology\u2019 could be applied to compensate deficiency of endogenous proresolving mediators\u2019 generation and/or possible failures in the engagement of resolution pathways observed in many chronic inflammatory diseases.",

In keeping with this hallmark feature, annexins have been implicated in the Ca2+-controlled regulation of a broad range of membrane events. In this review, we identify and discuss several themes of annexin actions that hold a potential therapeutic value, namely, the regulation of the immune response and the control of tissue homeostasis, and that repeatedly surface in the annexin activity profile.

        "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are key elements in the innate immune response. Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 is a PRR that, in addition to proinflammatory, pathogen\u2010derived compounds, also recognizes the anti\u2010inflammatory endogenous ligand annexin A1 (AnxA1). Because the contribution of this signaling axis in viral infections is undefined, we investigated AnxA1\u2010mediated FPR2 activation on influenza A virus (IAV) infection in the murine model. AnxA1\u2010treated mice displayed significantly attenuated pathology upon a subsequent IAV infection with significantly improved survival, impaired viral replication in the respiratory tract, and less severe lung damage. The AnxA1\u2010mediated protection against IAV infection was not caused by priming of the type I IFN response but was associated with an increase in the number of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and enhanced pulmonary expression of the AM\u2010regulating cytokine granulocyte\u2010M\u2010CSF (GM\u2010CSF). Both AnxA1\u2010mediated increase in AM levels and GM\u2010CSF production were abrogated when mouse (m)FPR2 signaling was antagonized but remained up\u2010regulated in mice genetically deleted for mFPR1, an mFPR2 isoform also serving as AnxA1 receptor. Our results indicate a novel protective function of the AnxA1\u2010FPR2 signaling axis in IAV pathology via GM\u2010CSF\u2010associated maintenance of AMs, expanding knowledge on the potential use of proresolving mediators in host defense against pathogens.\u2014Schloer, S., H\u00fcbel, N., Masemann, D., Pajonczyk, D., Brunotte, L., Ehrhardt, C., Brandenburg, L.\u2010O., Ludwig, S., Gerke, V., Rescher, U.

        "title": "The Contribution of Formyl Peptide Receptor Dysfunction to the Course of Neuroinflammation: A Potential Role in the Brain Pathology",
        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory processes within the central nervous system (CNS) are in part responsible for the development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These processes are associated with, among other things, the increased and disturbed activation of microglia and the elevated production of proinflammatory factors. Recent studies indicated that the disruption of the process of resolution of inflammation (RoI) may be the cause of CNS disorders. It is shown that the RoI is regulated by endogenous molecules called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which interact with specific membrane receptors. Some SPMs activate formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), which belong to the family of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors take part not only in the proinflammatory response but also in the resolution of the inflammation process. Therefore, the activation of FPRs might have complex consequences. This review discusses the potential role of FPRs, and in particular the role of FPR2 subtype, in the brain under physiological and pathological conditions and their involvement in processes underlying neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders as well as ischemia, the pathogenesis of which involves the dysfunction of inflammatory processes.",

        "title": "Behavioral, Anti-Inflammatory, and Neuroprotective Effects of a Novel FPR2 Agonist in Two Mouse Models of Autism",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social deficits, repetitive stereotyped behaviors, and altered inflammatory responses. Accordingly, children with ASD show decreased plasma levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a mediator involved in the resolution of inflammation, which is the endogenous ligand of the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). To investigate the role of FPR2 in ASDs, we have used a new ureidopropanamide derivative able to activate the receptor, named MR-39. The effects of MR-39 (10 mg/kg, for 8 days) on hippocampal pro-inflammatory profile, neuronal plasticity, and social behavior were evaluated in two validated animal models of ASD: BTBR mouse strain and mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA). Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from BTBR mice were also used to evaluate the effect of MR-39 on neurite elongation. Our results show that MR-39 treatment reduced several inflammatory markers, restored the low expression of LXA4, and modulated FPR2 expression in hippocampal tissues of both ASD animal models. These findings were accompanied by a significant positive effect of MR-39 on social behavioral tests of ASD mice. Finally, MR-39 stimulates neurite elongation in isolated hippocampal neurons of BTBR mice. In conclusion, these data indicate FPR2 as a potential target for an innovative therapeutical approach for the cure of ASD.",

        "abstract": "A substantial body of evidence demonstrates an association between a malfunction in the resolution of acute inflammation and the development of chronic inflammation. Recently, in this context, the importance of formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) has been underlined. FPR2 activity is modulated by a wide range of endogenous ligands, including specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (e.g., LXA4 and AT-LXA4) and synthetic ligands. Since SPMs have unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, we aimed to evaluate the protective and pro-resolving effects of a new potent FPR2 agonist, compound CMC23, in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The protective activity of CMC23 limited the lactate dehydrogenase release in LPS-stimulated cultures. This activity was mediated by the interaction with FPR2 as pretreatment with the FPR2 selective antagonist WRW4 abolished CMC23-induced protection. Furthermore, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were observed after CMC23 administration in LPS-treated OHCs. CMC23 also diminished the LPS-induced increase in IL-17A and both IL-23 subunits p19 and p40 in OHCs. Finally, we demonstrated that CMC23 exerts its beneficial impact via the STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway since it attenuated the level of phospho-STAT3 and maintained the LPS-induced SOCS3 levels in OHCs. Collectively, our research implies that the new FPR2 agonist CMC23 has beneficial protective and anti-inflammatory properties in nanomolar doses and FPR2 represents a promising target for the enhancement of inflammation resolution.",
