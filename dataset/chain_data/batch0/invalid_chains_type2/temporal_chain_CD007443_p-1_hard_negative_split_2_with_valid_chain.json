        "abstract": "Recently, high interest has been attracted           to the research of inflammatory bowel diseases           (IBD). Recombinant probiotic bacteria may represent           an interesting way to influence the course of           IBD. Their benefits include cheap and simple production           and easy manipulation of the genetic material.           Several gene therapy and probiotic approaches           already showed promising results in the past. The           aim of this study was to test the probiotic potential of           IL-10-expressing Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in a mouse           model of IBD and to compare it with control bacterial           strains. The dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)           model of colitis was examined for this purpose. Animals           received control probiotic bacteria or modified           probiotics (expressing IL-10) via gastric gavage.           Body weight, stool consistency, food and water consumption           were monitored. At the end of the experiment,           the parameters of inflammation, oxidative           stress and carbonyl stress were analysed in the samples           and statistical analysis was performed. We prepared           an anti-inflammatory probiotic Escherichia           coli strain that we designated Nissle 1917/pMEC-IL10           and proved its anti-inflammatory properties, which           are similar to those of the control probiotic strains           Nissle 1917 and Lactococcus lactis/pMEC-IL10 in vivo.           The probiotic therapy was successful according to           several parameters, including colon length, and oxidative           and carbonyl stress. Bacterially produced           IL-10 was detected in the plasma. The potential of           bacterial anti-inflammatory therapy of IBD using           modified probiotics           was outlined. The results opened           a way for upcoming studies using modified probiotics           for therapy of systemic diseases.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo determine the efficacy profiles of different concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) for treating colitis using an experimental murine model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nColitis was established in 64 BALB/c mice by adding 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to the drinking water and allowing ad libitum access for 7 d. The mice were then randomly divided into the following control and experimental model groups (n = 8 each; day 0): untreated model control; negative-treatment model control (administered gavage of 1 mL/10 g normal saline); experimental-treatment models C4-C8 (administered gavage of 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7), or 10(8) CFU/10 g L. acidophilus, respectively); positive-treatment model control (administration of the anti-inflammatory agent prednisone acetate at 45 \u03bcg/10 g). Eight mice given regular water (no DSS) and no subsequent treatments served as the normal control group. Body weight, fecal traits, and presence of fecal occult blood were assessed daily. All animals were sacrificed on post-treatment day 7 to measure colonic length, perform histological scoring, and quantify the major bacteria in the proximal and distal colon. Intergroup differences were determined by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls comparison.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll treatments (L. acidophilus and prednisone acetate) protected against colitis-induced weight loss (P < 0.05 vs model and normal control groups). The extent of colitis-induced colonic shortening was significantly reduced by all treatments (prednisone acetate > C4 > C5 > C7 > C8 > C6; P < 0.05 vs untreated model group), and the C6 group showed colonic length similar to that of the normal control group (P > 0.05). The C6 group also had the lowest disease activity index scores among the model groups. The bacterial profiles in the proximal colon were similar between all of the experimental-treatment model groups (all P > 0.05). In contrast, the bacterial profile in the distal colon of the C6 group showed the distinctive features (P < 0.05 vs all other experimental-treatment model groups) of Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. being the most abundant bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus being the least abundant bacteria.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe most therapeutically efficacious concentration of L. acidophilus (10(6) CFU/10 g) may exert its effects by modulating the bacterial profile in the distal colon.",

        "abstract": "Disruption of the balance among the microbiota, epithelial cells, and resident immune cells in the intestine is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Probiotics exert protective effects against IBD, and probiotic commensal Lactobacillus species are common inhabitants of the natural microbiota, especially in the gut. To investigate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the development of IBD, L. acidophilus was administered orally in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. DSS-induced damage and the therapeutic effect of L. acidophilus were investigated. Treatment with L. acidophilus attenuated the severity of DSS-induced colitis. Specifically, it suppressed proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17 in the colon tissues, which are produced by T helper (Th) 17 cells. Moreover, in vitro L. acidophilus treatment directly induced T regulatory (Treg) cells and the production of IL-10, whereas the production of IL-17 was suppressed in splenocytes. In addition, we found that L. acidophilus treatment decreased the levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a marker of activated myofibroblasts, and type I collagen compared with control mice. These results suggest that L. acidophilus may be a novel treatment for IBD by modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, as well as fibrosis development.",

        "title": "Compositional changes to the ileal microbiome precede the onset of spontaneous ileitis in SHIP deficient mice",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel disease, encompassing both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, is characterized by chronic, relapsing-remitting gastrointestinal inflammation of unknown etiology. SHIP deficient mice develop fully penetrant, spontaneous ileitis at 6 weeks of age, and thus offer a tractable model of Crohn\u2019s disease-like inflammation. Since disruptions to the microbiome are implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn\u2019s disease, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene survey of the ileum, cecum, colon, and stool contents of SHIP+/+ and SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice. We predicted that diversity and compositional changes would occur after, and possibly prior to, the onset of overt disease. No differences were found in alpha diversity, but significant changes in beta diversity and specific commensal populations were observed in the ileal compartment of SHIP deficient mice after the onset of overt disease. Specifically, reductions in the Bacteroidales taxa, Muribaculum intestinale, and an expansion in Lactobacillus were most notable. In contrast, expansions to bacterial taxa previously associated with inflammation, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella were observed in the ilea of SHIP deficient mice prior to the onset of overt disease. Finally, antibiotic treatment reduced the development of intestinal inflammation in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, our findings indicate that SHIP is involved in maintaining ileal microbial homeostasis. These results have broader implications for humans, since reduced SHIP protein levels have been reported in people with Crohn\u2019s disease.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, both which increase the risk and accelerate the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The gut microbiome is an essential modulator of the immune system, impacting in the brain. AD has been related with reduced diversity and alterations in the community composition of the gut microbiota. This study aimed to determine whether the gut microbiota from AD mice exacerbates neurological deficits after TBI in control mice. We prepared fecal microbiota transplants from 18-24 months old 3xTg-AD (FMT-AD) and from healthy controls (FMT-young) mice. FMTs were administered orally to young control C57BL/6 (wild-type, WT) mice after they underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, as a model of TBI. Then, we characterized the microbiota composition of the fecal samples by full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. We collected the blood, brain, and gut tissues for protein and immunohistochemical analysis. Our results showed that FMT-AD administration stimulates a higher relative abundance of the genus Muribaculum and a decrease in Lactobacillus johnsonii compared to FMT-young in WT mice. Furthermore, WT mice exhibited larger lesion, increased activated microglia/macrophages, and reduced motor recovery after FMT-AD compared to FMT-young one day after TBI. In summary, we observed gut microbiota from AD mice to have a detrimental effect and aggravate the neuroinflammatory response and neurological outcomes after TBI in young WT mice.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are highly prevalent but poorly understood, and with few treatment options despite decades of intense research, attention has recently shifted toward other mediators of neurological disease that may present future targets for therapeutic research. One such mediator is the gut microbiome, which communicates with the brain through the gut\u2013brain axis and has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with numerous neurological and other diseases, and restoration of the dysbiotic gut has been shown to improve disease conditions. One method of restoring a dysbiotic gut is via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), recolonizing the \u201cdiseased\u201d gut with normal microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a treatment method traditionally used for Clostridium difficile infections, but it has recently been used in neurodegenerative disease research as a potential treatment method. This review aims to present a summary of neurodegenerative research that has used FMT, whether as a treatment or to investigate how the microbiome influences pathogenesis.",

Patients with PD aged 35 to 75 years in Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3 with a mild to moderate symptom burden and dysbiosis of fecal microbiota were included. Of 229 patients screened, 48 were randomized and 47 received the intervention. One patient discontinued due to worsening of PD symptoms. Two further patients were excluded before analysis and 45 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\n\nIntervention\nParticipants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive FMT or placebo via colonoscopy.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary end point was the change of Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts I-III (part III off medication) at 6 months. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs).\n\n\nResults\nThe median (IQR) age was 65 (52.5-70.0) years in the placebo group and 66 (59.25-69.75) years in the FMT group; 9 (60.0%) and 16 (53.3%) patients were male in the placebo group and the FMT group, respectively. The primary outcome did not differ between the groups (0.97 points, 95% CI, -5.10 to 7.03, P\u2009=\u2009.75). Gastrointestinal AEs were more frequent in the FMT group (16 [53%] vs 1 [7%]; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses showed stronger increase of dopaminergic medication and improvement of certain motor and nonmotor outcomes in the placebo group. Microbiota changes were more pronounced after FMT but differed by donor. Nevertheless, dysbiosis status was reversed more frequently in the placebo group.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nFMT was safe but did not offer clinically meaningful improvements. Further studies-for example, through modified FMT approaches or bowel cleansing-are warranted regarding the specific impact of donor microbiota composition and dysbiosis conversion on motor and nonmotor outcomes as well as medication needs in PD.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04854291.",
