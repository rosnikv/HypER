        "abstract": "The primary goal of combination therapy is to enhance efficacy without compromising safety. In this multicenter study, the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril added to continuing hydrochlorothiazide therapy were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate (stage I and II), essential hypertension. Two hundred fifty\u2010two patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg were treated for 4 weeks with open\u2010label hydrochlorothiazide at 25 mg/day. The 208 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was \u226590 mmHg at the end of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy entered a 12\u2010week, double\u2010blind treatment, where placebo or perindopril were added to the 25\u2010mg/day hydrochlorothiazide therapy as follows: placebo (n = 50) and doses of perindopril at 2 mg/day (n = 52), 4 mg/day (n = 53), and 8 mg/day (n = 53). The perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations decreased both supine systolic blood pressure and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, for perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/day, respectively; there was no difference among the three drug groups. Placebo decreased blood pressure by 1.6/2.0 mmHg, an effect that was significantly lower compared with perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations. Adverse events were mild and similar among all treatment groups, except cough, which was 4.0%, 3.9%, 7.6%, and 13.2% for placebo and perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. The results of this multicenter study indicate that the combination of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide is safe and effective in lowering blood pressure. The findings also demonstrate that lower doses of perindopril are as effective as higher doses when combined with hydrochlorothiazide.",

        "title": "Antihypertensive efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide",
        "abstract": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are highly effective antihypertensive agents with excellent safety profiles. ARBs have been shown to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy. For this later class of patients, the American Diabetes Association recommends ARBs as the primary treatment option. The ARBs function by blocking the binding of angiotensin-II (A-II) to its receptor, thereby inhibiting the action of A-II. Unlike the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the production of A-II through the ACE pathway, the ARBs effectively inhibit A-II regardless of whether it is produced through ACE or some alternate enzyme pathway. This difference in action offers a distinct advantage of ARBs over ACE inhibitors. Olmesartan medoxomil, the latest addition to the ARB class, is a long-acting, safe and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug. The combination of olmesartan medoxomil with a low-dose diuretic, potentiates the blood pressure lowering effect of either agent alone and is highly effective in achieving the recommended blood pressure goals in the majority of patients treated.",

Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and other angiotensin receptor blocker combinations with a diuretic have been shown to be effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in a diverse patient population previously uncontrolled on monotherapy. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was performed on the intent\u2010to\u2010treat population of the INCLUSIVE study to identify variables predictive of variations in blood pressure changes in response to irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy. Higher baseline systolic blood pressure, female sex, type 2 diabetes, and statin therapy were found to be predictive of additional blood pressure lowering with this combination. The impact of higher baseline systolic blood pressure and diabetic state on changes in systolic blood pressure were diminished in female patients compared with male patients. In conclusion, a significant correlation may exist between certain clinical/demographic characteristics and the extent of the therapeutic response with irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide treatment.",

We compared efficacy and safety of early versus late titration after 10 weeks\u2019 treatment with irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide. Hypertensive patients uncontrolled on monotherapy were randomized into two groups. In the early titration group (E), patients received irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150/12.5 mg for 2 weeks; uncontrolled patients were up-titrated to 300/25 mg at weeks 2 and 6. In the late titration group (L), patients received 150/12.5 mg for 6 weeks; uncontrolled patients were up-titrated to 300/25 mg at week 6 (W6). The change of mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to week 10 (W10) were studied using a covariance analysis model. The percentage of controlled patients at W10 was compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. Of 833 patients enrolled from 14 countries, the intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 795 (mean age 58 \u00b1 12 years, female 60%, obesity 38%, diabetes 22%).

        "abstract": "Background: Although a low salt intake and angiotensin II blockade may act to reduce serum sodium (srNa) levels during low-dose diuretic treatment, the effects of these factors on srNa level have not yet been fully clarified. The present study was conducted to examine the association of dietary salt intake with the changes in srNa levels when angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment is changed to the combination of ARB plus a low-dose diuretic, Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).\n\nMethods: In 88 patients (age 70\u00b112 years old), ARB treatment was switched to the combination drug (the same dosage ARB plus 12.5 mg/day HCTZ). srNa level was measured before and 6 months after administration of this combination drug. The daily salt intake was estimated by the Kawasaki formula using second morning urine.\n\nResults: The study subjects were divided into quintile ranges according to the daily salt intake. The reduction in srNa levels by switching to the ARB plus HCTZ treatment was significant in subjects in the lowest quintile Q5 (7.22 g/day or less salt intake), but not in those in Q1-4 (17.78-7.25 g/day salt intake). Increases in serum creatinine and uric acid levels, however, were significantly larger in the former group than in the latter group.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\n\nConclusions: In the strict low salt intake condition (< 7.2 g/day), the addition of a low-dose diuretic (12.5 mg HCTZ) to ARB treatment causes significant reductions in srNa levels, which might affect blood osmolarity.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

The aim of this study was to investigate possible predictors of thiazide-induced hyponatremia.A total of 48 patients admitted to the ward or to the emergency department due to severe thiazide-induced hyponatremia (Na\u200a<\u200a125\u200ammol/L) were enrolled in our study as the case group. Another 211 hypertensive patients with normal sodium levels after treatment with thiazide diuretics were selected as the control group. Twelve tag single nucleotide polymorphism markers were selected from the Potassium Channel, Inwardly Rectifying Subfamily J, Member 1 (KCNJ1) gene: rs1231254, rs2238009, rs1148058, rs675482, rs673614, rs12795437, rs2855800, rs2509585, rs3016774, rs881333, rs4529890, and rs7116606. Clinical and genetic parameters between patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia and the control group were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze data.The patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia were older (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), predominantly female (P\u200a=\u200a0.008), had a lower mean body mass index (BMI) (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and more commonly used angiotensin II receptor antagonist (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and spironolactone (P\u200a=\u200a0.007) compared with the control groups.
