        "title": "Gut-directed hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome: piloting a primary care-based randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn western populations irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects between 10% and 30% of the population and has a significant effect on quality of life. It generates a substantial workload in both primary and secondary care and has significant cost implications. Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life but has not been assessed outside of secondary and tertiary referral centres.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess the effectiveness of gut-directed hypnotherapy as a complementary therapy in the management of IBS.\n\n\nDESIGN OF STUDY\nRandomised controlled trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nPrimary care patients aged 18-65 years inclusive, with a diagnosis of IBS of greater than 6 weeks' duration and having failed conventional management, located in South Staffordshire and North Birmingham, UK.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIntervention patients received five sessions of hypnotherapy in addition to their usual management. Control patients received usual management alone. Data regarding symptoms and quality of life were collected at baseline and again 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomisation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups demonstrated a significant improvement in all symptom dimensions and quality of life over 12 months. At 3 months the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in pain, diarrhoea and overall symptom scores (P<0.05). No significant differences between groups in quality of life were identified. No differences were maintained over time. Intervention patients, however, were significantly less likely to require medication, and the majority described an improvement in their condition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGut-directed hypnotherapy benefits patients via symptom reduction and reduced medication usage, although the lack of significant difference between groups beyond 3 months prohibits its general introduction without additional evidence. A large trial incorporating robust economic analysis is, therefore, urgently recommended.",

        "title": "Complementary and alternative medicine for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo review the evidence supporting selected complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n\nQUALITY OF EVIDENCE\nMEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Level I evidence was available for most interventions.\n\n\nMAIN MESSAGE\nSoluble fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain. Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSeveral complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.",

        "title": "Yoga in female sexual functions.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nYoga is a popular form of complementary and alternative therapy. It is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Female sexual dysfunctions are common and do not always get adequate clinical attention. Pharmacotherapies for treating female sexual dysfunctions are available but suffer from drawbacks such as poor compliance, low efficacy, and side effects. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving sexual functions and treating sexual disorders.\n\n\nAIM\nTo establish the effect yoga can have on female sexual functions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 40 females (age range 22-55 years, average age 34.7 +/- 8.49 years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and were given a standardized questionnaire named Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) before and after the 12 weeks session of yoga.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nFSFI scores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIt was found that after the completion of yoga sessions; the sexual functions scores were significantly improved (P < 0.0001). The improvement occurred in all six domains of FSFI (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain). The improvement was more in older women (age > 45 years) compared with younger women (age < 45 years).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nYoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of sexual functions in women as studied by FSFI.",

        "title": "Exercise-induced orgasm and pleasure among women",
        "abstract": "Orgasm is typically considered to be a sexual experience. However, orgasms occurring during physical exercise have been occasionally documented. The primary objective of the current study was to understand more about women's experience with exercise-induced orgasm (EIO) including the types of exercise that women have noted have led to EIO and associations with self-reported sexual experiences. A secondary purpose was to understand and assess women's experiences of exercise-induced sexual pleasure (EISP) among a convenience sample of women who had never experienced EIO but who had experienced sexual pleasure during exercise. A total of 530 women completed a cross-sectional, anonymous, Internet-based survey. The average age of first EIO was 18.9 years old. Among the most common exercises reported to induce orgasm were abdominal exercises, climbing and lifting weights. Women reporting EISP, but not orgasm, frequently identified biking/spinning, abdominal exercise and lifting weights as associated with their experiences. Self-consciousness during exercise was commonly reported by women in the EIO group. However, sexual thoughts or fantasy related to EIO were only rarely reported. Findings challenge the idea that women's orgasm is an intrinsically sexual experience. Implications related to the scientific understanding of orgasm processes and clinical recommendations are discussed.",

In June 2015, 1,055 women ages 18 to 94 from the nationally representative GfK KnowledgePanel\u00ae completed a confidential, Internet-based survey. While 18.4% of women reported that intercourse alone was sufficient for orgasm, 36.6% reported clitoral stimulation was necessary for orgasm during intercourse, and an additional 36% indicated that, while clitoral stimulation was not needed, their orgasms feel better if their clitoris is stimulated during intercourse. Women reported diverse preferences for genital touch location, pressure, shape, and pattern. Clinical, therapeutic, and educational implications are discussed.",

        "title": "Clitoral stimulation during penile-vaginal intercourse: A phenomenological study exploring sexual experiences in support of female orgasm",
        "abstract": "Abstract:Penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) is the most common partnered (hetero)sexual behaviour in North America. Many women participate in PVI but do not acquire the clitoral stimulation they may need to orgasm as desired resulting in a gender-based orgasm gap during partnered sex. This phenomenological study situates itself at the intersection of sexological studies, which validate the importance of the clitoris (e.g. Kinsey and colleagues; Hite), and feminist scholarship that explores the problem of a sexual script constructed in a patriarchy that largely devalues the clitoris (e.g. Koedt; Boston Women's Health Collective) in interrogating and describing solutions to inequitable orgasm experiences during PVI. In this study, 15 cisgender women, who do not orgasm from PVI alone, shared in semi-structured interviews how they acquire orgasmic clitoral stimulation during PVI. Four partners, who were cisgender men, were also interviewed and their perspectives were included when they added greater detail to the primary participants' experiences. Fourteen out of the 15 women learned to induce orgasm during masturbation before experiencing their first orgasm during PVI. Masturbatory experiences helped participants learn effective stimulation techniques. Women then communicated these preferences to partners or self-stimulated during PVI. Orgasmic stimulation was achieved by either stimulating the clitoris against the male body or by creating space around the clitoris (2-3\") where preferred stimulation could occur. No two women had the same preferred clitoral stimulation technique. Understanding that one's preferred stimulation technique is likely different and nuanced from others may be key to effective partner communication.",

        "abstract": "The study purpose was to assess, in a U.S. probability sample of women, the specific ways women have discovered to make vaginal penetration more pleasurable. Through qualitative pilot research with women that informed the development of the survey instrument used in this study, we identified four previously unnamed, but distinct, techniques women use to make vaginal penetration more pleasurable: Angling, Rocking, Shallowing and Pairing. This study defines each technique and describes its prevalence among U.S. adult women. Weighted frequencies were drawn from the Second OMGYES Pleasure Report\u2014a cross-sectional, online, national probability survey of 3017 American women\u2019s (age 18\u201393) sexual experiences and discoveries. Participants were recruited via the Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae. Data suggest that 87.5% of women make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using \u2018Angling\u2019: rotating, raising, or lowering the pelvis/hips during penetration to adjust where inside the vagina the toy or penis rubs and what it feels like. Approximately 76% of women make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using \u2018Rocking\u2019: the base of a penis or sex toy rubbing against the clitoris constantly during penetration, by staying all the way inside the vagina rather than thrusting in and out. About 84% of women make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using \u2018Shallowing\u2019: penetrative touch just inside of the entrance of the vagina\u2014not on the outside, but also not deep inside\u2014with a fingertip, sex toy, penis tip, tongue, or lips. Finally, 69.7% of women orgasm more often or make vaginal penetration more pleasurable using \u2018Pairing\u2019: when a woman herself (Solo Pairing) or her partner (Partner Pairing) reaches down to stimulate her clitoris with a finger or sex toy at the same time as her vagina is being penetrated. These data provide techniques that are at women\u2019s disposal to make penetration more pleasurable\u2014which can enable women to better identify their own preferences, communicate about them and advocate for their sexual pleasure.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDespite the negative stigma on receptive anal intercourse (RAI), this behavior has a positive influence on individuals' sexual and relationship health. No large studies have previously looked at specific sensations experienced during RAI and how these sensations may change with experience.\n\n\nAIM\nIn this study we aimed to quantify commonly reported pelvic sensations during RAI and determine whether their presentation changes with increasing experience of RAI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn internet survey was conducted on sensations felt during RAI among people with prostates from July 2022-January 2023. The survey content was developed based on a mixed-methods qualitative study and inquired about demographic and sexual histories as well as sensations (pleasure, pain, urinary, and bowel) experienced during RAI. We used descriptive statistics to describe demographic and sexual histories. All data were stratified by lifetime exposure to RAI.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary outcomes assessed included the quantification of both the primary sensations experienced during RAI and the associated bother.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 975 participants completed the survey. The median age was 32 (range 18-78) years. The average age of first participation in RAI was 21 \u00b1 6.6 years. Most respondents were having sex at least once a week (65%). Nine percent of respondents reported fewer than 10 experiences with RAI, 26% reported 11-50 RAI experiences, 32% reported 51-200 experiences, 16% reported 201-500 experiences, and 18% reported >500 experiences. As the number of experiences with RAI increased (from <10 to >500 exposures), the reported frequency of pleasurable sensation increased from 41% to 92% (P\u2009<\u2009.0001), whereas severe insertional pain and symptoms of bowel urgency decreased from 39% to 13% and from 21% to 6%, respectively (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Urinary urgency sensation did not differ by lifetime RAI experience.\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nLifetime RAI exposure can be readily assessed and correlates not only with pelvic sensation but also many other aspects of sexual health. These results imply that the etiology of dissatisfaction with pleasure or anodyspareunia during RAI may differ by lifetime RAI exposure.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS\nThis is the first study to our knowledge to assess pelvic sensations experienced during RAI among a large sample of individuals. This is a cross-sectional study, and we cannot conclude how pelvic sensations change over time among individuals. Internet-based participants may not be representative of clinical populations.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLifetime exposure to RAI is positively associated with pleasure and is negatively associated with pain and bowel urgency. Pelvic sensations experienced during RAI appear to be dependent on lifetime RAI exposure history regardless of age.",

Methods: We conducted an internet-based survey on sensations during RAI between July 2022 and March 2023. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the independent impact of lifetime RAI exposure on the diagnosis of common urologic and colorectal conditions. Participants completed a main survey and were invited to complete randomly assigned patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which measured pelvic symptoms, mental health symptoms, and sexual satisfaction. Results: In total, 1100 participants completed the main survey and 416 completed the PROMs. Participants of the main survey ranged from 18 to 78 years old and the median age of the sample was 32 years. There was no significant association between lifetime RAI exposure and any medical diagnosis, except for anal fissures, which increased linearly with additional RAI exposure. Both sexual satisfaction and mental health symptoms improved with RAI exposure. Conclusions: RAI was not associated with most of the colorectal and urologic diagnoses tested and was associated with fewer mental symptoms and increased sexual satisfaction. Development of anal fissures may be directly related to trauma of the anal canal from penetration.",
