        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nPeripheral arterial occlusive diseases (PAODs) not only compromise blood flow but lead to a series of subsequent metabolic and structural changes in the relevant muscles. Changes in myofibrillar proteins (eg, of myosin heavy chain [MHC] isoforms), one of the determinants of muscle structure as well as of muscular function, have not been reported in patients with PAOD and were therefore the aim of this study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirteen consecutive patients with PAOD were examined (clinical stage according to Fontaine II, three patients; III, three patients, and IV, seven patients) and compared with five age-matched control patients who had been in traffic accidents. A calf muscle sample (gastrocnemius muscle) in the ischemic region was taken for MHC isoform analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain, and the relative content of MHC isoforms was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control patients, there was no significant change of MHC isoforms in patients with PAOD II. In patients with PAOD III, MHC IIb decreased significantly (P <.05) although MHC IIa remained unchanged; in patients with PAOD IV, both MHC IIa and IIb decreased significantly (P <.05). Accordingly, there was a progressive increase of the relative amount of MHC I with more critical ischemia in PAOD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with PAOD, the content of MHC II decreased with a higher grade of ischemia. That seems to be consistent with an increased resistance to ischemia for myosin isoforms in the order of I more than in IIa more than IIb. Whether the decrease of MHC II in patients with PAOD is related to atrophy of muscle fibers or to muscle-fiber transition must be investigated further.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a progressive resistance training program on myosin heavy chain isoform expression, fiber type, and capillarization in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were randomized to either a training group (n = 11, mean +/- SD, 70 +/- 6 years, 4 men, 7 women) or a control group (n = 9, 66 +/- 6 years, 5 men, 4 women). The training sessions were completed 3 times/week, using 2 sets of various exercises, each performed for 8-15 repetitions. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after 24 weeks from the medial gastrocnemius. Following the 24-week training program, the training group had significantly decreased the percentage of myosin heavy chain type IIB. The proportion of type IIB/AB fibers as measured by using myosin adenosine triphosphatase histochemistry decreased significantly in the training group. There were significant increases in type I and type II fiber areas, and capillary density also increased significantly in the training group. There were significant increases in 10 repetition maximum leg press and calf press strengths in the trained subjects. There were no significant changes in any of the measurements in the control group. It is concluded that progressive resistance training results in significant increases in muscle strength and alters skeletal muscle composition of subjects with peripheral arterial disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLow socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with increased risk of disability in later life. The purpose of this study was to determine if SES has an impact on mobility functioning and to explore which physiological impairments are also associated with SES and may explain its relationship with mobility.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study sample consisted of 1025 individuals aged 65 years or older residing in the Chianti area (Italy). Number of years of education was used as an indicator of SES. Mobility functioning was assessed using gait speed (400 m) and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Mobility-related physiological impairments were assessed with tests of executive functioning, nerve conduction velocity, muscle power, hip-ankle range of motion, Ankle-Brachial Index, and visual acuity. Linear regression models were used to study the association between number of years of education and mobility and to estimate the contribution of each of the selected physiological impairments to this association.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdjusting for age and sex, slower gait speed (1.16 vs 1.26 m/s, p <.0001) and lower SPPB scores (9.55 vs 10.11, p =.006) were seen in persons with < or =5 years of total education compared with those persons with >5 years of total education. Leg power and executive function decreased the strength of the association between educational level and gait speed by more than 15%. Controlling for all selected impairments (full model) decreased the education-gait speed association by 49%. Low education continued to be significantly associated with gait speed (p <.01). Adjusting for all physiological impairments substantially reduced the low education-SPPB score association by 100%, and this association was no longer significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow SES is related to multiple physiological impairments, which explain a large amount of the association between education and gait limitations. Further work must be done to understand the mechanisms whereby low SES translates into the impairments that play an important role in mobility.",

Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2008;87:354\u2013362. Objective:To identify psychological, physical, and sensory function parameters that are specifically associated with fear of falling (FF) and fear-induced activity restriction in a population-based sample of older adults. Design:FF, fear-induced activity restriction, cognition, depression, personal mastery, chair-stand performance, standing balance, lower-limb and grip strength, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, and vibrotactile sensitivity were evaluated in the population-based, older cohort (n = 926, age \u2265 65) enrolled in the InCHIANTI study. Results:Nearly 50% participants reported FF. Of these, 65% reported some activity restriction. Personal mastery (P < 0.001) and chair-standing performance (P = 0.001) were independently associated with FF. In those who did not have depression, personal mastery, standing balance, lower-limb strength, and visual contrast sensitivity were associated with activity restriction (P < 0.001\u20130.011). In those who were depressed, total FF was the major factor strongly associated with activity restriction (P < 0.001), with marginal but significant associations for cognition (P = 0.027) and standing balance (P = 0.015). Conclusion:Psychological and physical factors are independently associated with FF. Presence of depression possibly modulates which factors, in addition to fear of falling, affect fear-induced activity restriction. A longitudinal study is warranted to substantiate causal relationships.",

        "title": "Interpreting Fear of Falling in the Elderly: What Do We Need to Consider?",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose: Fear of falling (FF) is a serious problem in elderly. Available scales quantify FF by generating an aggregate total FF score disregarding the environment in which fear is expressed. This study examined the differences in psychosocial and physical characteristics and global functional capabilities between the elderly who experienced FF exclusively for activities usually performed in community environments and those who reported FF only for home\u2010based activities. Methods: Older participants (age \u2265 65, n=1155) enrolled in the InCHIANTI study completed the evaluation of FF, personal mastery, depression, cognition, social support, lower limb strength, grip strength, balance, timed repeated sit\u2010to\u2010stand performance, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. Functional capacity measures included walking speed, ADL and IADL disability, self\u2010reported difficulty climbing steps without support and difficulty walking at least 400m. Only those who reported FF exclusively for activities usually performed in the community environment (n=232) or in home environment (n=110) were included in the analysis. Results: Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that those who reported FF exclusively for home\u2010based activities were significantly worse in psychosocial and physical characteristics measured (F(1,339)= 4.27; p < 0.01) and were also less able in all global functional capacity measures (p= 0.04 to < 0.01). Conclusions: There are significant characteristic and functional differences between the older persons who have FF performing community environment activities and those who express FF in home environment activities. The results strongly indicate the need to classify FF according to the environment or alternatively, to derive an aggregate score by appropriately weighting according to the environment, for valid interpretation of FF.",

        "title": "MULTIFACTORIAL SCREENING FOR FALL RISK IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS IN THE PRIMARY CARE OFFICE: DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE FALL RISK ASSESSMENT & SCREENING TOOL (FRAST)",
        "abstract": "Background: Unintentional falls are an increasing public health problem as incidence of falls rises and the population ages. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 1 in 3 adults aged 65 years and older will experience a fall this year; 20% to 30% of those who fall will sustain a moderate to severe injury. Physical therapists (PTs) and other primary care practitioners (PCPs) caring for older adults are usually engaged with these patients after the first injury fall and may have little opportunity to abate fall risk before the injuries occur. Purpose: This manuscript describes the content selection, development and validation of a simple-to-administer, multifactorial Fall Risk Assessment & Screening Tool (FRAST). The FRAST is designed specifically for use in primary care settings by minimally-trained staff to identify those older adults with heightened fall risk requiring PCP intervention. The FRAST incorporates previously validated measures within a new multifactorial tool and includes targeted recommendations for intervention. Methods: Development of the multifactorial FRAST used a 5-part process: identification of significant fall risk factors, review of best evidence, selection of items, creation of the scoring grid, and development of a recommended action plan. The FRAST was then validated via data collection across Montana in 2010 and included 99 subjects fitting specified inclusion/exclusion criteria: aged 65+, community-dwelling, independent ambulators (with or without assistive devices). Results: FRAST has been developed and validated to assess fall risk in the target population. Many fall risk factors have been considered and 15 items selected for inclusion. FRAST includes four previously validated measures to assess balance, depression, falls efficacy, and home safety. Conclusion: Fall risk for community-dwelling older adults is an urgent, multifactorial, public health problem. Providing PCPs with a very simple screening tool is imperative. FRAST was created and validated to allow for safe, quick, and low-cost fall risk screening by minimally-trained office staff with interpretation and follow-up provided by the PCP.",

        "abstract": "Falls are one of the common problems among older adults; it is estimated that 684,000 fatal cases of falls occur every year. Furthermore, falls constitute one of the leading causes of mortality due to accidental injury. This study aims to identify the risk factors for falls in the older adults who live in the community, according to the dimensions of the living area: in urban and rural. The proportional sampling method was used to identify the rural and urban areas in West Java Prefecture; meanwhile, the incidence of fall in the last 12\u2009months was selected as the outcome variable. Furthermore, sociodemographic background, chronic medical condition, fear of falling, visual and hearing impairments, Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Barthel index, physical performance (Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB)), and living environment were analyzed to identify the risk factors that contribute to the incidence of falls. A total of 611 older adults participated in this study: 62% of them are living in rural area and 38% of them are living urban areas. More than 70% of study participants were aged 60\u201369 years, while 73% were females. There is no significant difference in fall prevalence in rural (16.5%) and urban (10.7%) areas (p value\u2009=\u20090.228). Furthermore, the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the male gender (OR\u2009=\u20090.29, 95%CI [0.09\u20130.88]), chronic illness (OR\u2009=\u20093.25, 95%CI [1.24\u20138.53]), and visual impairment (OR\u2009=\u20093.6, 95%CI [1.52\u20138.54]) were associated with fall among older adults in urban areas. Meanwhile, visual impairment (OR\u2009=\u20091.81, 95%CI [1.03\u20133.18]) and living environment (OR\u2009=\u20093.36, 95% CI [1.14\u20139.93]) were significantly associated with falls in rural areas. Based on the associated risk factors identified in this study, a different approach is needed to reduce the falling risk among older adults in urban and rural areas in Indonesia.",

        "abstract": "Background: Falls represent a significant and growing public health issue among older adults worldwide. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the trends in the incidence, prevalence, and disability burden of falls among older adults in Saudi Arabia over 29 years, with a focus on gender disparities. Methods: Utilizing the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study data, this observational analysis tracked the epidemiology of falls from 1990 to 2019. The study employed ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to identify falls, analyzing incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and years lived with disability (YLDs), stratified by gender and reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: The incidence and prevalence of falls increased for both genders from 1990 to 2019, with males showing a higher relative increase in prevalence rates (57% for males vs. 26% for females). The disability burden, indicated by DALYs, increased by 4% for males and decreased by 10% for females, whereas YLDs saw an increase of 38% for males and 8% for females. The analysis highlights a notable rise in both the frequency of falls and their associated disability, with gender-specific variations emphasizing greater impacts on males. Conclusions: The findings illustrate a significant increase in fall-related incidents and associated disabilities among older adults in Saudi Arabia, with distinct gender differences. These trends call for targeted public health interventions and further research into the underlying causes of falls, risk factors, and effective prevention strategies. Such measures are essential to mitigate the impact of falls, improve health outcomes, and enhance the quality of life for the aging population.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Our objectives were to examine the association between balance confidence, functional mobility measures, and the presence of disability in older adults in Saudi Arabia and to identify the optimal cutoff scores for these measures that predict disability. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 324 community-dwelling older adults (65 \u00b1 7 years, 59% women). Disability was assessed using the Arabic version of the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) scale. Balance confidence was evaluated using the Arabic version of the Activities -Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, and functional mobility was assessed using the 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30s-CST). Results: The prevalence of disability was 33.6% among the participants. Logistic regression revealed a 6% increase in disability odds for each one-unit decrease in the 30s-CST (OR: 0.94) and a 3% increase per one-point decrease in the ABC score (OR: 0.97). The optimal cutoff scores were \u22645 repetitions for the 30s-CST (sensitivity: 74.4%; specificity: 51.4%; AUC: 0.64) and \u226440 for the ABC scale (sensitivity: 80.8%; specificity: 61.4%; AUC: 0.75). Conclusions: Impaired balance and functional mobility are significantly associated with disability among older adults. The 30s-CST and the ABC scale can be used as effective screening tools, but the cross-sectional design of the current study limits its generalizability. Longitudinal research is needed to validate these findings.",
