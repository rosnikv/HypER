        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between second and third trimester glycemic control and adverse outcomes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, as uncertainty exists about optimum glycemic targets. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Pregnancy outcomes were assessed prospectively in 725 women with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes and Pre-eclampsia Intervention Trial. HbA1c (A1C) values at 26 and 34 weeks\u2019 gestation were categorized into five groups, the lowest, <6.0% (42 mmol/mol), being the reference. Average pre- and postprandial results from an eight-point capillary glucose profile the previous day were categorized into five groups, the lowest (preprandial <5.0 mmol/L and postprandial <6.0 mmol/L) being the reference. RESULTS An A1C of 6.0\u20136.4% (42\u201347 mmol/mol) at 26 weeks\u2019 gestation was associated with a significantly increased risk of large for gestational age (LGA) (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0\u20133.0]) and an A1C of 6.5\u20136.9% (48\u201352 mmol/mol) with a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.3\u20134.8]), pre-eclampsia (4.3 [1.7\u201310.8]), need for a neonatal glucose infusion (2.9 [1.5\u20135.6]), and a composite adverse outcome (3.2 [1.3\u20138.0]). These risks increased progressively with increasing A1C. Results were similar at 34 weeks\u2019 gestation. Glucose data showed less consistent trends, although the risk of a composite adverse outcome increased with preprandial glucose levels between 6.0 and 6.9 mmol/L at 34 weeks (3.3 [1.3\u20138.0]). CONCLUSIONS LGA increased significantly with an A1C \u22656.0 (42 mmol/mol) at 26 and 34 weeks' gestation and with other adverse outcomes with an A1C \u22656.5% (48 mmol/mol). The data suggest that there is clinical utility in regular measurement of A1C during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the association of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) with neonatal birth weight (NBW) and neonatal hypoglycemia (+NH) in pregnancies complicated by diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed a retrospective cohort of 102 females, 17 with gestational diabetes (GDM), 48 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and 37 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1,5-AG and glycated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) values throughout pregnancy were extracted. Linear regression was used to assess their association with NBWs z-scores adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). +NH was defined by a note in the infant record, glucose <1.7 mmol/L in the first 24 h, or <2.5 mmol/L in the first 48 h after birth. A t test or Welch's approximate t test was used to compare the mean 1,5-AG and A1C of mothers with +NH versus those without (-NH), adjusted for gestational age and analyzed by diabetes type and across trimesters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean 1,5-AG significantly differed across groups: T1DM 3.77 \u00b1 2.82 \u03bcg/mL, T2DM 5.73 \u00b1 4.38 \u03bcg/mL, GDM 8.89 \u00b1 4.39 \u03bcg/mL (P<.0001), suggesting less glucose exposure in GDM relative to T1DM or T2DM. A negative linear association was found between mean 1,5-AG and z-scores (R= -0.28, P = .005. In contrast, the association between mean A1C and z-scores was weaker (R = 0.15, P = .14). The mean 1,5-AG tended to be lower in the +NH cohort versus -NH (P = .08), and this was statistically significant (P = .01) among subjects with GDM.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe association of 1,5-AG with complications related to glycemic exposure supports the notion of its utility as an adjunct glycemic biomarker in pregnancies complicated by diabetes and across trimesters.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere has been recent recognition of the limitations of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) in describing both short- and long-term glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides robust data about short-term glycemic control and provides metrics such as percent time-in-range (%TIR) that are now routinely reported to describe the change in glycemic control after an intervention in a clinical study or a change in therapy in a patient's care. Recent studies have shown that %TIR may have similar associations with diabetes microvascular complications as does HbA1C. The relationship of %TIR to the long-standing metric of overall glycemic control has not been clearly defined to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nArticles that report paired HbA1C and %TIR metrics (n\u2009=\u20091137) or HbA1C and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (n\u2009=\u20091440) across a wide range of HbA1Cs, technologies, and subject demographics were reviewed to determine the correlation of these metrics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSelected paired HbA1C and %TIR data from 18 articles were evaluated by linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. There was an excellent correlation between the two (R\u2009=\u2009-0.84; R2\u2009=\u20090.71). This relationship did not change after excluding one study that used SMBG or six studies with \u22647 days of CGM. For every absolute 10% change in %TIR, there was a 0.8% (9\u2009mmol/mol) change in HbA1C.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a good correlation between HbA1C and %TIR that may permit the transition to %TIR as the preferred metric for determining the outcome of clinical studies, predicting of the risk of diabetes complications, and assessing of an individual patient's glycemic control.",

        "title": "Managing New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Opportunities.",
        "abstract": "Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an incentive to expand considerably the use of telemedicine for high-risk patients with diabetes, and especially for the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Telemedicine and digital medicine also offer critically important approaches to improve access, efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical care for people with diabetes. Methods: Two case reports are presented where telemedicine was used effectively and safely after day 1 in person patient education. These aspects of the management of new-onset T1D patients (adult and pediatric) included ongoing diabetes education of the patient and family digitally. The patients used continuous glucose monitoring with commercially available analysis software (Dexcom Clarity and Glooko) to generate ambulatory glucose profiles and interpretive summary reports. The adult subject used multiple daily insulin injections; the pediatric patient used an insulin pump. The subjects were managed using a combination of e-mail, Internet via Zoom, and telephone calls. Results: These two cases show the feasibility and effectiveness of use of telemedicine in applications in which we had not used it previously: new-onset diabetes education and insulin dosage management. Conclusions: The present case reports illustrate how telemedicine can be used safely and effectively for new-onset T1D training and education for both pediatric and adult patients and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated the expansion of the use of telemedicine and digital medicine. We conclude that telemedicine is an effective approach for the management of patients with new-onset T1D.",

        "title": "Telemedicine in Pediatrics: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials",
        "abstract": "Background Telemedicine modalities, such as videoconferencing, are used by health care providers to remotely deliver health care to patients. Telemedicine use in pediatrics has increased in recent years. This has resulted in improved health care access, optimized disease management, progress in the monitoring of health conditions, and fewer exposures to patients with illnesses during pandemics (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic). Objective We aimed to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence on the feasibility and accessibility of telemedicine services, patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 satisfaction with these services, and treatment outcomes related to telemedicine service use among pediatric populations with different health conditions. Methods Studies were obtained from the PubMed database on May 10, 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. In this review, we included randomized controlled trials from the last 10 years that used a telemedicine approach as a study intervention or assessed telemedicine as a subspecialty of pediatric care. Titles and abstracts were independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. Afterward, full texts were retrieved and independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. A standardized form was used to extract the following data: publication title, first author\u2019s name, publication year, participants\u2019 characteristics, study design, the technology-based approach that was used, intervention characteristics, study goals, and study findings. Results In total, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All studies were categorized as randomized controlled trials (8/11, 73%) or cluster randomized trials (3/11, 27%). The number of participants in each study ranged from 22 to 400. The health conditions that were assessed included obesity (3/11, 27%), asthma (2/11, 18%), mental health conditions (1/11, 9%), otitis media (1/11, 9%), skin conditions (1/11, 9%), type 1 diabetes (1/11, 9%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1/11, 9%), and cystic fibrosis\u2013related pancreatic insufficiency (1/11). The telemedicine approaches that were used included patient and doctor videoconferencing visits (5/11, 45%), smartphone-based interventions (3/11, 27%), telephone counseling (2/11, 18%), and telemedicine-based screening visits (1/11, 9%). The telemedicine interventions in all included studies resulted in outcomes that were comparable to or better than the outcomes of control groups. These outcomes were related to symptom management, quality of life, satisfaction, medication adherence, visit completion rates, and disease progression. Conclusions Although more research is needed, the evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine services for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in-person services. Patients, health care professionals, and caregivers may benefit from using both telemedicine services and traditional, in-person health care services. To maximize the potential of telemedicine, future research should focus on improving patients\u2019 access to care, increasing the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services, and eliminating barriers to telemedicine use.",

        "title": "Pediatric Tele\u2013Home Care Compared to Usual Care: Cost-Minimization Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Although home hospitalization has been a well-known and widespread practice for some time in the adult population, it has not been the same case in the pediatric setting. Simultaneously, telemedicine tools are a facilitator of the change in the health care model, which is increasingly focused on home care. In a pioneering way in Spain, the in-home hospitalization program of the Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u in Barcelona allows the child to be in their home environment at the time they are being monitored and clinically followed by the professionals. Besides being the preferred option for families, previous experience suggests that pediatric home hospitalization reduces costs, primarily thanks to savings on the structural cost of the stay. Objective The aim of this study is to compare the average cost of a discharge by tele\u2013home care with the usual care and to analyze the main drivers of the differential costs of both care models. Methods A cost-minimization analysis is conducted under a hospital\u2019s perspective, based on observational data, and estimated retrospectively. A historical control group of similar patients in terms of clinical casuistry to children hospitalized at home was used for comparison. Results A 24-hour stay at the hospital costs US $574.19, while the in-home hospitalization costs US $301.71 per day, representing a saving of almost half (48%) of the cost compared to usual care. The main saving drivers were the personnel costs (US $102.83/US $284.53, 35.5% of the total), intermediate noncare costs (US $6.09/US $284.53, 33.17%), and structural costs (US $55.16/US $284.53, 19.04%). Home hospitalization involves a total stay 27.61% longer, but at almost half the daily cost, and thus represents a saving of US $176.70 (9.01%) per 24-hour stay. Conclusions The cost analysis conducted under a hospital perspective shows that pediatric tele\u2013home care is 9% cheaper compared to regular hospital care. These results motivate the most widespread implementation of the service from the point of view of economic efficiency, adding to previous experiences that suggest that it is also preferable from the perspective of user satisfaction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maintaining and improving infant health and continuing care at home are very important for the health system. According to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects on the health system capacity and medical staff\u2019s physical-mental health, this study investigated the health staff\u2019s attitude on the implementation of an infant home care plan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 nurses, midwives, and doctors working in the newborn care department in Isfahan health-therapeutic centers, with at least 6 months of work experience. The samples were selected by random multistage method and completed the researcher-made 5-point Likert questionnaire with 25 items and two areas of education support and security safety. The total score of this questionnaire varied from 25 to 125, and obtaining a score equal to or greater than 91 meant that people had a favorable opinion about home care for babies. The reliability of the questionnaire was reported by Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.79, and content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) scores of 0.88\u20130.99 and 0.79\u20130.1, respectively. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 18.0 (SPSS) (Chicago, USA) and analysis of descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and Pearson correlation tests at a 0.05 significance level. RESULTS: The mean score of medical staff's attitude was obtained at 77.59 \u00b1 11.71 and the security-safety and education-support domains scores were 41.3 \u00b1 6.34 and 36.29 \u00b1 6.11, respectively. In addition, a significant inverted relationship was observed between the mean score of medical staffs\u201dattitude with age and the number of shifts. CONCLUSION: According to the results, the medical staff's attitude about the infant home care program is neutral, and designing a professional educational period, considering economic preparations and responsibility assurance is essential for creating confidence and acceptance of the infant home care program by the medical staff.",
