        "abstract": "The safety of a traditional Chinese exercise, Tai-Chi Chuan, on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was evaluated. RA patients, who received 1 h of Tai-Chi Chuan instruction once (n = 20) and twice (n = 15) a week for 10 consecutive wk in two separate studies, showed no deterioration in their clinical disease activities compared with the corresponding controls (n = 11 and 9, respectively). Testing parameters included joint tenderness, joint swelling, time to walk 50 feet, handgrip strength and a written functional assessment. No significant exacerbation of joint symptoms using this weight-bearing form of exercise was observed. Tai-Chi Chuan exercise appears to be safe for RA patients and may serve as an alternative for their exercise therapy and part of their rehabilitation program. Weight-bearing exercises have the potential advantages of stimulating bone growth and strengthening connective tissue, but this effect needs to be documented in long-term studies.",

        "abstract": "Older persons who are willing to begin exercise programs are often not willing to continue them. At the Atlanta FICSIT (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques) site, individuals aged 70+ were randomized to Tai Chi (TC), individualized balance training (BT), and exercise control education (ED) groups for 15 weeks. In a follow-up assessment 4 months post-intervention, 130 subjects responded to exit interview questions asking about perceived benefits of participation. Both TC and BT subjects reported increased confidence in balance and movement, but only TC subjects reported that their daily activities and their overall life had been affected; many of these subjects had changed their normal physical activity to incorporate ongoing TC practice. The data suggest that when mental as well as physical control is perceived to be enhanced, with a generalized sense of improvement in overall well-being, older persons' motivation to continue exercising also increases.",

        "title": "Evaluation and treatment of balance in the elderly: A review of the efficacy of the Berg Balance Test and Tai Chi Quan.",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this review of outcome studies was to determine whether the Berg Balance Test (BBT) can be considered a reliable predictor of a risk for falls in the elderly, and to review the efficacy of Tai Chi Quan in the physical therapy intervention of balance disorders in older adults as reported in the literature. The authors examined studies of the BBT, which showed that the two groups of people, fallers and non-fallers, have considerable differences among them. Fallers tended to be more variable in their characteristics as indicated by larger standard deviations. Based on these results, the authors suggest that patients who score high on the BBT should not be referred for further intervention, whereas patients who score 40 or less have a high probability of falls and require appropriate referrals. The BBT, which is relatively safe and simple, uses a quantitative scale, scoring is reproducible, and the strong internal consistency allows for easy interpretation of scores. The BBT has been shown to have moderately good sensitivity, and high specificity, and therefore is a good predictor of older adults who may have fall risks and may need assistive devices. A big challenge, then, is to plan and implement an effective treatment technique to improve balance control. One recently identified intervention is Tai Chi Quan. Tai Chi is an ancient form of exercise for fitness and the martial arts which has been practiced in China for centuries. The second part of this report examines the efficacy of Tai Chi Quan as a treatment modality. A review of studies on Tai Chi Quan indicates that it has a positive effect on improving balance in the elderly, although it has no effect on improving postural stability. The effects of Tai Chi on the treatment of balance still require extensive research. Although the articles reviewed indicate that Tai Chi does have a positive effect on balance, the methodology used in these studies needs to be improved.",

        "abstract": "This study examined balance ability, lower-extremity muscle strength, fear of falling and their inter-relationships in 40 community-dwelling older adults (>65 years). Subjects who self-identified either as being fearful offalling or not (no concern) were screened to exclude those with known risk factors for falling. Limits of stability, maximal isometric strength, gait speed, and fear of falling were contrasted between groups (27 control subjects, 13 fearful subjects). Those fearful of falling demonstrated smaller center of pressure (COP) excursions in anterior, left, and right directions ( p <.0001) and used a smaller percentage of their base of support during maximal weight shifting in combined anterior-posterior and right-left directions ( p <.001) compared to the control group. Strength did not differ between groups, but was associated with the ability to shift the COP in the anterior-posterior direction ( p <.05). Fear of falling also related to weight shifting ability ( p <.017). Seniors fearful of falling demonstrated limitations in balance ability and balance confidence that could not be explained by muscle weakness.",

        "abstract": "This study examined gender differences in balance, gait, and muscle performance in seniors and identified gender-specific factors contributing to physical performance. Forty (20 men, 20 women) healthy, community-dwelling seniors (74.5 +/- 5.3 years) participated. Limits of stability, gait speed, lower limb flexor and extensor isokinetic concentric peak torques, self-reported activity level, and balance confidence were measured. No gender differences were detected in gait speed, limits of stability when normalized to height, activity level, or balance confidence (p = .188). Women were weaker than men (p = .007), even after controlling for weight and body-mass index, suggesting that other gender-related factors contribute to strength. Gender accounted for 18-46% of the variance in strength and served as a modifier of the relationship between activity level and strength in some muscle groups. The primary factors relating to gender-specific strength was activity level in men and body weight in women.",

        "abstract": "In the next 10 years the number of Dutch people aged 65 and over will increase with 650,000 to 3.0 million people. The prevalence of multiple and often interacting problems in elderly people is high and have many adverse effects on health and quality of life. However, most research and guidelines are directed at isolated health problems. Therefore the research in this thesis is directed towards the interplay between gait and cognition, which both are highly prevalent in old age, have a great impact on the quality of life and functioning of older people and their carers and increase the risk of falling. In this thesis methods to investigate gait and cognitive function and their possible interplay are investigated. It can be concluded that impairments in gait and cognition too often co-occur to be just determined by coincidence. Literature together with the results of this thesis supports the hypothesis that gait and cognition influence each other in older people. They probably have a shared pathophysiology and treatment given for a cognitive problem, for example antipsychotics, can also influence gait. Cognitive functions that seem involved in the coordination of gait and balance are division of attention and insight in cognitive and physical abilities in the cognitive regulation of walking. Executive functions, such as planning and mental flexibility, are also involved and better executive functioning is associated with better gait and balance performance during walking with a cognitive dual task. Although numerous questions are still open, enough knowledge is already present to be able to recommend: If gait is impaired also assess cognitive function and if cognitive function is impaired, also assess gait!",

        "title": "Effect of Cognitive Load on Curvature Redirected Walking Thresholds",
        "abstract": "To allow users to perform real walking in a virtual environment larger than the physical space, redirected walking (RDW) techniques could be employed. Users do not notice this manipulation and immersion remains intact when RDW is applied within certain thresholds. Although many studies on RDW detection thresholds exists, in none of these studies, users were performing an additional task during the threshold identification process. These existing thresholds could be only conservative estimates and the potential of RDW may not be fully utilized. In this paper, we present an experiment to investigate the effect of cognitive load on curvature RDW thresholds. The cognitive load was imposed using a dual task of serial seven subtraction. Results showed that gender and cognitive load have significant effects on curvature RDW thresholds. More specifically, men are on average more sensitive to RDW than women, and being engaged in a dual task increases users\u2019 RDW thresholds.",

        "title": "Inverse Kinematics Assistance for the Creation of Redirected Walking Paths",
        "abstract": "Virtual reality interactions that require a specific relationship between the virtual and physical coordinate systems, such as passive haptic interactions, are not possible with locomotion techniques using redirected walking. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced environmental alignment, which is the notion of using redirected walking techniques to align the virtual and physical coordinate systems such that these interactions are possible. However, the previous research has only implemented environmental alignment in a reactive manner, and the authors posited that better results could be achieved if a predictive algorithm was instead used. In this work, we introduce a novel way to model the environmental alignment problem as a version of the inverse kinematics problem which can be incorporated into several existing predictive algorithms, as well as a simple proof-of-concept implementation. An exploratory human subject study (N=17) was conducted to evaluate this implementation\u2019s usability as a tool for authoring planned path redirected walking scenarios that incorporate physical interactivity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate redirected walking experience design tools and provides a possible framework for future studies. Our qualitative analysis of the results generated both guidance for integrating automatic solvers and broad recommendations for designing redirected path authoring tools.",

        "title": "F-RDW: Redirected Walking with Forecasting Future Position",
        "abstract": "In order to serve better VR experiences to users, existing predictive methods of Redirected Walking (RDW) exploit future information to reduce the number of reset occurrences. However, such methods often impose a precondition during deployment, either in the virtual environment's layout or the user's walking direction, which constrains its universal applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose a mechanism F-RDW that is twofold: (1) forecasts the future information of a user in the virtual space without any assumptions by using the conventional method, and (2) fuse this information while maneuvering existing RDW methods. The backbone of the first step is an LSTM-based model that ingests the user's spatial and eye-tracking data to predict the user's future position in the virtual space, and the following step feeds those predicted values into existing RDW methods (such as MPCRed, S2C, TAPF, and ARC) while respecting their internal mechanism in applicable ways. The results of our simulation test and user study demonstrate the significance of future information when using RDW in small physical spaces or complex environments. We prove that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the number of resets and increases the traveled distance between resets, hence augmenting the redirection performance of all RDW methods explored in this work.

        "title": "A Room to Roam: Reset Prediction Based on Physical Object Placement for Redirected Walking",
        "abstract": "In Redirected Walking (RDW), resets are an overt method that explicitly interrupts users, and they should be avoided to provide a quality user experience. The number of resets depends on the configuration of the physical environment; thus, inappropriate object placement can lead to frequent resets, causing motion sickness and degrading presence. However, estimating the number of resets based on the physical layout is challenging. It is difficult to measure reset frequency with real users repeatedly testing different layouts, and virtual simulations offer limited real-time verification. As a result, while rearranging objects can reduce resets, users have not been able to fully take advantage of this opportunity, highlighting the need for rapid assessment of object placement. To address this, in Study 1, we collected simulation data and analyzed the average number of resets for various object placements. In study 2, we developed a system that allows users to evaluate reset frequency using a real-time placement interface powered by the first learning-based reset prediction model. Our model predicts resets from top-down views of the physical space, leveraging a Vision Transformer architecture. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of $23.88$. We visualized the model's attention scores using heatmaps to analyze the regions of focus during prediction. Through the interface, users can reorganize furniture while instantly observing the change in the predicted number of resets, thus improving their interior for a better RDW experience with fewer resets.",
