        "title": "Use of Theraflex-TMJ Topical Cream for the Treatment of Temporomandibular Joint and Muscle Pain",
        "abstract": "Abstract This randomized, double-blind study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the topical cream Theraflex-TMJ (NaBob/Rx, San Mateo, CA) in patients with masseter muscle pain and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain. Fifty-two subjects (5 males and 47 females) were instructed to apply a cream over the afflicted masseter muscle(s) or over the jaw joint(s) twice daily for two weeks. Theraflex-TMJ cream was used by the experimental group, while a placebo cream was used by the control group. The means of pain ratings were calculated prior to the application of the cream (baseline), after ten days of tx (period 1), and 15 days of tx (period 2) days of treatment and five days after stopping the treatment (follow-up). There was a significant decrease in reported pain levels from baseline in the experimental group for period 1 (p<0.01), period 2 (p<0.001), and follow-up (p<0.01). For the control group, no significant differences were found between the different time periods (p>0.05). There was evidence of minor side effects such as skin irritation and/or burning on the site of the application in two subjects in the experimental as well as two subjects in the control groups. The data strongly suggest that Theraflex-TMJ topical cream is safe and effective for reducing pain in the masseter muscle and the temporomandibular joint.",

        "title": "Clinical effect of a topical herbal ointment on pain in temporomandibular disorders: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of using Ping On ointment and using petroleum jelly in the treatment of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and masticatory muscle pain, in order to establish the true efficacy of Ping On ointment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 55 subjects with TMJ and/or masticatory pain (Group I patients according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorder (RDC/TMD) received Ping On ointment for 4 weeks, or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity measured by visual analogue scale and maximal comfortable mandibular opening, at baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPing On ointment significantly reduced the symptoms of painful TMJs and/or masticatory muscles. Maximal comfortable mandibular opening also improved in the Ping On ointment group compared with the placebo, but was not clinically significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis preliminary study suggests that topical application of Ping On ointment may be considered for further investigation as a potential first-line treatment modality, before prescribing analgesics, for the management of TMDs. It is topically applied, safe, reversible, and effective in managing TMDs and masticatory muscle pain.",

        "title": "A pilot study of a chiropractic intervention for management of chronic myofascial temporomandibular disorder.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTemporomandibular pain has multiple etiologies and a range of therapeutic options. In this pilot study, the authors assessed the feasibility of conducting a larger trial to evaluate chiropractic treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors assigned 80 participants randomly into one of the following four groups, all of which included a comprehensive self-care program: reversible interocclusal splint therapy (RIST), Activator Method Chiropractic Technique (AMCT) (Activator Methods International, Phoenix), sham AMCT and self-care only. They made assessments at baseline and at month 2 and month 6, including use of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe authors screened 721 potential participants and enrolled 80 people; 52 participants completed the six-month assessment. The adjusted mean change in current pain over six months, as assessed on the 11-point numerical rating scale, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1-3.0) for RIST, 1.7 (0.9-2.5) for self-care only, 1.5 (0.7-2.4) for AMCT and 1.6 (0.7-2.5) for sham AMCT. The authors also assessed bothersomeness and functionality.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe authors found the study design and methodology to be manageable. They gained substantial knowledge to aid in conducting a larger study. AMCT, RIST and self-care should be evaluated in a future comparative effectiveness study.\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nThis pilot study was a necessary step to prepare for a larger study that will provide clinicians with information that should be helpful when discussing treatment options for patients with TMD.",

Methods This randomized, double-blind prospective clinical study was conducted with patients who applied with the complaint of pain in the temporomandibular region. A total of 169 patients were randomly divided into four groups and received the following treatments: Group A: naproxen sodium 550 mg; Group B: naproxen sodium 550 mg + codeine phosphate 30 mg; Group C: naproxen sodium 550 mg + single-dose dexamethasone 8 mg, and Group D: paracetamol 500 mg. Results Of the patients, 132 were female, and 37 were male, with a mean age of 27.04 \u00b1 10.56 (18\u201369 years). Analgesic efficiency of the naproxen sodium-codeine phosphate group was the most effective at the 2nd week and 4th week (p < 0.05). Conclusion Naproxen sodium-codeine phosphate might be preferred as an analgesic in similar cases with severe myofascial pain.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe selection of appropriate outcomes in clinical trials and systematic reviews is a crucial factor in determining the results that are useful, reliable, and relevant for both patients and healthcare professionals. Clinicians and researchers have been encouraged to develop and apply core outcome sets (COS) to minimise the discrepancy between studies.\n\n\nAIM\nThis systematic review is the first phase of the COS development project for clinical trials in temporomandibular disorders (COS-TMD). It aims to identify and synthesise the outcomes used in the randomised controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions used in TMD management.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAn electronic search was performed in several databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and EMBASE. The eligibility criteria comprised RCT that applied any intervention to treat temporomandibular joint disorders or masticatory muscle disorders. The identified outcomes were categorised according to domains of the Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe electronic search resulted in 1606 studies. After removing duplicates and applying the eligibility criteria, 106 RCT were included. A total of 43 studies evaluated masticatory muscle disorders, 27 evaluated temporomandibular joint disorders, and 36 analysed mixed TMD.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evaluation showed significant variability in the types of outcomes and their measurement instruments. In addition, some domains such as physical and emotional functioning, participant ratings of global improvement and adverse events have been neglected when determining the effectiveness of treatments for TMD.",
