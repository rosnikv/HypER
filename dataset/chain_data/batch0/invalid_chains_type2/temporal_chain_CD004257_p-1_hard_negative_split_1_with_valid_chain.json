        "abstract": "Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, and placebo were compared to determine their efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis of the knee. In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose, parallel-design studies, patients with osteoarthritis aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 60.6 \u00b1 12.8 years were randomized to daily doses of 660 mg naproxen sodium (440 mg naproxen sodium in patients \u226565 years), 4000 mg acetaminophen, or placebo for 7 days. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in pain at rest, on passive motion, on weight-bearing, stiffness after rest (morning), day and night pain compared with placebo, and significantly greater relief from resting pain than acetaminophen (P < 0.05). Acetaminophen provided significantly greater improvements in day pain compared with placebo. Daily evaluations showed naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided superior pain relief to acetaminophen and was significantly better than acetaminophen at reducing difficulties experienced in walking several blocks and difficulties in bending, lifting, and stooping. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) and acetaminophen (4000 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mobility level, household tasks, and walking and bending. Patient and investigator evaluation scores were significantly higher in naproxen sodium and acetaminophen groups compared with placebo; no differences were observed between active treatments. Naproxen sodium and acetaminophen had similar safety profiles to placebo. Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) effectively relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis. Naproxen sodium is an alternative in the initial treatment of osteoarthritis and may be preferred to acetaminophen as first-line therapy in patients with moderate or severe pain.",

        "abstract": "While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.",

Objective: Characterize ASS in APAP hepatotoxicity. Methods: ASS was measured in plasma from rodents and humans with APAP hepatotoxicity. Results: In mice, ASS increased before injury, peaked before alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased rapidly. Fischer rats had a greater increase in ASS relative to ALT. Patients with abnormal liver test results had very high ASS compared to controls. ASS appeared to increase early in some patients, and declined rapidly in all. Conclusions: ASS may be a useful biomarker of acute cell death in APAP hepatotoxicity.",

        "title": "Acetaminophen: Dose-Dependent Drug Hepatotoxicity and Acute Liver Failure in Patients",
        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced liver injury is a rare but serious clinical problem. A number of drugs can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure at therapeutic doses in a very limited number of patients (<1:10,000). This idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, which is currently not predictable in preclinical safety studies, appears to depend on individual susceptibility and the inability to adapt to the cellular stress caused by a particular drug. In striking contrast to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, drugs with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity are mostly detected during preclinical studies and do not reach the market. One notable exception is acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol), which is a safe drug at therapeutic doses but can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure after intentional and unintentional overdoses. Key Messages: APAP overdose is responsible for more acute liver failure cases in the USA or UK than all other etiologies combined. Since APAP overdose in the mouse represents a model for the human pathophysiology, substantial progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of cell death, liver injury and recovery. More recently, emerging evidence based on mechanistic biomarker analysis in patients and studies of cell death in human hepatocytes suggests that most of the mechanisms discovered in mice also apply to patients. The rapid development of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote against APAP overdose was based on the early understanding of APAP toxicity in mice. However, despite the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in patients who present early after APAP overdose, there is a need to develop intervention strategies for late-presenting patients. Conclusions: The challenges related to APAP toxicity are to better understand the mechanisms of cell death in order to limit liver injury and prevent acute liver failure, and also to develop biomarkers that better predict as early as possible who is at risk for developing acute liver failure with poor outcome.",

        "title": "Oridonin ameliorates lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine-induced acute liver injury in mice via inhibition of apoptosis.",
        "abstract": "We investigated the protective effects exerted by oridonin, the main active constituent of the Chinese medicinal herb Rabdosiarubescens, against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-Gal)-induced acute liver injury (ALI). An ALI model was induced in mice using LPS (40 \u03bcg/0.5 ml) and D-Gal (5 mg/0.5 ml). The mice were randomly divided into the following five groups of six mice each: one control group (a), one ALI group (b), two oridonin treatment groups (c and d), and one oridonin control group (e). Oridonin (0.2 mg/0.5 ml) was administered once 1 h prior to the LPS/D-Gal challenge in group c and a total of three times over a period of four days, with the last dose given at 1 h before the LPS/D-Gal challenge, in group d. Pretreatment with oridonin improved the survival rate, alleviated histopathological abnormalities, and suppressed plasma aminotransferases in the LPS/D-Gal-challenged mice. Importantly, oridonin attenuated LPS/D-Gal-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes by reducing pro-apoptotic signals (P<0.05), such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Furthermore, JNK-associated mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins were also suppressed by pretreatment with oridonin. Taken together, these data show that oridonin exerts protective effects against LPS/D-Gal-induced ALI in mice via a mechanism that may involve the suppression of the pro-apoptotic cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and JNK-associated pro-apoptotic signaling.",

        "title": "Protective Effects of Oridonin on Acute Liver Injury via Impeding Posttranslational Modifications of Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4) in the Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) Signaling Pathway",
        "abstract": "Objective Recent researches have demonstrated that inflammation-related diseases are effectively regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation and acetylation. Our previous study found a new acetyltransferase inhibitor, oridonin, which had a protective effect on acute liver injury (ALI). In the present study, we further investigated its protective mechanism against D-galactosamine (D-Gal) combined with lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI in mice. Methods Intraperitoneal injections of LPS (40 \u03bcg/mouse)/D-Gal (5\u2009mg/mouse) were given to the mice, and the experimental group was pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of oridonin (0.2\u2009mg/mouse). To elucidate the protective mechanism of oridonin, we collected liver specimens and used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. We focused on the genes that were upregulated by LPS/D-Gal and downregulated after pretreatment with oridonin. The downregulated genes examined by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were further verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. Results GO analysis showed that genes that were downregulated after pretreatment with oridonin were extremely concentrated in immune response, chemotaxis, and inflammatory response. Real-time PCR confirmed that the expression of these genes was upregulated by LPS/D-Gal induction and reduced after treatment with oridonin, which was consistent with RNA-Seq results. KEGG pathway analysis showed a significantly enriched downregulated gene that was present in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling cascade. Our results manifested that phosphorylation levels of upstream signaling molecules in the TLR4 signaling cascade, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), P38, and I\u03baB, were significantly inhibited by oridonin. Furthermore, LPS/D-Gal stimulation triggered posttranslational modifications of related gene loci in the TLR4 signaling pathway, including phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4 T345/S346) and acetylation of IRAK4 (K34). However, after treatment with oridonin, the modification pattern of IRAK4 expression stimulated by LPS/D-Gal was suggestively attenuated. Conclusion Our study revealed that the protective effects of oridonin on LPS/D-Gal-induced ALI mediated by inhibition of the PTMs of IRAK4, including phosphorylation of T345/S346 and acetylation of K34.",

        "abstract": "Purpose In search of new potent treatment of herpes simplex keratitis (HSK), inhibitory effect of oridonin (Ori) on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was validated by experiments. Methods For evaluating inhibitory effect of oridonin on herpes simplex virus type 1, a series of in-vivo and in-vitro studies were carried out. Mouse HSV-1 infection model was used in the in-vivo experiments. Experimental mice were classified in five different groups: Mock (mock-infected), HSV-1+ DMSO, HSV-1+ Ori, HSV-1+ ACV, combined Ori and ACV+HSV-1. Corneas of Mock, HSV-1+ DMSO, HSV-1+ Ori group were sent for mRNA-sequencing after 3 days post infection (dpi). The expression of virus and host-related genes was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Vero cells HSV-1 infection models were used in the in-vitro experiments. Results The application of ACV, Oridonin alone or a combination of both could alleviate HSV-1 severity and inhibit HSV-1 virus replication in C57BL/6 mice models. qPCR showed that compared with mock group, the expression of interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-1\u03b1 (il-1\u03b1), and Tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-\u03b1) was up-regulated in DMSO+HSV-1 group and suppressed in other three group. Moreover, the expression of nod-like receptor protein (nlrp3), caspase 1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 (il-1\u03b2) were depressed in the oridonin-treated group. Oridonin significantly inhibits HSV-1 replication, HSV-1 related gene expression, and the production of progeny HSV-1 viruses in vitro. Besides, oridonin affect the replication phase but not HSV-1 entry or penetration and cannot inactivate HSV-1. Conclusion Oridonin alleviates herpes simplex keratitis infection in mouse, which may be attributed to inhibition of the NLRP3-inflammasome-IL-1\u03b2 pathway. Our study illustrates that Oridonin has potential promise for application in treating HSK and other diseases caused by HSV-1 infection.",
