        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) in the treatment of depression in 191 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study. A placebo washout period of 3-7 days was followed by an 8 week active treatment phase during which patients received either paroxetine (20-40 mg daily) or amitriptyline (75-150 mg daily). The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at endpoint.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParoxetine was as effective as amitriptyline for the treatment of depression, with similar improvements in RA associated pain and disability also seen in both groups. However, paroxetine was better tolerated than amitriptyline, with an overall frequency of adverse experiences of 56.4% and 67.7% in the 2 groups, respectively. The frequency of anticholinergic adverse experiences was much lower in the paroxetine treatment group (18.1% vs 43.8% taking amitriptyline) and paroxetine treated patients also experienced fewer severe (16.0% vs 21.9%), serious nonfatal (0% vs 4.2%), and drug related adverse experiences (12.8% vs 29.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTolerability is an important consideration in this patient population, which is largely composed of elderly patients who are taking additional medications for RA. Paroxetine shows a number of advantages in the management of depression comorbid with RA.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE Our objective was to examine the relative association of depression severity and chronicity, other comorbid psychiatric conditions, and coexisting medical illnesses with multiple domains of health status among primary care patients with clinical depression. METHODS We collected cross-sectional data as part of a treatment effectiveness trial that was conducted in 8 diverse health care organizations. Patients aged 60 years and older (N = 1,801) who met diagnostic criteria for major depression or dysthymia participated in a baseline survey. A survey instrument included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, depression severity and chronicity, neuroticism, and the presence of 11 common chronic medical illnesses, as well as questions screening for panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Measures of 4 general health indicators (physical and mental component scales of the SF-12, Sheehan Disability Index, and global quality of life) were included. We conducted separate mixed-effect regression linear models predicting each of the 4 general health indicators. RESULTS Depression severity was significantly associated with all 4 indicators of general health after controlling for sociodemographic differences, other psychological dysfunction, and the presence of 11 chronic medical conditions. Although study participants had an average of 3.8 chronic medical illnesses, depression severity made larger independent contributions to 3 of the 4 general health indicators (mental functional status, disability, and quality of life) than the medical comorbidities.

        "abstract": "Objective. To examine the relative and combined impact of depressive and chronic physical conditions on functional status and health-care use in the general population. Method. Canadian, representative, population-based cross-sectional survey (n=130880). Major depressive disorder (MDD) in the past 12 months was assessed by structured interview, and physical disorders, activity reduction, role impairment and work absence by self-report. The relative impact of MDD and six common chronic physical illnesses (asthma, arthritis, back problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes) was estimated using multivariate regression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and overall chronic physical illness burden. Results. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol dependence and chronic physical illness burden, the presence of co-morbid MDD was associated with significantly greater (approximately double the) likelihood of health-care utilization and increased functional disability and work absence compared to the presence of a chronic physical illness without co-morbid MDD. This impact of MDD was seen across each of the six chronic physical illnesses examined in this study, with the strongest associations seen for work absence. Conclusions. These observations confirm prior findings of a strong association at the population level between major depression and health-care use and role impairment among persons with chronic physical disorders. They also point to the significant impact of co-morbid major depression on health-care seeking, disability and work absence in persons with chronic physical illness, underscoring the need for greater efforts to design and test the impact of detection and treatment programs for such individuals.",

Whether MI is associated with an increased risk of suicide is unknown. We examined the association between MI and suicide. Methods and Results\u2014 We conducted a population-based case-control study by retrieving data from 5 nationwide longitudinal registers in Denmark. As cases, we selected all persons aged 40 to 89 years who died by suicide from 1981 to 2006. As controls, we randomly selected up to 10 persons per case matched by sex, day of birth, and calendar time. We identified 19 857 persons who committed suicide and 190 058 controls. MI was associated with a marked increased risk of suicide. The risk of suicide was highest during the first month after discharge for MI for patients with no history of psychiatric illness (adjusted rate ratio, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 6.56) and for patients with a history of psychiatric illness (adjusted rate ratio, 64.05; 95% confidence interval, 13.36 to 307.06) compared with those with no history of MI or psychiatric illness.

        "abstract": "Background Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Given their worldwide use, even small risks account for a large number of cases. This study has been conducted with carefully collected information to further investigate the relationship between SSRIs and upper GI bleeding. Methods We conducted a case-control study in hospitals in Spain and in Italy. Cases were patients aged \u226518 years with a primary diagnosis of acute upper GI bleeding diagnosed by endoscopy; three controls were matched by sex, age, date of admission (within 3 months) and hospital among patients who were admitted for elective surgery for non-painful disorders. Exposures to SSRIs, other antidepressants and other drugs were defined as any use of these drugs in the 7 days before the day on which upper gastrointestinal bleeding started (index day). Results 581 cases of upper GI bleeding and 1358 controls were considered eligible for the study; no differences in age or sex distribution were observed between cases and controls after matching. Overall, 4.0% of the cases and 3.3% of controls used an SSRI antidepressant in the week before the index day. No significant risk of upper GI bleeding was encountered for SSRI antidepressants (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06, 95% CI, 0.57\u20131.96) or for whichever other grouping of antidepressants.

        "abstract": "Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed agents for various conditions in general psychiatry. There is a strong consensus that blockade of serotonin reuptake affects primary hemostasis, namely platelet activity, thus resulting in a bleeding tendency. Considering that SSRIs are commonly prescribed, this study was conducted to assess if they were associated with an increased risk of bleeding. \nMethods: This was a prospective, open-label study of 30 patients attending the Psychiatry out-patient department, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Medical College, Bangalore who satisfied DSM-IV criteria for a primary diagnosis of depression, treated with SSRIs. Bleeding time, clotting time, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count were assessed at baseline and at the end of 6 weeks of treatment or occurrence of bleeding symptom. \nResults: The patients aged between 18-55 years of whom 21 were females, were treated with an SSRI (fluoxetine 12, escitalopram 12 and sertraline 6 patients). Six patients had overt symptoms of bleeding (upper gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis) 4; epistaxis 2 and petechiae 2) of whom one patient gave a history of both hematemesis and petechiae and another of hematemesis and epistaxis. The average day after treatment beginning, on which patients reported with bleeding was 30.33 (26-40 days). There was a significant increase in the bleeding time (p=0.028) and clotting time (p=0.042), implying derangement in platelet aggregation. There was no significant change in the other parameters. \nConclusion: Treatment with SSRIs increases the risk of bleeding.

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 Serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants decrease platelet aggregation. This may cause an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the risk of subclinical microbleeds, which are highly prevalent in middle-aged and elderly people, is unknown. We studied whether serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants increase the frequency of cerebral microbleeds and secondarily whether they lower the presence of ischemic vascular damage. Methods\u2014 Within the population-based Rotterdam Study, information on antidepressant use was obtained from continuously monitored pharmacy records. Brain MRI was available in 4945 participants (55% women, mean age 64 years) between 2005 and 2011. We categorized antidepressants based on affinity for the serotonin transporter: high, intermediate, or low. Microbleeds (presence and location) and ischemic lesions (lacunes, white matter lesions) were rated on MRI. Logistic and linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, depressive symptoms, and cardiovascular risk were used to study the association of antidepressants with microbleeds and ischemic vascular lesions. Results\u2014 Antidepressant use with strong serotonin reuptake inhibition was not associated with microbleed presence (odds ratio compared with nonuse, 1.03; confidence interval, 0.75\u20131.39) irrespective of microbleed location in the brain. Exclusion of antithrombotic users or persons with cortical infarcts did not change our results. Furthermore, serotonin reuptake inhibition was not related to ischemic vascular brain damage. Conclusions\u2014 In the general population, use of serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants is not related to presence of cerebral microbleeds. This strengthens the idea that the platelet inhibitor effects of antidepressant drugs with affinity for serotonin are minimal and further supports the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for nongastrointestinal bleedings.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for psychiatric complications after stroke. Studies have indicated additional effects, and SSRIs could potentially be used as enhancers of stroke recovery. However, beneficial effects should be weighed against potential adverse effects. In particular, the possible association with cerebrovascular events has raised concern. Areas covered: We review the literature on cerebrovascular events associated with SSRI treatment after stroke. The possible beneficial effects of SSRI treatment for stroke recovery and survival, and potential safety concerns, are discussed. Expert opinion: Evidence suggests that SSRIs may enhance stroke recovery. Most studies on cerebrovascular risk are from non-stroke populations and little is known about recurrent events and mortality post-stroke. In non-stroke populations treatment has been associated with increased risk of intracerebral and intracranial hemorrhage; however the absolute risk is low. The association between SSRIs and ischemic stroke is less clear. Randomized stroke trials indicate that treatment is safe and well tolerated, and the most common side effects are often benign and transient. The trials are small however and not powered to detect potential differences in cerebrovascular events. We await several ongoing large randomized trials before SSRIs can be recommended as a routine pharmacotherapy in stroke recovery.",

        "abstract": "The brain can undergo self-repair and has the ability to compensate for functions lost after a stroke. The plasticity of the ischemic brain is influenced by several factors including aging and pharmacotherapy. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant which enhances serotonergic neurotransmission through selective inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin. In clinical practice, fluoxetine alleviates the symptoms of post-stroke depression (PSD), helps motor recovery in stroke patients. In animal experiments, chronic administration of fluoxetine induces increased excitability of mature granule cells (GCs), enhancing axonal and dendritic reorganization, as well as promoting neurogenesis or angiogenesis in the dentate gurus (DG), but the effect of fluoxetine in the subventricular zone (SVZ) remains controversial. Meanwhile, chronic treatment with fluoxetine did not reverse age-dependent suppression of proliferation cells in the DG. Interestingly, although fluoxetine has been found to enhance neurogenesis in the DG in stroke rats, this property is not consistent with the behavioral recovery. More studies into this issue will be required to reveal how to translate enhanced neuronal plasticity into behavioral benefits. This review provides an update of the current knowledge about the neurogenesis and the fate of the newly generated cells after the use of fluoxetine, as well as its ability to promote a behavioral recovery after stroke in clinical and experimental results and attempts to define the therapeutic properties of fluoxetine in regenerative neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory role of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in microglia (MG) and the mechanisms under oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). An OGD/R model on BV-2 cells was used for the study of microglia under ischemia/reperfusion injury in ischemic stroke. Lentiviral transfection was applied to knock down I\u03baB-\u03b1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for detecting levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, and real-time PCR was used to assess the expression of I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein. Western blotting was applied to analyze NF-\u03baB-signaling related proteins and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used for assessing cell viability. Molecular docking and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay were used for the detection of the interaction between I\u03baB-\u03b1 and fluoxetine. We found that fluoxetine decreased the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in supernatant as well as NF-\u03baB subunits p65 and p50 in BV-2 cells under OGD/R. Fluoxetine significantly increased the level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 ubiquitylation and promoted the bonding of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and fluoxetine in BV-2 cells under OGD/R.
