        "title": "Effects of intravenous nifekalant as a lifesaving drug for severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias complicating acute coronary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIntravenous amiodarone (AMD) has been used for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) in emergency care medicine. However, AMD acts slowly and is occasionally accompanied by hypotension and bradycardia. The antiarrhythmic effect of intravenous nifekalant (NIF) was assessed in patients with VT/VF complicating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) according to our study protocol.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAmong a series of 1,143 ACS patients, 41 patients who suffered sustained VT/VF were enrolled; 19 failed to respond to a preceding lidocaine (LID) injection. NIF was given first as an intravenous bolus injection (0.2 mg/kg) and then as a continuous intravenous infusion at a relatively low dose level (0.2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Sustained VT/VF was successfully inhibited by NIF in 34 patients (83%). In subgroup analysis, NIF achieved VT/VF inhibition in 79% of patients who received preceding LID and in 86% of patients who received direct NIF. There were no significant changes in systolic blood pressure or heart rate following NIF therapy. A corrected QT interval was significantly prolonged (P<0.01), whereas torsade de pointes developed in only 1 patient (2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn intravenous bolus injection and subsequent continuous infusion of NIF at a relatively low dosage were effective in treating severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias complicating ACS, reducing the potential risk of proarrhythmia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNifekalant hydrochloride (NIF) is an intravenous class-III antiarrhythmic agent that purely blocks the K(+)-channel without inhibiting \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. The present study was designed to investigate the feasibility of NIF as a life-saving therapy for out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe Japanese Population-based Utstein-style study with basic and advanced Life Support Education study was a multi-center registry study with 4 participating institutes located at the northern urban area of Osaka, Japan. Eligible patients were those treated with NIF because of out-of-hospital VF refractory to 3 or more precordial shocks and intravenous epinephrine. Between February 2006 and February 2007, 17 patients were enrolled for the study. The time from a call for emergency medical service to the first shock was 12(6-26)min. The time from the first shock to the NIF administration was 25.5(9-264)min and the usage dose of NIF was 25(15-210)mg. When excluding 3 patients in whom percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was applied before NIF administration, the rate of return of spontaneous circulation was 86% and the rate of admission alive to the hospital was 79%. One patient developed torsade de pointes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntravenous administration of NIF seems to be feasible as a potential therapy for advanced cardiac life-support in patients with out-of-hospital VF, and therefore further study is warranted.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to review the literature and discuss nifekalant's potential use as a first aid drug in an emergency care setting. The PubMed database was used to identify papers, using keywords nifekalant, MS-551, amiodarone and lidocaine. Nifekalant hydrochloride, formally known as MS-551, is a class III antiarrhythmic agent which acts only by increasing the time course of myocardial repolarization. It was developed and is currently being used only in Japan for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is a non-selective K(+) channel blocker without any \u03b2-blocking actions. Administration of nifekalant suppressed sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in acute coronary syndrome patients, and in cardiac arrest victims as well as during or after cardiac surgery. The major adverse effect of nifekalant is QT interval prolongation and occurrence of torsades de pointes which requires frequent monitoring of the QT interval during nifekalant infusion with adequate dose adjustment. Nifekalant is a possible effective antiarrhythmic agent for refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Further clinical studies are required before nifekalant is routinely used in the emergency care setting.",

        "abstract": "Aims Complete restitution of neurologic function after 6 h of pre-hospital resuscitation and in-hospital rewarming has been reported in accidental hypothermia patients with cardiac arrest (CA). However, the level of restitution of circulatory function during long-lasting hypothermic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remains largely unknown. We compared the effects of CPR in replacing spontaneous circulation during 3 h at 27\u00b0C vs. 45 min at normothermia by determining hemodynamics, global oxygen transport (DO2), oxygen uptake (VO2), and organ blood flow. Methods Anesthetized pigs (n = 7) were immersion cooled to CA at 27\u00b0C. Predetermined variables were compared: (1) Before cooling, during cooling to 27\u00b0C with spontaneous circulation, after CA and subsequent continuous CPR (n = 7), vs. (2) before CA and during 45 min CPR in normothermic pigs (n = 4). Results When compared to corresponding values during spontaneous circulation at 38\u00b0C: (1) After 15 min of CPR at 27\u00b0C, cardiac output (CO) was reduced by 74%, mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 63%, DO2 by 47%, but organ blood flow was unaltered. Continuous CPR for 3 h maintained these variables largely unaltered except for significant reduction in blood flow to the heart and brain after 3 h, to the kidneys after 1 h, to the liver after 2 h, and to the stomach and small intestine after 3 h. (2) After normothermic CPR for 15 min, CO was reduced by 71%, MAP by 54%, and DO2 by 63%. After 45 min, hemodynamic function had deteriorated significantly, organ blood flow was undetectable, serum lactate increased by a factor of 12, and mixed venous O2 content was reduced to 18%. Conclusion The level to which CPR can replace CO and MAP during spontaneous circulation at normothermia was not affected by reduction in core temperature in our setting. Compared to spontaneous circulation at normothermia, 3 h of continuous resuscitation at 27\u00b0C provided limited but sufficient O2 delivery to maintain aerobic metabolism. This fundamental new knowledge is important in that it encourages early and continuous CPR in accidental hypothermia victims during evacuation and transport.",

        "title": "Autoregulation of Cerebral Blood Flow During 3-h Continuous Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation at 27\u00b0C",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Victims of accidental hypothermia in hypothermic cardiac arrest (HCA) may survive with favorable neurologic outcome if early and continuous prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is started and continued during evacuation and transport. The efficacy of cerebral autoregulation during hypothermic CPR is largely unknown and is aim of the present experiment. Methods: Anesthetized pigs (n = 8) were surface cooled to HCA at 27\u00b0C before 3 h continuous CPR. Central hemodynamics, cerebral O2 delivery (DO2) and uptake (VO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were determined before cooling, at 32\u00b0C and at 27\u00b0C, then at 15 min after the start of CPR, and hourly thereafter. To estimate cerebral autoregulation, the static autoregulatory index (sARI), and the CBF/VO2 ratio were determined. Results: After the initial 15-min period of CPR at 27\u00b0C, cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were reduced significantly when compared to corresponding values during spontaneous circulation at 27\u00b0C (\u221266.7% and \u221244.4%, respectively), and remained reduced during the subsequent 3-h period of CPR. During the first 2-h period of CPR at 27\u00b0C, blood flow in five different brain areas remained unchanged when compared to the level during spontaneous circulation at 27\u00b0C, but after 3 h of CPR blood flow in 2 of the 5 areas was significantly reduced. Cooling to 27\u00b0C reduced cerebral DO2 by 67.3% and VO2 by 84.4%. Cerebral VO2 was significantly reduced first after 3 h of CPR. Cerebral DO2 remained unaltered compared to corresponding levels measured during spontaneous circulation at 27\u00b0C. Cerebral autoregulation was preserved (sARI > 0.4), at least during the first 2 h of CPR. Interestingly, the CBF/VO2 ratio during spontaneous circulation at 27\u00b0C indicated the presence of an affluent cerebral DO2, whereas after CPR, the CBF/VO2 ratio returned to the level of spontaneous circulation at 38\u00b0C. Conclusion: Despite a reduced CO, continuous CPR for 3 h at 27\u00b0C provided sufficient cerebral DO2 to maintain aerobic metabolism and to preserve cerebral autoregulation during the first 2-h period of CPR. This new information supports early start and continued CPR in accidental hypothermia patients during rescue and transportation for in hospital rewarming.",
