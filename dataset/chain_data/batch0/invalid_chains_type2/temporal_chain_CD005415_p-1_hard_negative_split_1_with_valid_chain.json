        "title": "Drug treatments in upper gastrointestinal bleeding: value of endoscopic findings as surrogate end points",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Pharmacotherapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding has been difficult to evaluate because clinical end points are infrequent and affected by other factors. AIMS To evaluate whether blood in the stomach at endoscopy reflected severity of bleeding, predicted clinical outcomes, and could be altered by therapeutic agents. METHODS We studied 414 consecutive admissions with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were randomised to receive lansoprazole 60 mg followed by 30 mg four times daily, tranexamic acid 2 g followed by 1 g four times daily, both drugs, or placebo for four days, until discharge or a clinical end point occurred. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of endoscopic changes and clinical outcomes, and to investigate the effects of drug treatments on blood in the stomach. RESULTS Of 414 patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 379 were endoscoped. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was confirmed in 316. Sixteen required surgery within 30 days and 16 died on the index admission. Trial treatments were evaluable on a per protocol basis in 228 patients. The amount of blood in the stomach was found to reflect initial risk, with significant associations with high risk categorisation (odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.5\u20139.4) for more than a trace v none/trace), age (1.5 (1.1\u20131.9) per decade), and initial pulse (1.02 (1.00\u20131.04) per beat), and to predict rebleeding (9.2 (4.6\u201318.7)) and surgery (8.2 (2.9\u201322.9)). Other stigmata were less significant in these respects. The amount of blood in the stomach at endoscopy was reduced significantly by both lansoprazole (0.22 (0.07\u20130.63)) and tranexamic acid (0.27 (0.09\u20130.81)), although there was no evidence of synergy. CONCLUSIONS Blood in the stomach reflects clinical features in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is reduced by treatment with lansoprazole and tranexamic acid.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a pilot, non-randomized trial we tested the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent fibrinolytic inhibitor, as adjunctive therapy in standard treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty consecutive patients (12 male, eight female; 63+/-8 years) with 36 episodes of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding were included in the study. In 16 episodes of bleeding TXA was used (in a dosage of 20 mg intravenously, followed for the next 4 weeks by 10 mg/kg/48 h orally), whereas in 20 other cases of bleeding, TXA was not used. The decision to use TXA was left to the attending physician's clinical judgement, resulting in all the more severe cases of bleeding being treated with TXA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment including TXA was shown to be beneficial (relative to cases not treated with TXA) in terms of decreasing the rate of early re-bleeding (in the first week, 0 vs 6, P<0.05), the rate of early and late re-bleeding (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05), the rate of repeated endoscopic procedures (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05) and the number of blood transfusions needed (in the first month, 1.4+/-1.3 vs 2.6+/-1.5 units, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this pilot study suggest that TXA can be beneficial in the treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients. This remains to be definitely confirmed in a randomized study.",

        "abstract": "Summary Some previous studies suggest that activation of the fibrinolytic system may induce platelet dysfunction in haemodialysis patients. Accordingly, inhibition of fibrinolysis may improve platelet dysfunction, and speculatively increase haemoglobin levels. We tested this hypothesis. The study group comprised 22 patients (14 male, 8 female, median age 62), who had been on maintenance haemodialysis for more than one year. Patients were treated for three months with low-dose tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent anti-fibrinolytic agent. The dosages of erythropoietin and the haemodialysis procedure were not changed significantly during the study. We primarily followed platelet function (by in vitro closure time test) and haemoglobin values. Patients were divided into those with substantially prolonged (N=9) and those with slightly delayed or normal (N=13) in vitro closure time. Treatment with TXA resulted in a significant improvement of platelet function and increased levels of haemoglobin in the first group, and no changes in either platelet function or haemoglobin values in the second group. TXA in the dosage used was biologically active, since a significant decrease in plasminogen and D-dimer were found in both groups. No significant changes in other fibrinolytic parameters or von Willebrand factor were found. No complications in terms of arterial or venous thrombosis were observed. Our pilot study suggests that long term, low-dose TXA treatment of haemodialysis patients with substantially prolonged in vitro closure time results in a significant improvement of platelet dysfunction and a significant increase in haemoglobin values. These new, promising results merit further investigation in larger studies.",

        "abstract": "We describe a successful treatment of a severe, persistent bleeding from both kidneys in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent antifibrinolytic agent. The bleeding could not be controlled by intensive conservative treatment, it became life-threatening and urgent bilateral nephrectomy was intended. Since local and systemic hyperfibrinolysis play a role in bleeding in ADPKD patients, we tried TXA treatment. In fact, the massive bleeding promptly stopped, and haematuria gradually ceased. Removal of both kidneys was prevented. After 5 days both ureters became obstructed by blood clots, but placing J-catheters in each pyelon successfully solved this complication. Our case shows that it is reasonable to try antifibrinolytic treatment with TXA in such devastating uncontrolled bleeding.",

        "abstract": "This is the first report of a case of a reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function in a patient with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) receiving rapamycin. A 42-year-old man with ADPKD and a severe persistent bleeding from his solitary left kidney was successfully treated with tranexamic acid (TXA). He also received low-dose rapamycin for 8 months, and this was associated with a 23.5% reduction in kidney volume, improvement and stabilization of renal function, and normalization of haemoglobin levels. When treatment with rapamycin was interrupted, renal function deteriorated within an 8-month period and haemodialysis (HD) became necessary. Kidney volume increased at once, and life-threatening bleeding prompted a nephrectomy 4 months after the onset of HD. These data suggest that the reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function with rapamycin could be the result of the antiangiogenic, antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.",

To address this limitation, we tested the efficacy of rapamycin in a mouse model that results from conditional inactivation of Pkd1. Mosaic deletion of Pkd1 resulted in PKD and replicated characteristic features of human PKD including aberrant mTOR activation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis, and progressive fibrosis. Treatment with rapamycin was highly effective: It reduced cyst growth, preserved renal function, inhibited epithelial cell proliferation, increased apoptosis of cyst-lining cells, and inhibited fibrosis. These data provide in vivo evidence that rapamycin is effective in a human-orthologous mouse model of PKD.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) lead to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a leading cause of renal failure for which no treatment is available. PC1 is an integral membrane protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that membrane-anchored PC1 activates STAT3 in a JAK2-dependent manner, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC1 can undergo proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation. Tail-cleavage abolishes the ability of PC1 to directly activate STAT3 but the cleaved PC1 tail now coactivates STAT3 in a mechanism requiring STAT phosphorylation by cytokines or growth factors. This leads to an exaggerated cytokine response. Hence, PC1 can regulate STAT activity by a dual mechanism. In ADPKD kidneys PC1 tail fragments are overexpressed, including a unique \u223c15-kDa fragment (P15). STAT3 is strongly activated in cyst-lining epithelial cells in human ADPKD, and orthologous and nonorthologous polycystic mouse models. STAT3 is also activated in developing, postnatal kidneys but inactivated in adult kidneys. These results indicate that STAT3 signaling is regulated by PC1 and is a driving factor for renal epithelial proliferation during normal renal development and during cyst growth.",

        "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a most common genetic cause of chronic renal failure, is characterized by the progressive development and enlargement of cysts in kidneys and other organs. The cystogenic process is highly complex and involves a high proliferative rate, increased apoptosis, altered protein sorting, changed secretory characteristics, and disorganization of the extracellular matrix. ADPKD is caused by mutations in the genes encoding polycystin-1 (PC-1) or polycystin-2 (PC-2). PC-1 undergoes multiple cleavages that intervene in several signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation mechanisms. One of these cleavages releases the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PC-1. In addition, the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of PC-1 and PC-2 interact in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature that suggests that PC-1 and PC-2 may function through a common signaling pathway necessary for normal tubulogenesis. We hope that a better understanding of PC-1 and PC-2 protein function will lead to progress in diagnosis and treatment for ADPKD.",

        "abstract": "Polycystin-1 (PC1) mutations result in proliferative renal cyst growth and progression to renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was shown to be activated in cyst-lining cells in ADPKD and PKD mouse models and may drive renal cyst growth, but the mechanisms leading to persistent STAT3 activation are unknown. A proteolytic fragment of PC1 corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail, PC1-p30, is overexpressed in ADPKD. Here, we show that PC1-p30 interacts with the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, resulting in Src-dependent activation of STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation. The PC1-p30-mediated activation of Src/STAT3 was independent of JAK family kinases and insensitive to the STAT3 inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. Signaling by the EGF receptor (EGFR) or cAMP amplified the activation of Src/STAT3 by PC1-p30. Expression of PC1-p30 changed the cellular response to cAMP signaling. In the absence of PC1-p30, cAMP dampened EGFR- or IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3; in the presence of PC1-p30, cAMP amplified Src-dependent activation of STAT3. In the polycystic kidney (PCK) rat model, activation of STAT3 in renal cystic cells depended on vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) signaling, which increased cAMP levels. Genetic inhibition of vasopressin expression or treatment with a pharmacologic V2R inhibitor strongly suppressed STAT3 activation and reduced renal cyst growth. These results suggest that PC1, via its cleaved cytoplasmic tail, integrates signaling inputs from EGFR and cAMP, resulting in Src-dependent activation of STAT3 and a proliferative response.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induces the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-\u03baB) and cytokine expression in gastric epithelial cells. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat) cascade is the inflammatory signaling in various cells. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether H. pylori-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) are mediated by the activation of Jak1/Stat3 in gastric epithelial (AGS) cells. Thus, gastric epithelial AGS cells were infected with H. pylori in Korean isolates (HP99) at bacterium/cell ratio of 300:1, and the level of IL-8 in the medium was determined by enzyme-linked immonosorbent assay. Phospho-specific and total forms of Jak1/Stat3 and I\u03baB\u03b1 were assessed by Western blot analysis, and NF-\u03baB activation was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results showed that H. pylori induced the activation of Jak1/Stat3 and IL-8 production, which was inhibited by a Jak/Stat3 specific inhibitor AG490 in AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. H. pylori-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, determined by phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB-DNA binding activity, were inhibited by AG490. In conclusion, Jak1/Stat3 activation may mediate the activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of IL-8 in H. pylori-infected AGS cells. Inhibition of Jak1/Stat3 may be beneficial for the treatment of H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation, since the activation of NF-\u03baB is inhibited and inflammatory cytokine expression is suppressed.",

        "abstract": "Research is increasingly focusing on gut inflammation as a contributor to Parkinson's disease (PD). Such gut inflammation is proposed to arise from a complex interaction between various genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, however these factors are under-characterized. This study investigated the association between PD and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes responsible for binding of bacterial metabolites and intestinal homeostasis, which have been implicated in intestinal infections or inflammatory bowel disease. A case-control analysis was performed utilizing the following cohorts: (i) patients from the Australian Parkinson's Disease Registry (APDR) (n = 212); (ii) a Caucasian subset of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort (n = 376); (iii) a combined control group (n = 404). The following SNPs were analyzed: PGLYRP2 rs892145, PGLYRP4 rs10888557, TLR1 rs4833095, TLR2 rs3804099, TLR4 rs7873784, CD14 rs2569190, MUC1 rs4072037, MUC2 rs11825977, CLDN2 rs12008279 and rs12014762, and CLDN4 rs8629. PD risk was significantly associated with PGLYRP4 rs10888557 genotype in both cohorts. PGLYRP2 rs892145 and TLR1 rs4833095 were also associated with disease risk in the APDR cohort, and TLR2 rs3804099 and MUC2 rs11825977 genotypes in the PPMI cohort. Interactive risk effects between PGLYRP2/PGLYRP4 and PGLYRP4/TLR2 were evident in the APDR and PPMI cohorts, respectively. In the APDR cohort, the PGLYRP4 GC genotype was significantly associated with age of symptom onset, independently of gender, toxin exposure or smoking status. This study demonstrates that genetic variation in the bacterial receptor PGLYRP4 may modulate risk and age-of-onset in idiopathic PD, while variants in PGLYRP2, TLR1/2, and MUC2 may also influence PD risk. Overall, this study provides evidence to support the role of dysregulated host-microbiome signaling and gut inflammation in PD, and further investigation of these SNPs and proteins may help identify people at risk of developing PD or increase understanding of early disease mechanisms.",

However, neuropathology changes and motor deficits were observed starting at 6 months old. Similar changes in altered gut microbiota were also observed in another PD genetic mouse model carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation at 2 months old. Among the commonly enriched gut microbiota in both PD genetic mouse models, the abundance of Parabateroides Merdae and Ruminococcus torques were also increased in human PD patients compared to controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings revealed the altered gut microbiota communities and oscillations preceding the occurrence of neuropathy and motor dysfunction in the PD process.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the relationship between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, which is closely related to the source paper's focus on gut homeostasis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The paper's findings on early dysbiosis and dampened gut microbe oscillation preceding motor dysfunction and neuropathology in animal models of Parkinson's disease build upon the source paper's hypothesis that dysregulated host-microbiome signaling and gut inflammation contribute to Parkinson's disease."

        "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that \u2010\u2010Parkinson's disease (PD) may be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract, before manifesting in the central nervous system. In this respect, it was demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin from gram\u2010negative bacteria, accelerates the in vitro formation of \u03b1\u2010synuclein (aSyn) fibrils, whose intracellular deposits is a histological hallmark of the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Herein, N\u2010terminal acetylation and missense mutations of aSyn (A30P, A53T, E46K, H50Q and G51D) linked to rare, early\u2010onset forms of familial PD were investigated regarding their effect on aSyn aggregation stimulated by either LPS or small unilamellar lipid vesicles (SUVs). Our findings indicated that LPS as well as SUVs induce the fibrillation of N\u2010terminally acetylated wild\u2010type aSyn (Ac\u2010aSyn\u2010WT) more remarkably than the non\u2010acetylated protein, while the LPS\u2010free protein alone did not undergo fibrillation under our assay conditions. In addition, with the exception of A30P, PD mutations increased the fibrillation of Ac\u2010aSyn in the presence of LPS compared with Ac\u2010aSyn\u2010WT. The most pronounced effect of LPS was noticed for A53T, as observed when either Thioflavin\u2010T or JC\u20101 were used as fluorescent probes for fibrils. Overall, our results suggest for the first time the existence of a synergy between LPS and PD mutations/N\u2010terminal acetylation toward aSyn fibrillation.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the relationship between bacterial endotoxins, lipid vesicles, and \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation in the context of Parkinson's disease. Although it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it does investigate the gastrointestinal origin of PD, which is related to the source paper's discovery of altered gut microbiota preceding neuropathy and motor dysfunction in PD. Therefore, the key hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper."
