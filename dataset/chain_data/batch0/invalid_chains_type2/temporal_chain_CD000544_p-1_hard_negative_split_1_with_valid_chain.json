        "abstract": "For decades sulphasalazine has been the only valuable non-corticosteroid drug in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Then Truelove et al showed that the pharmacologically active moiety in sulphasalazine for the treatment of this disease was 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).' This resulted in new 5-ASA formulations for topical and oral use. 5-ASA enemas and suppositories seem to have the same efficacy as topical corticosteroids in active distal ulcerative colitis.2 3 Sulphasalazine is not as effective as corticosteroids for the treatment of widespread active disease, and there is no evidence that any of the newer salicylates is better in this respect.4 Because extensive, active ulcerative colitis must be treated aggressively so that it does not become severe and require surgery, systemic corticosteroids are always the first alternative in these cases. Maintenance treatment is therefore the main indication for oral use of sulphasalazine and the new salicylates in ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis was unable to show that any of the new salicylates was more efficient than sulphasalazine.4 There are three factors to consider when choosing which drug to use: (1) effectiveness; (2) which formulation delivers 5-ASA to the colon with the fewest systemic effects; and (3) safety. The formulations and sites of 5-ASA release of various new 5-ASA based drugs are shown in the Table.",

        "abstract": "This study quantified and characterised changes to a species level for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from colonic biopsies of acute ulcerative colitis (UC) comparing them with that of a normal control group. Fresh endoscopic biopsies of the recto\u2013sigmoid region were obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy from 10 patients suffering an acute attack of UC and a similar number of healthy controls. Quantitative estimation was carried out on selective media for total aerobic, anaerobic, Bacteroides , Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. (Miles\u2013Misra). Species identification involved gram stain, indole, catalase tests and commercially validated anaerobic, gram-positive and non-enteric fermenting enzyme hydrolysis kits. There was a significant quantitative decrease in growth of Lactobacillus spp. in colitic biopsies (p<0.05). Total aerobic speciation revealed 32 different sub-species with 18 of these found only in UC biopsies. Anaerobic speciation revealed 41 different sub-species with a mean 6.7 species in normal and 4.7 in UC patients. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was isolated in significantly increased frequency in UC biopsies (8:10) in comparison with normal (4:10). Our data are consistent with the possibility that a reduction in mucosally associated Lactobacillus bacteria in UC permits proliferation of a large number of potentially pathogenic aerobic species and anaerobic predominance of B. thetaiotaomicron .

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is able to bind the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and thus potentially restrict its rapid absorption from the intestine. In this study we investigated the potential of GG to reduce AFB1 availability in vitro in Caco-2 cells adapted to express cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, such that both transport and toxicity could be assessed. Caco-2 cells were grown as confluent monolayers on transmembrane filters for 21 days prior to all studies. AFB1 levels in culture medium were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. In CYP 3A4-induced monolayers, AFB1 transport from the apical to the basolateral chamber was reduced from 11.1% \u00b1 1.9% to 6.4% \u00b1 2.5% (P = 0.019) and to 3.3% \u00b1 1.8% (P = 0.002) within the first hour in monolayers coincubated with GG (1 \u00d7 1010 and 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml, respectively). GG (1 \u00d7 1010 and 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml) bound 40.1% \u00b1 8.3% and 61.0% \u00b1 6.0% of added AFB1 after 1 h, respectively. AFB1 caused significant reductions of 30.1% (P = 0.01), 49.4% (P = 0.004), and 64.4% (P < 0.001) in transepithelial resistance after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Coincubation with 1 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml GG after 24 h protected against AFB1-induced reductions in transepithelial resistance at both 24 h (P = 0.002) and 48 h (P = 0.04). DNA fragmentation was apparent in cells treated only with AFB1 cells but not in cells coincubated with either 1 \u00d7 1010 or 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml GG. GG reduced AFB1 uptake and protected against both membrane and DNA damage in the Caco-2 model. These data are suggestive of a beneficial role of GG against dietary exposure to aflatoxin.",

        "abstract": "Interest in the bacterial protective effect against mycotoxins has greatly increased. This effect is mostly strain-dependent and the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. The objectives of this work were (1) to assess the ability of Lactobacillus casei Shirota to bind aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by fluorescent monoclonal antibody staining, (2) to evaluate the AFB1-bacteria interaction by atomic force microscopy, and (3) to determine its effect on intestinal absorption through detection of AFB1-Lys adducts used as biological markers to a 3-week aflatoxin exposure in a murine model. The micrographs obtained in this work showed for the first time a clear visual image of the ability of Lactobacillus casei Shirota to bind AFB1 into the bacterial cell envelope. The images also revealed that aflatoxin binding produces structural changes that modify the bacterial cell surface. AFB1-Lys adducts quantified from blood samples were found to be present at significantly lower levels in animals receiving AFB1 plus bacteria than in those receiving only AFB1. This suggests that the presence of Lactobacillus casei Shirota can decrease aflatoxin absorption at the intestinal level even after a long period of toxin exposure, which consequently circumvents its toxic effects.Abstract(1) Lactobacillus casei Shirota B1 (AFB1) (2) AFB1-(3) 3 AFB1-Lys Lactobacillus casei Shirota AFB1 AFB1-Lys AFB1-Lys Lactobacillus casei ShirotaR\u00e9sum\u00e9L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet protecteur des bact\u00e9ries contre les mycotoxines a consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9.

Levels of AFB1 of 20 and 50 ng g\u22121 were used to determine the binding capacity of different concentrations of CA alone and in the presence of yeast strains, as well as toxin desorption, under gastrointestinal conditions. The viability of yeasts in the presence of CA was evaluated. The results show that the CA did not affect the viability of the yeast strains assayed. CA alone showed a low percentage adsorption. At 20 and at 50 ng g\u22121, CA was highly efficient in adsorbing AFB1 when combined with RC016 and RC012 strains respectively. Desorption of AFB1 by CA alone and in combination with the yeasts increased with increasing levels of CA. The results demonstrate the improvement of CA in AFB1 adsorption once it is mixed with live yeasts. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "Mycotoxins are harmful contaminants of food and feed worldwide. Feed additives with the abilities to trap mycotoxins are considered substances which regulate toxin transfer from feed to tissue, reducing its absorption in animal digestive tract. Market analysis emphasizes growing interest of feed producers in mycotoxins binders obtained from yeast biomass. The aim of the study was to prescreen cell walls (CW) and \u03b2(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan (\u03b2-G) preparations isolated from Candida utilis ATCC 9950 cultivated on waste potato juice water with glycerol as adsorbents for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), zearalenone (ZEN), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin (T-2) and fumonisin B1 (FB1). The adsorption was studied in single concentration tests at pH 3.0 and 6.0 in the presence of 1% of the adsorbent and 500 ng/mL of individual toxin. Evaluated CW and \u03b2-G preparations had the potential to bind ZEN, OTA and AFB1 rather than DON, NIV, T-2 toxin and FB1. The highest percentage of adsorption (about 83%), adsorption capacity (approx. 41 \u00b5g/ g preparation) and distribution coefficient (458.7mL/g) was found for zearalenone when CW preparation was used under acidic conditions. Higher protein content in CW and smaller particles sizes of the formulation could influence more efficient binding of ZEN, OTA, DON and T-2 toxin at appropriate pH compared to purified \u03b2-G. Obtained results show the possibility to transform the waste potato juice water into valuable Candida utilis ATCC 9950 preparation with mycotoxins adsorption properties. Further research is important to improve the binding capacity of studied preparations by increasing the active surface of adsorption.",

Three hundred and sixty 26-week-old Roman laying hens were randomly allocated into four experimental groups with 10 replicates of nine birds each. The four groups received either a basal diet (BD; Control), a BD supplemented with 0.15 mg/kg AFB1 + 1.5 mg/kg DON + 0.12 mg/kg OTA (Toxins), a BD + Toxins with Toxo-HP binder (Toxins + HP), or a BD + Toxins with TOXO XL binder (Toxins + XL) for 12 weeks. Compared to the control, dietary supplementation of mycotoxins decreased (P < 0.10) total feed intake, total egg weight, and egg-laying rate, but increased feed/egg ratio by 2.5\u20136.1% and mortality during various experimental periods. These alterations induced by mycotoxins were alleviated by supplementation with both TOXO HP and XL binders (P < 0.10). Furthermore, dietary mycotoxins reduced (P < 0.05) eggshell strength by 12.3% and caused an accumulation of 249 \u03bcg/kg of DON in eggs at week 12, while dietary supplementation with TOXO HP or XL mitigated DON-induced changes on eggshell strength and prevented accumulation of DON in eggs (P < 0.05). Moreover, dietary mycotoxins increased relative liver weight, but decreased spleen and proventriculus relative weights by 11.6\u201322.4% (P < 0.05). Mycotoxin exposure also increased alanine aminotransferase activity and reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgM, and IgG concentrations in serum by 9.2\u201326.1% (P < 0.05). Additionally, mycotoxin exposure induced histopathological damage and reduced villus height, villus height/crypt depth, and crypt depth in duodenum, jejunum and (or) ileum (P < 0.05). Notably, most of these histological changes were mitigated by supplementation with both TOXO HP and XL (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the mycotoxin binders TOXO HP and XL can help to mitigate the combined effects of AFB1, DON, and OTA on laying hen performance, egg quality, and health.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the effects of modified montmorillonite (MMT, copper loading) on the growth performance, gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, antioxidative capacity and immune function of broilers. Yellow-feathered broilers were randomly divided into control (CTR), modified montmorillonite (MMT), and antibiotic (ANTI) groups. Results revealed that MMT supplementation increased the BW and ADG and decreased the F/R during the 63-day experiment period. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that MMT modulated the cecal microbiota composition of broilers by increasing the relative abundance of two phyla (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) and two genera (Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium) and decreasing the abundance of genus Olsenella. MMT also improved the intestinal epithelial barrier indicated by the up-regulated mRNA expression of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 and the increased length of microvilli in jejunum and the decreased levels of DAO and D-LA in serum. In addition, MMT enhanced the immune function indicated by the increased levels of immunoglobulins, the decreased levels of MPO and NO, the down-regulated mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, and the up-regulated mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-10. Moreover, MMT down-regulated the expression of jejunal TLRs/MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-related genes (TLR2, TLR4, Myd88, TRAF6, NF-\u03baB, and iNOS) and related proteins (TRAF6, p38, ERK, NF-\u03baB, and iNOS). In addition, MMT increased the antioxidant enzyme activities and the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway-related genes and thereby decreased the apoptosis-related genes expression. Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis revealed that Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Olsenella were related to the inflammatory index (MPO and NO), oxidative stress (T-AOC, T-SOD, and CAT) and intestinal integrity (D-LA and DAO). Taken together, MMT supplementation improved the growth performance of broilers by modulating intestinal microbiota, enhancing the intestinal barrier function, and improving inflammatory response, which might be mediated by inhibiting the TLRs/MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and antioxidative capacity mediated by the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the effects of modified montmorillonite on broilers, which is a different mycotoxin binder compared to the source paper's focus on TOXO HP and XL. However, the paper's findings on the modulation of intestinal microbiota and enhancement of intestinal barriers are related to the source paper's results on the mitigation of mycotoxin-induced changes in laying hens."

        "abstract": "Montmorillonite (MMT), a natural absorbent agent, has widely been accepted for its antidiarrhea function in human and farm animals; however, its specific physicochemical property limits its biological function in practical use. In the current study, raw MMT was loaded by andrographolide, namely andrographolide loaded montmorillonite (AGP-MMT). The microstructure of AGP-MMT was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effect of AGP-MMT on the growth performance, intestinal barrier and inflammation was investigated in an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenged mice model. The results show that the microstructure of MMT was obviously changed after andrographolide modification: AGP-MMT exhibited a large number of spheroid particles, and floccule aggregates, but lower interplanar spacing compared with MMT. ETEC infection induced body weight losses and intestinal barrier function injury, as indicated by a lower villus height and ratio of villus height/crypt depth, whereas the serum levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D-xylose and ETEC shedding were higher in the ETEC group compared with the CON group. Mice pretreated with AGP-MMT showed alleviated body weight losses and the intestinal barrier function injury induced by ETEC challenge. The villus height and the ratio of villus height/crypt depth, were higher in mice pretreated with AGP-MMT than those pretreated with equal levels of MMT. Pretreatment with AGP-MMT also alleviated the increased concentration of serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and the corresponding genes in the jejunum induced by ETEC infection in mice. The protein and mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 were lower in mice pretreated with AGP-MMT than those with equal levels of MMT. The results indicate that AGP-MMT was more effective in alleviating intestinal barrier injury and inflammation in mice with ETEC challenge than MMT.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper. Both papers investigate the effects of modified montmorillonite on intestinal health, with the source paper exploring its impact on broilers and this paper examining its effects on a mouse model. The use of montmorillonite as a treatment for intestinal health issues is a common thread between the two papers, indicating a dependency on the source paper's findings."
