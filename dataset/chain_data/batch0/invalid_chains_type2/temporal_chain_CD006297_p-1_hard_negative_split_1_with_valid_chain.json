        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. Its goals of therapy are to eliminate the symptoms of hyperglycaemia, reduce the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications and allow the patients to achieve a normal life-style. Basal insulin replacement for insulin dependent patients can be achieved with either intermediate or long acting insulin preparations.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of intermediate acting versus long acting insulin preparations for basal insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, as well as reference lists, databases of ongoing trials, and requests from authors of included trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials, assessing long acting insulin preparations compared to intermediate acting insulin preparations, in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo reviewers independently scanned the titles. Data were extracted and analysed accordingly.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nTwenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified. A total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively, were analysed. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the level of glycosylated haemoglobin was -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.04) in favour of the long acting insulin arm. The WMD between the groups in fasting plasma and blood glucose levels was -0.63 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.40) and -0.86 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.72) in favour of the long acting insulins. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulin to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. The OR for severe hypoglycaemic episodes was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), and 0.70 (95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79) for nocturnal episodes. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups for hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow up days was -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.65), -0.0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and -0.40 (95% CI -0.45 to -0.34) for overall, severe, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Weight gain was more prominent in the control group. No difference was noted in the quantity or quality of severe adverse events or deaths.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLong acting insulin preparations seem to exert a beneficial effect on nocturnal glucose levels. Their effect on the overall diabetes control is clinically unremarkable. Their use as a basal insulin regimen for type 1 diabetes mellitus warrants further substantiation.",

        "title": "Are bedtime nutritional strategies effective in preventing nocturnal hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes?",
        "abstract": "Hypoglycaemia remains the major limiting factor for adequate diabetes control for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), especially during the night\u2010time. Although nutritional strategies for nocturnal hypoglycaemia (NH) prevention are regularly suggested in clinical practice, there is no evidence\u2010based recommendation for the usefulness and optimal composition of a bedtime snack. The aim of this narrative review was to analyse the current state of knowledge on nutritional strategies to prevent NH in individuals with T1D. A literature search was conducted, using PubMed and Medline (1946 to 2013); 16 studies were retrieved. Overall, the level of evidence was low. Results indicated that a calibrated bedtime snack based on bedtime blood glucose (BG) level could be effective to reduce NH occurrence for patients treated with human or animal insulin (short\u2010acting combined with lente, ultralente and/or intermediate\u2010acting insulin), but there is no evidence for patients treated with insulin analogues as part of multiple daily injections or insulin pump regimen. Some evidence suggests that including uncooked cornstarch or alanine in the bedtime snack composition could provide some benefits for the prevention of NH. Individualized recommendations of a bedtime snack intake for patients or situations at high risk for NH (long standing diabetes, hypoglycaemia unawareness, prior physical activity, alcohol consumption, bedtime BG close to hypoglycaemia threshold) appear as a prudent recommendation. On the basis of the available evidence, a bedtime snack cannot be recommended systematically but it might be useful if prescribed in an individualized fashion; further research is needed to evaluate these strategies.",

        "title": "The Effects of Basal Insulin Suspension at the Start of Exercise on Blood Glucose Levels During Continuous Versus Circuit-Based Exercise in Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes on Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExercise causes glycemic disturbances in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Continuous moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (CON) generally lowers blood glucose (BG) levels and often leads to hypoglycemia. In comparison, circuit-based exercise (CIRC) may attenuate the drop in BG. The goal of this study is to contrast the effects of basal insulin suspension at the onset of two different forms of exercise (CON vs. CIRC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwelve individuals (six men and six women) with T1D on insulin pump therapy were recruited for the study. All participants completed a maximal aerobic fitness test and two 40-min exercise sessions, consisting of either continuous treadmill walking or a circuit workout. Basal insulin infusion was stopped at the onset of exercise and resumed in recovery. After providing an initial reference value, volunteers were blinded to their [BG] and were asked to estimate their levels during exercise.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOxygen consumption (47.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 vs. 54.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5\u2009mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1, P\u2009=\u20090.03) and heart rate (122\u2009\u00b1\u200920 vs. 144\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009bpm, P\u2009=\u20090.003) were lower in CON vs. CIRC. Despite the lower workload, BG levels dropped more with CON vs. CIRC (delta BG\u2009=\u2009-3.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs. -0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0\u2009mmol/L for CON vs. CIRC, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.001). Participants were able to estimate their BG more accurately during CON (r\u2009=\u20090.83) vs. CIRC (r\u2009=\u20090.33) based on a regression analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDespite a lower intensity of exercise, with full basal insulin suspension at the start of exercise, CON results in a larger drop in BG vs. CIRC. These findings have implications for single hormone-based artificial pancreas development for exercise. While this study does not negate the importance of frequent capillary BG monitoring during exercise, it does suggest that if persons are knowledgeable about their pre-exercise BG levels, they can accurately perceive the changes in BG during CON, but not during CIRC.",

        "title": "Improved Open-Loop Glucose Control With Basal Insulin Reduction 90 Minutes Before Aerobic Exercise in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes on Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To reduce exercise-associated hypoglycemia, individuals with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion typically perform basal rate reductions (BRRs) and/or carbohydrate feeding, although the timing and amount of BRRs necessary to prevent hypoglycemia are unclear. The goal of this study was to determine if BRRs set 90 min pre-exercise better attenuate hypoglycemia versus pump suspension (PS) at exercise onset. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Seventeen individuals completed three 60-min treadmill exercise (\u223c50% of VO2peak) visits in a randomized crossover design. The insulin strategies included 1) PS at exercise onset, 2) 80% BRR set 90 min pre-exercise, and 3) 50% BRR set 90 min pre-exercise. RESULTS Blood glucose level at exercise onset was higher with 50% BRR (191 \u00b1 49 mg/dL) vs. 80% BRR (164 \u00b1 41 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and PS (164 \u00b1 45 mg/dL; P < 0.001). By exercise end, 80% BRR showed the smallest drop (\u221231 \u00b1 58 mg/dL) vs. 50% BRR (\u221247 \u00b1 50 mg/dL; P = 0.04) and PS (\u221267 \u00b1 41 mg/dL; P < 0.001). With PS, 7 out of 17 participants developed hypoglycemia versus 1 out of 17 in both BRR conditions (P < 0.05). Following a standardized meal postexercise, glucose rose with PS and 50% BRR (both P < 0.05), but failed to rise with 80% BRR (P = 0.16). Based on interstitial glucose, overnight mean percent time in range was 83%, 83%, and 78%, and time in hypoglycemia was 2%, 1%, and 5% with 80% BRR, 50% BRR, and PS, respectively (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Overall, a 50\u201380% BRR set 90 min pre-exercise improves glucose control and decreases hypoglycemia risk during exercise better than PS at exercise onset, while not compromising the postexercise meal glucose control.",

        "abstract": "The artificial pancreas is a closed-loop insulin delivery system that automatically regulates glucose levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In-silico testing using simulation environments accelerates the development of better artificial pancreas systems. Simulation environments need an accurate model that captures glucose dynamics during exercise to simulate real-life scenarios. We proposed six variations of the Bergman Minimal Model to capture the physiological effects of moderate exercise on glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We estimated the parameters of each model with clinical data using a Bayesian approach and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The data consisted of measurements of plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and oxygen consumption collected from a study of 17 adults with type 1 diabetes undergoing aerobic exercise sessions. We compared the models based on the physiological plausibility of their parameters estimates and the deviance information criterion. The best model features (i) an increase in glucose effectiveness proportional to exercise intensity, and (ii) an increase in insulin action proportional to exercise intensity and duration. We validated the selected model by reproducing results from two previous clinical studies. The selected model accurately simulates the physiological effects of moderate exercise on glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes. This work offers an important tool to develop strategies for exercise management with the artificial pancreas.",

        "title": "New model of glucose-insulin regulation characterizes effects of physical activity and facilitates personalized treatment evaluation in children and adults with type 1 diabetes",
        "abstract": "Accurate treatment adjustment to physical activity (PA) remains a challenging problem in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. Exercise-driven effects on glucose metabolism depend strongly on duration and intensity of the activity, and are highly variable between patients. In-silico evaluation can support the development of improved treatment strategies, and can facilitate personalized treatment optimization. This requires models of the glucose-insulin system that capture relevant exercise-related processes. We developed a model of glucose-insulin regulation that describes changes in glucose metabolism for moderate- to high-intensity PA of short and prolonged duration. In particular, we incorporated the insulin-independent increase in glucose uptake and production, including glycogen depletion, and the prolonged rise in insulin sensitivity. The model further includes meal absorption and insulin kinetics, allowing simulation of everyday scenarios. The model accurately predicts glucose dynamics for varying PA scenarios in a range of independent validation data sets, and full-day simulations with PA of different timing, duration and intensity agree with clinical observations. We personalized the model on data from a multi-day free-living study of children with T1D by adjusting a small number of model parameters to each child. To assess the use of the personalized models for individual treatment evaluation, we compared subject-specific treatment options for PA management in replay simulations of the recorded data with altered meal, insulin and PA inputs. Author summary Exercise represents a cornerstone of diabetes management. Yet, many people with type 1 diabetes restrain from exercising, since it increases the risk for hypoglycemia and requires adjusted insulin treatment. The effect of exercise on blood glucose levels depends on exercise duration and intensity, but also varies strongly between individuals, making accurate adjustment a challenge. Mathematical models can help to better understand exercise physiology and to devise new treatment strategies. Here, we propose a model of glucose-insulin regulation that captures the effects of exercise on glucose metabolism and personalize it to individual children with type 1 diabetes, allowing subject-specific treatment assessment.",

        "abstract": "Exercise modulates metabolism by also acting on insulin sensitivity, being the biological response to insulin stimulation of target tissues. Among the available methods for insulin sensitivity quantification, an option is represented by mathematical-model interpretation of data from dynamic tests (i.e. administration of a glucose challenge). When using such methods, the requirements in terms of data samples in relation to the model characteristics are critical. Thus, starting from a modeling approach previously proposed in the literature to interpret data from oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the aim of this study was to provide a simplified procedure for a reliable (model-based) quantification of the effect of an exercise bout on insulin sensitivity without the need to repeat the full test, as the modelling approach otherwise would require. A mathematical model comprising five differential equations was exploited to estimate 13 unknown parameters, with a particular focus on the parameter kxgi, representing insulin sensitivity. The parameter kxgi and other indexes of insulin sensitivity (Matsuda, Cederholm, Stumvoll, OGIS120 and PREDIM) were assessed in a group of ten men who underwent a 75-gram OGTT before and after an exercise bout. Then, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between kxgi percentage changes before and after exercise and change in each of the other indexes, revealing Stumvoll as the most strongly correlated (\u03c1=0.83). Consequently, a linear regression model was set up to estimate kxgi after exercise from changes in the Stumvoll index (\u03b20=-7.1062, \u03b21=14.6745 for coefficients of the linear regression), thus eliminating the need of two full-protocol OGTT tests.",
