        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus low-dose aspirin has not been studied in a broad population of patients at high risk for atherothrombotic events.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 15,603 patients with either clinically evident cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors to receive clopidogrel (75 mg per day) plus low-dose aspirin (75 to 162 mg per day) or placebo plus low-dose aspirin and followed them for a median of 28 months. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rate of the primary efficacy end point was 6.8 percent with clopidogrel plus aspirin and 7.3 percent with placebo plus aspirin (relative risk, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.05; P=0.22). The respective rate of the principal secondary efficacy end point, which included hospitalizations for ischemic events, was 16.7 percent and 17.9 percent (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.995; P=0.04), and the rate of severe bleeding was 1.7 percent and 1.3 percent (relative risk, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.61 percent; P=0.09). The rate of the primary end point among patients with multiple risk factors was 6.6 percent with clopidogrel and 5.5 percent with placebo (relative risk, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.59; P=0.20) and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes also was higher with clopidogrel (3.9 percent vs. 2.2 percent, P=0.01). In the subgroup with clinically evident atherothrombosis, the rate was 6.9 percent with clopidogrel and 7.9 percent with placebo (relative risk, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.998; P=0.046).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this trial, there was a suggestion of benefit with clopidogrel treatment in patients with symptomatic atherothrombosis and a suggestion of harm in patients with multiple risk factors. Overall, clopidogrel plus aspirin was not significantly more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the rate of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Two-dimensional strain echocardiography detects early signs of left ventricular dysfunction; however, it is unknown whether myocardial strain analysis at rest in patients with suspected stable angina pectoris predicts the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and Results\u2014In total, 296 consecutive patients with clinically suspected stable angina pectoris, no previous cardiac history, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction were included. All patients were examined by 2-dimensional strain echocardiography, exercise ECG, and coronary angiography. Two-dimensional strain echocardiography was performed in the 3 apical projections. Peak regional longitudinal systolic strain was measured in 18 myocardial sites and averaged to provide global longitudinal peak systolic strain. Duke score, including ST-segment depression, chest pain, and exercise capacity, was used as the outcome of the exercise test. Patients with an area stenosis \u226570% in \u22651 epicardial coronary artery were categorized as having significant CAD (n=107). Global longitudinal peak systolic strain was significantly lower in patients with CAD compared with patients without (17.1\u00b12.5% versus 18.8\u00b12.6%; P<0.001) and remained an independent predictor of CAD after multivariable adjustment for baseline data, exercise test, and conventional echocardiography (odds ratio, 1.25 [P=0.016] per 1% decrease). Area under receiver operating characteristic curve for exercise test and global longitudinal peak systolic strain in combination was significantly higher than that for exercise test alone (0.84 versus 0.78; P=0.007). Furthermore, impaired regional longitudinal systolic strain identifies which coronary artery is stenotic. Conclusions\u2014In patients with suspected stable angina pectoris, global longitudinal peak systolic strain assessed at rest is an independent predictor of significant CAD and significantly improves the diagnostic performance of exercise test. Furthermore, 2-dimensional strain echocardiography seems capable of identifying high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Myocardium subtended by obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) may show reduced left ventricle (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS), as well as early systolic lengthening (ESL) before shortening; these can be measured at rest and may predict obstructive CAD. This study investigated whether baseline resting LV longitudinal strain measurements may be able to detect significant CAD in patients undergoing stress echocardiography (SE) and coronary angiography, who have normal resting wall motion. We selected patients with a clinical indication of coronary angiography who were previously referred for SE. Patients with known CAD, rest wall-motion (WM) abnormalities, or rhythm/conduction abnormalities were excluded. Speckle tracking strain analyses were retrospectively performed on digitally archived 2D video-loops, using vendor independent software. Peak GLS and duration of ESL were recorded. Diagnostic accuracy of each parameter to predict obstructive (\u226550%) CAD was assessed and multivariate logistic regression models fitted and compared. Eighty-two patients were enrolled and 49 had significant CAD by quantitative angiography. Patients with CAD were more often male (P=0.01) and more frequently presented with typical angina (P<0.01). Among rest and stress variables, GLS showed a Youden index of 0.665, while SE WM assessment showed a Youden index of 0.599. These were the only two parameters that remained predictive in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, rest GLS demonstrated comparable accuracy with stress-echo data for prediction of angiographically obstructive CAD; it also added significant CAD prediction when combined with clinical data, similar to SE WM assessment.",

        "title": "Longitudinal Strain at Rest does not Predict Stress Echo Results",
        "abstract": "Background: Stress echo shows ischemia as a transient regional motility disorder. The subjective visual analysis which is dependenton the operator\u2019s experience has prompted the search for a semiautomatic method to mitigate this limitation and improve thereliability and reproducibility of the test. This has generated a growing interest in the introduction of two-dimensional longitudinalstrain before, during and after stress echo. If useful, its assessment during the different stress stages would attenuate other limitations,such as the inability to achieve submaximal heart rate, difficult visualization of more subtle disorders and delay in imageacquisition, which increases false negative results.Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether longitudinal strain analysis at rest is able to predict the outcome of stressecho when there is no visual evidence of contractile disorders, and whether baseline longitudinal strain is different in patients withsignificant coronary artery disease compared with patients not presenting this disease (in their previous evaluation before the test).Methods: The study compared longitudinal strain results at rest in 62 patients with positive stress echo consecutively recruitedduring a 12-month period, half of whom underwent coronary angiography(Group A) and the other half did not undertake this study(Group B) versus a control group (Group C) with negative test and without coronary angiography.Results: Longitudinal strain showed no significant difference between groups A and B (-21.8%\u00b12.4% vs. -21.5% \u00b12.5%) and neitherbetween patients with positive test (Group A+B) versus Group C (-21.67 % \u00b12.4% vs. -21.9 %\u00b12.8%).Conclusions: Two-dimensional longitudinal strain did not predict stress echo results or the presence of significant coronary arterydisease in the group of patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography.",

        "title": "Long Term Prognostic Value of Contractile Reserve Assessed by Global Longitudinal Strain in Patients with Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis",
        "abstract": "Background. Left ventricle (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) at rest has shown prognostic value in patients (pts) with severe aortic stenosis (SAS). Contractile reserve (CR) during exercise stress echo (ESE) estimated via GLS (CR-GLS) could better stratify the asymptomatic patients who could benefit from early intervention. Aims. To determine the long-term prognostic value of CR-GLS in patients with asymptomatic SAS with an ESE without inducible ischemia. Additionally, to compare the prognostic value of CR assessed via ejection fraction (CR-EF) and CR-GLS. Methods. In a prospective, single-center, observational study between 2013 and 2019, 101 pts with asymptomatic SAS and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 55% were enrolled. CR was considered present with an exercise-rest increase in LVEF (Simpson\u2019s rule) \u2265 5 points and > 2 absolute points in GLS. Patients were assigned to 2 groups (G): G1: 56 patients with CR-GLS present; and G2: 45 patients CR-GLS absent. All patients were followed up. Results. G2 Patients were older, with lower exercise capability, less aortic valve area (AVA), a higher peak aortic gradient, and less LVEF (71.5% \u00b1 5.9 vs. 66.8% \u00b1 7.9; p = 0.002) and GLS (%) at exercise (G1: \u221222.2 \u00b1 2.8 vs. G2: \u221218.45 \u00b1 2.4; p = 0.001). During mean follow-up of 46.6 \u00b1 3.4 months, events occurred in 45 pts., with higher incidence in G2 (G2 = 57.8% vs. G1 = 42.2%, p < 0.01). At Cox regression analysis, CR-GLS was an independent predictor of major cardiovascular events (HR: 1.98, 95% CI 1.09\u20133.58, p = 0.025). Event-free survival was lower for patients with CR-GLS absent (log rank test p = 0.022). CR-EF was not outcome predictive (log rank test p 0.095). Conclusions: In patients with asymptomatic SAS, the absence of CR-GLS during ESE is associated with worse prognosis. Additionally, CR-GLS was a better predictor of events than CR-EF.",
