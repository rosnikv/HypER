        "abstract": "AIMS\nWe studied a novel sirolimus eluting stent with a bioabsorbable coating (SES) in >3 months old chronic total coronary occlusions (CTO).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nNinety-five patients were randomised to either BMS (n=47) or SES (n=48). The primary endpoints were late lumen loss (LLL) and in-segment restenosis (ISR) after six months. Secondary endpoints were target vessel revascularisation after six and 24 months. Occlusion length (37.6 mm), reference diameter (2.8 mm) as well as the stented segment (45.5 mm) were similar in both groups. Up until six months no death, myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis occurred in either group. Angiographic follow-up (45BMS/46SES): LLL 1.8 mm/0.77 mm (p<0.0001), ISR 60%/17.4% (p<0.0001). In-segment re-occlusion 15.5%/0% and TVR 53.3%/10.8% (p<0.0001). After 24 months: 1 BMS, 2 SES patients died; 0 BMS, 0 SES infarction; 0 BMS, 0 SES stent thrombosis and 3 BMS, 0 SES TVR between six and 24 months. Thus total TVR after 24 months was 60% for BMS and 10.8% for SES (p<0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe alternative sirolimus-coated stent was shown to reduce the relative risk of restenosis after six months by 71%, and of TVR after 24 months by 82%. Between six and 24 months, neither stent thrombosis occurred, nor repeat revascularisation was required in patients who received a SES.",

Among these, successful recanalization was obtained in 144 lesions (80.4%) with exclusive SES implantation in 104 lesions. The 9-12 months angiographic follow-up was executed in 85.5% of lesions with evidence of angiographic binary restenosis in 16.8% of lesions. Total stent length and number of stent implanted were recognized as independent predictors of restenosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-107.09, P = 0.02) and (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.39-23.55, P = 0.01), respectively.The 2-year clinical follow-up showed rates of target lesion revascularization, non-Q wave myocardial infarction, and total major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) of 11.1%, 2%, and 13.1%, respectively. Cox proportional-hazard analysis showed diabetes as independent predictor of MACEs (hazard ratio [HR] 4.832; 95% CI, 0.730-0.861; P = 0.028).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nData from this registry demonstrate the long-term efficacy and safety of SES implantation after complex CTOs recanalization.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nControlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART) or reverse CART techniques is the final step for percutaneous revascularization of coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO), but it still represents technical challenges and risk in interventional procedures.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nOur purpose was to utilize intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided reverse CART approach for percutaneous revascularization of CTO in our heart center, focusing on its safety, efficacy, and latest technical developments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom November 2006 to November 2012, 49 patients with CTO failed to antegrade and/or retrograde percutaneous revascularization of CTO from true lumen to true lumen were enrolled in and underwent IVUS guided reverse CART approach.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean J-CTO score of cases was 2.5. IVUS guidance was successfully implemented in 95.9%; IVUS identified that 61.7% of retrograde wires were located at intimal space, and 59.5% of antegrade wires were located at subintimal space. A Corsair channel dilator was used in 77.6% of cases. The success rates of technique and procedure were 95.9% and 93.9%, respectively; the technical minor complications were observed in 10.2% of cases, without significant clinic outcomes; 2.0% of cases occurred with a major adverse cardiac event of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; and no case occurred with target vessel revascularization or death. The mean length of stent implanted in a single CTO vessel was 51.3\u2009mm. No patient appeared with radiation dermatitis and contrast-induced rise of creatinine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIVUS guided reverse CART approach is effective and safe for percutaneous revascularization of complex CTO, with a high success and a low complication rate. It is feasible to develop this approach for percutaneous revascularization of complex CTO. However, suitable case selection and lately device handling by experienced operators are the crucial points of success.",

        "abstract": "Recanalization of chronic total occlusions (CTO) of coronary vessels is a catheter intervention with proven benefit for the patient. However, it incorporates a risk of penetrating the vessel as well as increasing patients exposure to radiation and contrast agent. The physicians expertise is a key to successful interventions. In this work, we present a system to assess haptic interaction of medical professionals in an CTO intervention. As a test scenario, a silicone model with comparable mechanic properties of a CTO, including fibrous caps and microchannels is used. A special guide wire with a diameter of 360 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7 and an integrated force sensor at the tip can measure intracorporal forces. Additionally, a torquer with an integrated single-axis force sensor is used to measure the forces executed by the cardiologist during the procedure. The guide wire motion is measured by two encoders (translational and rotatory) in order to assess motion-based quality criteria. A camera setup with software filtering is used to obtain an x-raylike image of the training scenario. Applied x-ray and contrast agent doses can be measured as well. The setup is intended to develop new training schemes based on interactions exerted by experts.",

        "abstract": "Robot-assisted intravascular interventions have evolved as unique treatments approach for cardiovascular diseases. However, the technology currently has low potentials for catheterization skill evaluation, slow learning curve, and inability to transfer experience gained from manual interventions. This study proposes a new weighting-based deep ensemble model for recognizing interventionalists' hand motions in manual and robotic intravascular catheterization. The model has a module of neural layers for extracting features in electromyography data, and an ensemble of machine learning methods for classifying interventionalists' hand gestures as one of the six hand motions used during catheterization. A soft-weighting technique is applied to guide the contributions of each base learners. The model is validated with electromyography data recorded during in-vitro and in-vivo trials and labeled as many-to-one sequences. Results obtained show the proposed model could achieve 97.52% and 47.80% recognition performances on test samples in the in-vitro and in-vivo data, respectively. For the latter, transfer learning was applied to update weights from the in-vitro data, and the retrained model was used for recognizing the hand motions in the in-vivo data. The weighting-based ensemble was evaluated against the base learners and the results obtained shows it has a more stable performance across the six hand motion classes. Also, the proposed model was compared with four existing methods used for hand motion recognition in intravascular catheterization. The results obtained show our model has the best recognition performances for both the in-vitro and in-vivo catheterization datasets. This study is developed toward increasing interventionalists' skills in robot-assisted catheterization.",

        "title": "Analyzing Surgeon\u2013Robot Cooperative Performance in Robot-Assisted Intravascular Catheterization",
        "abstract": "Robot-assisted catheterization offers a promising technique for cardiovascular interventions, addressing the limitations of manual interventional surgery, where precise tool manipulation is critical. In remote-control robotic systems, the lack of force feedback and imprecise navigation challenge cooperation between the surgeon and robot. This study proposes a manipulation-based evaluation framework to assess the cooperative performance between different operators and robot using kinesthetic, kinematic, and haptic data from multi-sensor technologies. The proposed evaluation framework achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.99% in assessing the cooperation between operator and robot. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of delay factors, considering no delay, constant delay, and variable delay, on cooperation characteristics. The findings suggest that variable delay contributes to improved cooperation performance between operator and robot in a primary-secondary isomorphic robotic system, compared to a constant delay factor. Furthermore, operators with experience in manual percutaneous coronary interventions exhibit significantly better cooperative manipulate on with the robot system than those without such experience, with respective synergy ratios of 89.66%, 90.28%, and 91.12% based on the three aspects of delay consideration. Moreover, the study explores interaction information, including distal force of tools-tissue and contact force of hand-control-ring, to understand how operators with different technical skills adjust their control strategy to prevent damage to the vascular vessel caused by excessive force while ensuring enough tension to navigate complex paths. The findings highlight the potential of variable delay to enhance cooperative control strategies in robotic catheterization systems, providing a basis for optimizing surgeon-robot collaboration in cardiovascular interventions.",
