        "title": "Frozen shoulder syndrome: comparison of oral route corticosteroid and intra-articular corticosteroid injection.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-six patients with frozen shoulder syndrome (Stage 2 and 3) were included in this study conducted at Dr. Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang, Indonesia and randomly allocated into 2 groups: 40 mg triamcinolone intra-articular injection and triamcinolone oral tablets. The result showed that triamcinolone intra-articular injection group \"cured\" rate was 5.8 times higher at week one compared to the triamcinolone tablet group. Sixty-two percent of the cases with triamcinolone intra-articular injection achieved their \"cured\" condition after one week of therapy, compared with only 14% of the triamcinolone tablets group. We conclude that, intra-articular corticosteroid injection provide faster improvement compared to oral route.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the effectiveness of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg) and methylprednisolone acetate (60 mg) in Iraqi patients with primary and secondary frozen shoulder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total number of 135 (93 males and 42 females) patients with frozen shoulder, allocated at outpatient clinic of rheumatology in Al-Yarmook Teaching Hospital (Baghdad-Iraq) from January 2004 to December 2005, were enrolled in non-controlled clinical trial. The diagnosis of frozen shoulder was made using the guidelines for shoulder complaint issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. Intraarticular injections of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (46 males and 22 females) or 60 mg methylprednisolone acetate (47 males and 20 females) were given every 3 weeks (not more than 3 injections) by using posterior route.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth triamcinolone acetonide (81.8%) and methylprednisolone acetate (83.3%) were equally effective in primary frozen shoulder. Triamcinolone acetonide is significantly improved diabetic frozen shoulder in comparison to methylprednisolone acetate (69% versus 39%). Also patients on triamcinolone acetonide required less number of steroid injections and higher percent of severe cases were significantly improved by triamcinolone acetonide in comparison with methylprednisolone acetate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that triamcinolone acetonide is a good rescue for painful stiff shoulder particularly for resistant cases as with diabetes mellitus, and with long duration of illness. Also, its efficacy can be observed with less frequent injections.",

        "explanation": "This paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper as it compares the effectiveness of different corticosteroids, including triamcinolone, in treating frozen shoulder. The source paper's findings on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injection provide a basis for this comparison."

        "title": "Methylprednisolone versus triamcinolone in painful shoulder using ultrasound-guided injection",
        "abstract": "There is little evidence about the comparative efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of painful shoulder. The main aim was to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MTP) versus triamcinolone (TMC) in the treatment of painful shoulder using an ultrasound-guided injection. Patients with painful shoulder due to subacromial bursitis and partial or full-thickness rotator cuff tears demonstrated by musculoskeletal ultrasound received a guided-injection of MTP acetate 40\u00a0mg (12 patients) or TMC acetonide 40\u00a0mg (12 patients). Range of motion and pain visual analogue scale were registered at 10 and 30 min, 1 and 2\u00a0weeks postinjection. Two weeks postinjection, both groups reported a mean improvement in range of motion (33%) and relief of pain (61%). Relief of pain of 50% or more was observed in 92% of patients in MTP group and 50% of TMC group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Two months postinjection, 50% of the patients in MTP group and 25% in TMC group reported total relief of pain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.3). Patients with painful shoulder receiving an ultrasound-guided injection of MTP or TMC have a rapid and sustained overall response. Relief of pain tends to be more rapid with MTP than TMC.",

        "title": "Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injections Versus Pulsed Radiofrequency in Painful Shoulder: A Prospective, Randomized, Single-blinded Study",
        "abstract": "ObjectiveChronic shoulder pain treatment is known to be a difficult and long process. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injection and pulse radiofrequency (PRF) applied to the suprascapular nerve in patients with shoulder pain. MethodsFifty patients with shoulder pain were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated into group 1 (intra-articular injection of corticosteroid) and group 2 (PRF to the suprascapular nerve). Outcome measures included a pain scale (visual analog scale; VAS), range of motion, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), the Short Form-36, Beck Depression Scale questionnaires, and paracetamol consumption. ResultsIn both groups, significant improvement was observed in all weeks in VAS, range of motion (active-passive), and SPADI subscores (P<0.05). Improvement was detected in most of the Short Form-36 scores at the end of the treatment in both groups (P<0.05), whereas no significant change was observed in Beck Depression Inventory score (P>0.05). When the groups were compared, a significant difference was found between the groups in favor of group 1 in terms of VAS at night in weeks 1, 4, and 12; VAS at rest in weeks 1 and 4; and VAS during movement in week 1 (P<0.05). There was also a significant difference in favor of group 1 observed in weeks 1, 4, and 12 in SPADI pain and total subscores (P<0.05). Paracetamol consumption was observed to be lower in group 1 (P<0.05). ConclusionsIntra-articular injection of corticosteroid and PRF applied to the suprascapular nerve are effective in the treatment of painful shoulder. When 2 treatments are compared, it may be concluded that intra-articular steroid injection was more effective especially in the first weeks regarding pain than the PRF. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in the prospective treatment guidelines.",

The paper investigates a different aspect of corticosteroid treatment, but it is still within the same domain of painful shoulder treatment."

        "abstract": "To the Editor:\n\nI read with great interest the article by Choi et al. \u21d3, describing a prospective study comparing pulsed radio frequency (pRF) of cervical dorsal root ganglion (DRG) treatment with transforaminal epidural steroid injections. They should be commended for their work and for reporting the dose they used.\n\nSince Cohen and Van Zundert \u21d3 gave their excellent editorial on pRF, there have been many other short reports, case series, prospective trials, and some randomized trials looking at pRF, including a nice review of both the physics behind pRF and a review of the data by Chua et al. \u21d3. These add to the already existing myriad of data on pRF. However, I take some exception to the statement that Choi et al. make in their section explaining their pRF technique. They state that in pRF, \u201cthe output is usually set at 45V.\u201d Although I \u2026",
