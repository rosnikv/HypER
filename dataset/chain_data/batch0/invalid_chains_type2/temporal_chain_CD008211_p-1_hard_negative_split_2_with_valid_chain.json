        "title": "Technical Considerations and Patient Comfort in Total Colonoscopy with and without a Transparent Cap: Initial Experiences from a Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS\nEven though colonoscopy was introduced 30 years ago, endoscopists still leave a small percentage of the colonic mucosal surface unexamined because of the limitations of the procedure, so there is still room for technical improvements. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of attaching a transparent cap to the tip of the colonoscope, partly to gather basic data and experience for planning a larger randomized study, and partly to evaluate any technical advantages or disadvantages, and also to appraise the patients' experiences.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn 50 consecutive patients examined by a single experienced endoscopist, a prospective pilot study was carried out comparing the use of a colonoscope fitted with a transparent cap (in half of the colonoscopies) with the use of an ordinary colonoscope without a cap (in the remaining 25 patients). The following parameters were recorded: indication for colonoscopy, time to reach the cecum, total time for the colonoscopy, findings, diagnosis, type of colonoscopy (diagnostic or therapeutic, partial or total, ileal intubation), the amount of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy, and complications. At the end of the examination and also before leaving the hospital, the patients were asked by a nurse to estimate pain experienced during the colonoscopy, using a visual analogue scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time for the procedure, the ability to perform a complete colonoscopy (including ileal intubation when it was medically relevant), and the complication rate turned out to be similar in both groups. There were no differences between the amounts of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy or between the patients' estimations of the pain experienced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe time to reach the cecum and the total time for the colonoscopy is the same with or without the cap, which is well tolerated by patients. Using the cap greatly facilitates the possibility of finding small polyps behind folds in the colon, because the folds can be straightened, thereby improving the view, although in this small pilot study it could not be proven that the number of polyps found was greater using a cap-fitted colonoscope.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Colonoscopy is an established method of colorectal cancer screening, but has an adenoma miss rate of 10\u201320%. Detection rates are expected to improve with optimised visualisation methods. This prospective randomised study evaluated narrow-band imaging (NBI), a new technique that may enhance image contrast in colon adenoma detection. Methods: Eligible patients presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to undergo wide-angle colonoscopy using either conventional high-resolution imaging or NBI during instrument withdrawal. The primary outcome parameter was the difference in the adenoma detection rate between the two techniques. Results: A total of 401 patients were included (mean age 59.4 years, 52.6% men). Adenomas were detected more frequently in the NBI group (23%) than in the control group (17%) with a number of 17 colonoscopies needed to find one additional adenoma patient; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.129). When the two techniques were compared in consecutive subgroups of 100 study patients, adenoma rates in the NBI group remained fairly stable, whereas these rates steadily increased in the control group (8%, 15%, 17%, and 26.5%, respectively). Significant differences in the first 100 cases (26.5% versus 8%; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) could not be maintained in the last 100 cases (25.5% versus 26.5%, p\u200a=\u200a0.91). Conclusions: The increased adenoma detection rate means of NBI colonoscopy were statistically not significant. It remains speculative as to whether the increasing adenoma rate in the conventional group may have been caused by a training effect of better polyp recognition on NBI.",

We sought to compare the performance of colonoscopy using a high-definition, wide-angle endoscope (HDE) versus a standard colonoscope (SC) for the detection of colorectal neoplasia.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nAll consecutive consenting adult patients referred from primary care centers were included and randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to undergo HDE or SC. Times to reach and withdraw from the cecum were measured. Morphology, size, location, and pathologic diagnosis of each polyp were recorded. Sample size calculation resulted in a total of 682 patients needed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 693 consecutive patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria (73 excluded owing to insufficient bowel preparation). Each arm included 310 patients with no baseline characteristic differences. Time to reach the cecum was slightly superior for SC (8.9 +/- 4.8 minutes vs 8.2 +/- 4.5 minutes; P = .055). Pathology examination was feasible in 418 lesions (272 adenomas, 109 hyperplastic polyps, and 37 inflammatory lesions). Both techniques detected a similar number and type of lesions, and there were no differences in the distribution along the colon, in the degree of dysplasia, or morphology of adenomas. The per-patient basis analyses demonstrated that there were no differences between the 2 arms of the study in the detection rates of polyps (SC, 0.84 +/- 1.59; HDE, 0.83 +/- 1.30), adenomas (0.45 +/- 1.07 vs 0.43 +/- 0.87), small adenomas (0.22 +/- 0.71 vs 0.28 +/- 0.78), flat adenomas (0.30 +/- 0.91 vs 0.21 +/- 0.63), or hyperplastic polyps (0.16 +/- 0.50 vs 0.18 +/- 0.54).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHDE did not detect significantly more colorectal neoplasia than SC.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nColonoscopy is the accepted gold standard for the detection of colorectal cancer. The aim of the current study was to prospectively compare high definition plus (HD+) colonoscopy with I-Scan functionality (electronic staining) vs. standard video colonoscopy. The primary endpoint was the detection of patients having colon cancer or at least one adenoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 220 patients due to undergo screening colonoscopy, postpolypectomy surveillance or with a positive occult blood test were randomized in a 1\u200a:\u200a1 ratio to undergo HD+ colonoscopy in conjunction with I-Scan surface enhancement (90i series, Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) or standard video colonoscopy (EC-3870FZK, Pentax). Detected colorectal lesions were judged according to type, location, and size. Lesions were characterized in the HD+ group by using further I-Scan functionality (p- and v-modes) to analyze pattern and vessel architecture. Histology was predicted and biopsies or resections were performed on all identified lesions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHD+ colonoscopy with I-Scan functionality detected significantly more patients with colorectal neoplasia (38\u200a%) compared with standard resolution endoscopy (13\u200a%) (200 patients finally analyzed; 100 per arm). Significantly more neoplastic (adenomatous and cancerous) lesions and more flat adenomas could be detected using high definition endoscopy with surface enhancement. Final histology could be predicted with high accuracy (98.6\u200a%) within the HD+ group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHD+ colonoscopy with I-Scan is superior to standard video colonoscopy in detecting patients with colorectal neoplasia based on this prospective, randomized, controlled trial.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo investigate if high-definition (HD) colonoscope with i-Scan gave a higher detection rate of mucosal lesions vs standard white-light instruments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were collected from the computerized database of the endoscopy unit of our tertiary referral center. We retrospectively analyzed 1101 consecutive colonoscopies that were performed over 1 year with standard white-light (n = 849) or HD+ with i-Scan (n = 252) instruments by four endoscopists, in an outpatient setting. Colonoscopy records included patients' main details and family history for colorectal cancer, indication for colonoscopy (screening, diagnostic or surveillance), type of instrument used (standard white-light or HD+ plus i-Scan), name of endoscopist and bowel preparation. Records for each procedure included whether the cecum was reached or not and the reason for failure, complications during or immediately after the procedure, and number, size, location and characteristics of the lesions. Polyps or protruding lesions were defined as sessile or pedunculated, and nonprotruding lesions were defined according to Paris classification. For each lesion, histological diagnosis was recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEight hundred and forty-nine colonoscopies were carried with the standard white-light video colonoscope and 252 with the HD+ plus i-Scan video colonoscope. The four endoscopists did 264, 300, 276 and 261 procedures, respectively; 21.6%, 24.0%, 21.7% and 24.1% of them with the HD+ plus i-Scan technique. There were no significant differences between the four endoscopists in either the number of procedures done or the proportions of each imaging technique used. Both techniques detected one or more mucosal lesions in 522/1101 procedures (47.4%). The overall number of lesions recognized was 1266; 645 in the right colon and 621 in the left. A significantly higher number of colonoscopies recognized lesions in the HD+ plus i-Scan mode (171/252 = 67.9%) than with the standard white-light technique (408/849 = 48.1%) (P < 0.0001). HD+ with i-Scan colonoscopies identified more lesions than standard white-light imaging (459/252 and 807/849, P < 0.0001), in the right or left colon (mean \u00b1 SD, 1.62 \u00b1 1.36 vs. 1.33 \u00b1 0.73, P < 0.003 and 1.55 \u00b1 0.98 vs. 1.17 \u00b1 0.93, P = 0.033), more lesions < 10 mm (P < 0.0001) or nonprotruding (P < 0.022), and flat polyps (P = 0.04). The cumulative mean number of lesions per procedure detected by the four endoscopists was significantly higher with HD+ with i-Scan than with standard white-light imaging (1.82 \u00b1 2.89 vs. 0.95 \u00b1 1.35, P < 0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHD imaging with i-Scan during the withdrawal phase of colonoscopy significantly increased the detection of colonic mucosal lesions, particularly small and nonprotruding polyps.",

The morphological characteristics of laryngopharyngeal lesions were analysed using high performance endoscopic systems equipped with narrow band imaging and autofluorescence imaging modes. The diagnostic effectiveness of white light image, narrow band imaging and autofluorescence imaging endoscopy for benign and malignant laryngopharyngeal lesions was evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUnder narrow band imaging endoscopy, the superficial microvessels of squamous cell carcinomas appeared as dark brown spots or twisted cords. Under autofluorescence imaging endoscopy, malignant lesions appeared as bright purple. The sensitivity of malignant lesion diagnosis was not significantly different between narrow band imaging and autofluorescence imaging modes, but was better than for white light image endoscopy (\u03c72 = 12.676, p = 0.002).

        "abstract": "A polymer probe based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers labelled with a fluorescent dye Dy-633 or Cy-7 and decorated with targeting oligopeptides GE-7 or GE-11, specific targeting ligands binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) highly expressed on surface of tumour cells, was designed, synthesised and characterised. Specific accumulation of the polymer probe in the tumour mass is a prerequisite for successful fluorescence-guided endoscopic surgery as the fluorescence signal from the malignant cells enables more precise resection of the tumour without damaging the healthy tissue. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy was used to assess the binding efficacy of the oligopeptide conjugates to EGFR on the cell membranes of the malignant cells. The results showed that the highest binding efficacy was achieved with polymers bearing the GE-11 targeting oligopeptide in human EGFR-positive hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu) and in breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231). Similarly, the polymer probes targeted by the GE-11 oligopeptidewere found in vivo as highly effective in tumour accumulation, as determined from fluorescence imaging. Indeed, the ex vivo cross-section of the tumours showed significant tumour border fluorescence proving the potential of the studied polymer probes. Moreover, the presence of the active targeting moiety on the polymer-drug conjugate should enable the use of such a conjugate as a targeted polymer system for treatment of solid tumours. Replacement of the fluorescent probe with a cytostatic drug provides a targeted polymer nanocancerostatic for advanced treatment of neoplastic diseases, thus the polymer probes have multiple functions.",

CSC-specific markers and signaling pathways highly active in CSCs have emerged as a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic targets associated with CSCs of solid tumors across various cancer types, including key molecular markers aldehyde dehydrogenases, CD44, epithelial cellular adhesion molecule, and CD133 and signaling pathways such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch, and Sonic Hedgehog. We discuss a wide array of therapeutic modalities ranging from targeted antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and near-infrared photoimmunotherapy to advanced genetic approaches like RNA interference, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, aptamers, antisense oligonucleotides, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, CAR natural killer cells, bispecific T cell engagers, immunotoxins, drug-antibody conjugates, therapeutic peptides, and dendritic cell vaccines. This review spans developments from preclinical investigations to ongoing clinical trials, highlighting the innovative targeting strategies that have been informed by CSC-associated pathways and molecules to overcome therapeutic resistance. We aim to provide insights into the potential of these therapies to revolutionize cancer treatment, underscoring the critical need for a multi-faceted approach in the battle against cancer.
