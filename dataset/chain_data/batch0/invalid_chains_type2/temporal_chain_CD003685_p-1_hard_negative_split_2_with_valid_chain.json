        "title": "Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEach year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.",

        "title": "Variability among nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTraditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding/perforation, but the magnitude of this effect for coxibs in the general population and the degree of variability between individual NSAIDs is still under debate. This study was undertaken to assess the risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation among users of individual NSAIDs and to analyze the correlation between this risk and the degree of inhibition of whole blood cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2 in vitro.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review of observational studies on NSAIDs and upper GI bleeding/perforation published between 2000 and 2008. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) estimates of upper GI bleeding/perforation for individual NSAIDs. Additionally, we verified whether the degree of inhibition of whole blood COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro by average circulating concentrations predicted the RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation was 4.50 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.82-5.31) for traditional NSAIDs and 1.88 (95% CI 0.96-3.71) for coxibs. RRs lower than that for NSAIDs overall were observed for ibuprofen (2.69 [95% CI 2.17-3.33]), rofecoxib (2.12 [95% CI 1.59-2.84]), aceclofenac (1.44 [95% CI 0.65-3.2]), and celecoxib (1.42 [95% CI 0.85-2.37]), while higher RRs were observed for ketorolac (14.54 [95% CI 5.87-36.04]) and piroxicam (9.94 [95% CI 5.99-16.50). Estimated RRs were 5.63 (95% CI 3.83-8.28) for naproxen, 5.57 (95% CI 3.94-7.87) for ketoprofen, 5.40 (95% CI 4.16-7.00) for indomethacin, 4.15 (95% CI 2.59-6.64) for meloxicam, and 3.98 (95% CI 3.36-4.72) for diclofenac. The degree of inhibition of whole blood COX-1 did not significantly correlate with RR of upper GI bleeding/perforation associated with individual NSAIDs (r(2) = 0.34, P = 0.058), but a profound and coincident inhibition (>80%) of both COX isozymes was associated with higher risk. NSAIDs with a long plasma half-life and with a slow-release formulation were associated with a greater risk than NSAIDs with a short half-life.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of our analysis demonstrate that risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation varies between individual NSAIDs at the doses commonly used in the general population. Drugs that have a long half-life or slow-release formulation and/or are associated with profound and coincident inhibition of both COX isozymes are associated with a greater risk of upper GI bleeding/perforation.",

        "abstract": "Conventional medical treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis includes the use of NSAIDs (traditional and selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase [COX]-2), because they provide unmistakable and significant health benefits in the treatment of pain and inflammation. However, they are associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) adverse events. Both beneficial and adverse effects are due to the same mechanism of action, which is inhibition of COX-dependent prostanoids. Since CV and GI risk are related to drug exposure, a reduction in the administered dose is recommended. However, this strategy will not eliminate the hazard owing to a possible contribution of individual genetic background. Further studies will be necessary to develop genetic and/or biochemical markers predictive of the CV and GI risk of NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Further understand the safety profile of celecoxib and provide safety information for important adverse events (AEs). Methods: Analysis of randomized controlled trials from the Pfizer clinical trial repository (final study reports completed by 31 July 2011) in which celecoxib was compared with placebo or non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) for treatment of pain or inflammation in adults. Safety end points comprised 18 terms that had been identified as important AEs among all NSAIDs. Results: There was a greater risk of edema (risk difference (95% confidence interval) 0.77% (0.45, 1.09)); hypertension (0.28% (-0.01, 0.57)); angioedema (0.16% (-0.06, 0.39) and allergic reactions (0.15% (-0.10, 0.40)) with celecoxib than with placebo, while a greater risk of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage (-0.15% (-0.47, 0.16)) was seen with placebo. There was a greater risk of GI hemorrhage (-0.53% (-0.72, -0.33)), GI ulceration (-0.46% (-0.60, -0.33)), edema (-0.62% (-0.89, -0.35)) and hypertension (-0.57% (-0.82, -0.33)) with nsNSAIDs than with celecoxib. Conclusions: The magnitude of risks associated with NSAIDs is small and similar in celecoxib-, nsNSAID- and placebo-treated patients. This analysis provides safety information that will allow physicians to make informed treatment decisions for patients who are appropriate candidates for celecoxib use.",

Methods: We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.11), PubMed (1966-2017.11), Embase (1980-2017.11), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.11), and the Cochrane Library (1900-2017.11) for randomized clinical trials comparing the use of methylprednisolone to treat knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores and WOMAC function scores. Each outcome was combined and calculated using the statistical software STATA 12.0. Fixed/random effect model was adopted based on the heterogeneity tested by I2 statistic. Results: A total of 739 patients were analyzed across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the WOMAC pain scores at 4 weeks (WMD = \u22121.384, 95% CI: \u22121.975 to \u22120.793, P\u200a=\u200a.000), 12 weeks (WMD\u200a=\u200a\u22121.587, 95% CI: \u22122.489 to \u22120.685, P\u200a=\u200a.001), and 24 weeks (WMD\u200a=\u200a\u22121.563, 95% CI: \u22122.245 to \u22120.881, P\u200a=\u200a.000).

        "abstract": "Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Objectives The aims of the study were to clarify the evidence on the magnitude and duration of treatment effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis compared with placebo, to evaluate a treatment effect by steroid type, and to describe the reported adverse effects. Design Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. The risk of systematic bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s domain-based evaluation framework. Results The final sample included eight randomized controlled studies with follow-ups from 1 to 26 wks. The risk of systematic bias was considered low in five and high in three studies. The pooled standardized mean difference was \u22120.58 (95% confidence interval = \u22120.88 to \u22120.27) and number needed to treat 5.1 (95% confidence interval = 10.0 to 3.7). The heterogeneity was considerable. The pooled effect size approached the level of statistical insignificance at 4 mos. The pooled risk ratio of adverse effects was insignificant 0.95 (95% confidence interval = 0.34 to 2.55). Conclusions The intra-articular corticosteroid had a mild to moderate effect on pain severity up to 3 mos after the injection\u2014much longer than it had previously been reported. The effect may vary substantially in different patient groups and appropriate patient selection is important. The risk of adverse effects was low.",

        "title": "Molecular-Morphological Relationships of the Scaffold Protein FKBP51 and Inflammatory Processes in Knee Osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting the adult population. OA is no longer thought to come from a purely biomechanical origin but rather one that has been increasingly recognized to include a persistent low-grade inflammatory component. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACSI) have become a widely used method for treating pain in patients with OA as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, as the disease progresses, IACSI become ineffective. FKBP51 is a regulatory protein of the glucocorticoid receptor function and have been shown to be dysregulated in several pathological scenario\u2019s including chronic inflammation. Despite of these facts, to our knowledge, there are no previous studies of the expression and possible role of FKBP51 in OA. We investigated by double and triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy the cellular and subcellular expression of FKBP51 and its relations with inflammation factors in osteoarthritic knee joint tissues: specifically, in the tibial plateau knee cartilage, Hoffa\u2019s fat pad and suprapatellar synovial tissue of the knee. Our results show co-expression of FKBP51 with TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CD31 and CD34 in OA chondrocytes, synovial membrane cells and adipocytes in Hoffa\u2019s fat pad. FKBP51 is also abundant in nerve fibers within the fat pad. Co-expression of FKBP51 protein with these markers may be indicative of its contribution to inflammatory processes and associated chronic pain in OA.",

        "title": "Mitochondrial-nuclear communication by FKBP51 shuttling.",
        "abstract": "The HSP90-binding immunophilin FKBP51 is a soluble protein that shows high homology and structural similarity with FKBP52. Both immunophilins are functionally divergent and often show antagonistic actions. They were first described in steroid receptor complexes, their exchange in the complex being the earliest known event in steroid receptor activation upon ligand binding. In addition to steroid-related events, several pleiotropic actions of FKBP51 have emerged during the last years, ranging from cell differentiation and apoptosis to metabolic and psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, mitochondria play vital cellular roles in maintaining energy homeostasis, responding to stress conditions, and affecting cell cycle regulation, calcium signaling, redox homeostasis, and so forth. This is achieved by proteins that are encoded in both the nuclear genome and mitochondrial genes. This implies active nuclear-mitochondrial communication to maintain cell homeostasis. Such communication involves factors that regulate nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression affecting the synthesis and recruitment of mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins, and/or changes in the functional state of the mitochondria itself, which enable mitochondria to recover from stress. FKBP51 has emerged as a serious candidate to participate in these regulatory roles since it has been unexpectedly found in mitochondria showing antiapoptotic effects. Such localization involves the tetratricopeptide\u00a0repeats domains of the immunophilin and not its intrinsic enzymatic activity of peptidylprolyl-isomerase. Importantly, FKBP51 abandons the mitochondria and accumulates in the nucleus upon cell differentiation or during the onset of stress. Nuclear FKBP51 enhances the enzymatic activity of telomerase. The mitochondrial-nuclear trafficking is reversible, and certain situations such as viral infections promote the opposite trafficking, that is,\u00a0FKBP51 abandons the nucleus and accumulates in mitochondria. In this article, we review the latest findings related to the mitochondrial-nuclear communication mediated by FKBP51 and speculate about the possible implications of this phenomenon.",
