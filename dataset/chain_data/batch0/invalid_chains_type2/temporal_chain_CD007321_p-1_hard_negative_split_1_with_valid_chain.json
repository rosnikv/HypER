        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe evaluated the effectiveness and rapidity of onset of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), administered as daily intravenous boluses of 400 mg for 5 days, followed by oral tablets, 200 mg thrice daily for 23 days, versus a matching placebo regimen, in the treatment of 81 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was bicentric, randomized, double blinded, and placebo controlled. Patients underwent a 7-day washout of arthritis medications prior to initiation of this study treatment. Major outcome measures were the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability and pain scales, and supplemental visual analog scales for rest and walking pain.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt one site, patients had milder OA, the baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were well matched, and the SAM treated group showed significantly greater reduction in overall pain and rest pain (p < 0.05) than the placebo treated group. At the other site, the patients had more severe OA, randomization yielded markedly different treatment groups, and the response to treatment did not differ between groups. Onset of SAM effect was seen as early as 14 days after the start of treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSAM may be an effective treatment for some patients with symptomatic knee OA, and merits further study. Intravenous loading before oral maintenance therapy may be advantageous.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe assessed the efficacy of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a dietary supplement now available in the Unites States, compared with that of placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nThis was a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nWe identified randomized controlled trials of SAMe versus placebo or NSAIDS for the treatment of OA through computerized database searches and reference lists.\n\n\nOUTCOMES MEASURED\nThe outcomes considered were pain, functional limitation, and adverse effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEleven studies that met the inclusion criteria were weighted on the basis of precision and were combined for each outcome variable. When compared with placebo, SAMe is more effective in reducing functional limitation in patients with OA (effect size [ES] =.31; 95% confidence interval [CI],.099-.520), but not in reducing pain (ES =.22; 95% CI, -.247 to.693). This result, however, is based on only 2 studies. SAMe seems to be comparable with NSAIDs (pain: ES =.12; 95% CI, -.029 to.273; functional limitation: ES =.025; 95% CI, -.127 to.176). However, those treated with SAMe were less likely to report adverse effects than those receiving NSAIDs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSAMe appears to be as effective as NSAIDs in reducing pain and improving functional limitation in patients with OA without the adverse effects often associated with NSAID therapies.",

        "abstract": "The reactive oxygen species\u2010sensitive transcription nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) plays a pivotal role in the development of acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. We investigated the efficacy of a diverse series of antioxidants in preventing APAP\u2010induced hepatotoxicity. BALB/c mice were divided into four groups and provided with antioxidants incorporated into chow as follows: (1) control diet; or diet supplemented with (2) S\u2010adenosylmethionine (SAMe); (3) green tea polyphenols (GrTP); or (4) (RS)\u2010n\u2010propylthiazolidine\u20104(R)\u2010carboxylic acid (PTCA). After 5 days on these diets, the animals were further subdivided into (A) given an IP injection with APAP (750 mg/kg), or (B) kept as untreated controls. The animals were sacrificed at 0, 4 h, and 24 h following APAP administration. PAP/vehicle induced marked decreases in hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and endogenous SAMe concentrations (46%) when compared to controls. APAP also caused severe centrilobular necrosis and marked increase in serum enzyme ALT activity (38\u2010fold). Oral administration of antioxidants significantly attenuated the APAP\u2010induced liver damage and depletion of hepatic GSH. There were profound increases in serum TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels at 4 h following APAP administration in nonsupplemented compared to antioxidant\u2010treated animals, but no significant differences noted after 24 h. Serum amyloid A increased in APAP\u2010challenged mice irrespective of antioxidant treatment. Finally, hepatic SAMe concentrations were drastically decreased 24 h following APAP administration, and these decreases were attenuated by pretreatment with antioxidants. In conclusion, these orally administered antioxidants with dissimilar properties provided protection against liver damage, supporting the potential use of antioxidant therapy in patients with APAP toxicity. This is the first report that GrTP and oral administration of PTCA and SAMe can provide protection against APAP injury in this model. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "title": "Emerging Role of Nrf2 in Protecting Against Hepatic and Gastrointestinal Disease",
        "abstract": "Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) belongs to the basic region-leucine zipper family and is activated in response to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. Nrf2 coordinately regulates the constitutive and inducible transcription of a wide array of genes involved in drug metabolism, detoxification, and antioxidant defenses. During periods of oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from sequestration in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus. Nrf2 binds antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes and activates transcription. Genetically modified mice lacking Nrf2 serve as a useful tool for identifying new ARE-regulated genes and assessing the ability of Nrf2 to confer protection against a variety of pathologies in numerous organs including the liver, intestine, lung, skin, and nervous system. With regards to the liver and gastrointestinal tract, Nrf2 knockout mice are more susceptible to acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular injury, benzo[a]pyrene-induced tumor formation and Fas-and TNF\u03b1-mediated hepatocellular apoptosis. The higher sensitivity of Nrf2 knockout mice to chemical toxicity is due in part to reduced basal and inducible expression of detoxification enzymes. Nrf2 may also be important in protecting against liver fibrosis, gallstone development, and formation of aberrant crypt foci. Research of Nrf2 has opened up new opportunities in understanding how antioxidant defense pathways are regulated, how oxidative stress contributes to disease progression and may serve as a novel target for designing therapies to prevent and treat diseases in which oxidative stress is implicated.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Oxidative stress is implicated in cardiac insulin resistance, a critical risk factor for cardiac failure, but the direct evidence remains missing. This study explored a causal link between oxidative stress and insulin resistance with a focus on a regulatory role of redox sensitive transcription factor NF-E2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the cardiac cells in vitro and in vivo. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Chronic treatment of HL-1 adult cardiomyocyte with hydrogen peroxide led to insulin resistance, reflected by a significant suppression of the insulin-induced glucose uptake. This was associated with an exaggerated phosphorylation of extracellular signal\u2013related kinase (ERK). Although U0126, an ERK inhibitor, enhanced insulin sensitivity and attenuated oxidative stress\u2013induced insulin resistance, LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), worsened the insulin resistance. Moreover, insulin increased Nrf2 transcriptional activity, which was blocked by LY294002 but enhanced by U0126. Forced activation of Nrf2 by adenoviral over-expression of Nrf2 inhibited the increased ERK activity and recovered the blunted insulin sensitivity on glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes that were chronically treated with H2O2. In the hearts of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and diabetic patients Nrf2 expression significantly decreased along with significant increases in 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation and ERK phosphorylation, whereas these pathogenic changes were not observed in the heart of diabetic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a potent antioxidant metallothionein. Upregulation of Nrf2 by its activator, Dh404, in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo prevented hydrogen peroxide\u2013 and diabetes-induced ERK activation and insulin-signaling downregulation. CONCLUSIONS ERK-mediated suppression of Nrf2 activity leads to the oxidative stress\u2013induced insulin resistance in adult cardiomyocytes and downregulated glucose utilization in the diabetic heart.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo investigate the signaling mechanism of anti-oxidative action by curcumin and its impact on glucose disposal.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMale C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a normal diet (n = 10) or a high fat diet (HFD) (n = 20) to induce obesity and insulin resistance. After 16 wk, 10 HFD-fed mice were further treated with daily curcumin oral gavage at the dose of 50 mg/kg body weight (BW) (HFD + curcumin group). After 15 d of the curcumin supplementation, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. Fasting blood samples were also collected for insulin and glucose measurements. Insulin-sensitive tissues, including muscle, adipose tissue and the liver, were isolated for the assessments of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe show here that in a HFD mouse model, short-term curcumin gavage attenuated glucose intolerance without affecting HFD-induced BW gain. Curcumin also attenuated HFD-induced elevations of MDA and ROS in the skeletal muscle, particularly in its mitochondrial fraction, but it had no such an effect in either adipose tissue or the liver of HFD-fed mice. Correspondingly, in skeletal muscle, the levels of total or nuclear content of Nrf2, as well as its downstream target, heme oxygenase-1, were reduced by HFD-feeding. Curcumin intervention dramatically reversed these defects in Nrf2 signaling. Further analysis of the relationship of oxidative stress with glucose level by a regression analysis showed a positive and significant correlation between the area under the curve of a glucose tolerance test with MDA levels either in muscle or muscular mitochondria.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings suggest that the short-term treatment of curcumin in HFD-fed mice effectively ameliorates muscular oxidative stress by activating Nrf2 function that is a novel mechanism for its effect in improving glucose intolerance.",

        "abstract": "Chemoprevention represents one of the most highly effective anti\u2010cancer strategies and is accompanied by minimal secondary effects as compared to conventional chemotherapies. Many new anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010cancer drug candidates have been derived from chemical scaffolds engineered from natural products discovered just a few decades ago. This approach is widely utilized in drug discovery in order to produce novel molecular entities with enhanced drug activities mediated through various signal transduction pathways for the treatment of different diseases. Curcumin, a polyphenolic derivative of turmeric, is a naturally occurring compound isolated from Curcuma longa that suppresses and inverts carcinogenesis via multifaceted molecular targets. Several reports have demonstrated that curcumin inhibits animal and human cancers, suggesting that it may serve as a chemopreventive agent. Numerous in vitro and in vivo experimental models have also revealed that curcumin regulates several molecules in cell signal transduction pathway including NF\u2010\u03baB, Akt, MAPK, p53, Nrf2, Notch\u20101, JAK/STAT, \u03b2\u2010catenin, and AMPK.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. This study experimentally revealed that curcumin treatment reduced Akt protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, along with an activation of autophagy and suppression of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) function. The curcumin-reduced Akt expression, cell proliferation, and migration were prevented by genetic and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy but not by UPS inhibition. Additionally, inactivation of AMPK by its specific inhibitor compound C or by target shRNA-mediated silencing attenuated curcumin-activated autophagy. Thus, these results indicate that curcumin-stimulated AMPK activity induces activation of the autophagy-lysosomal protein degradation pathway leading to Akt degradation and the subsequent suppression of proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell.",

        "abstract": "Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound isolated from the plant Curcuma longa, is known to induce autophagy in various cancer cells, including lung cancer. In the present study, we also confirmed by LC3 immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses that curcumin triggers autophagy in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line. In parallel with autophagy induction, the gene expression of human GD3 synthase (hST8Sia I) responsible for ganglioside GD3 synthesis was markedly elevated in response to curcumin in the A549 cells. To investigate the transcriptional activation of hST8Sia I associated with the autophagy formation in curcumin-treated A549 cells, functional characterization of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the hST8Sia I gene was carried out using the luciferase reporter assay system. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the -1146 to -646 region, which includes the putative c-Ets-1, CREB, AP-1, and NF-\u03baB binding sites, functions as the curcumin-responsive promoter of hST8Sia I in A549 cells. The site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the NF-\u03baB binding site at -731 to -722 was indispensable for the curcumin-induced hST8Sia I gene expression in A549 cells. Moreover, the transcriptional activation of hST8Sia I by the curcumin A549 cells was strongly inhibited by compound C, an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

Current anticancer agents display limited efficacy, accompanied by severe side effects. In order to improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with cancer, it is crucial to identify novel, highly efficacious pharmacological agents. Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol extracted from turmeric, has gained increasing attention due to its powerful anticancer properties. Curcumin can inhibit the growth, invasion and metastasis of various cancers. The anticancer mechanisms of curcumin have been extensively studied. The anticancer effects of curcumin are mainly mediated through its regulation of multiple cellular signaling pathways, including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, MAPK, p53 and NF-\u0138B signaling pathways. Moreover, curcumin also orchestrates the expression and activity of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs. In this review, we summarized the regulation of these signaling pathways by curcumin in different cancers. We also discussed the modulatory function of curcumin in the downregulation of oncogenic miRNAs and the upregulation of tumor-suppressive miRNAs.

        "abstract": "Simple Summary We provided an effective approach for the treatment of breast cancer as a malignant disease. Regards to this, we used drug delivery system. This approach does not have any side effects on the patients who suffer from cancer unlike chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drug resistance. This system implicates on using nano-drugs which loaded into nano-carrier. During this study, we used niosome@calcium alginate as a nano carrier which contained curcumin in aim of eradicating breast cancer cell lines. Through the research, we applied the above mentioned sample to breast cancer cell lines that were SKBR3 and MDA-MB231 and measured gene expression level to evaluate efficacy of this novel approach in therapy of this disease. Interestingly, applying curcumin loaded into niosome@calcium alginate in SKBR3 and MDA-MB231 as a treatment enhances cancer cell\u2019s death and apoptosis. We hope that this method could use as an effective and novel manner for the treatment of breast cancer. Abstract Cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality, and its various treatment methods can have many challenges for patients. As one of the most widely used cancer treatments, chemotherapy may result in diverse side effects. The lack of targeted drug delivery to tumor tissues can raise the possibility of damage to healthy tissues, with attendant dysfunction. In the present study, an optimum formulation of curcumin-loaded niosomes with a calcium alginate shell (AL-NioC) was developed and optimized by a three-level Box\u2013Behnken design\u2014in terms of dimension and drug loading efficiency. The niosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The as-formulated niosomes showed excellent stability for up to 1 month at 4 \u00b0C. Additionally, the niosomal formulation demonstrated a pH-dependent release; a slow-release profile in physiological pH (7.4), and a more significant release rate at acidic conditions (pH = 3). Cytotoxicity studies showed high compatibility of AL-NioC toward normal MCF10A cells, while significant toxicity was observed in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells. Gene expression studies of the cancer cells showed downregulation of Bcl2, cyclin D, and cyclin E genes, as well as upregulation of P53, Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 genes expression following the designed treatment. Flow cytometry studies confirmed a significant enhancement in the apoptosis rate in the presence of AL-NioC in both MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells as compared to other samples. In general, the results of this study demonstrated that\u2014thanks to its biocompatibility toward normal cells\u2014the AL-NioC formulation can efficiently deliver hydrophobic drugs to target cancer cells while reducing side effects.",

        "abstract": "The aim, as proof of concept, was to optimize niosomal formulations of tamoxifen in terms of size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and release kinetics for further treatment of the breast cancer (BC). Different assays were carried out to evaluate the pro-apoptotic and cytotoxicity impact of tamoxifen-loaded niosomes in two BC cells, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. In this study, tamoxifen was loaded in niosomes after optimization in the formulation. The formulation of niosomes supported maximized drug entrapment and minimized their size. The novel formulation showed improvement in storage stability, and after 60 days only, small changes in size, polydispersity index, and drug entrapment were observed. Besides, a pH-dependent release pattern of formulated niosomes displayed slow release at physiological pH (7.4) and a considerable increase of release at acidic pH (5.4), making them a promising candidate for drug delivery in the BC treatment. The cytotoxicity study exhibited high biocompatibility with MCF10A healthy cells, while remarkable inhibitory effects were observed after treatment of cancerous lines, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3 cells. The IC50 values for the tamoxifen-loaded niosomes were significantly less than other groups. Moreover, treatment with drug-loaded niosomes significantly changed the gene expression pattern of BC cells. Statistically significant down-regulation of cyclin D, cyclin E, VEGFR-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 genes and up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were observed. These results were in correlation with cell cycle arrest, lessoned migration capacity, and increased caspase activity and apoptosis induction in cancerous cells. Optimization in the formulation of tamoxifen-loaded niosomes can make them a novel candidate for drug delivery in BC treatment.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it also uses niosomes to deliver tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment, and builds upon the idea of using niosomes for targeted drug delivery."

        "abstract": "Niosomes are vesicular nanocarriers, biodegradable, relatively non-toxic, stable, and inexpensive, that provide an alternative for lipid-solid carriers (e.g., liposomes). Niosomes may resolve issues related to the instability, fast degradation, bioavailability, and insolubility of different drugs or natural compounds. Niosomes can be very efficient potential systems for the specific delivery of anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antibacterial molecules. This review aims to present an overview of their composition, the most common formulation techniques, as well as of recent utilizations as delivery systems in cancer therapy.",
