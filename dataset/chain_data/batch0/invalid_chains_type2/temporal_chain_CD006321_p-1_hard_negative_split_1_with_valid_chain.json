        "title": "Growth Hormone, Glutamine, and an Optimal Diet Reduces Parenteral Nutrition in Patients With Short Bowel Syndrome: A Prospective, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Clinical Trial",
        "abstract": "Objective:To determine if growth hormone (GH) and glutamine (Gln) might allow for a reduction in parenteral nutrition (PN) in individuals with short bowel syndrome. Background Data:Following massive intestinal resection, patients frequently sustain severe nutrient malabsorption and are dependent on PN for life. GH treatment with or without Gln might allow for a reduction in PN. Methods:A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in 41 adults dependent on PN. Following screening, patients were admitted to an in-house facility for 6 weeks. After 2 weeks of stabilization and dietary optimization, patients were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms (1:2:2 ratio): oral Gln (30 g/day) + GH placebo (control group, n = 9), Gln placebo + GH (0.1 mg/kg per day, n = 16), or Gln + GH (n = 16). Standard criteria based on clinical and laboratory measurements were followed to determine PN volume and content. After 4 weeks of treatment, patients were discharged and monitored; GH and GH placebo were discontinued, but the diet with Gln or Gln placebo was continued for 3 months. Results:Patients receiving GH + Gln placebo + diet showed greater reductions in PN volume (5.9 \u00b1 3.8 L/wk, mean \u00b1 SD), PN calories (4338 \u00b1 1858 calories/wk), and PN infusions (3 \u00b1 2 infusions/wk) than corresponding reductions in the Gln + diet group (3.8 \u00b1 2.4 L/wk; 2633 \u00b1 1341 calories/wk; 2 \u00b1 1 infusions/wk, P < 0.05). Patients who received GH + Gln + diet showed the greatest reductions (7.7 \u00b1 3.2 L/wk; 5751 \u00b1 2082 calories/wk; 4 \u00b1 1 infusions/wk, P < 0.001 versus Gln + diet). At the 3-month follow-up, only patients who had received GH + Gln + diet maintained significant reductions in PN (P < 0.005) compared with the Gln + diet. Conclusions:Treatment with GH + diet or GH + Gln + diet initially permitted significantly more weaning from PN than Gln + diet. Only subjects receiving GH + Gln + diet maintained this effect for at least 3 months.",

        "title": "Strategies for Parenteral Nutrition Weaning in Adult Patients With Short Bowel Syndrome",
        "abstract": "The development of parenteral nutrition (PN) was an important, life-saving advance in the care of patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS). Nevertheless, its long-term use is often associated with complications. Therefore, it is desirable, when possible, to wean SBS patients to an oral diet. Given the complexity of PN weaning and the lack of published guidelines, the purpose of this article is to describe strategies of PN weaning and illustrate important clinical considerations during the weaning process. Patient education and motivation are key factors in successful PN weaning. The patient should have clearly defined care protocols and understand the importance of each aspect of the weaning program. Other factors likely to influence weaning success include the length and health of the remnant bowel, the presence of a colon, and the degree to which bowel adaptation has occurred. It is imperative that daily oral fluid and caloric intake goals are met prior to initiating PN weaning and that the patient receives an optimized dietary and medication plan. During weaning, the most practical measures for assessing adequate hydration and nutritional status are oral intake, stool and urine output, serum electrolytes and visceral proteins, and body weight. PN reductions can be made by either decreasing the days of PN infusion per week or decreasing the PN infusion volume equally across all days of the week. Use of recombinant human growth hormone, with or without glutamine, may play a role in facilitating the PN weaning process.",

        "title": "Role of enteral nutrition in adult short bowel syndrome undergoing intestinal rehabilitation: the long-term outcome.",
        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term clinical significance of enteral nutrition (EN) in weaning adult short bowel patients off parenteral nutrition (PN) undergoing intestinal rehabilitation therapy (IRT). Sixty-one adult patients with small bowel length 47.95+/-19.37 cm were retrospectively analyzed. After a 3-week IRT program, including recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH, 0.05 mg/kg/d), glutamine (30 g/d), and combined EN and PN support, patients were maintained on EN or plus a high-carbohydrate, low fat (HCLF) diet. Continuous tube feeding was used when EN was started. Patients were followed up for 50.34+/-24.38 months and had an overall survival rate 95.08% (58/61). On last evaluation, 85.24% (52/61) of the patients were free of PN. For 77.42% patients (24/31) with small bowel length<35 cm in jejunoileocolic anastomosis (type III) and <60 cm in jejunocolic anastomosis (type II), weaning off PN was achieved. EN comprised of 52.56+/-13.47% of patients' daily calorie requirements on follow-up. Five patients were maintained on home PN (HPN) plus EN. Nutritional and anthropometric parameters, urine 5-hr D-xylose excretion and serum citrulline levels all increased significantly after IRT and on follow-up compared with baseline. In conclusion, with proper EN management during and after IRT, a significant number of SBS patients could be weaned from PN, especially for those who were considered as permanent intestinal failure; continuous tube feeding is recommended for enteral access, and long-term EN support could meet the daily nutritional requirement in majority of SBS patients.",

        "title": "Reconnection surgery in adult post-operative short bowel syndrome < 100 cm: is colonic continuity sufficient to achieve enteral autonomy without autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction? Report from a single center and systematic review of literature.",
        "abstract": "A systematic bibliographic research concerning patients operated on for SBS was performed: inclusion criteria were adult age, reconnection surgery and SBS < 100 cm. Autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction represented an exclusion criteria. The outcomes of interest were the rate of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) independence and the length of follow-up (minimum 1 year) after surgery. We reviewed our experience from 2003 to 2013 with minimum 1-year follow-up, dealing with reconnection surgery in 13 adults affected by < 100 cm SBS after massive small bowel resection: autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction was not feasible. Three (out of 5168 screened papers) non randomized controlled trials with 116 adult patients were analysed showing weaning from TPN (40%, 50% and 90% respectively) after reconnection surgery without autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction. Among our 13 adults, mean age was 54.1 years (53.8 % ASA III): 69.2 % had a high stomal output (> 500 cc/day) and TPN dependence was 100%. We performed a jejuno-colonic anastomosis (SBS type II) in 53.8%, in 46.1% of cases without ileo-cecal valve, leaving a mean residual small bowel length of 75.7 cm. In-hospital mortality was 0%. After a minimum period of 1 year of intestinal rehabilitation, all our patients (100%) went back to oral intake and 69.2% were off TPN (9 patients). No one was listed for transplantation. A residual small bowel length of minimum 75 cm, even if reconnected to part of the colon, seems able to produce a TPN independence without autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction after a minimum period of 1 year of intestinal rehabilitation.",

        "title": "Role of Serial Transverse Enteroplasty in the Management of Adult-Type Short Bowel Syndrome: Experience from a Single Tertiary Referral Hospital in Turkey.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is little knowledge with regard to the management of intestinal failure in countries where home care services and dedicated intestinal rehabilitation centers are limited. This study presents a single-center experience of treating adult-type short bowel syndrome (SBS) with serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nMedical records were retrospectively reviewed from November 2009 to April 2018 on patients with adult-type SBS. All patients underwent STEP, and a representative quota sample of control patients treated with conventional measures were included. Clinico-demographic characteristics including baseline and post-treatment information about the orientation of bowel alignment and nutritional status were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean patient age was 51.1 \u00b1 16.2 in the STEP group and 57.6 \u00b1 12.7 in the control group (P = .304). The median small bowel length was 60 cm (interquartile range (IQR): 40-90) in the STEP group (before the lengthening) and 90 cm (IQR: 70-100) in the control (at the initiation of intestinal rehabilitation) (P = .035). Durations of median follow-up were 18 months (IQR: 14-58) and 10 months (IQR: 3-14), respectively (P = .019). In the STEP group, the mean increase in bowel length after STEP was 37.3 \u00b1 11.6 cm, and at their follow-up 7 patients (64%) had successfully progressed to enteral autonomy. In the control group, only 3 patients (27%) were successful. Mean time to wean parenteral nutrition was 45 \u00b1 54 days, and the mean increase in enteral calorie intake was 1.79 \u00b1 1.60-fold after lengthening in the STEP group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSTEP is an easy-to-perform procedure in the surgical rehabilitation of adult-type SBS. When performed simultaneously with reconnection surgery, it may offer a cost-effective and comprehensive solution to the treatment strategy in middle income settings.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review With the inherent therapeutic limitations of gut transplantation, the concept of surgical gut rehabilitation was introduced to restore nutritional autonomy in pediatric patients. With favorable outcomes in these young patients, there has been increasing interest in the applicability of gut rehabilitative surgery to a growing population of adults with gut failure due to various etiologies. We aim to review the current status of surgical gut rehabilitation for adult gut failure patients in the era of multidisciplinary gut rehabilitation and transplantation. Recent findings Indications for surgical gut rehabilitation have been gradually expanding, with gut failure after bariatric surgery recently added. Serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) has been used with favorable outcomes in adult patients, including those with intrinsic intestinal disease. Autologous gut reconstruction (AGR) is the most frequently used surgical rehabilitative method; its outcome is further improved with conjunctive use of bowel lengthening and enterocyte growth factor as a part of comprehensive gut rehabilitation. Summary Accumulated experiences have validated the efficacy of gut rehabilitation for survival, nutritional autonomy, and quality of life in adults with gut failure of various etiology. Further progress is expected with growing experience around the world.",
