        "abstract": "2-((R-5-Chloro-4-methoxymethyl-indan-1-yl)-1H-imidazole (PF-3774076) is a central nervous system (CNS) penetrant, potent, selective, partial agonist at the human \u03b11A-adrenoceptor, demonstrating efficacy and selectivity in a range of binding and functional assays. In vivo, PF-3774076 increases peak urethral pressure in anesthetized female dogs in a dose-dependent manner, inducing changes in both the proximal and distal portions of the urethra via a central mechanism of action. The profile of this compound suggests that a CNS penetrant partial agonist at the \u03b11A-adrenoceptor may offer significant benefit in stress urinary incontinence (SUI). However, despite partial agonism at the \u03b11A-adrenoceptor and selectivity over \u03b11B- and \u03b11D-adrenoceptors, PF-3774076 did not offer the necessary degree of separation over cardiovascular events when assessed in in vivo models of cardiovascular function. This may be due to activation of both peripheral and central \u03b11A-adrenoceptors. These data indicate that although central, partial \u03b11A-agonists may offer significant benefit in the treatment of SUI, it may not be possible to achieve the desired level of urethral selectivity over cardiovascular events with this class of agent.",

        "title": "Salutary effect of gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 in two different stress urinary incontinence models in female rats",
        "abstract": "Background Since an originally anti-ulcer stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (PL 14736) was shown to promote healing of injured striated muscle and smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, we explored its therapeutic potentials for leak point pressure (LPP) recovery in rat stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after transabdominal urethrolysis (TU) and prolonged vaginal dilatation (VD). Material/Methods During a 7-day period, TU-rats and VD-rats (or healthy rats) received BPC 157, either (i) intraperitoneally, 10 \u03bcg/kg or 10 ng/kg, once daily (first administration 30 min after surgery, last 24 h before LPP-testing and sacrifice), or (ii) per-orally, 10 \u03bcg/kg in drinking water (0.16 \u03bcg/mL, 12 mL/rat/day). Vesicourethral segments were harvested for immunohistochemical evaluation. Results All BPC 157 regimens counteracted decrease of LPP values in TU-rats and VD-rats. Additionally, BPC 157-TU rats (\u03bcg-intraperitoneally or per-orally) and BPC 157-VD rats (\u03bcg intraperitoneally) reached LPP values originally noted in healthy rats. Conversely, in healthy rats, BPC 157 did not alter LPP. Immunohistochemical studies revealed higher desmin (delineates striated organization of skeletal muscle), smooth muscle actin, and CD34 (angiogenic marker) positivity within the urethral wall in BPC 157-treated rats vs. controls, as well as overall preserved muscle/connective tissue ratio assessed with Mallory\u2019s trichrome staining. Conclusions Pentadecapeptide BPC 157, applied parenterally or per-orally, appears to ameliorate the SUI in rat models, improving the otherwise detrimental course of healing after VD and TU, which may be analogous to human injury. These beneficial effects may possibly be selectively used in future strategies for treatment of SUI.",

        "title": "Body protective compound-157 enhances alkali-burn wound healing in vivo and promotes proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in vitro",
        "abstract": "Chemical burns take up a high proportion of burns admissions and can penetrate deep into tissues. Various reagents have been applied in the treatment of skin chemical burns; however, no optimal reagent for skin chemical burns currently exists. The present study investigated the effect of topical body protective compound (BPC)-157 treatment on skin wound healing, using an alkali burn rat model. Topical treatment with BPC-157 was shown to accelerate wound closure following an alkali burn. Histological examination of skin sections with hematoxylin\u2013eosin and Masson staining showed better granulation tissue formation, reepithelialization, dermal remodeling, and a higher extent of collagen deposition when compared to the model control group on the 18th day postwounding. BPC-157 could promote vascular endothelial growth factor expression in wounded skin tissues. Furthermore, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that BPC-157 enhanced the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Transwell assay and wound healing assay showed that BPC-157 significantly promoted migration of HUVECs. We also observed that BPC-157 upregulated the expression of VEGF-a and accelerated vascular tube formation in vitro. Moreover, further studies suggested that BPC-157 regulated the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) as well as its downstream targets, including c-Fos, c-Jun, and Egr-1, which are key molecules involved in cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis. Altogether, our results indicated that BPC-157 treatment may accelerate wound healing in a model of alkali burn-induced skin injury. The therapeutic mechanism may be associated with accelerated granulation tissue formation, reepithelialization, dermal remodeling, and collagen deposition through ERK1/2 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "A new peptide, body protecting compound (BPC), BPC 157, and a variant of mechano-growth factor (MGF), MGF R23H, were identified in confiscated vials. BPC 157 has the amino acid sequence, GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, and is currently under investigation for the promotion of healing and recovery in a variety of tissues. In vitro metabolism experiments in plasma demonstrate that MGF R23H has good stability and should be detectable in urine, while BPC 157 forms a stable metabolite that should be detectable in urine. A weak cation exchange solid phase extraction method was validated for detection of BPC 157 in urine. The method has a limit of detection of 0.1\u00a0ng/mL, precision of less than 20%, and good linearity, r2 0.998. BPC 157 was stable in urine for at least 4\u00a0days. The specificity of the method is improved by measurement of a potential BPC metabolite along with the parent peptide. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "title": "Identification of metabolites of peptide-derived drugs using an isotope-labeled reporter ion screening strategy",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background Peptide-derived drugs represent an emerging class of prohibited substances in professional sports and, thus, in modern doping controls. After parental administration (e.g. subcutaneous, intravenous), these drugs undergo various metabolic processes, which degrade them to biologically active or inactive peptides. Knowledge about these metabolic processes and the hereby produced metabolites plays a key role in successful doping controls due to the effective design of analytical assays under consideration of optimal analytical targets. Unfortunately, the complexity of biological matrix (e.g. blood or urine) complicates the immediate identification of relevant metabolites due to the enormous excess of naturally occurring peptides and their degradation products. Methods In this study, a strategy employing in-vitro metabolism of stable isotope-labeled peptides producing characteristic reporter ions derived from labeled immonium ions is shown. The in-vitro experiments were performed with human skin tissue microsomes (S9), and model drugs representing prohibited peptide hormones were synacthen, insulin, and corticorelin (respectively, their stable isotope-labeled analogs). After generic sample preparation, the metabolites were identified by means of liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) in an untargeted approach. Results and conclusions For all three model peptides, several metabolic products were readily identified. While insulin and corticorelin were found to be comparably stable, synacthen was fully degraded, yielding a plethora of metabolic products. A proof of concept concerning the transferability of the obtained data was accomplished by analyzing plasma samples collected post-administration of recombinant human insulin, corroborating the presence of a skin protease-indicative insulin metabolite in vivo.",

        "title": "Investigations into the In Vitro Metabolism of hGH and IGF-I Employing Stable-Isotope-Labelled Drugs and Monitoring Diagnostic Immonium Ions by High-Resolution/High-Accuracy Mass Spectrometry",
        "abstract": "Studying the metabolism of prohibited substances is an essential element in anti-doping research in order to facilitate and improve detectability. Whilst pharmacokinetic studies on healthy volunteers are valuable, they are often difficult, not least due to safety reasons and ethical constraints, especially concerning peptidic substances, which must be administered parenterally. Hence, there is a growing need for suitable in vitro models and sophisticated analytical strategies to investigate the metabolism of protein- and peptide-derived drugs. These include human growth hormone (hGH) and its main mediator insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), both prohibited in professional sports for their anabolic and lipolytic effects, while challenging in their detection, as they occur naturally in the human body.Within this study, the in vitro metabolism of hGH and IGF-I was investigated using a stable-isotope-labelled reporter ion screening strategy (IRIS). A combination of liquid chromatography, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and characteristic immonium ions generated by internal dissociation of the stable-isotope-labelled peptidic metabolites enabled the detection of specific fragments. Several degradation products for hGH and IGF-I were identified within this study. These metabolites, potentially even indicative for subcutaneous administration of the drugs, could serve as promising targets for the detection of hGH and IGF-I misuse in future anti-doping applications.",

        "title": "Stable Isotope Labeling-Based Nontargeted Strategy for Characterization of the In Vitro Metabolic Profile of a Novel Doping BPC-157 in Doping Control by UHPLC-HRMS",
        "abstract": "Traditional strategies for the metabolic profiling of doping are limited by the unpredictable metabolic pathways and the numerous proportions of background and chemical noise that lead to inadequate metabolism knowledge, thereby affecting the selection of optimal detection targets. Thus, a stable isotope labeling-based nontargeted strategy combined with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) was first proposed for the effective and rapid metabolism analysis of small-molecule doping agents and demonstrated via its application to a novel doping BPC-157. Using 13C/15N-labeled BPC-157, a complete workflow including automatic 13C0,15N0-13C6,15N2 m/z pair picking based on the characteristic behaviors of isotope pairs was constructed, and one metabolite produced by a novel metabolic pathway plus eight metabolites produced by the conventional amide-bond breaking metabolic pathway were successfully discovered from two incubation models. Furthermore, a specific method for the detection of BPC-157 and the five main metabolites in human urine was developed and validated with satisfactory detection limits (0.01~0.11 ng/mL) and excellent quantitative ability (linearity: 0.02~50 ng/mL with R2 > 0.999; relative error (RE)% < 10% and relative standard deviation (RSD)% < 5%; recovery > 90%). The novel metabolic pathway and the in vitro metabolic profile could provide new insights into the biotransformation of BPC-157 and improved targets for doping control.",
