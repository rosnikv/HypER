        "title": "Non-infectious pulmonary complications of newer biological agents for rheumatic diseases--a systematic literature review.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD.",

        "title": "[A case of rheumatoid arthritis complicated with deteriorated interstitial pneumonia after the administration of abatacept].",
        "abstract": "We report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated with interstitial pneumonia that deteriorated after the administration of abatacept. A 55-year-old man developed RA and interstitial pneumonia. Although interstitial pneumonia was improved by high-dose glucocorticoids, various disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including infliximab were ineffective for his arthritis. Tacrolimus was effective but was discontinued due to refractory itching and diarrhea. After 2 months, he was registered on the Phase III trial of abatacept in Japan because of worsening of arthritis. From 2 days after the abatacept administration, frothy sputum frequently appeared, but sputum culture was negative. On 13 days after the administration, the interstitial shadow was deteriorated by chest CT as compared with that of 2 months before, and he was dropped out from the trial. On 27 days after the administration, the dose of prednisolone was increased from 2 to 10 mg/day for his arthritis. On 44 days after the administration, the interstitial pneumonia improved. Abatacpet might be the cause of the deterioration of the interstitial pneumonia, but other possibilities such as discontinuation of tacrolimus, flare-up of RA itself or viral infection should be considered. This is the first report of deteriorated interstitial pneumonia after the abatacept administration in the literature. Further cases are needed to identify the relation between abatacept and interstitial pneumonia, however this possibility should be always kept in mind when we use abatacept.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common, devastating pulmonary complication. An increased number of reports suggesting that biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) induced or exacerbated ILDs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients has garnered increased attention. Areas covered: This article discusses ILDs induced by or exacerbated during biological therapy in RA patients. The article summarizes the efficacy and safety of a variety of licensed and off-label biologics clinically used for rheumatic diseases, focusing on the onset or exacerbation of RA-associated ILDs (RA-ILDs) in RA patients treated with biologics targeting tumor necrosis factor, CD20, interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6 receptors. Additionally, the pathogenesis of RA-ILDs is discussed. Expert opinion: To some extent, the possibility of biologic-induced RA-ILDs increases the difficulty in choosing an optimal regimen for RA treatment with biological agents, as the relationship between biological therapy safety and the induction or exacerbation of RA-ILDs has not been established. A framework to assess baseline disease severity, particularly standardizing the evaluation of the pulmonary condition stage in RA patients and monitoring the outcome during the biological therapy treatment, is highly needed and may substantially help guide treatment decisions and predict the treatment benefits.",

        "title": "New treatment paradigms for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease",
        "abstract": "Purpose of review Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is frequently observed in connective tissue disease (CTD) and is a major cause of mortality. In CTD-ILD, a marked variability in morphological patterns, time course and severity exists. In many patients, CTD-ILD is limited and inherently stable, although a significant proportion of patients have progressive disease. We review the utility of integration of the recently proposed disease behavior classification into the management of CTD-ILD, and recent advances in treatment approaches. Recent findings Recent studies on scleroderma-ILD (SSc-ILD) staging and short-term lung function trends provide important information, although accurate prognostic markers, particularly in limited/early CTD-ILD, are still needed. Most patients with progressive CTD-ILD stabilize on immunosuppression, as observed in recent SSc-ILD trials and CTD-ILD retrospective series. A minority of patients present with life-threatening acute/subacute ILD, requiring intense immunosuppression, with limited available guidance. A significant minority of CTD-ILD patients have progressive disease despite immunosuppression. Ongoing trials with antifibrotic agents and with biologic agents may reveal a potential role for their use/addition. Summary Ultimately, further research into the mechanisms linking autoimmunity to fibrosis and randomized controlled clinical trials are needed, with the aim of preventing irreversible damage of lung tissue, while minimizing burden of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the recently published data and provide a practical overview for management of systemic sclerosis-interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Recent findings Published evidence shows considerable practitioner variability in screening patients for ILD. Recent published data support use of cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil as first-line treatment of SSc-ILD. For patients not responding to first-line therapies, consideration is given to rituximab as rescue therapy. Recent trials of hematopoietic autologous stem cell transplantation have demonstrated benefit in patients with progressive SSc-ILD. Antifibrotic agents are approved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; studies with antifibrotics are underway for SSc-ILD. Summary The specter of rapidly progressive lung disease requires clinicians to risk stratify patients according to known predictors for progression and rigorously monitor for symptoms and advancing disease. The abovementioned therapies promise improved efficacy and favorable side-effect profiles compared to cyclophosphamide.",

        "abstract": "Background Targeting interleukin (IL)-6 has become a major therapeutic strategy in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Interference with the IL-6 pathway can be directed at the specific receptor using anti-IL-6R\u03b1 antibodies or by directly inhibiting the IL-6 cytokine. This paper is an update of a previous consensus document, based on most recent evidence and expert opinion, that aims to inform on the medical use of interfering with the IL-6 pathway. Methods A systematic literature research was performed that focused on IL-6-pathway inhibitors in inflammatory diseases. Evidence was put in context by a large group of international experts and patients in a subsequent consensus process. All were involved in formulating the consensus statements, and in the preparation of this document. Results The consensus process covered relevant aspects of dosing and populations for different indications of IL-6 pathway inhibitors that are approved across the world, including rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular-course and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, adult-onset Still\u2019s disease, Castleman\u2019s disease, chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell-induced cytokine release syndrome, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and severe COVID-19. Also addressed were other clinical aspects of the use of IL-6 pathway inhibitors, including pretreatment screening, safety, contraindications and monitoring. Conclusions The document provides a comprehensive consensus on the use of IL-6 inhibition to treat inflammatory disorders to inform healthcare professionals (including researchers), patients, administrators and payers.",

        "title": "HBV reactivation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-interleukin-6: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to assess the possibility of HBV reactivation (HBVr) in patients with RA under anti-IL-6 treatment. Methods Using PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE, we performed a systematic literature search for articles related to HBVr in RA patients under anti-IL-6 treatment. The search was performed with no date limits and was last updated 28 January 2023. The results from all the databases were combined and duplicates were excluded, as were non-English articles, case reports, position articles, comments, and paediatric studies. Results Our initial search led to 427 articles; 28 were duplicates, 46 non-English, 169 reviews, 31 books/letters, 25 case reports, and 88 irrelevant to the meta-analysis aim; 21 were excluded due to inadequate information, leaving 19 articles, with a sum of 372 RA patients with chronic HBV (CHB) or resolved HBV infection, for further analysis. The overall risk for HBVr in RA patients with CHB was 6.7%, increasing to 37% when only RA patients with CHB and no antiviral prophylaxis were included. On the contrary, HBVr was close to 0% in RA patients with resolved HBV infection, irrespective of antiviral prophylaxis. All RA patients experiencing HBVr in these studies were successfully managed with antiviral treatment and/or drug withdrawal. Conclusion Overall, anti-IL-6 treatment comes with a significant risk of HBVr in RA patients with CHB; risk is diminished when antiviral prophylaxis is used. In contrast, in RA patients with resolved HBV infection, the risk of HBVr seems to be extremely low. Large, well-designed studies (either controlled trials or multicentre/international observational studies) are warranted to further validate these results.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nHepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) constitutes a side effect of the treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Even though HBVr risk of conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents has long been established, the risk of targeted synthetic (ts)DMARDs and anti-interleukin (anti-IL) agents remains largely unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a SLR (PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE) and metanalysis to examine the HBVr risk for the following: anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23 and JAK-inhibitors in patients with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg presence or detectable HBV-DNA) and in patients with prior HBV infection (HBcAb-positive and HBsAg-negative). Meta-analysis was performed using both the fixed and random effects method and was conducted using the R computing language.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, our study revealed a low HBVr risk of\u2009<\u20096% in all agents; the risk was significantly higher for people having chronic compared with those with resolved HBV (14,4% vs 5.1%, respectively p< 0.01). There was no difference among different drugs in the HBVr rates [anti-IL-17: 4% (95% CI: 1-9%), anti-IL-12/IL-23: 2% (95% CI: 0-5%), JAK-inhibitors: 4% (95% CI: 1-8%), anti-IL23: 0%]. Of note, HBVr rate reached 28% in patients with chronic HBV who did not receive anti-viral treatment. For patients with resolved hepatitis the respective percentage was 4.7%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall, our meta-analysis shows that patients with chronic HBV receiving anti-IL-17, anti-IL-12/23, anti-IL-23 and JAK-inhibitors have significant risk for HBVr, especially if they are not under anti-viral treatment. In contrast, resolved HBV seems to offer minor risk for HBVr even without anti-viral treatment.",
