        "title": "Efficacy and safety of milnacipran 100 mg/day in patients with fibromyalgia: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of milnacipran at a dosage of 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) for monotherapy treatment of fibromyalgia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess 1,025 patients with fibromyalgia who were randomized to receive milnacipran 100 mg/day (n = 516) or placebo (n = 509). Patients underwent 4-6 weeks of flexible dose escalation followed by 12 weeks of stable-dose treatment. Two composite responder definitions were used as primary end points to classify the response to treatment. The 2-measure composite response required achievement of \u226530% improvement from baseline in the pain score and a rating of \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" on the Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. The 3-measure composite response required satisfaction of these same 2 improvement criteria for pain and global status as well as improvement in physical function on the Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter 12 weeks of stable-dose treatment, a significantly greater proportion of milnacipran-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients showed clinically meaningful improvements, as evidenced by the proportion of patients meeting the 2-measure composite responder criteria (P < 0.001 in the baseline observation carried forward [BOCF] analysis) and 3-measure composite responder criteria (P < 0.001 in the BOCF). Milnacipran-treated patients also demonstrated significantly greater improvements from baseline on multiple secondary outcomes, including 24-hour and weekly recall pain score, PGIC score, SF-36 PCS and mental component summary scores, average pain severity score on the Brief Pain Inventory, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire total score (all P < 0.001 versus placebo), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory total score (P = 0.036 versus placebo). Milnacipran was well tolerated by most patients, with nausea being the most commonly reported adverse event (placebo-adjusted rate of 15.8%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMilnacipran administered at a dosage of 100 mg/day improved pain, global status, fatigue, and physical and mental function in patients with fibromyalgia.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate and compare the efficacy and acceptability of the antidepressants amitriptyline (AMT), duloxetine (DLX) and milnacipran (MLN) for FM syndrome (FMS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nCochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, www.clinicalstudyresults.org and www.clinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized pharmacological placebo-controlled trials until 30 May 2010. Outcomes of interest were symptom reduction [pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL)] and acceptability (total drop-out rates). We performed a meta-analysis of each drug vs placebo using a random-effects model and adjusted indirect analyses of the three drugs. Methodological quality was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTen AMT studies (612 patients), four DLX studies (1411 patients) and five MLN studies (4129 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The reported methodological quality of most AMT trials was poor, that of DLX and MLN were high. The three drugs were superior to placebo except DLX for fatigue, MLN for sleep disturbance and AMT for HRQOL. The significant effects of AMT and DLX were small and those of MLN not substantial. In adjusted indirect comparisons, AMT was superior to DLX and MLN in reduction of pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue and limitations of HRQOL. DLX was superior to MLN in reducing pain, sleep disturbances and limitations of HRQOL. MLN was superior to DLX in reducing fatigue. There were no significant differences in acceptability of the three drugs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAMT cannot be regarded as the gold standard of FMS therapy with antidepressants because of the methodological limitations of its trials.",

        "title": "Imputing Productivity Gains From Clinical Trials",
        "abstract": "Objective: To respond to employer and payer interest in the extent to which productivity gains offset therapy costs by identifying clinical trials that did not include such measures and using their clinical data to impute productivity impact. Methods: A PubMed search identified the sample of 25 clinical trials of musculoskeletal pain medications and antidepressants. Next, we applied regression coefficients, quantifying the empirical relationship between clinical measures to each trial's clinical outcomes data. This validated methodology provides estimates of Work Limitations Questionnaire Productivity Loss scores. Results: Based on imputation, musculoskeletal medications and antidepressants achieved median productivity gains of approximately 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Accounting for productivity gains based on the Work Limitations Questionnaire could substantially influence cost-effectiveness results reported in the health economics literature.",
