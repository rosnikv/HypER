        "title": "An Improved Scoring System for Identifying Patients at High Early Risk of Stroke and Functional Impairment after an Acute Transient Ischemic Attack or Minor Stroke",
        "abstract": "Background Risk of a subsequent stroke following an acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke is high. The ABCD2 tool was proposed as a method to triage these patients using five clinical factors. Modern imaging of the brain was not included. The present study quantified the added value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors to the ABCD2 tool. Methods Patients with TIA or minor stroke were examined within 12 h and had a brain MRI within 24 h of symptom onset. Primary outcomes were recurrent stroke and functional impairment at 90 days. A new tool, ABCD2+ MRI, was created by adding diffusion-weighted imaging lesion and vessel occlusion status to the ABCD2 tool. The predictive accuracy of both tools was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Results One hundred and eighty patients were enrolled and 11\u00b71% had a recurrent stroke within 90 days. The predictive accuracy of the ABCD2+MRI was significantly higher than ABCD2 (AUC of 0\u00b788 vs. 0\u00b778, P = 0\u00b701). Those with a high score (7\u20139) had a 90-day recurrent stroke risk of 32\u00b71%, moderate score (5\u20136) risk of 5\u00b74%, and low score (0-4) risk of 0\u00b70%. The ABCD2 tool did not predict risk of functional impairment at 90 days (P = 0\u00b733), unlike the ABCD2+MRI (P = 0\u00b702): high score (22\u00b79%), moderate (7\u00b75%), low (7\u00b77%). Conclusions Risk of recurrent stroke and functional impairment after a TIA or minor stroke can be accurately predicted by a scoring system that utilizes both clinical and MRI information. The ABCD2+MRI score is simple and its components are commonly available during the time of admission.",

        "title": "Addition of Brain Infarction to the ABCD2 Score (ABCD2I): A Collaborative Analysis of Unpublished Data on 4574 Patients",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 The ABCD system was developed to predict early stroke risk after transient ischemic attack. Incorporation of brain imaging findings has been suggested, but reports have used inconsistent methods and been underpowered. We therefore performed an international, multicenter collaborative study of the prognostic performance of the ABCD2 score and brain infarction on imaging to determine the optimal weighting of infarction in the score (ABCD2I). Methods\u2014 Twelve centers provided unpublished data on ABCD2 scores, presence of brain infarction on either diffusion-weighted imaging or CT, and follow-up in cohorts of patients with transient ischemic attack diagnosed by World Health Organization criteria. Optimal weighting of infarction in the ABCD2I score was determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and random effects meta-analysis. Results\u2014 Among 4574 patients with TIA, acute infarction was present in 884 (27.6%) of 3206 imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging and new or old infarction was present in 327 (23.9%) of 1368 imaged with CT. ABCD2 score and presence of infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging or CT were both independently predictive of stroke (n=145) at 7 days (after adjustment for ABCD2 score, OR for infarction=6.2, 95% CI=4.2 to 9.0, overall; 14.9, 7.4 to 30.2, for diffusion-weighted imaging; 4.2, 2.6 to 6.9, for CT; all P<0.001). Incorporation of infarction in the ABCD2I score improved predictive power with an optimal weighting of 3 points for infarction on CT or diffusion-weighted imaging. Pooled areas under the curve increased from 0.66 (0.53 to 0.78) for the ABCD2 score to 0.78 (0.72 to 0.85) for the ABCD2I score. Conclusions\u2014 In secondary care, incorporation of brain infarction into the ABCD system (ABCD2I score) improves prediction of stroke in the acute phase after transient ischemic attack.",

        "title": "TWO ACES: Transient Ischemic Attack Work-Up as Outpatient Assessment of Clinical Evaluation and Safety",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 To evaluate a novel emergency department-based TIA triage system. Methods\u2014 We developed an approach to TIA triage and management based on risk assessment using the ABCD2 score in combination with early cervical and intracranial vessel imaging. It was anticipated that this triage system would avoid hospitalization for the majority of TIA patients and result in a low rate of recurrent stroke. We hypothesized that the subsequent stroke rate among consecutively encountered patients managed with this approach would be lower than predicted based on their ABCD2 scores. Results\u2014 From June 2007 to December 2009, 224 consecutive patients evaluated in the Stanford emergency department for a possible TIA were enrolled in the study. One hundred fifty-seven were discharged to complete their evaluation at the outpatient TIA clinic; 67 patients were hospitalized. One hundred sixteen patients had a final diagnosis of TIA/minor stroke or possible TIA. The stroke rates at 7, 30, and 90 days were 0.6% (0.1%\u20133.5%) for patients referred to the TIA clinic and 1.5% (0.3%\u20138.0%) for the hospitalized patients. Combining both groups, the overall stroke rate was 0.9% (0.3%\u20133.2%), which is significantly less than expected based on ABCD2 scores (P=0.034 at 7 days and P=0.001 at 90 days). Conclusions\u2014 This emergency department-based inpatient versus outpatient TIA triage system led to a low rate of hospitalization (30%). Recurrent stroke rates were low for both the hospitalized and outpatient subgroups.",

        "abstract": "Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) if untreated carries a high risk of early stroke and is associated with poorer long\u2010term survival. There have been recent advances in the understanding of TIA, its investigations, management and organisation of services for patient care. Clinically, patients are diagnosed TIA if they have transient sudden\u2010onset focal neurological symptoms which usually completely and rapidly resolve by presentation. Patients with residual symptoms should be evaluated as potentially having stroke, if they present within 4.5\u2009h of onset, should be urgently evaluated for their potential eligibility for thrombolysis. TIA patients should receive rapid attention with essential investigations, including brain imaging, electrocardiograph and carotid ultrasound. Immediate administration of an antiplatelet agent is recommended after brain imaging, with subsequent attention to preventing or treating other mechanistic factors. There is emerging evidence that TIA patients can be managed safely in the outpatient setting after initial rapid management in emergency departments as part of a structured clinical pathway supervised by stroke specialists. Clinical systems of management may require approaches individualised to the healthcare setting, while adopting the central aspects of rapid management.",

        "title": "Predictive Value of A2HD Scoring for Transient Symptoms Associated with Infarction",
        "abstract": "Background Effective early management of cerebral infarction patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) is undermined by an inability to predict who is at highest risk of stroke. Material/Methods A total of 577 TIA patients with symptoms lasting no more than 1 hour were prospectively investigated and divided into a TIA group and a transient symptoms associated with infarction (TSI) group based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging findings after hospital admission. The baseline characteristics, symptoms of TIA, features of disease onset, and findings from clinical examinations were compared between the 2 groups. Factors related to TSI were further analyzed. Results Of 577 TIA patients, 127 patients were in the TSI group and 450 were in the TIA group. Anterior circulation events, hemiplegia, aphasia, multiple seizures, maximal duration, atrial fibrillation, and hypointense plaques were included as risk factors for stroke in a model of multivariate analysis, and results showed that hemiplegia, aphasia, multiple seizures, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for TSI. In the final mode, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.766 (95% confidence interval: 0.729\u20130.800). According to the A2HD score and odds ratio, hemiplegia (score 2), aphasia (score 2), multiple seizures (score 2), and atrial fibrillation (score 1) were scored, and any increment in the score increased the risk for cerebral infarction by 1.893-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.643\u20132.181). Conclusions Risk of TSI seems to be highly predictable. The A2HD score can be used in clinical practice to identify high-risk cerebral infarction patients with TIA who need emergency diagnosis and treatment.",
