        "abstract": "This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter trial compared efficacy and safety of tramadol HCL 37.5 mg/paracetamol 325 mg combination tablet with tramadol HCL 50 mg capsule in the treatment of postoperative pain following ambulatory hand surgery with iv regional anesthesia. Patients received trial medication at admission, immediately after surgery, and every 6 hours after discharge until midnight of the first postoperative day. Analgesic efficacy was assessed by patients (n = 128 in each group, full analysis set) and recorded in a diary on the evening of surgery day and of the first postoperative day. They also documented the occurrence of adverse events. By the end of the first postoperative day, the proportion of treatment responders based on treatment satisfaction (primary efficacy variable) was comparable between the groups (78.1% combination, 71.9% tramadol; P = 0.24) and mean pain intensity (rated on a numerical scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) had been reduced to 1.7 \u00b1 2.0 for both groups. Under both treatments, twice as many patients experienced no pain (score = 0) on the first postoperative day compared to the day of surgery (35.9% vs 16.4% for tramadol/paracetamol and 36.7% vs 18% for tramadol treatment). Rescue medication leading to withdrawal (diclofenac 50 mg) was required by 17.2% patients with tramadol/paracetamol and 13.3% with tramadol. Adverse events (mainly nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, and increased sweating) occurred less frequently in patients under combination treatment (P = 0.004). Tramadol/paracetamol combination tablets provided comparable analgesic efficacy with a better safety profile to tramadol capsules in patients experiencing postoperative pain following ambulatory hand surgery.",

Early mobilization and oral feeding, preoperative oral intake of carbohydrate-rich fluids, proper fluid and pain management, intensive postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, and antimicrobial and thromboembolism prophylaxis are the interventions that may decrease surgery-induced metabolic stress and facilitate the return of bowel function and early discharge.

        "abstract": "AIM\nThe overarching aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a nurse-led pain management programme on pain intensity, side effects of treatment, shoulder range of motion and length of stay after thoracic surgery.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nPost-thoracic surgical pain is a major source of stress and distress for patients. It has profound effects ranging from increased risks in developing chronic post-thoracic surgery pain to an increased length of stay after surgery. The post-thoracic surgical pain management in the Nigerian context is based on the traditional approach that is dependent on the attending medical and nursing staff.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was a quasi-experimental design (two-group post-test only). The study was conducted in a Nigerian hospital. Forty-two patients were recruited and consecutively assigned into either the usual pain management group or the intervention group after they had met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected utilizing the following: (1) the modified McGill Pain Questionnaire; (2) a Numeric Rating Scale; (3) the documentation form for thoracic surgery pain management outcomes and (4) a goniometer.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe findings indicated that pain intensity, nausea and drowsiness were significantly reduced among the patients in the experimental group than the control group, while the duration of stay after surgery and the shoulder range of motion were not different between the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study's results suggest that the intervention in question for patients undergoing thoracic surgery had a positive effect on reducing pain intensity, nausea and drowsiness but not the shoulder range of motion and length of stay after surgery.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY\nNursing policymakers may need to give a serious consideration to the revision of policies related to the nursing education curriculum as well as the in-service training curriculum regarding pain management by nurses especially after surgery. Likewise, future research on other populations employing an improved methodology as well as utilizing up-to-date evidence by nurses across different hospitals may be necessary.",

        "title": "Nurses\u2019 Priorities for Perioperative Research in Africa",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mortality rates among surgical patients in Africa are double those of surgical patients in high-income countries. Internationally, there is a call to improve access to and safety of surgical and perioperative care. Perioperative research needs to be coordinated across Africa to positively impact perioperative mortality. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the top 10 perioperative research priorities for perioperative nurses in Africa, using a research priority-setting process. A Delphi technique with 4 rounds was used to establish consensus on the top 10 perioperative research priorities. In the first round, respondents submitted research priorities. Similar research priorities were amalgamated into single priorities when possible. In round 2, respondents ranked the priorities using a scale from 1 to 10 (of which 1 is the first/highest priority, and 10 is the last/lowest priority). The top 20 (of 31) were determined after round 2. In round 3, respondents ranked their top 10 priorities. The final round was an online discussion to reach consensus on the top 10 perioperative research priorities. RESULTS: A total of 17 perioperative nurses representing 12 African countries determined the top research priorities, which were: (1) strategies to translate and implement perioperative research into clinical practice in Africa, (2) creating a perioperative research culture and the tools, resources, and funding needed to conduct perioperative nursing research in Africa, (3) optimizing nurse-led postoperative pain management, (4) survey of operating theater and critical care resources, (5) perception of, and adherence to sterile field and aseptic techniques among surgeons in Africa (6) surgical staff burnout, (7) broad principles of infection control in surgical wards, (8) the role of interprofessional communication to promote clinical teamwork when caring for surgical patients, (9) effective implementation of the surgical safety checklist and measures of its impact, and (10) constituents of quality nursing care. CONCLUSIONS: These research priorities provide the structure for an intermediate-term research agenda for perioperative research in Africa.",
