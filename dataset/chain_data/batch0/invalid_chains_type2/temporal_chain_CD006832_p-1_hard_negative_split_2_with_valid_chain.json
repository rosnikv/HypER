        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nCritical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy causes limb and respiratory muscle weakness, prolongs mechanical ventilation, and extends hospitalization of intensive care patients. Besides controlling risk factors, no specific prevention or treatment exists. Recently, intensive insulin therapy prevented critical illness polyneuropathy in a surgical intensive care unit.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the impact of intensive insulin therapy on polyneuropathy/myopathy and treatment with prolonged mechanical ventilation in medical patients in the intensive care unit for at least 7 days.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a prospectively planned subanalysis of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of intensive insulin versus conventional therapy on morbidity and mortality in critically ill medical patients. All patients who were still in intensive care on Day 7 were screened weekly by electroneuromyography. The effect of intensive insulin therapy on critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy and the relationship with duration of mechanical ventilation were assessed.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nIndependent of risk factors, intensive insulin therapy reduced incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy (107/212 [50.5%] to 81/208 [38.9%], p = 0.02). Treatment with prolonged (> or = 14 d) mechanical ventilation was reduced from 99 of 212 (46.7%) to 72 of 208 (34.6%) (p = 0.01). This was statistically only partially explained by prevention of critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn a subset of medical patients in the intensive care unit for at least 7 days, enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of intensive insulin therapy, those assigned to intensive insulin therapy had a reduced incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy and were treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation less frequently.",

        "title": "Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: Risk factors and prevention",
        "abstract": "Intensive care unit-acquired weakness, the main clinical sign of critical illness neuromyopathy, is an increasingly recognized cause of prolonged mechanical ventilation and delayed return to physical self-sufficiency. Identifying risk factors and developing preventive measures are therefore important goals. Several studies on risk factors for critical illness neuromyopathy including prospective observational studies with a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors were conducted over the last decade. A large body of data is also available from two large prospective randomized trials comparing the effect of strict vs. conventional blood-glucose control on intensive care unit mortality and on secondary outcomes including the occurrence of critical illness neuromyopathy. Five central risk factors and their related potential measures to prevent intensive care unit-acquired weakness can be identified including multiple organ failure, muscle inactivity, hyperglycemia, and use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blockers. Although strong evidence regarding the efficacy of preventive measures is still lacking, the results of available studies are promising and cast doubt on the widespread belief that the treatment of intensive care unit-acquired weakness is essentially supportive. Early identifying and treating conditions leading to multiple organ failure, especially severe sepsis and septic shock, avoiding unnecessary deep sedation and excessive blood glucose levels, promoting early mobilization, and carefully weighing the risks and benefits of corticosteroids might contribute to reduce the incidence and severity of intensive care unit-acquired weakness.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Critically ill patients are prescribed sedatives and analgesics to decrease pain and anxiety, improve patient\u2013ventilator dyssynchrony and ensure patient safety. These medications may themselves lead to delirium and ICU-acquired weakness, which are associated with worse clinical outcomes. This review will focus on the epidemiology of these two disease processes and discuss strategies aimed at reducing these devastating complications of critical illness. Recent findings Delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are associated with longer hospital stay, increased cost and decreased quality of life after discharge from the ICU. Delirium has also shown to be associated with increased mortality. Strategies aimed at reducing sedative exposure through protocols and coordination of daily sedation and ventilator cessation trials, avoiding benzodiazepines in favor of alternative sedative regimens and early mobilization of patients have all shown to significantly improve patient outcomes. Summary Delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are complications of critical illness associated with worse clinical outcomes and functional decline in survivors. An evidence-based approach based on the following tenets \u2013 minimization of sedative medication, particularly benzodiazepines, delirium monitoring and management and early mobilization may mitigate these complications.",
