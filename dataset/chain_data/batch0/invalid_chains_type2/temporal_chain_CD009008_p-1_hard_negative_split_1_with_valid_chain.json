        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is a novel combination of insulin degludec (IDeg) and liraglutide. This trial investigated the contribution of the liraglutide component of IDegLira versus IDeg alone on efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a 26-week, double-blind trial, patients with type 2 diabetes (A1C 7.5\u201310.0% [58\u201386 mmol/mol]) on basal insulin (20\u201340 units) and metformin with or without sulfonylurea/glinides were randomized (1:1) to once-daily IDegLira + metformin or IDeg + metformin with titration aiming for fasting plasma glucose between 4 and 5 mmol/L. Maximum allowed doses were 50 dose steps (equal to 50 units IDeg plus 1.8 mg liraglutide) and 50 units for IDeg. The primary end point was change in A1C from baseline. RESULTS A total of 413 patients were randomized (mean A1C 8.8% [73 mmol/mol]; BMI 33.7 kg/m2). IDeg dose, alone or as part of IDegLira, was equivalent (45 units). A1C decreased by 1.9% (21 mmol/mol) with IDegLira and by 0.9% (10 mmol/mol) with IDeg (estimated treatment difference \u22121.1% [95% CI \u22121.3, \u22120.8], \u221212 mmol/mol [95% CI \u221214, \u22129; P < 0.0001). Mean weight reduction with IDegLira was 2.7 kg vs. no weight change with IDeg, P < 0.0001. Hypoglycemia incidence was comparable (24% for IDegLira vs. 25% for IDeg). Overall adverse events were similar, and incidence of nausea was low in both groups (IDegLira 6.5% vs. IDeg 3.5%). CONCLUSIONS IDegLira achieved glycemic control superior to that of IDeg at equivalent insulin doses without higher risk of hypoglycemia and with the benefit of weight loss. These findings establish the efficacy and safety of IDegLira and the distinct contribution of the liraglutide component.",

        "title": "A primer on concentrated insulins: what an internist should know",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The common insulin concentration in most preparations of insulin is 100 units per mL or U-100. Human regular U-500 insulin was the first concentrated insulin introduced and it has been available in the United States since the 1950s. Humulin R is the only human regular U-500 available on the market. Human regular U-500 is five times more concentrated than U-100 and because of its pharmacodynamic properties, works as both a basal and a bolus insulin. Human regular U500 allows for delivery of a larger insulin dose with a smaller volume leading to better absorption compared to U-100 and has traditionally been used in patients with moderate to severe insulin resistance. More recently other forms of concentrated insulin have become available and the newer concentrated insulin preparations can be used in diabetic patients with or without insulin resistance. Our intent is to provide primary care physicians with a review of the pharmacology and current literature on concentrated insulins as well as recommendations for patient selection, dose initiation, and dose adjustment.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this article is to provide recommendations to the diabetes educator/expert prescriber team for the use of human regular U-500 insulin (U-500R) in patients with severely insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes, including its initiation and titration, by utilizing dosing charts and teaching materials translated from a recent U-500R clinical trial. Conclusions Clinically relevant recommendations and teaching materials for the optimal use and management of U-500R in clinical practice are provided based on the efficacy and safety results of and lessons learned from the U-500R clinical trial by Hood et al, current standards of practice, and the authors\u2019 clinical expertise. This trial was the first robustly powered, randomized, titration-to-target trial to compare twice-daily and three-times-daily U-500R dosing regimens. Modifications were made to the initiation and titration dosing algorithms used in this trial to simplify dosing strategies for the clinical setting and align with current glycemic targets recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Leveraging the expertise, resources, and patient interactions of the diabetes educator who can provide diabetes self-management education and support in collaboration with the multidisciplinary diabetes team is strongly recommended to ensure patients treated with U-500R receive the timely and comprehensive care required to safely and effectively use this highly concentrated insulin.",
