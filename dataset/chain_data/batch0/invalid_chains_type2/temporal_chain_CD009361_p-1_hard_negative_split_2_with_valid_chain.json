        "title": "The effect of colesevelam hydrochloride on insulin sensitivity and secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes: a pilot study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study evaluated the effect of colesevelam hydrochloride on insulin sensitivity, potential binding to glucose, and chronic effect(s) on fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients meeting inclusion criteria were withdrawn from all antidiabetes agents for 2 weeks and randomized to colesevelam 3.75 grams/day (n = 17) or placebo (n = 18) for 8 weeks. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed at baseline (week -1) and weeks 2 and 8. A meal tolerance test was conducted at weeks -1, 0, 2, and 8. The meal tolerance test and study drug were coadministered at week 0 to assess the direct effect of colesevelam on glucose absorption.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInsulin sensitivity as measured by the insulin clamp method did not change, but the Matsuda Index, a measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity calculated from postmeal tolerance test glucose and insulin levels, increased significantly within the colesevelam group from baseline to week 8 with last observation carried forward (P = 0.020). The postprandial area under the curve for glucose decreased with colesevelam versus placebo at weeks 2 and 8 with last observation carried forward (P = 0.012 and P = 0.061, respectively); the area under the curve for insulin did not decrease in concert with the decrease in area under the curve for glucose at week 2 (P = 0.585). Colesevelam had no effect on postmeal tolerance test glucose levels at week 0.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that colesevelam has no effect on peripheral insulin sensitivity or glucose absorption, but may improve glucose control by improving whole-body insulin sensitivity, although not by an acute effect on glucose absorption.

        "title": "Colesevelam for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nColesevelam is a second-generation bile acid sequestrant that has effects on both blood glucose and lipid levels. It provides a promising approach to glycaemic and lipid control simultaneously.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of colesevelam for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nSeveral electronic databases were searched, among these The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2012),\u00a0MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, OpenGrey and Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (all up to January 2012), combined with handsearches. No language restriction was used.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared colesevelam with or without other oral hypoglycaemic agents with a placebo or a control intervention with or without oral hypoglycaemic agents.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected the trials and extracted the data. We evaluated risk of bias of trials using the parameters of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSix RCTs ranging from 8 to 26 weeks investigating 1450 participants met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the risk of bias of these trials was unclear or high. All RCTs compared the effects of colesevelam with or without other antidiabetic drug treatments with placebo only (one study) or combined with antidiabetic drug treatments. Colesevelam with add-on antidiabetic agents demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in fasting blood glucose with a mean difference (MD) of -15 mg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI) -22 to - 8), P < 0.0001; 1075 participants, 4 trials, no trial with low risk of bias in all domains. There was also a reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in favour of colesevelam (MD -0.5% (95% CI -0.6 to -0.4), P < 0.00001; 1315 participants, 5 trials, no trial with low risk of bias in all domains. However, the single trial comparing colesevelam to placebo only (33 participants) did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the two arms - in fact, in both arms HbA1c increased. Colesevelam with add-on antidiabetic agents demonstrated a statistical significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol with a MD of -13 mg/dL (95% CI -17 to - 9), P < 0.00001; 886 participants, 4 trials, no trial with low risk of bias in all domains. Non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes were infrequently observed. No other serious adverse effects were reported. There was no documentation of complications of the disease, morbidity, mortality, health-related quality of life and costs.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nColesevelam added on to antidiabetic agents showed significant effects on glycaemic control. However, there is a limited number of studies with the different colesevelam/antidiabetic agent combinations. More information on the benefit-risk ratio of colesevelam treatment is necessary to assess the long-term effects, particularly in the management of cardiovascular risks as well as the reduction in micro- and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, long-term data on health-related quality of life and all-cause mortality also need to be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Bile acids (BA), for decades considered only to have fat-emulsifying functions in the gut lumen, have recently emerged as novel cardio-metabolic modulators. They have real endocrine effects, acting via multiple intracellular receptors in various organs and tissues. BA affect energy homeostasis through the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, predominantly by activating the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as well as the cytoplasmic membrane G protein-coupled BA receptor TGR5 in a variety of tissues; although numerous other intracellular targets of BA are also in play.The roles of BA in the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases are seriously being considered, and BA and their derivatives seem to represent novel potential therapeutics to treat these diseases of civilization.",

        "title": "Ultra-Early and Early Changes in Bile Acids and Insulin after Sleeve Gastrectomy among Obese Patients",
        "abstract": "Background and Objective: In obese patients, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has shown mixed results on bile acid (BA) values. The aim of our study was to examine the potential ultra-early and early changes of the circulating total BA in relation with the changes of insulin resistance (IR) in obese patients submitted to laparoscopic SG. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four obese subjects were investigated for body mass index (BMI), total fasting BA, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and leptin before and at 7 and 30 d after SG. Results: After surgery, mean BMI decreased at the first (p < 0.001) and at the second time point (p < 0.001) relative to baseline. Total fasting BA values did not change significantly at 7 d (p = 0.938) and at 30 d (p = 0.289) after SG. No significant changes were found at 7 d (p = 0.194, p = 0.34) and 30 d (p = 0.329, p = 0.151) after surgery regarding fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, respectively. However, a trend of increased total fasting BA and decreased fasting insulin and HOMA- after laparoscopic SG has been found. Negative correlations between total fasting BA and insulin (r = \u22120.807, p = 0.009), HOMA-IR (r = \u22120.855, p = 0.014), and blood glucose (r = \u22120.761, p = 0.047), respectively, were observed at one month after SG. Conclusion: In conclusion, here, we found a lack of significant changes in total fasting BA, insulin, and HOMA-IR ultra-early and early after SG, which precluded us to consider a possible relation between the variations of BA and IR. However, the presence of the tendency for total fasting BA to increase and for insulin and HOMA-IR to decrease, as well as of the negative correlations one month after laparoscopic SG, suggest that this surgery brings about some changes that point towards the existence, and possibly towards the restoration, at least to some extent, of the link between BA and glucose metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Abstract Background: Bile acid is an essential factor that plays a role in metabolic regulation, but how bile acid is regulated after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate changes in the levels of fasting bile acids following RYGB and SG. Methods: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases through July 2020 was performed in accordance with the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The concentrations of bile acids were evaluated. Results: Thirteen studies with 289 patients were included. Our results showed that patients who underwent RYGB had increased levels of fasting total bile acids, primary bile acids, secondary bile acids, conjugated bile acids, and unconjugated bile acids, but no significant differences in all these bile acid levels were observed in patients who underwent SG. Furthermore, 12a-hydroxylated bile acid levels and the 12a-hydroxylated/non-12a-hydroxylated bile acid ratio also increased following RYGB. Conclusion: In this study, we found that fasting bile acid levels, especially 12a-hydroxylated bile acids levels, were increased after RYGB. However, no differences in fasting bile acid levels were observed following SG.",

        "title": "Role of Presurgical Gut Microbial Diversity in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Weight-Loss Response: A Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) substantially alters the gut microbial composition which could be associated with the metabolic improvements seen after surgery. Few studies have been conducted in Latin American populations, such as Mexico, where obesity prevalence is above 30% in the adult population. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the changes in the gut microbiota structure in a Mexican cohort before and after RYGB and to explore whether surgery-related changes in the microbial community were associated with weight loss. Methods: Biological samples from patients who underwent RYGB were examined before and 12 months after surgery. Fecal microbiota characterization was performed through 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: Twenty patients who underwent RYGB showed a median excess weight loss of 66.8% 12 months after surgery. Surgery increased alpha diversity estimates (Chao, Shannon index, and observed operational taxonomic units, p < 0.05) and significantly altered gut microbiota composition. Abundance of four genera was significantly increased after surgery: Oscillospira, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and an unclassified genus from Enterobacteriaceae family (PFDR < 0.1). The change in Veillonella abundance was associated with lower excess weight loss (rho = \u22120.446, p = 0.063) and its abundance post-surgery with a greater BMI (rho = 0.732, p = 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22124). In subjects without type 2 diabetes, lower bacterial richness and diversity before surgery were associated with a greater Veillonella increase after surgery (p < 0.05), suggesting that a lower bacterial richness before surgery could favor the bloom of certain oral-derived bacteria that could negatively impact weight loss. Conclusion: Presurgical microbiota profile may favor certain bacterial changes associated with less successful results.",
