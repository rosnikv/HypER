        "abstract": "The clear delineation of a post-infective variety of IBS, as well as the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly, provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to emerge, a review of available trials emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of strain selection, dose and viability. The possible roles of co-therapy or sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or other agents also deserves further study. The role of the enteric flora is evidently an area of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era of research and therapy for this common disorder.",

        "title": "Effective Constipation Treatment Changes More Than Bowel Frequency: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims The marketing of newer agents for treatment of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) emphasize improvements in abdominal pain. However, it is not clear whether this observation reflects a unique visceral analgesic effect of these agents or is a general feature of effective laxation. We sought to determine the relationship between improvements in bowel frequency and decreases in abdominal pain in clinical trials of patients with constipation or IBS-C. Methods We searched \u201cPubMed\u201d and \u201cEmbase\u201d databanks for clinical trials in patients with constipation or IBS-C, targeting publications that provided detailed data on bowel movement frequency and pain intensity before and after an intervention. We abstracted the results and performed meta-analytic and meta-regression analyses. Results Twenty-seven trials (16 constipation and 11 IBS) met entry criteria. Baseline weekly bowel movement frequency was low with 2.35 (2.07\u20132.64) with differences between constipation (2.00 [1.62\u20132.38]) and IBS-C (2.77 [2.40\u20133.14]; Q = 8.18; P = 0.002). Studies reported moderate pain levels (2.12 [1.81\u20132.42]) with comparable baseline levels in constipation (2.02 [1.63\u20132.42]) and IBS-C (2.35 [2.10\u20132.60]; Q = 1.92; P = 0.167). Treatments increased bowel frequency by 2.17 [1.88\u20132.47] and lowered pain ratings by 0.58 [0.49\u20130.68]. Meta-regression demonstrated a significant correlation between treatment-induced increases in bowel frequency and decreased pain ratings. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that reduction of abdominal pain observed in clinical trials of constipation and IBS-C is associated with laxation, and may not require specific drug mechanisms, thus arguing against a unique advantage of newer agents over traditional laxatives in the treatment of constipation and IBS-C.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, is said to reduce epithelial permeability. However, whether lubiprostone has a direct effect on the epithelial barrier function and how it modulates the intestinal barrier function remain unknown. Therefore, the effects of lubiprostone on intestinal barrier function were evaluated in vitro. Methods: Caco-2 cells were used to assess the intestinal barrier function. To examine the expression of claudins, immunoblotting was performed with specific antibodies. The effects of lubiprostone on cytokines (IFN\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2) and aspirin-induced epithelial barrier disruption were assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability. Results: IFN\u03b3, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and aspirin significantly decreased TEER and increased epithelial permeability. Lubiprostone significantly improved the IFN\u03b3-induced decrease in TEER in a dose-dependent manner. Lubiprostone significantly reduced the IFN\u03b3-induced increase in FITC labeled-dextran permeability. The changes induced by IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and aspirin were not affected by lubiprostone. The expression of claudin-1, but not claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and ZO-1 was significantly increased by lubiprostone. Conclusion: Lubiprostone significantly improved the IFN\u03b3-induced decrease in TEER and increase in FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Lubiprostone increased the expression of claudin-1, and this increase may be related to the effect of lubiprostone on the epithelial barrier function.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hepatic overload of gut-derived lipopolysaccharide dictates the progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) by inducing oxidative stress and activating Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells through toll-like receptor 4 signaling. Therefore, targeting the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity has attracted attention for the treatment of ALD. Zinc acetate and rifaximin, which is a nonabsorbable antibiotic, had been clinically used for patients with cirrhosis, particularly those with hepatic encephalopathy, and had been known to improve intestinal barrier dysfunction. However, only few studies focused on their efficacies in preventing the ALD-related fibrosis development. AIM To investigate the effects of a combined zinc acetate with rifaximin on liver fibrosis in a mouse ALD model. METHODS To induce ALD-related liver fibrosis, female C57BL/6J mice were fed a 2.5% (v/v) ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet and received intraperitoneal carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injection twice weekly (1 mL/kg) for 8 wk. Zinc acetate (100 mg/L) and/or rifaximin (100 mg/L) were orally administered during experimental period. Hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis as well as intestinal barrier function were evaluated by histological and molecular analyses. Moreover, the direct effects of both agents on Caco-2 barrier function were assessed by in vitro assays. RESULTS In the ethanol plus CCl4-treated mice, combination of zinc acetate and rifaximin attenuated oxidative lipid peroxidation with downregulation of Nox2 and Nox4. This combination significantly inhibited the Kupffer cells expansion and the proinflammatory response with blunted hepatic exposure of lipopolysaccharide and the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kB pathway. Consequently, liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cells activation were efficiently suppressed with downregulation of Mmp-2, -9, -13, and Timp1. Both agents improved the atrophic changes and permeability in the ileum, with restoration of tight junction proteins (TJPs) by decreasing the expressions of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and myosin light chain kinase. In the in vitro assay, both agents directly reinforced ethanol or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated paracellular permeability and upregulated TJPs in Caco-2 cells. CONCLUSION Dual therapy with zinc acetate and rifaximin may serve as a strategy to prevent ALD-related fibrosis by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity.",

        "abstract": "Backgrounds Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a major health problem worldwide. There is increasing evidence that immune cells, iron metabolism and copper metabolism play important roles in the development of AH. We aimed to explore biomarkers that are co-associated with M1 macrophages, ferroptosis and cuproptosis in AH patients. Methods GSE28619 and GSE103580 datasets were integrated, CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells and GSVA algorithm was used to calculate ferroptosis and cuproptosis scores. Using the \u201cWGCNA\u201d R package, we established a gene co-expression network and analyzed the correlation between M1 macrophages, ferroptosis and cuproptosis scores and module characteristic genes. Subsequently, candidate genes were screened by WGCNA and differential expression gene analysis. The LASSO-SVM analysis was used to identify biomarkers co-associated with M1 macrophages, ferroptosis and cuproptosis. Finally, we validated these potential biomarkers using GEO datasets (GSE155907, GSE142530 and GSE97234) and a mouse model of AH. Results The infiltration level of M1 macrophages was significantly increased in AH patients. Ferroptosis and cuproptosis scores were also increased in AH patients. In addition, M1 macrophages, ferroptosis and cuproptosis were positively correlated with each other. Combining bioinformatics analysis with a mouse model of AH, we found that ALDOA, COL3A1, LUM, THBS2 and TIMP1 may be potential biomarkers co-associated with M1 macrophages, ferroptosis and cuproptosis in AH patients.

        "abstract": "Background Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe inflammatory liver disease. In recent years, the incidence of AH has been on the rise, leading to an increasingly severe disease burden. Currently, there is a lack of specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of AH in clinical practice. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to identify biomarkers closely associated with the progression of AH, to address the shortcomings in pathological diagnosis, and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods Bioinformatics and machine learning methods were used to comparatively study the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AH patients and healthy individuals by analyzing four mRNA microarray data sets obtained from the GEO database. Subsequently, the role of potential biomarkers in AH and their mechanism of action were further confirmed by AH patients and in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results Using differential analysis and WGCNA of the data set, a total of 167 key genes that may be related to AH were obtained. Among 167 genes, the LASSO logistic regression algorithm identified four potential biomarkers (KCNJ10, RPL21P23, ADRB2, and AC025279.1). Notably, ADRB2 showed biomarker potential in GSE28619, GSE94397, and E-MTAB-2664 datasets, and clinical liver samples. Furthermore, AH patients and in vivo experiments demonstrated ADRB2 inhibition and suppression of SIRT1/PPAR\u03b1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathways, accompanied by elevated inflammatory factors and lipid deposition. In vitro experiments showed that ADRB2 overexpression mitigated the inhibition of the SIRT1/PPAR\u03b1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway, reversing the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and lipid deposition induced by alcohol exposure. Besides, the results also showed that ADRB2 expression in AH was negatively correlated with the levels of inflammatory factors (e.g., CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL10). Conclusion This study points to ADRB2 as a promising biomarker with potential diagnostic and prognostic value in clinical cohort data. In addition, in AH patients, in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed the key role of ADRB2 in the progression of AH. These findings suggest that ADRB2 may alleviate AH by activating the SIRT1/PPAR\u03b1/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway. This finding provides a new perspective for the diagnosis and treatment of AH.",
