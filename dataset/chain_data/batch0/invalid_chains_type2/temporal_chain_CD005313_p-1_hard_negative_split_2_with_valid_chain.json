        "abstract": "To overcome the problem of in\u2010stent restenosis, the concept of local delivery of antiproliferative or immunosuppressive drugs has been introduced into interventional cardiology. Local drug delivery can be achieved by drug\u2010eluting stents coated with polymer surfaces used for controlled drug release. However, several polymer coatings have shown an induction of inflammatory response and increased neointima formation. In the present study, the effect of a new inorganic ceramic nanoporous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) coating on neointima proliferation and its suitability as a carrier for the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus have been investigated. 316 L stainless steel coronary stents were coated with a 500 nm thin nanoporous aluminum oxide layer. This ceramic nanolayer was used as a carrier for tacrolimus. Bare stents (n = 6), ceramic coated stents (n = 6), and ceramic coated stents loaded with 60 (n = 7) and 120 \u03bcg (n = 6) tacrolimus were implanted in the common carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. The ceramic coating caused no significant reduction of neointimal thickness after 28 days. Loading the ceramic stents with tacrolimus led to a significant reduction of neointima thickness by 52% for 60 \u03bcg (P = 0.047) and 56% for 120 \u03bcg (P = 0.036) as compared to the bare stents. The ceramic coating alone as well as in combination with tacrolimus led to a reduced infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages in the intima in response to stent implantation. Ceramic coating of coronary stents with a nanoporous layer of aluminum oxide in combination with tacrolimus resulted in a significant reduction in neointima formation and inflammatory response. The synergistic effects of the ceramic coating and tacrolimus suggest that this new approach may have a high potential to translate into clinical benefit.

        "title": "Particle debris from a nanoporous stent coating obscures potential antiproliferative effects of tacrolimus\u2010eluting stents in a porcine model of restenosis",
        "abstract": "Polymer stent coatings may not be suitable for drug elution because of inherent proinflammatory effects. A previous study suggested a beneficial effect of a stent eluting tacrolimus from a nanoporous ceramic aluminum oxide coating in a rabbit restenosis model. We investigated whether this stent is effective in preventing in\u2010stent restenosis in a porcine restenosis model. Thirty\u2010four juvenile swine underwent balloon overstretch injury and were subjected to implantation of either stainless steel (bare) stents, bare stents coated with nanoporous aluminum oxide alone, and coated stents eluting 50 and 180 \u03bcg of tacrolimus (FK506). In\u2010stent restenosis was quantified at 1 and 3 months after stent placement by histomorphometry. A significant increase of neointimal hyperplasia was noted with the stents coated with aluminum oxide alone compared with bare stents (2.92 \u00b1 1.02 and 1.38 \u00b1 0.51 mm2, respectively; P < 0.02). In all arteries containing coated stents, particle debris was found in the media and neointima, resulting in augmented vascular inflammation. In the group of stents coated with aluminum oxide, FK506 elution at a dose 180 \u03bcg reduced neointimal hyperplasia vs. no drug elution (1.66 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 2.92 \u00b1 1.02 mm2; 180 \u03bcg vs. ceramic alone; P < 0.03). At a dose of 50 \u03bcg stent\u2010based delivery of FK506, no reduction of neointimal hyperplasia was found (2.88 \u00b1 1.31 and 2.92 \u00b1 1.02 mm2, respectively; P = NS; FK506 vs. ceramic alone). In summary, particle debris shed from a drug\u2010eluting aluminum oxide coating of a stainless steel stent counteracts potential antiproliferative effects of stent\u2010based tacrolimus delivery in a porcine model of restenosis. We propose that stent coatings eluting drugs need to be routinely tested for being tightly anchored into the stent surface. Alternatively, omission of any coating used as a drug reservoir may eliminate inflammatory particle debris after placement of drug\u2010eluting stents.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLong-term efficacy and safety of tacrolimus-eluting stent (Janus) for treatment of coronary artery disease in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) \"real world\" is uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Janus stent for treating coronary heart disease in PCI daily practice, the safety of 4-month clopidogrel therapy after Janus stent implantation and the feasibility for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for first time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom February 20, 2006 to August 26, 2006, a total of 200 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Janus stent (n = 100) or bare metal stent (Tecnic Carbostent, n = 100). All patients were administered with clopidogrel for 4 months and aspirin for life long after stenting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. AMI was present in 37% of patients with Janus and 36% with Tecnic Carbostent. At an average of 246-day follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6% with the Janus stent and 15% with the Tecnic Carbostent (P = 0.038). Primary events included 1 cardiac death, 1 myocardial infarction (MI) due to subacute stent thrombosis and 13 target lesion revascularizations (TLR) due to restenosis in patients with Tecnic Carbostent and 6 TLR due to restenosis in patients with Janus stent. Although all patients had discontinued clopidogrel for an average of 126 days, there was no additional thrombotic event in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nJanus stent is efficient in reducing MACE compared with Tecnic Carbostent at an average of 8-month follow-up. Discontinuation of clopidogrel at 4 months after PCI is safe for patients with Janus stent, including AMI patients. Long-term efficacy of Janus stent in reducing restenosis requires further study.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nDrug-eluting stents (DES) have considerably reduced the rates of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Several studies reported pre-procedural C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, red cell distribution width (RDW), serum uric acid (UA), and mean platelet volume (MPV) as independent predictors of ISR using bare metal stents. This study investigates whether any laboratory parameter obtained before the coronary stenting procedure is associated with ISR using DES in stable coronary artery disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree hundred fifteen stents were retrospectively analysed in 285 patients who had undergone coronary stenting and a control coronary angiography within one year of stenting, between January 2012 and April 2014. Pre-procedural complete blood count, biochemistry, and CRP were recorded. Off-line quantitative coronary angiography analysis was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall restenosis rate was 10.2%. When the stents were analysed with respect to the presence of ISR, the number of diabetics and smokers was higher in the ISR group. CRP levels were significantly higher in the ISR group, but there were no differences in N/L, monocytes, eosinophils, RDW, MPV, UA, and total bilirubin levels. In the univariate regression analysis, DM, CRP, stent length, stent diameter, pre-procedural diameter stenosis, pre-procedural minimal lumen diameter (MLD), post-procedural residual diameter stenosis, post-procedural reference vessel diameter, and post-procedural MLD were predictors of ISR. However, multivariate regression analysis identified only DM and post-procedural residual stenosis as independent predictors of ISR.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPre-procedural blood parameters do not independently predict ISR in DES, which is mainly determined by the presence of diabetes and post-procedural residual stenosis.",

The study group included 218 patients with in-stent restenosis. The control group consisted of 218 patients with CAD without in-stent restenosis. Inclusion criteria were acute or chronic form of CAD, age 45-74 years, CAG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with emergency or planned stenting of the native coronary artery, repeated CAG in history due to signs/symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Exclusion criteria: age younger than 45 years and over 74 years, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), cancer, autoimmune disease, anemia, liver failure, chronic kidney disease S4-S5, recent blood transfusion, hypo-or hyperthyroidism.Results.According to the study, the risk in-stent restenosis is 5,2 times higher in patients in the 65-69 years age group and 9,9 times higher in the 70-74 years age group compared with the group of young patients (45-49 years). In-stent restenosis is 2,7 times more common in men than in women. Predictors of restenosis were red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, Gensini score with OR 1,5; 1,4; 1,1; 1,5, respectively.Conclusion.Risk factors for coronary artery restenosis after stenting are markers of chronic inflammation, such as the red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume. The risk of restenosis is higher in the male population. In old age, the risk of restenosis increases, however, young people and middle-aged people do not differ in risk of in-stent restenosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: The neutrophil-leukocyte index (NLI) is an independent predictor of an unfavorable outcome in stable ischemic heart disease, as well as of mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes and uncontrolled heart failure. A number of studies have shown the informative value of NLI for the prediction of severe course of COVID-19. NLI variability in COVID-19 with comorbid baseline physical diseases and cardiovascular disorders in particular, has not been studied. \nAim: To evaluate the clinical value of NLI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 depending on their concomitant cardiac disorders. \nMaterials and methods: In this retrospective quantitative study we have analyzed the data from medical files of the patients with the diagnosis of new coronavirus infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, treated in a specialized in-patient department of infectious diseases in 2020 to 2022. Previously diagnosed cardiac disorders were defined as any past history of these disorders. The results of instrumental and laboratory work-up were assessed before treatment. \nResults: The analysis included 226 patients with median age of 50.0 (Q1Q3: 42.063.0) years, with 81.4% (n = 184) of them being men. Ninety four (41.6%) patients had no previously diagnosed cardiovascular disorders. Arterial hypertension by the time of admittance was present in 132 (58.4%), ischemic heart disease, in 77 (34.1%), atherosclerotic and/or post-infarct cardiosclerosis, in 82 (36.3%), and chronic heart failure, in 77 (34.1%) of the patients. \nIn the total study group (n = 226) the median NLI was 2.6 (1.574.47). The larger was the volume of the lung involvement (assessed by computed tomography at admittance), the higher was NLI (p = 0.009, Kruskal-Wallis test). There was an association between the NLI value and the degree of respiratory failure (p 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Median NLI in the patients with cardiac disorders (irrespective of their nosology) was significantly higher than that in the patients without any history of cardiovascular problems: 3.30 (2.095.42) versus 1.95 (1.423.62) (p 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). We found significant difference in the NLI values for each type of cardiac disorders, compared to that in the patients without history of cardiovascular disorders, including for the patients with arterial hypertension (p 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test), ischemic heart disease (p 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test), atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis (p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test), and chronic heart failure (p = 0.040, Kruskal-Wallis test). \nConclusion: We have confirmed the contribution of cardiovascular disorders to the course of COVID-19 and the clinical value of NLI as a convenient laboratory marker of the severity of infectious disease.",
