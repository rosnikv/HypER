        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between second and third trimester glycemic control and adverse outcomes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, as uncertainty exists about optimum glycemic targets. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Pregnancy outcomes were assessed prospectively in 725 women with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes and Pre-eclampsia Intervention Trial. HbA1c (A1C) values at 26 and 34 weeks\u2019 gestation were categorized into five groups, the lowest, <6.0% (42 mmol/mol), being the reference. Average pre- and postprandial results from an eight-point capillary glucose profile the previous day were categorized into five groups, the lowest (preprandial <5.0 mmol/L and postprandial <6.0 mmol/L) being the reference. RESULTS An A1C of 6.0\u20136.4% (42\u201347 mmol/mol) at 26 weeks\u2019 gestation was associated with a significantly increased risk of large for gestational age (LGA) (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0\u20133.0]) and an A1C of 6.5\u20136.9% (48\u201352 mmol/mol) with a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.3\u20134.8]), pre-eclampsia (4.3 [1.7\u201310.8]), need for a neonatal glucose infusion (2.9 [1.5\u20135.6]), and a composite adverse outcome (3.2 [1.3\u20138.0]). These risks increased progressively with increasing A1C. Results were similar at 34 weeks\u2019 gestation. Glucose data showed less consistent trends, although the risk of a composite adverse outcome increased with preprandial glucose levels between 6.0 and 6.9 mmol/L at 34 weeks (3.3 [1.3\u20138.0]). CONCLUSIONS LGA increased significantly with an A1C \u22656.0 (42 mmol/mol) at 26 and 34 weeks' gestation and with other adverse outcomes with an A1C \u22656.5% (48 mmol/mol). The data suggest that there is clinical utility in regular measurement of A1C during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Paternal postpartum depression (PPD) within the first postpartum year is estimated to occur in 4% to 25% of new fathers. Paternal PPD occurs later postpartum in men than in women, and results in father/infant bonding issues, may lead to long term effects for the child, and has detrimental effects on the couple\u2019s relationship. Risk factors of paternal PPD include the mother having PPD, the father having a history of depression, being under 25, and being unmarried. Recent evidence suggests that paternal PPD may be related to sensitivity to low testosterone in some men. Childbirth professionals have the opportunity to raise awareness of this issue through pre and postnatal education of both parents.",
