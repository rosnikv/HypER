        "title": "Randomized Trial of Warfarin, Aspirin, and Clopidogrel in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure: The Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure (WATCH) Trial",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Chronic heart failure remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The role of antithrombotic therapy in patients with chronic heart failure has long been debated. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal antithrombotic agent for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fractions who are in sinus rhythm. Methods and Results\u2014 This prospective, randomized clinical trial of open-label warfarin (target international normalized ratio of 2.5 to 3.0) and double-blind treatment with either aspirin (162 mg once daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) had a 30-month enrollment period and a minimum of 12 months of treatment. We enrolled 1587 men and women \u226518 years of age with symptomatic heart failure for at least 3 months who were in sinus rhythm and had left ventricular ejection fraction of \u226435%. The primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. For the primary composite end point, the hazard ratios were as follows: for warfarin versus aspirin, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.12; P=0.77); for clopidogrel versus aspirin, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.40; P=0.57); and for warfarin versus clopidogrel, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16; P=0.39). Warfarin was associated with fewer nonfatal strokes than aspirin or clopidogrel. Hospitalization for worsening heart failure occurred in 116 (22.2%), 97 (18.5%), and 89 (16.5%) patients treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, respectively (P=0.02 for warfarin versus aspirin). Conclusion\u2014 The primary outcome measure and the mortality data do not support the primary hypotheses that warfarin is superior to aspirin and that clopidogrel is superior to aspirin.",

        "title": "Use of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials",
        "abstract": "BackgroundTo optimize the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical research, it is first necessary to review the current use of these outcomes in clinical trials to determine under what circumstances they are most useful, and to reveal current limitations. PurposeTo investigate current patterns of use of PROs in clinical trials. Research DesignWe conducted a systematic literature review of all double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials using one or more PROs as a study outcome from 2004 to 2006. Data were abstracted and analyzed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression to characterize the use of PROs in clinical trials. ResultsThe 180 clinical trials that met the study inclusion criteria used 173 unique instruments to measure a total of 466 PROs. Most PRO measurements were obtained using relatively few PRO instruments, with one-third of PRO instruments applied in more than 1 trial. In multivariable analysis, tests of statistical significance were more often reported for PROs used as primary trial outcomes. Statistically significant PRO outcomes (P<0.05) were more likely among disease-specific PROs compared with general PROs, PROs with a discussion of minimally important difference, and larger trials. ConclusionsPRO instruments may be improved through efforts to provide centralized electronic administration, cross-validation, and standardized interpretation of clinically relevant outcomes. The majority of PROs used in current clinical trials come from relatively few, commonly used disease-specific PRO instruments within major therapeutic areas.",

        "title": "An Electronic Diary Is Shown to Be More Reliable than a Paper Diary: Results from a Randomized Crossover Study in Patients with Persistent Asthma",
        "abstract": "Objectives. Test\u2013retest reliability of an asthma paper diary versus an electronic diary (e-diary) with an integrated peak flow meter was investigated. The equivalence of the two modes was also evaluated. Methods. Prospective, randomized crossover study design in adolescents (12\u201317 years) and adults (\u226518 years). Key inclusion criteria were persistent asthma, Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores \u226516, use of inhaled corticosteroid with or without long-acting beta-agonist for \u226512 weeks, nocturnal awakenings <2 times in the past week, and activity limitations <1 per week. Participants were randomized to either paper then e-diary or e-diary then paper, to be completed for 14 days each. Results. Forty-seven participants completed all study visits. Weekly percentage of symptom-free days (SFDs) and rescue-free days (RFDs) were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of Week 1 mean SFD and RFD (test) and Week 2 mean SFD and RFD (retest), respectively, were estimated in three groups defined as stable: (i) minimal changes in asthma symptoms, as measured by the global patient reported symptom change question, (ii) less than 15% change (absolute value) in 1 second FEV1 at adjacent study visits, and (iii) changes in ACT scores less than three points for each mode. SFD demonstrated acceptable ICC (\u22650.70) using all three definitions of asthma stability for both modes. Conclusion. Acceptable reproducibility of the percentage of RFD (ICC = 0.78) was only observed for the e-diary using the FEV1 stability criterion. The ICCs for SFD and RFD were acceptable, 0.84 and 0.70, respectively, suggesting better reliability for the e-diary.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Assessment of symptoms and rescue medication use are well-established endpoints for clinical trials evaluating asthma treatment. Objective: To evaluate the measurement properties of an asthma symptom and rescue medication use (ASRMU) diary for clinical trials involving asthma patients aged \u226512 years. Methods: Interviews with 35 patients were conducted to confirm the importance of key concepts in the ASRMU diary. Scores of symptom and rescue medication use were converted to symptom-free days (SFD) and rescue-free days (RFD). Test\u2013retest reliability and equivalence (based on intra-class correlation coefficients [ICCs]) between paper-and-pencil and electronic (eDiary) versions were evaluated in a prospective study in 47 patients. Responsiveness of the ASRMU diary was evaluated through differences in percentage of SFD and of RFD by treatment group in eight asthma clinical trials that assessed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABA), alone or in combination. A ninth placebo-controlled study calculated effect sizes. Minimal important differences (MID) were determined using anchor-based methods from two trials and by interviewing 11 patients. Results: Patient interviews supported content validity for the ASRMU diary. Test\u2013retest reliability was acceptable for SFD (ICC:0.70\u20130.75), but varied for RFD (ICC:0.58\u20130.78). Paper-and-pencil and eDiary modes of administration were equivalent (SFD, ICC\u2009=\u20090.84; RFD, ICC\u2009=\u20090.70). ICS/LABA had the largest percentage of SFD and RFD, followed by monotherapy and then placebo. MIDs were 7.7\u201314.7% for SFD and 8.4\u201315.6% for RFD. Conclusions: The ASRMU diary captures the disease-specific concepts of greatest importance to asthma patients and provides important information for asthma diagnosis and treatment evaluation.",
