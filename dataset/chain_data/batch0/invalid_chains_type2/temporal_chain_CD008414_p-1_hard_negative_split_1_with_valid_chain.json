        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNo therapy has been shown to reliably prevent the evolution of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

        "title": "Wireless capsule endoscopy versus ileocolonoscopy for the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of Crohn\u2019s disease: a prospective study",
        "abstract": "Background and aims: Following ileocolonic resection for Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), early endoscopic recurrence predicts recurrence of symptoms. The aim of the study was to compare ileocolonoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) for the detection of postoperative recurrence in CD. Methods: WCE and ileocolonoscopy were performed within six months following surgery in 32 prospectively enrolled patients. Two independent observers interpreted the results of WCE. Recurrence in the neoterminal ileum was defined by a Rutgeerts score \u2a7e1. When observers at WCE did not concur, WCE results were considered as either true negative or true positive and sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to both assumptions. Results: Recurrence occurred in 21 patients (68%) and was detected by ileocolonoscopy in 19 patients. Sensitivity was 90% and specificity 100%. Sensitivity of WCE was 62% and 76% and specificity was 100% and 90%, respectively, depending on assumptions. There was a correlation between the severity of the lesions measured by both methods (p<0.05). Lesions located outside the scope of conventional endoscopy were detected by WCE in two thirds of patients with excellent interobserver agreement (kappa >0.9) for all lesions with the exception of ulceration (kappa\u200a=\u200a0.7). Conclusions: The sensitivity of WCE in detecting recurrence in the neoterminal ileum was inferior to that of ileocolonoscopy. In contrast, WCE detected lesions outside the scope of ileocolonoscopy in more than two thirds of patients. Additional follow up studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of such lesions. At the present time, it seems that WCE cannot systematically replace ileocolonoscopy in the regular management of patients after surgery.",

        "title": "Wireless capsule endoscopy and small intestine contrast ultrasonography in recurrence of Crohn's disease",
        "abstract": "Background: The best available tool to assess recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) is ileocolonoscopy (CC). Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) are noninvasive techniques able to detect small bowel lesions. In a prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the usefulness of SICUS and WCE for assessing postoperative recurrence of CD 1 year after surgery, using CC as the gold standard. Methods: Twenty\u2010two patients (11 men, median age 33 years, range 22\u201367 years) undergoing ileocolonic resection for CD were prospectively followed from July 2003 to May 2006, with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) used for clinical assessment every 3 months for 1 year. At 1 year, recurrence was assessed by SICUS and CC, followed by WCE. CD recurrence was assessed by CC (Rutgeerts score). SICUS was performed after ingestion of polyethylene glycol, and WCE was performed with Given M2A equipment. Results: At 1 year, all 22 patients had inactive CD (CDAI < 150). In 5 patients, WCE was not performed because of luminal narrowing or stenosis. Seventeen of the 22 patients had all 3 techniques performed. CC detected recurrence in 21 of 22 patients. Lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 22 patients (1 false positive). When considering only the 17 patients studied by all 3 techniques, recurrence was detected by CC in 16 of 17 patients, whereas lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 17 patients (16 true positives [TPs], 1 FP) and by WCE in 16 of 17 patients (16 TPs, 1 true negative). Conclusions: The present findings suggest that SICUS and WCE may be used as noninvasive techniques for the assessment of recurrence of CD in patients being regularly followed up after ileocolonic resection.

        "title": "Severity of postoperative recurrence in crohn's disease: Correlation between endoscopic and sonographic findings",
        "abstract": "Background: Crohn's disease (CD) recurrence is currently assessed by ileocolonoscopy. Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) visualizes the small bowel lesions in CD, although its role after curative resection is undefined. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of SICUS in assessing CD recurrence after ileocolonic resection when using ileocolonoscopy as a gold standard. The correlation between the bowel wall thickness (BWT) measured by SICUS and the endoscopic score of recurrence was also assessed. Methods: The analysis included 72 CD patients with ileocolonic resection requiring ileocolonoscopy, undergoing SICUS within 6 months. Recurrence was assessed by ileocolonoscopy using the Rutgeerts' score. SICUS was performed after PEG ingestion and findings compatible with recurrence included: increased BWT (>3 mm), bowel dilation (>25 mm) or stricture (<10 mm). Results: Ileocolonoscopy detected recurrence in 67/72 (93%) patients. SICUS detected findings compatible with recurrence in 62/72 (86%) patients (5 false negative (FN), 4 false positive (FP), 1 true negative (TN), 62 true positive (TP)), showing a 92.5% sensitivity, 20% specificity, and 87.5% accuracy for detecting CD recurrence. The BWT detected by SICUS was correlated with the Rutgeerts' score (P = 0.0001; r = 0.67). The median BWT, the extent of the ileal lesions, and the prestenotic dilation were higher in patients with an endoscopic degree of recurrence \u22653 versus \u22642 (P < 0.001) and the lumen diameter was lower in patients with a Rutgeerts' score \u22653 versus \u22642 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Although SICUS and ileocolonoscopy provide different views of the small bowel, SICUS shows a significant correlation with the endoscopic findings. SICUS may represent an alternative noninvasive technique for assessing CD recurrence after ileocolonic resection. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2009)",

        "abstract": "Diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging data. Imaging of the morphological characteristics of IBD includes the assessment of mucosal alterations, transmural involvement and extraintestinal manifestations. No single imaging technique serves as a diagnostic gold standard to encompass all disease manifestations. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow cross-sectional imaging of the transmural alterations and extraintestinal manifestations. While in the USA the technique of choice is CT, in Europe the focus is more on MRI and ultrasound (US). Most patients with chronic IBD are diagnosed at a young age. After baseline diagnosis many of these young patients have to undergo repetitive imaging procedures during the variable clinical course of the disease, characterized by alternate periods of remission and active disease, and in monitoring the response to treatment. US has the advantage of being noninvasive, less costly, and easily repeatable, and thus can be very useful in following up patients with IBD. In addition, rising concern about radiation exposure in young adults indicates the demand for radiation-sparing techniques like US and MRI. This article focuses on the current clinical practice of US in IBD, describing the current technologies used in transabdominal intestinal US and the characteristic sonographic findings in Crohn\u00b4s disease and ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Imaging the gut provides information on Crohn's disease activity, identifies complications and provides insight into patient symptoms. Imaging can help direct therapy and can predict important patient outcomes. In a rapidly changing, technology-driven field, new imaging applications add novel insights that we are only beginning to appreciate. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in imaging as they are applied to the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. Recent findings In the past year, key literature describing cross-sectional imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) based imaging, specifically CT enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), transcutaneous ultrasound, and PET-based imaging, has emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease. MRI sequences that have been recently applied to Crohn's disease assessment, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), add important new insights. These new data highlight the current status of available imaging modalities and provide a glimpse into the future of our practice. Summary CTE and MRE are our new standard imaging modalities for small bowel Crohn's disease. PET scanning is promising but currently only used routinely in centers with a strong research presence in this area. Ultrasound is emerging as a useful, potentially less costly, radiation-free technique. New MRI sequences offer future promise for effectively monitoring the natural history of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by a relapsing-remitting clinical behavior and dominated by intestinal inflammation. Being a chronic disorder that with time develops into a disabling disease, it is important to monitor the severity of inflammation to assess the efficacy of medication, rule out complications, and prevent progression. This is particularly true now that the goals of treatment are mucosal healing and deep remission. Endoscopy has always been the gold standard for assessing mucosal activity in CD, but its use is limited by its invasiveness and its inability to examine the small intestine, proximal to the terminal ileum. Enteroscopy and the less invasive small bowel capsule endoscopy enable the small bowel to be thoroughly explored and scores are emerging for classifying small bowel disease activity. Cross-sectional imaging techniques (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography) are emerging as valid tools for monitoring CD patients, assessing inflammatory activity in the mucosa and the transmucosal extent of the disease, and for excluding extra-intestinal complications. Neither endoscopy nor imaging are suitable for assessing patients frequently, however. Noninvasive markers such as C-reactive protein, and fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin, are therefore useful to confirm the inflammatory burden of the disease and to identify patients requiring further investigations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are auto-antibodies directed against components of neutrophil granulocytes and may be found in various inflammatory conditions, like small-vessel vasculitis or ulcerative colitis (UC). Routine ANCA screening is performed on ethanol-fixed neutrophils using indirect immunofluorescence technique. Yet, how neutrophil granule proteins become available to immunologic presentation is a matter of debate. In recent years, various studies have shown that neutrophils are able to extrude their chromatin decorated with granular proteins as neutrophil extracelullar traps (NETs). Aim: We hypothesized that (I) ANCA immunoreactivity may be found on NETs and (II) NETs may serve as a useful tool in a novel approach for ANCA detection. Methods: Sera from patients suffering from either ANCA-associated vasculitis (n\u2009=\u200910), UC (n\u2009=\u200930) or sera from patients without diagnosed ANCA-associated diseases (n\u2009=\u200920), respectively, were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence and a newly developed method to detect ANCA by flow cytometry employing microbead technology. Results: ANCA-related immunofluorescence was readily detectable on ethanol-fixed NETs, establishing NETs as a structure carrying ANCA target antigens. Moreover, we observed that neutrophils form NETs in response to microbeads and stick to the surface of these beads. Using these NET-coated microbeads in flow cytometry, we were capable of reliably detecting p-ANCA, c-ANCA, and a-ANCA in tested patient sera. UC-related complex DNase-1-sensitive ANCA (NET-ANCA) antigens were also detected on NET-coated microbeads. Conclusion: NET-coated microbeads may be commercially developed as a novel tool for automated ANCA screening assays using flow cytometry.",
