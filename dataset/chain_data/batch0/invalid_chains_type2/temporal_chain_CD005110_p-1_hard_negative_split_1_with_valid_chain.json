        "title": "Gut-directed hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome: piloting a primary care-based randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn western populations irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects between 10% and 30% of the population and has a significant effect on quality of life. It generates a substantial workload in both primary and secondary care and has significant cost implications. Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life but has not been assessed outside of secondary and tertiary referral centres.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess the effectiveness of gut-directed hypnotherapy as a complementary therapy in the management of IBS.\n\n\nDESIGN OF STUDY\nRandomised controlled trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nPrimary care patients aged 18-65 years inclusive, with a diagnosis of IBS of greater than 6 weeks' duration and having failed conventional management, located in South Staffordshire and North Birmingham, UK.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIntervention patients received five sessions of hypnotherapy in addition to their usual management. Control patients received usual management alone. Data regarding symptoms and quality of life were collected at baseline and again 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomisation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups demonstrated a significant improvement in all symptom dimensions and quality of life over 12 months. At 3 months the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in pain, diarrhoea and overall symptom scores (P<0.05). No significant differences between groups in quality of life were identified. No differences were maintained over time. Intervention patients, however, were significantly less likely to require medication, and the majority described an improvement in their condition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGut-directed hypnotherapy benefits patients via symptom reduction and reduced medication usage, although the lack of significant difference between groups beyond 3 months prohibits its general introduction without additional evidence. A large trial incorporating robust economic analysis is, therefore, urgently recommended.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo review the evidence supporting selected complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n\nQUALITY OF EVIDENCE\nMEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Level I evidence was available for most interventions.\n\n\nMAIN MESSAGE\nSoluble fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain. Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSeveral complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.",

        "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, affects from 3\u201320% of the US population, depending on sociocultural and comorbid factors. IBS is characterized by a symptom complex of abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits that present as diarrhea or constipation, and general physical weakness in the absence of abnormal morphological, histological or inflammatory markers. The main diagnostic Rome III criteria as established by international professional organizations are based on exclusion criteria and the occurrence and rate of symptoms. Because the pathophysiology and causes of IBS are poorly understood, treatment approaches are mainly focused on symptom management to maintain everyday functioning and improve quality of life for persons with IBS. The mainstay of intervention is pharmacological treatment with antispasmodics and antidiarrheals for diarrhea, prokinetics and high\u2010fiber diets for constipation, and supportive therapy with low\u2010dose antidepressants to normalize gastrointestinal motility. Other interventions include lifestyle and dietary changes, psychotherapy, herbal therapies and acupuncture. The purpose of this review is to critically assess benefits and risks of current treatment approaches as well as promising complementary and alternative therapies.",

        "title": "STRESS AND THE GUT: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES, DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH AND TREATMENT OPTIONS",
        "abstract": "Stress is a ubiquitous condition that affects all people. According to a definition given by H. Selye, stress is defined as an acute threat to the homeostasis of an organism. It may be real (physical) or perceived (psychological) and posed by events in the outside world or from within. Importantly, stress evokes adaptive responses that serve to defend the stability of the internal environment and to ensure the survival of the organism (1). The gastrointestinal tract and the immune system are particularly responsive to different stressors. In the past years the influence of psychosocial and environmental stressors on the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal diseases has received increased awareness (2). Stress may affect different physiologic functions of the gastrointestinal tract including gastric secretion, gut motility, mucosal permeability and barrier function, visceral sensitivity and mucosal blood flow (3-5) (Fig. 1). In recent years the important interplay between stress and gut microbiota has been shown. Interestingly, bacteria may respond directly to stress-related host signals. There is evidence that catecholamines can alter the growth, motility and virulence of pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Thereby, stress may influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts (6). This article reviews the impact of stress on the gastrointestinal tract. Especially the focus is addressed to the role of stress in the pathophysiology of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and to the diagnostic and therapeutic options to prevent stress-related disorders.

        "abstract": "The gut\u2013brain axis is the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, which occurs through multiple pathways that include hormonal, neural and immune mediators. The signals along this axis can originate in the gut, the brain or both, with the objective of maintaining normal gut function and appropriate behaviour. In recent years, the study of gut microbiota has become one of the most important areas in biomedical research. Attention has focused on the role of gut microbiota in determining normal gut physiology and immunity and, more recently, on its role as modulator of host behaviour (\u2018microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis\u2019). We therefore review the literature on the role of gut microbiota in gut homeostasis and link it with mechanisms that could influence behaviour. We discuss the association of dysbiosis with disease, with particular focus on functional bowel disorders and their relationship to psychological stress. This is of particular interest because exposure to stressors has long been known to increase susceptibility to and severity of gastrointestinal diseases.",

        "abstract": "The emerging links between our gut microbiome and the central nervous system (CNS) are regarded as a paradigm shift in neuroscience with possible implications for not only understanding the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, but also their treatment. Thus the gut microbiome and its influence on host barrier function is positioned to be a critical node within the brain-gut axis. Mounting preclinical evidence broadly suggests that the gut microbiota can modulate brain development, function and behavior by immune, endocrine and neural pathways of the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Detailed mechanistic insights explaining these specific interactions are currently underdeveloped. However, the concept that a \u201cleaky gut\u201d may facilitate communication between the microbiota and these key signaling pathways has gained traction. Deficits in intestinal permeability may underpin the chronic low-grade inflammation observed in disorders such as depression and the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating intestinal permeability. In this review we will discuss the possible role played by the gut microbiota in maintaining intestinal barrier function and the CNS consequences when it becomes disrupted. We will draw on both clinical and preclinical evidence to support this concept as well as the key features of the gut microbiota which are necessary for normal intestinal barrier function.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing recognition of the importance of the commensal intestinal microbiota in the development and later function of the central nervous system. Research using germ-free mice (mice raised without any exposure to microorganisms) has provided some of the most persuasive evidence for a role of these bacteria in gut-brain signalling. Key findings show that the microbiota is necessary for normal stress responsivity, anxiety-like behaviors, sociability, and cognition. Furthermore, the microbiota maintains central nervous system homeostasis by regulating immune function and blood brain barrier integrity. Studies have also found that the gut microbiota influences neurotransmitter, synaptic, and neurotrophic signalling systems and neurogenesis. The principle advantage of the germ-free mouse model is in proof-of-principle studies and that a complete microbiota or defined consortiums of bacteria can be introduced at various developmental time points. However, a germ-free upbringing can induce permanent neurodevelopmental deficits that may deem the model unsuitable for specific scientific queries that do not involve early-life microbial deficiency. As such, alternatives and complementary strategies to the germ-free model are warranted and include antibiotic treatment to create microbiota-deficient animals at distinct time points across the lifespan. Increasing our understanding of the impact of the gut microbiota on brain and behavior has the potential to inform novel management strategies for stress-related gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "title": "Gut instincts: microbiota as a key regulator of brain development, ageing and neurodegeneration",
        "abstract": "There is a growing realisation that the gut\u2013brain axis and its regulation by the microbiota may play a key role in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopmental, age\u2010related and neurodegenerative disorders. The routes of communication between the microbiota and brain are being unravelled and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signalling, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism or by way of microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. The importance of early life gut microbiota in shaping future health outcomes is also emerging. Disturbances of this composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding, infection, stress and the environmental influences coupled with the influence of host genetics can result in long\u2010term effects on physiology and behaviour, at least in animal models. It is also worth noting that mode of delivery at birth influences microbiota composition with those born by Caesarean section having a distinctly different microbiota in early life to those born per vaginum. At the other extreme of life, ageing is associated with a narrowing in microbial diversity and healthy ageing correlates with a diverse microbiome. Recently, the gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of conditions including depression, autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. There is still considerable debate as to whether or not the gut microbiota changes are core to the pathophysiology of such conditions or are merely epiphenomenal. It is plausible that such neuropsychiatric disorders might be treated in the future by targeting the microbiota either by microbiota transplantation, antibiotics or psychobiotics.",

        "title": "Role of TLR4 in the gut-brain axis in Parkinson\u2019s disease: a translational study from men to mice",
        "abstract": "Objective Recent evidence suggesting an important role of gut-derived inflammation in brain disorders has opened up new directions to explore the possible role of the gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases. Given the prominence of dysbiosis and colonic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), we propose that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated intestinal dysfunction could contribute to intestinal and central inflammation in PD-related neurodegeneration. Design To test this hypothesis we performed studies in both human tissue and a murine model of PD. Inflammation, immune activation and microbiota composition were measured in colonic samples from subjects with PD and healthy controls subjects and rotenone or vehicle-treated mice. To further assess the role of the TLR4 signalling in PD-induced neuroinflammation, we used TLR4-knockout (KO) mice in conjunction with oral rotenone administration to model PD. Results Patients with PD have intestinal barrier disruption, enhanced markers of microbial translocation and higher pro-inflammatory gene profiles in the colonic biopsy samples compared with controls. In this regard, we found increased expression of the bacterial endotoxin-specific ligand TLR4, CD3+ T cells, cytokine expression in colonic biopsies, dysbiosis characterised by a decrease abundance of SCFA-producing colonic bacteria in subjects with PD. Rotenone treatment in TLR4-KO mice revealed less intestinal inflammation, intestinal and motor dysfunction, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, relative to rotenone-treated wild-type animals despite the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in TLR4-KO mice. Conclusion Taken together, these studies suggest that TLR4-mediated inflammation plays an important role in intestinal and/or brain inflammation, which may be one of the key factors leading to neurodegeneration in PD.",

        "abstract": "Metagenome assembly is a core yet methodologically challenging step for taxonomic classification and functional annotation of a microbiome. This study aims to generate the high-resolution human gut metagenome using both Illumina and Nanopore platforms. Assembly was achieved using four assemblers, including Flye (Nanopore), metaSPAdes (Illumina), hybridSPAdes (Illumina and Nanopore), and OPERA-MS (Illumina and Nanopore). Hybrid metagenome assembly was shown to generate contigs with almost same sizes comparable to those produced using Illumina reads alone, but was more contiguous, informative, and longer compared with those assembled with Illumina reads only. In addition, hybrid metagenome assembly enables us to obtain complete plasmid sequences and much more AMR gene-encoding contigs than the Illumina method. Most importantly, using our workflow, 58 novel high-quality metagenome bins were obtained from four assembly algorithms, particularly hybrid assembly (47/58), although metaSPAdes could provide 11 high-quality bins independently. Among them, 29 bins were currently uncultured bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes. These findings were highly consistent and supported by mock community data tested. In the analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the number of BGCs in the contigs from hybridSPAdes (241) is higher than that of contigs from metaSPAdes (233). In conclusion, hybrid metagenome assembly could significantly enhance the efficiency of contig assembly, taxonomic binning, and genome construction compared with procedures using Illumina short-read data alone, indicating that nanopore long reads are highly useful in metagenomic applications. This technique could be used to create high-resolution references for future human metagenome studies.",

        "title": "HyLight: Strain aware assembly of low coverage metagenomes",
        "abstract": "Different strains of identical species can vary substantially in terms of their spectrum of biomedically relevant phenotypes. Reconstructing the genomes of a microbial community at strain level poses major methodical challenges, because relative frequencies of individual strains match the rate of sequencing errors, which hampers the identification of their characteristic genetic variants. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads are too short to span complex repetitive regions, the considerably longer third-generation sequencing (TGS) reads are affected by larger sequencing error rates or are just significantly more expensive. Suppressing TGS coverage to limit costs implies losses in terms of the accuracy of the assemblies. Therefore, existing approaches have remained fragmentary: all approaches presented so far agree on losses in strain awareness, accuracy, possibly excessive costs of the assemblies, or combinations thereof. We present HyLight as, to the best of our knowledge, the first metagenome assembly approach that is not affected by any of the aforementioned drawbacks. In experiments, we demonstrate that HyLight assemblies are strain-aware, contiguous, contain little errors, and because operating on low coverage TGS data of the cheap kind, come at drastically reduced costs. HyLight implements hybrid assembly, which exploits the complementarity of TGS and NGS data. For unifying the two types of data, HyLight utilizes strain resolved overlap graphs (OG), which support the accurate reconstruction of the individual members of microbial communities at strain level: HyLight outperforms existing approaches in terms of strain identity preserving sequence by on average 25.53% (across all experiments / data sets: first quartile: 21.53%, median: 26.81%, third quartile: 31.98%), achieving near-complete strain awareness on many data sets. In summary, HyLight appears to implement the first protocol that delivers assemblies that are strain-aware, contiguous and accurate in combination.",
