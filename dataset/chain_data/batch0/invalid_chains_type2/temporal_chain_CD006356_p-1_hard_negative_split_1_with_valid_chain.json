        "title": "A two year randomised controlled trial of intramuscular depot steroids in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis who have shown an incomplete response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs",
        "abstract": "Background: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), intramuscular (IM) pulsed depomedrone expedites an immediate response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Although IM depomedrone is also widely used to treat disease flares in patients treated with DMARDs, its effect on radiological progression has not been assessed. Objective: To evaluate the benefits of 120 mg IM depomedrone versus placebo in patients with established RA whose disease was inadequately controlled by existing DMARDs. Methods: In a 2 year prospective randomised controlled trial patients were assessed using the ILAR/WHO core dataset, disease activity score (DAS28), x ray examination of hands and feet scored by Larsen\u2019s method, and bone densitometry. Results: 291 patients with RA were screened, 166 were eligible, and 91 consented and were randomised. Disease activity improved more rapidly in the steroid treated patients than with placebo, but after 6 months no difference remained. A small but significant reduction in erosive damage in the steroid group compared with placebo was also found. More adverse reactions occurred in the steroid treated group than in the placebo patients (55 v 42), especially those reactions traditionally related to steroids (16 v 2), including vertebral fracture, diabetes, and myocardial infarction. Hip bone density fell significantly in steroid treated but not placebo patients. Conclusions: IM depomedrone improved disease activity in the short term and produced a small reduction in bone erosion at the cost of a significant increase in adverse events. Despite the initial benefit of IM depomedrone, when patients respond suboptimally to a DMARD they should not be given long term additional steroids but should be treated with alternative or additional DMARDs.",

        "title": "Corticosteroids in the management of early and established rheumatoid disease.",
        "abstract": "Corticosteroid use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains something of a dichotomy to most rheumatologists. How do we reconcile the promise of disease-modifying activity in early disease with the possibility of significant and potentially longlasting adverse effects? Is the benefit of the former sufficiently marked to justify the latter? In addition, since the debate concerning corticosteroid use in RA was re-ignited some years ago, ideas about the management of RA have moved on. More intense use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), either singly or in combination, and the proliferation of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents have had an enormous impact on how we now manage RA [1, 2]. Where do corticosteroids fit into our current treatment strategies? RA has also emerged as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis over and above those more traditionally recognised (e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, weight and lipid profile) as a link between systemic inflammation and accelerated vascular disease has been demonstrated, both in the general population and in RA [3\u20135]. Corticosteroids are likely to improve the inflammatory profile but will this be enough to offset their negative effect on traditional risk factors? Patient choice and opinion, central to the day-to-day management of their disease, is also of prime importance and is a factor often overlooked in the corticosteroid debate [6]. Many of these issues remain difficult to answer but we attempt here to revisit [7, 8] and review the status of corticosteroids in the management of RA in the light of current published evidence.",

        "title": "Low disease activity state with corticosteroid may not represent 'true' low disease activity state in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nCorticosteroids constitute one of the most common treatments of RA. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether long-term corticosteroid use suppresses the progression of disability in RA patients with low disease activity state.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData collected from a large observational cohort of RA patients at our institution were analysed for 214 RA patients whose disease activity score (DAS) 28 and HAQ were available consecutively from October 2000 to October 2004. All 214 patients had average DAS 28 <3.2, meaning only those who had well-controlled RA disease activity were chosen as subjects. The subjects were divided into steroid users who received continuous corticosteroids every month and non-steroid users who did not receive consecutive corticosteroids continuously every month.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-five patients (25.7%) were corticosteroid users and 159 (74.3%) were non-users. Average prednisolone for the former group was 4.2 mg/day. No significant differences were observed among baseline variables and RA disease activity variables. However, for steroid users, HAQ progressively worsened with time and for non-steroid users, HAQ progressively improved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough DAS 28 and other variables may suggest well-controlled RA disease activity, functional capacity of patients on low-dose corticosteroids deteriorated. Thus, low disease activity state with corticosteroid may not represent the 'true' low disease activity state. Along with the achievement of a low disease activity state, long-term efficacy, prognosis, and the quality of remission need to be also considered in the tight control of RA activity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine, in real life practice, the impact of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on glucocorticoid (GC) use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis systematic monocenter retrospective before-after study enrolled all RA patients who started their first anti-TNF-alpha treatment between January 2004 and December 2006 and were followed more than 3 months after anti-TNF-alpha initiation. Paired comparisons were performed to compare GC intake during the year before anti-TNF-alpha initiation and during the first year of treatment; each patient was his/her own control. Comparisons between patients who reduced their oral prednisone intake and those who did not, were also performed to identify variables associated with prednisone decrease.\n\n\nRESULTS\n110 patients were included (90 females/20 males, age: 42.1+/-14.4 years, disease duration: 10.6+/-10.2 years). Etanercept was prescribed in 70 (63.6%) patients, adalimumab in 35 (31.8%) and infliximab in 5 (4.6%). At anti-TNF-alpha initiation, 79 patients (71.8%) were taking oral prednisone (mean dose 7.3+/-2.6 mg/d). Of the 82 prednisone-users (74.5% of patients), 62 (75.6%) had lowered prednisone doses, whereas 12 (14.6%) and 10 (12.2%) patients had stable or increased doses, respectively. Twelve patients (15.2%) discontinued oral prednisone. Overall, a significant decrease of 28% of oral prednisone use was observed. The only factors associated with oral prednisone decrease were higher initial prednisone daily doses (p=0.04) and female sex (p=0.04).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study showed a significant GC sparing-effect of anti-TNF-alpha in RA patients in real life practice that was observed for oral, parenteral and intra-articular administration, as early as the first 3 months of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Several prior investigations demonstrate an improvement in bone mineral density associated with use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). We compared the risk of osteoporotic fractures among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating a disease\u2010modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). A population\u2010based cohort study was conducted using health care utilization data (1996\u20132008) from a Canadian province and a U.S. commercial insurance plan. Patients with at least two RA diagnoses were identified, and follow\u2010up began with the first prescription for a DMARD. Drug regimens were categorized into three mutually exclusive hierarchical groups: (1) TNFi with or without nonbiologic DMARDs (nbDMARD), (2) methotrexate (MTX) without a TNFi, or (3) other nbDMARD without a TNFi or MTX. Main outcomes were hospitalizations for fractures of the hip, wrist, humerus, or pelvis based on diagnoses and procedure codes. The study cohort consisted of 16,412 RA patients with 25,988 new treatment episodes: 5856 TNFi, 12,554 MTX, and 7578 other nbDMARD. The incidence rate per 1000 person\u2010years for osteoporotic fracture were 5.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.50\u20137.45] for TNFi, 5.35 (95% CI 4.08\u20137.02) for MTX, and 6.38 (95% CI 3.78\u201310.77) for other nbDMARD. After multivariable adjustment for osteoporosis and fracture\u2010related risk factors, the risk of nonvertebral osteoporotic fracture was not different in either TNFi [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.57\u20131.98] or MTX (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.60\u20132.34) compared with nbDMARD. Among subjects diagnosed with RA, the adjusted risk of nonvertebral fracture was similar across persons starting a TNFi, MTX, or other nbDMARD. \u00a9 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Osteoporosis, one of the most common non-communicable human diseases worldwide, is one of the most prevalent disease of the adult skeleton. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis(GIOP) is the foremost form of secondary osteoporosis, extensively researched due to its prevalence.Probiotics constitute a primary bioactive component within numerous foods, offering promise as a potential biological intervention for preventing and treating osteoporosis. This study aimed to evaluate the beneficial effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum on bone health and its underlying mechanisms in a rat model of glucocorticoid dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis, using the osteoporosis treatment drug alendronate as a reference. Methods We examined the bone microstructure (Micro-CT and HE staining) and analyzed the gut microbiome and serum metabolome in rats. Results and discussion The results revealed that L. plantarum treatment significantly restored parameters of bone microstructure, with elevated bone density, increased number and thickness of trabeculae, and decreased Tb.Sp. Gut microbiota sequencing results showed that probiotic treatment increased gut microbial diversity and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota decreased. Beneficial bacteria abundance was significantly increased (Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Ruminococcus, UCG_005, Romboutsia, and Christensenellaceae_R_7_group), and harmful bacteria abundance was significantly decreased (Desulfovibrionaceae). According to the results of serum metabolomics, significant changes in serum metabolites occurred in different groups. These differential metabolites were predominantly enriched within the pathways of Pentose and Glucuronate Interconversions, as well as Propanoate Metabolism. Furthermore, treatment of L. plantarum significantly increased serum levels of Pyrazine and gamma-Glutamylcysteine, which were associated with inhibition of osteoclast formation and promoting osteoblast formation. Lactobacillus plantarum can protect rats from DEX-induced GIOP by mediating the \u201cgut microbial-bone axis\u201d promoting the production of beneficial bacteria and metabolites. Therefore L. plantarum is a potential candidate for the treatment of GIOP.",
