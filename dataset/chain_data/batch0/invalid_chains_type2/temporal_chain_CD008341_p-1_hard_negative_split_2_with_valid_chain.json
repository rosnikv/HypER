        "title": "Non-infectious pulmonary complications of newer biological agents for rheumatic diseases--a systematic literature review.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD.",

        "title": "[A case of rheumatoid arthritis complicated with deteriorated interstitial pneumonia after the administration of abatacept].",
        "abstract": "We report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated with interstitial pneumonia that deteriorated after the administration of abatacept. A 55-year-old man developed RA and interstitial pneumonia. Although interstitial pneumonia was improved by high-dose glucocorticoids, various disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including infliximab were ineffective for his arthritis. Tacrolimus was effective but was discontinued due to refractory itching and diarrhea. After 2 months, he was registered on the Phase III trial of abatacept in Japan because of worsening of arthritis. From 2 days after the abatacept administration, frothy sputum frequently appeared, but sputum culture was negative. On 13 days after the administration, the interstitial shadow was deteriorated by chest CT as compared with that of 2 months before, and he was dropped out from the trial. On 27 days after the administration, the dose of prednisolone was increased from 2 to 10 mg/day for his arthritis. On 44 days after the administration, the interstitial pneumonia improved. Abatacpet might be the cause of the deterioration of the interstitial pneumonia, but other possibilities such as discontinuation of tacrolimus, flare-up of RA itself or viral infection should be considered. This is the first report of deteriorated interstitial pneumonia after the abatacept administration in the literature. Further cases are needed to identify the relation between abatacept and interstitial pneumonia, however this possibility should be always kept in mind when we use abatacept.",

        "title": "Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease: Safety of Biological Antirheumatic Drugs and Assessment of Pulmonary Fibrosis",
        "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accompanying the increased number of reports on the development or exacerbation of ILD in RA patients following therapy with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) has aroused renewed interest. Although such cases have been reported mainly in association with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the use of other biological DMARDs has also become a matter of concern. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between the use of biological DMARDs and either the development or exacerbation of ILD. Such pulmonary complications may occur in the natural course of RA regardless of the use of biological DMARDs. Since rheumatologists currently aim to achieve remission in RA patients, the administration of biological DMARDs is increasing, even for those with RA-ILD. However, there are no reliable, evidence-based guidelines for deciding whether biological DMARDs can be safely introduced and continued in RA-ILD patients. A standardized staging system for pulmonary conditions of RA-ILD patients is needed when making therapeutic decisions at baseline and monitoring during biological DMARD therapy. Based on the available information regarding the safety of biological DMARDs and the predictive factors for a worse prognosis, this review discusses candidate parameters for risk evaluation of ILD in RA patients who are scheduled to receive biological antirheumatic therapy.",

        "title": "Acute Respiratory Events in Connective Tissue Disorders",
        "abstract": "Subacute-acute, hyperacute, or even catastrophic and fulminant respiratory events occur in almost all classic connective tissue disorders (CTDs); they may share systemic life-threatening manifestations, may precipitously lead to respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support as well as a combination of specific therapeutic measures, and in most affected patients constitute the devastating end-of-life event. In CTDs, acute respiratory events may be related to any respiratory compartment including the airways, lung parenchyma, alveolar capillaries, lung vessels, pleura, and ventilatory muscles. Acute respiratory events may also precipitate disease-specific extrapulmonary organ involvement such as aspiration pneumonia and lead to digestive tract involvement and heart-related respiratory events. Finally, antirheumatic drug-related acute respiratory toxicity as well as lung infections related to the rheumatic disease and/or to immunosuppression complete the spectrum of acute respiratory events. Overall, in CTDs the lungs significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality, since they constitute a common site of disease involvement; a major site of infections related to the \u2018mater' disease; a major site of drug-related toxicity, and a common site of treatment-related infectious complications. The extreme spectrum of the abovementioned events, as well as the \u2018vicious' coexistence of most of the aforementioned manifestations, requires skills, specific diagnostic and therapeutic means, and most of all a multidisciplinary approach of adequately prepared and expert scientists. Avoiding lung disease might represent a major concern for future advancements in the treatment of autoimmune disorders.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent and severe complication of connective tissue disease (CTD). Areas covered In this narrative review, we update the most relevant differential characteristics of fibrotic ILD associated with CTD (CTD-ILD) and propose a diagnostic and therapeutic approach based on a review of the articles published between 2002 and 2022 through PubMed. Expert opinion The subset of ILD, mainly the radiological/histological pattern and the degree of fibrotic component, usually determines the prognosis and therapeutic strategy for these patients. Some patients with CTD-ILD can develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) with severe deterioration of lung function, rapid progression to chronic respiratory failure, and high mortality. PPF has been described in many CTDs, mainly in systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and requires a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic approach to improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by synovitis as the most common clinical manifestation, and interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) represents one of the most common and potentially severe extra-articular features. Our current understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of RA-ILD is limited despite the demonstration that an early identification of progressive fibrosing forms is crucial to provide timely treatment with antifibrotic therapies. While high resolution computed tomography is the gold standard technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of RA-ILD, it has been hypothesized that serum biomarkers (including novel and rare autoantibodies), new imaging techniques such as ultrasound of the lung, or the application of innovative radiologic algorithms may help towards predicting and detecting early forms of diseases. Further, while new treatments are becoming available for idiopathic and connective tissue disease-associated forms of lung fibrosis, the treatment of RA-ILD remains anecdotal and largely unexplored. We are convinced that a better understanding of the mechanisms connecting RA with ILD in a subgroup of patients as well as the creation of adequate diagnostic pathways will be mandatory steps for a more effective management of this clinically challenging entity.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To investigate the impact of disease activity and treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on all-cause mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and prevalent interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). Methods Patients with RA-ILD were selected from the biologics register Rheumatoid Arthritis: Observation of Biologic Therapy (RABBIT). Using time-varying Cox regression, the association between clinical measures and mortality was investigated. The impact of DMARDs was analysed by (1) Cox regression considering cumulative exposure (ie, treatment months divided by total months) and (2) time-varying Cox regression as main approach (treatment exposures at monthly level). Results Out of 15 566 participants, 381 were identified as RA-ILD cases with 1258 person-years of observation and 2.6 years median length of follow-up. Ninety-seven patients (25.5%) died and 34 (35.1%) of these were not receiving DMARD therapy at the time of death. Higher inflammatory biomarkers but not swollen and tender joint count were significantly associated with mortality. Compared with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), non-TNFi biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) exhibited adjusted HRs (aHRs) for mortality below 1, lacking statistical significance. This finding was stable in various sensitivity analyses. Joint aHR for non-TNFi biologics and JAKi versus TNFi was 0.56 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.97). Receiving no DMARD treatment was associated with a twofold higher mortality risk compared with receiving any DMARD treatment, aHR 2.03 (95% CI 1.23 to 3.35). Conclusions Inflammatory biomarkers and absence of DMARD treatment were associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with RA-ILD. Non-TNFi bDMARDs may confer enhanced therapeutic benefits in patients with RA-ILD.",
