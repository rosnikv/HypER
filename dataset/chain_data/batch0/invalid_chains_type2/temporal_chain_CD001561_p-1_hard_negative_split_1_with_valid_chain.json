        "abstract": "Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of a worksite health promotion programme by individual counselling on sick leave. Methods: Three municipal services of Enschede, the Netherlands, participated in this trial. A total of 299 civil servants were measured at baseline and were randomised by cluster into the intervention (n\u200a=\u200a131) or the control group (n\u200a=\u200a168). During nine months, subjects in the intervention group received a total of seven consultations, particularly aimed at increasing their physical activity level and improving their dietary habits. Both the intervention and the control subjects received written information as to several lifestyle factors. Sick leave data regarding the nine month intervention period (from May until January) were collected from each municipal service\u2019s personnel department. In addition, sick leave data concerning the nine month period pre- and post-intervention were collected. Sick leave data were analysed using multilevel analysis. Results: For both groups, the mean sick leave rate during the intervention increased compared to before the intervention. After the intervention period, the control group increased even more (from 22.9 to 27.6 days), whereas the intervention group slightly decreased (from 21.5 to 20.5 days). Median values of sick leave rate decreased for both groups. No statistically significant intervention effect was found. In both groups, the mean sick leave frequency slightly decreased over time (intervention effects were not significant). Conclusions: Results showed no significant effect of individual counselling on sick leave. Continued research investigating the effectiveness of this individual counselling programme on several health related outcomes is useful to clarify the trend observed in sick leave.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the dose\u2013response relation between moderate and vigorous physical activity and sick leave in a working population. Methods: Data were used from three large Dutch databases: two continuous, cross sectional surveys among a representative sample of the Dutch population and one prospective cohort study. A distinction was made between duration, frequency and intensity of physical activity. The outcome measure was the number of days of sick leave. Analyses of variance were used to compare sick leave (in days) for workers with different amounts of physical activity, in particular workers meeting the physical activity recommendations v those who did not. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to obtain effect estimates in the prospective cohort study, with the generalised estimating equation (GEE) method. Results: No relation was found between moderate physical activity and sick leave. In two databases, workers meeting the recommendation of vigorous physical activity (active at a vigorous level for at least three times a week) had significantly less sick leave: more than one day over two months and more than four days over a year. The duration of vigorous physical activity was not associated with sick leave. Conclusion: Physical activity at a vigorous intensity level for at least three times a week, as in the CDC/ACSM recommendation, has a positive effect on sick leave.",

Over the past few decades, the number of health promotion programmes in workplace settings has continued to grow. Though employer rationales vary, health promotion programmes may yield economic benefits in terms of, for example, reduced absenteeism, presenteeism, employee health care costs, and employee turnover.

It is the purpose of this paper to outline an evidence-based approach to promote physical activity in the business and industry sector in support of a National Physical Activity Plan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nComprehensive literature searches identified systematic reviews, comprehensive reviews, and consensus documents on the impact of physical activity interventions in the business and industry sector. A framework for action and priority recommendations for practice and research were generated.\n\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nComprehensive, multicomponent worksite programs that include physical activity components generate significant improvements in health, reduce absenteeism and sick leave, and can generate a positive financial return. Specific evidence-based physical activity interventions are presented. Recommendations for practice include implementing comprehensive, multicomponent programs that make physical activity interventions possible, simple, rewarding and relevant in the context of a social-ecological model. The business and industry sector has significant opportunities to improve physical activity among employees, their dependents, and the community at-large and to reap important benefits related to worker health and business performance.",

        "abstract": "Fitness matters for the prevention of premature death, chronic diseases, productivity loss, excess medical care costs, loss of income or family earnings, and other social and economic concerns. The workforce may be viewed as a corporate strategic asset, yet its fitness level appears to be relatively low and declining. Over the past half-century, obesity rates have doubled, physical activity levels are below par, and cardiorespiratory fitness often does not meet minimum acceptable job standards. During this time, daily occupational energy expenditure has decreased by more than 100 calories. Employers should consider best practices and design workplace wellness programs accordingly. Particular attention should be paid to human-centered cultures. Research should address ongoing surveillance needs regarding fitness of the US workforce and close gaps in the evidence base for fitness and business-relevant outcomes. Policy priorities should consider the impact of both state and federal regulations, adherence to current regulations that protect and promote worker health, and the introduction of incentives that allow employers to optimize the fitness of their workforce through supportive legislation and organizational policies.",

        "abstract": "W hat is the essence of a good life? Aristotle tells us that it is ''to serve others and to do good.'' In this issue of The Art of Health Promotion, Dr Stephen Post supports his bold recommendation for a universal prescription to do just that with a comprehensive review of the literature on the benefits of volunteering. His G2BG Rx of 100 hours, a year of volunteer work, is indeed a win-win\u2014as volunteering is a version of paying it forward that pays dividends back. 1 Dr Post asserts that no other behavioral intervention is as beneficial. Although we may not yet be able to definitively draw that conclusion, it certainly appears that volunteering\u2014beyond contributing directly to community well-being\u2014directly boosts well-being in numerous other domains. These findings support Gallup's assertion that the domains of well-being are interdependent and reinforce one another. 2 Dr Post's review clearly highlights a myriad of benefits to physical and emotional well-being for individuals of all ages. The review also cites the heightened sense of purpose experienced by cardiac patients who volunteer. Fortunately, that effect is much more universal. Volunteering is routinely credited for enhancing one's sense of purpose and meaning. 1,3 Perhaps that's in part because it can also contribute to career well-being 3 by facilitating the exploration of new fields, the development of new skills, the accumulation of experience, 1,3 improvement in communication skills, and increased cultural sensitivity. 4 Volunteering makes it easier to build a network of contacts or find a job 1,3 and can help develop leadership skills. 4 So numerous are the benefits that some employers are finding that offering opportunities to volunteer provides a business edge by increasing employee retention. 4 There are also numerous ways in which volunteering can enhance social well-being\u2014it provides opportunities to meet new people, establish friendships, be a role model for others, and obtain more social support. 1,3 Volunteers report better social networks, enhanced feelings of belonging, 5 and better family functioning. 1 Horoszowski 5 emphasizes that volunteering increases empathy, which can enhance life satisfaction. Barbara Fredrickson's broaden and build theory of positive emotions and its extension, the Upward Spiral Model of LifeStyle Change, 6 may also provide a partial explanation for the reasons volunteering is so beneficial. It turns out that giving time actually increases one's perception of having time (or ''time affluence'') 7 \u2014in part because by giving, people feel more confident, useful, \u2026",

A convenience sample of 80 students (female = 53.75%; age range = 18-25 years) participated in the study, of which 38 (47.50%) had volunteer experience. The students completed measures of self-report for volunteer work hours, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Gratitude Questionnaire. Following linear regression analysis, results indicated that volunteers reported significantly higher resilience and gratitude scores than peers who were non-volunteers. No notable interaction effect emerged after controlling for age, sex, and family monthly income. Among those with volunteer experience, results indicated that the more hours they spend volunteering, the higher their sense of resilience and gratitude.

        "abstract": "Abstract Volunteerism is influenced by varied motivational factors. As the world is still suffering from the devastating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, China, through collective efforts by the government, local people, and the international community comprising of student volunteers, has been able to reduce the rate of infection. The qualitative study involving fifteen (15) international postgraduate student volunteers explored the motivation behind their decision to volunteer in the deadly COVID-19 crisis. Participants of the study were randomly sampled from three universities. Findings of the study suggest that student volunteers were largely influenced by intrinsic-altruistic motives as opposed to extrinsic motives. The volunteers distributed mask, thermometers, checked temperatures, educated students on COVID-19, and made videos to encourage students suffering from anxiety, depression, and boredom. It was found that despite contextual challenges, the intrinsically and altruistically motivated volunteers had satisfaction to engage in volunteering activities. Volunteer management boards should ensure volunteers are well-motivated. Future research should replicate this study by investigating factors that affect the volunteering role of international students and the impact of international volunteering on well-being and work-life of volunteers.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of the present paper is to investigate Algerian medical students' intention to participate in volunteer work during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopted an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework by integrating the constructs of personal moral norms and perceived risk of COVID-19 and followed a self-administered questionnaire survey to collect data among a convenience sample of medical students (n\u00a0=\u00a0267) in five Algerian universities. The data obtained were analyzed through a hierarchical multiple regression process in which three models were considered.FindingsFindings of this study show that attitude toward volunteering, perceived behavior control (PBC), personal moral norm and subjective norm significantly and positively predicted medical students' intention to engage in volunteer work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, students' perceived risk of COVID-19 significantly and negatively predicted students' intention to participate in volunteer activities. Moreover, the authors' analyses showed that the extended TPB model explained 75.1% of the variance of intention.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study have implications for understanding medical students' volunteer behavior during health crises. Some implications are provided for the crisis and emergency managers of hospitals and policymakers to attract and recruit enough medical students' volunteers for future waves of COVID-19 or other similar health crises.Originality/valueThis is the first paper from Algeria and one of the few from Africa that identifies predictors of intentions to participate in volunteer activities among medical students.",

        "abstract": "Evidence-based psychosocial interventions can enhance communication and social abilities, leading to a favorable effect on the overall welfare and quality of life for individuals with autism and those who care for them. Despite the importance of volunteers in supporting individuals with autism and their families, there is limited research on the factors influencing individuals' decisions to participate in autism-related volunteer work. This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the various factors that shape individuals' intentions to participate in volunteer activities related to autism. A cross-sectional study design with a purposive sampling technique was conducted. Data obtained from a survey questionnaire polled ninety-nine university students\u2019 attitudes regarding the factors influencing their participatory intention in autism volunteer work. Descriptive statistics show that the participation intention level among university students was high (M=4.47, SD=0.52). There was a statistically significant strong and moderate relationship between attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy and religiosity toward participation intention. The regression analysis revealed that subjective norms, perceived behavior control and religiosity affected participatory intention. This study provided practical implications for designing and implementing effective interventions and programs to recruit and retain volunteers, as well as to promote positive social change and inclusion for people with autism.",
