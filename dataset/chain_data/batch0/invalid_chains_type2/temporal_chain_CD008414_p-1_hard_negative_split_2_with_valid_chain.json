        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNo therapy has been shown to reliably prevent the evolution of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere are a limited number of treatment options for patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease and uncontrolled studies in humans suggest that tacrolimus may be effective treatment for ulcerative colitis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThis review aims to evaluate the efficacy of tacrolimus for induction of remission in patients with corticosteroid refractory ulcerative colitis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nMEDLINE (PubMed), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the IBD/FBD review group specialized register and the ISI-Research Institute were searched (January 1997 to November 2007) to identify relevant studies all randomized trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nEach author independently reviewed potentially relevant studies to determine eligibility based on the pre-specified criteria.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nA data extraction form was developed and used to extract data from included studies. Two authors independently extracted data. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 4.2.9). The primary outcomes were induction of remission and clinical improvement, as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the patients randomized (intention to treat analysis).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nOne randomized controlled trial comparing high target serum concentration and low target serum concentration tacrolimus versus placebo was identified and included in the review. Clinical remission was observed in 19% (4/21) of patients in the high target serum concentration group, in 9% (2/22) in the low target serum concentration group and in 5% (1/20) in the placebo group (OR 2.27; 95% CI 0.35 to 14.75). A statistically significant benefit for clinical improvement at two weeks was observed. Clinical improvement was observed in 62% (13/21) of patients in the high target serum concentration group, in 36% (8/22) in the low target serum concentration group and in 10% (2/20) in the placebo group (OR 8.66; 95% CI 1.79 to 42.00; RD 0.39; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.59; NNT = 3). Patients in the high serum target concentration group were significantly more likely than placebo patients to experience adverse events related to treatment (P = 0.043). Finger tremor (n = 6) was the most common adverse event in the tacrolimus group. Other adverse events included: gastroenteritis, sepsis, sleepiness, hot flush, headache, queasiness and stomach discomfort.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nTacrolimus may be effective for short-term clinical improvement in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients enrolled in the trial and other study limitations. Insufficient treatment and follow-up intervals prevent any conclusions with regard to long term safety and efficacy. The use of tacrolimus in the clinical setting requires careful consideration of risks versus benefits as well as close monitoring for adverse events. More data from well designed and controlled studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of tacrolimus.",

        "title": "Novel topical therapies for distal colitis.",
        "abstract": "Distal colitis (DC) can be effectively treated with topical 5ASA agents. Suppositories target the rectum while enemas can reliably reach the splenic flexure. Used in combination with oral 5ASAs, the control of the inflammation is even more effective. Unfortunately, resistant DC does occur and can be extremely challenging to manage. In these patients, the use of steroids, immunosuppressants and the anti-tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 agents are often required. These, however, can be associated with systemic side effects and are not always effective. The investigation of new topical therapeutic agents is thus required as they are rarely associated with significant blood drug levels and side effects are infrequent. Some of the agents that have been proposed for use in resistant distal colitis include butyrate, cyclosporine and nicotine enemas as well as tacrolimus suppositories and tacrolimus, ecabet sodium, arsenic, lidocaine, rebamipide and Ridogrel(\u00ae) enemas. Some of these agents have demonstrated impressive results but the majority of the agents have only been assessed in small open-labelled patient cohorts. Further work is thus required with the investigation of promising agents in the context of randomized double-blinded placebo controlled trials. This review aims to highlight those potentially effective therapies in the management of resistant distal colitis and to promote interest in furthering their investigation.",

        "abstract": "Due to misunderstandings about their effectiveness and feasibility, topical (or rectal) therapies with aminosalicylates (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA) and steroids are often underused in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, many of these patients could be treated solely with rectal/topical therapies, or could benefit from them in combination with oral therapies. We review the evidence for topical therapies containing 5-ASA and budesonide in UC and discuss how these therapies can be optimized in daily practice, thereby improving compliance. Finally, we provide a brief summary of studies on the use of other topical treatments in UC, the results of which were both promising and negative.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an exceptional scenario with regard to drug targeting, as oral administration has the potential to deliver the drug directly to the site(s) of action. Consequently, retention of the drug within the intestinal lumen and tissue, rather than systemic absorption, is frequently desirable. Areas covered: In this article, the traditional drug-delivery strategies used in IBD are briefly summarized. These include rectal dosage forms and oral systems that target the lower intestine/colon by pH-, time-, microflora-, and pressure-dependent mechanisms. Then, the article offers an updated overview of recently developed delivery systems aimed to achieve maximal drug concentrations in the inflamed intestinal tissues with minimal systemic side effects. These include antibodies, small molecules, Janus kinase inhibitors, particulate carrier systems, anti-inflammatory peptides, gene therapy, and transgenic bacteria. The various approaches are reviewed, and the challenges that still remain to be overcome are discussed. Expert opinion: The molecular revolution of the past decade profoundly influenced the treatment and management of IBD. In the coming years, this trend is expected to continue. Yet, many challenges are still ahead. A strong collaborative effort by experts from different fields is encouraged and necessary to maximize our success in IBD drug targeting.",

Eudragit RL PO nanoparticles loaded with silybin were produced using solvent\u2013evaporation emulsification technique. Then, they were coated by Eudragit FS30D. Drug release was studied in different physiological environments. Colitis was induced by 4% of acetic acid in rats which received freeze-dried nanoparticles of silybin (75\u2009mg/kg/day), dexamethasone (1\u2009mg/kg/day), blank nanoparticles and normal saline orally for 5 days.

        "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study is to develop colon targeted drug delivery of chitosan microspheres with celecoxib as a model drug. Materials and Methods: Mucoadhesive microspheres were prepared using chitosan as a core polymer and coated with Eudragit S-100 by a solvent evaporation technique. The effect of different microsphere formulations was studied. Results: In vitro release study, core microspheres are found to show burst release in the first 1 h, whereas coated microspheres exhibit a controlled release, and thus suitable for colon target drug delivery. Through an in vivo study, we investigated the effect of the coated microspheres in rats exposed to experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in rats by rectal instillation of acetic acid. Rats experienced hemorrhagic diarrheic, body weight loss, rise in myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reduction of reduced glutathione (r-GSH) activity by cyclooxygenase (COX), after 5 days administration of acetic acid. Oral administration of coated microspheres (5 mg/kg) twice-a-day to rats after induction of colitis significantly attenuated the severity of the colonic injury. In addition, there was a significant reduction of MPO and COX levels but arises in the levels of GSH. Conclusion: Thus, the study provided the evidence that coated microspheres are beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with minimal side effects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study is using the targeted approach and anti-inflammatory action of the probiotic biomass to lessen the side effects of therapeutic agents of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the present study is to prepare mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles by spray drying method. The in-vitro release of the optimized formulation was 90.55\u2009\u00b1\u20092.42 in 24\u2009hr, which display controlled drug release of mesalamine at a particular region. Mesalamine loaded eudragit S-100 with probiotic microparticles (F12) presented average particle size of 4.91\u2009\u00b5m. The statistical analysis was done by one way ANOVA and then comparison test of Bonferroni was done and p values <.05 were considered as significant. The effects of spray dried microparticles over inflamed Caco-2 cell were also evaluated by determining the concentration of IL-8. From in-vivo study it was seen that pretreatment of mesalamine with probiotic prevents DNBS (Dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) induced colitis in rats and represents protective action against ulcerative colitis because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The results give the foundation for a combination of targeted approach along with the anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic which might help to decrease the problems which are seen with the traditional cure and management of ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Mesalamine is the first-line choice of drug for ulcerative colitis management. However, due to the nontargeted delivery of mesalamine, it shows side effects. The possible impact of mesalamine can be improved by coated microparticles in combination with S. boulardii for targeted delivery to the colon with the prevention of unwanted side effects. In this work, pectin-based mesalamine and S. boulardii loaded microparticles were prepared by dehydration technique and coated by an oil-in-oil solvent evaporation method and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and zeta analysis. 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was used for the induction of colitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of coated microparticles on Caco-2 cells were assessed by the determination of interleukin (IL)-8 concentration. In addition, the impact of coated microparticles on the concentration of colonic enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), lipid peroxides, and glutathione (GSH), were also evaluated. Moreover, hematological parameters, including white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were assessed. SEM data revealed that all the prepared coated microparticles had an almost spherical shape. The X-ray powder diffraction analysis of uncoated and coated microparticles showed maximum stability without any interaction. The particle size of uncoated and coated microparticles was 9.14 and 15.61\u2009\u03bcm, respectively. The zeta potential of uncoated and coated microparticles was observed to be -26.78 and -29.36\u2009mV, respectively. The prepared coated microparticles decreased the levels of lipid peroxides, MPO, and GSH significantly in colitis. In the Caco-2 cell culture model, the concentration of IL-8 is decreased significantly. The hematological observations confirmed that the prepared formulation showed a promising decrease in the levels of WBC, CRP, and ESR in diseased animals. Animal experiments revealed that cellulose acetate phthalate coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii significantly improved the colitis disease conditions of Wistar rats. Hence, cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine and S. boulardii could be recommended as adjuvant therapy to achieve a synergistic effect in the management of UC. Lay summary Mesalamine is the drug of choice for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), which inhibits mediators responsible for inflammation. We investigated the in vivo effects of cellulose acetate phthalate-coated microparticles of mesalamine with Saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic) for their efficacy against UC. Our findings evidenced that the combination of mesalamine with S. boulardii showed a synergistic effect in the 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis model by reducing the inflammation and maintains the macroscopic features. From the observed results, it can be concluded that S. boulardii can be used to enhance the individual drug's effect in the therapeutic management of UC.",

In the present work, we developed oral composite nanoparticles (MSZ@PRHS) consisting of a rough mesoporous silica (RHS) loaded with Mesalazine (MSZ) and a CAP polymer membrane for targeted relief of inflammation in colitis. At the pH values of the simulated stomach and small intestine, the release rate of MSZ from MSZ@PRHS was low, while at the pH values of the simulated colon, the release rate of MSZ was high. In dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model, compared with oral administration of the drug Mesalazine in the equivalent solution form, oral administration of PRHS loaded with drug-loaded nanoparticles can significantly alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, and improve the therapeutic effect.
