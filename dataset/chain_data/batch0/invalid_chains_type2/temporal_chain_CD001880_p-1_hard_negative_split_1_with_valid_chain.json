        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo study appetite and food choices in lean elderly women at the time of a femoral neck fracture and after 6 months of nutritional and anabolic intervention.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nForty-five nondemented women >70 years of age (mean +/- SD: 83 +/- 5 years) with a recent hip fracture and body mass index <24 kg/m2 (mean: 20.5 +/- 2.3) were interviewed about their appetite and dietary habits prior to fracture. The patients were randomized to treatment with a protein-rich liquid supplement (PR; 200 kcal and 20 g protein day(-1)) alone or in combination with nandrolone decanoate injections (PR/N) 25 mg i.m. every third week or to a control group (C). A second interview was conducted 6 months later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReduced appetite before the fracture was reported by 60%. Half of the patients did not have dessert with any of their daily meals, one-third used low-fat margarines and one-third drank water with their meals. The estimated mean daily energy intake was 6.4 +/- 1.2 MJ (1541 +/- 304 kcal) indicating that three of four subjects did not meet their energy needs. At 6 months, 40% reported reduced appetite. There was no difference in the change of appetite between the three randomized groups. Still, half of the subjects appeared to not meet their energy needs. Protein intake increased in the PR and PR/N groups, in contrast to the controls (P = 0.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReduced appetite and insufficient energy intake was recorded in lean elderly women with a femoral neck fracture. Nutritional supplementation alone or in combination with an anabolic steroid increased protein intake without adversely affecting appetite.",

All nutritional intake during the first three post-operative days was recorded, as well as post-operative morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNutritional energy intake during the first three post-operative days was median 90% of BMR and 86% of recommended protein intake. The independent risk factors for an insufficient energy intake were perioperative medical complications, and no association between low nutritional intake in the perioperative phase and the commonly used predictors of low BMI or albumin on admission was found.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPerioperative medical complications and dementia restricted nutritional intake in the perioperative phase. These factors help identify hip fracture patients in whom increased nutritional support is necessary.",

        "title": "Anaesthesia for the patient with dementia undergoing outpatient surgery",
        "abstract": "Purpose of review Dementia is common in elderly patients, and anaesthesiologists are increasingly challenged in managing these patients who are especially vulnerable. The aim of this article is to highlight some of the most important perioperative issues relating to demented patients, both regarding anaesthesia and other aspects that should be considered to ensure a quick and uncomplicated recovery. Recent findings Demented patients often receive prescribed medication that can interact with various anaesthetic drugs and cause serious side effects. The anaesthesiologist should consider this when choosing the drugs used during surgery and when relieving postoperative pain. Generally, hypnotics, opioids, and inhalational anaesthetics should be administered in lower doses and carefully titrated because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics leading to a great variability, as documented in elderly patients. Neuromuscular blocking agents, and especially rocuronium, display an increased variability in the duration of action, but the new drug sugammadex may reverse the neuromuscular block in a few minutes. Postoperative cognitive decline is more frequent in elderly patients with preexisting cognitive impairment and several preventive measurements can be provided. Summary Outpatient surgery for demented patients causes many concerns in relation to anaesthesia. Extensive drug-related problems may arise and restrictive drug usage is recommended to avoid serious complications.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction in the elderly commonly observed following anesthesia has been attributed to age-related neuronal changes exacerbated by pharmacotoxic effects. However, the extent to which these changes may persist following recovery from surgery is still largely unknown. This study investigates the long-term effects of anesthesia on cognitive functioning after orthopedic surgery in 270 elderly patients over the age of 65 who completed a computerized cognitive battery before and 8 days, 4 and 13 months after surgery. Their performance was compared to those of 310 elderly controls who completed the same neuropsychiatric evaluation at baseline and one-year interval. Multivariate analyses adjusted for socio-demographic variables, depressive symptomatology, vascular pathology as well as baseline cognitive performance. We found early and transient post-operative decline in reaction time and constructional praxis. With regard to long-term changes we observed improvement compared to controls in most verbal tasks (probably due to learning effects). On the other hand, a clear dissociation effect was observed for several areas of visuospatial functioning which persisted up to the 13-month follow-up. This specific pattern of visuospatial deficit was found to be independent of apolipoprotein E genotype and closely resembles what has recently been termed vascular mild cognitive impairment, in turn associated with subtle sub-cortical vascular changes. The observation of only minor differences between persons operated by general and regional anesthesia makes it difficult to attribute these changes directly to the anesthetic agents themselves, suggesting that cognitive dysfunction may be attributable at least in part to peri-operative conditions, notably stress and glucocorticoid exposure.",

        "abstract": "The kynurenine pathway is a fundamental mechanism of immunosuppression and peripheral tolerance. It is increasingly recognized as playing a major role in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory, neurodegenerative and malignant disorders. However, the temporal dynamics of kynurenine pathway activation and metabolite production in human immune cells is currently unknown. Here we report the novel use of flow cytometry, combined with ultra high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to sensitively quantify the intracellular expression of three key kynurenine pathway enzymes and the main kynurenine pathway metabolites in a time-course study. This is the first study to show that up-regulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), kynurenine 3-monoxygenase (KMO) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) is lacking in lymphocytes treated with interferon gamma. In contrast, peripheral monocytes showed a significant elevation of kynurenine pathway enzymes and metabolites when treated with interferon gamma. Expression of IDO-1, KMO and QPRT correlated significantly with activation of the kynurenine pathway (kynurenine:tryptophan ratio), quinolinic acid concentration and production of the monocyte derived, pro-inflammatory immune response marker: neopterin. Our results also describe an original and sensitive methodological approach to quantify kynurenine pathway enzyme expression in cells. This has revealed further insights into the potential role of these enzymes in disease processes.",

Cognition was assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CamCog). Tryptophan, kynurenines, neopterin, and vitamin B6 forms were measured in plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Non-parametric statistics, logistic regression and standardized robust regressions were applied with a false discovery rate of 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTryptophan, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid were lower in AD (Odds ratios (ORs) 0.24 -0.47; p-values <0.001 -0.01). Pyridoxal 5'phosphate did not differ between AD and controls. Kynurenine, anthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, and markers of immune activation (neopterin, kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, and the PAr index (Pyridoxic acid/(Pyridoxal 5'phosphate + Pyridoxal)) increased with age (\u03b2 0.31 -0.51; p-values <0.001 -0.006). Xanthurenic acid decreased with age (\u03b2: -0.42, p\u200a<\u200a0.001).

        "abstract": "The kynurenine (Kyn) pathway, which regulates neuroinflammation and N\u2010methyl\u2010d\u2010aspartate receptor activation, is implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Age\u2010related changes in Kyn metabolism and altered cerebral Kyn uptake along large neutral amino acid transporters, could contribute to these diseases. To gain further insight into the role and prognostic potential of the Kyn pathway in PD and AD, we investigated systemic and cerebral Kyn metabolite production and estimations of their transporter\u2010mediated uptake in the brain. Kyn metabolites and large neutral amino acids were retrospectively measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of clinically well\u2010characterized PD patients (n = 33), AD patients (n = 33), and age\u2010matched controls (n = 39) using solid\u2010phase extraction\u2010liquid chromatographic\u2010tandem mass spectrometry. Aging was disease independently associated with increased Kyn, kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid in serum and CSF. Concentrations of kynurenic acid were reduced in CSF of PD and AD patients (p = 0.001; p = 0.002) but estimations of Kyn brain uptake did not differ between diseased and controls. Furthermore, serum Kyn and quinolinic acid levels strongly correlated with their respective content in CSF and Kyn in serum negatively correlated with AD disease severity (p = 0.002). Kyn metabolites accumulated with aging in serum and CSF similarly in PD patients, AD patients, and control subjects. In contrast, kynurenic acid was strongly reduced in CSF of PD and AD patients. Differential transporter\u2010mediated Kyn uptake is unlikely to majorly contribute to these cerebral Kyn pathway disturbances. We hypothesize that the combination of age\u2010 and disease\u2010specific changes in cerebral Kyn pathway activity could contribute to reduced neurogenesis and increased excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative disease.",

Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u20133 versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95 \u00d7 10\u20138 versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u20133) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (\u03c72p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is a poorly known entity. An underlying chronic, low-grade inflammation (LGI) has been theorized as a pathophysiological mechanism. Available data on biomarkers in PCS show conflicting results. Our aim was to know whether subjects with PCS present higher levels of inflammatory markers, after a mild COVID-19. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study. Cases of mild COVID-19 in a community setting were included. We collected epidemiological data (age, sex, BMI, smoking, comorbidities), variables of the acute COVID-19 (duration, symptoms), and data at 3\u2009months after the acute phase (symptoms and laboratory test). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels were analysed. LGI was defined as CRP >0.3 and <1.0\u2009mg/dL. A subject was classified as PCS\u2009+\u2009if presented signs and symptoms >12\u2009weeks after an infection consistent with COVID-19. Five composite indices (C1\u2013C5) were developed, combining the upper ranges of biomarkers distributions. Multivariate analyses were performed. Results We analysed 121 mild COVID-19 cases (mean age = 45.7\u2009years, 56.2% women). Among the acute symptoms, women presented a higher frequency of fatigue (54.4% vs 30.2%; p\u2009=\u2009.008). PCS affected 35.8% of women and 20.8% of men (p\u2009=\u2009.07), and the most reported symptoms were fatigue (42.8%), anosmia (40%), ageusia (22.8%), dyspnea (17.1%) and myalgia (11.4%). Neutrophil count, NLR, CRP and fibrinogen showed the best correlations with PCS and were selected to develop the indices. In women PCS+, C1, C3 and C4 indices were more frequently met, while in men PCS+, C2, C5 and CRP were in the range of LGI. Anosmia, ageusia and fatigue were related to higher neutrophil counts, with sex differences. Fibrinogen levels were higher in persistent myalgia (510\u2009\u00b1\u200982\u2009mg/dL vs 394\u2009\u00b1\u200987; p\u2009=\u2009.013). In multivariable analysis, a woman with a neutrophil count above the median, or with fibrinogen level or NLR in the highest tertile, had a 4\u20135-fold increased risk of prevalent PCS. A man with CRP in the range of LGI, or fibrinogen level or a neutrophil count in the highest tertile, had a 10\u201317-fold increased risk of prevalent PCS. Conclusions The data obtained in the present cross-sectional study seems to demonstrate a consistent association between PCS and upper ranges of the neutrophil count, NLR, fibrinogen, and CRP in the LGI range. Furthermore, composite indices appear useful in detecting relationships between slight elevations of biomarkers and PCS, and our study identifies relevant sex differences in symptoms and markers regarding the PCS.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, refers to the constellation of long-term symptoms experienced by people suffering persistent symptoms for one or more months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood biomarkers can be altered in long COVID patients; however, biomarkers associated with long COVID symptoms and their roles in disease progression remain undetermined. This study aims to systematically evaluate blood biomarkers that may act as indicators or therapeutic targets for long COVID. Methods A systematic literature review in PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL was performed on 18 August 2022. The search keywords long COVID-19 symptoms and biomarkers were used to filter out the eligible studies, which were then carefully evaluated. Results Identified from 28 studies and representing six biological classifications, 113 biomarkers were significantly associated with long COVID: (1) Cytokine/Chemokine (38, 33.6%); (2) Biochemical markers (24, 21.2%); (3) Vascular markers (20, 17.7%); (4) Neurological markers (6, 5.3%); (5) Acute phase protein (5, 4.4%); and (6) Others (20, 17.7%). Compared with healthy control or recovered patients without long COVID symptoms, 79 biomarkers were increased, 29 were decreased, and 5 required further determination in the long COVID patients. Of these, up-regulated Interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor alpha might serve as the potential diagnostic biomarkers for long COVID. Moreover, long COVID patients with neurological symptoms exhibited higher levels of neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein whereas those with pulmonary symptoms exhibited a higher level of transforming growth factor beta. Conclusion Long COVID patients present elevated inflammatory biomarkers after initial infection. Our study found significant associations between specific biomarkers and long COVID symptoms. Further investigations are warranted to identify a core set of blood biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and manage long COVID patients in clinical practice.",

        "title": "Exploring the Pathophysiology of Long COVID: The Central Role of Low-Grade Inflammation and Multisystem Involvement",
        "abstract": "Long COVID (LC), also referred to as Post COVID-19 Condition, Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), and other terms, represents a complex multisystem disease persisting after the acute phase of COVID-19. Characterized by a myriad of symptoms across different organ systems, LC presents significant diagnostic and management challenges. Central to the disorder is the role of low-grade inflammation, a non-classical inflammatory response that contributes to the chronicity and diversity of symptoms observed. This review explores the pathophysiological underpinnings of LC, emphasizing the importance of low-grade inflammation as a core component. By delineating the pathogenetic relationships and clinical manifestations of LC, this article highlights the necessity for an integrated approach that employs both personalized medicine and standardized protocols aimed at mitigating long-term consequences. The insights gained not only enhance our understanding of LC but also inform the development of therapeutic strategies that could be applicable to other chronic conditions with similar pathophysiological features.",
