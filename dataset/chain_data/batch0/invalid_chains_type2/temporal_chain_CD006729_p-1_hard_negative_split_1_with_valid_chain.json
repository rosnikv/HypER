Thirty symptomatic patients were invited to undergo objective and subjective assessment of the ability to instill artificial tears with and without the Opticare.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred twenty-seven (37%) patients had had symptoms lasting at least 3 months at some time, and 85 (25%) were currently symptomatic. Many patients found difficulty using artificial tears due to problems aiming and squeezing the bottles as a result of impaired upper limb function. The Opticare statistically significantly improved the ability to squeeze out drops and get them in the eye.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Opticare device allows patients with functional impairment of the upper limb to instill artificial tears, resulting in less wastage of tears and increased independence and compliance.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate sicca symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with respect to constancy, temporal changes of prevalence, and possible risk factors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospective cohort study of 70 patients with RA was conducted over 5 years. The main variables of interest were the 6 questions on sicca symptoms used in the preliminary European criteria for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourteen patients were lost to followup. We found that 84.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 59.5-95.8) of the patients reporting sicca symptoms at baseline also reported them at followup. During the study period, sicca symptoms increased by 52.6% in general (P = 0.02) and by 80.0% for the ocular components (P = 0.04). Sicca symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 8.35, 95% CI 1.91-36.49) and pain (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.07) at baseline were identified as independent predictive factors for sicca symptoms at followup.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSicca symptoms in patients with RA are remarkably constant over time. There is also a substantial time-dependent increase in the prevalence of such symptoms. As the prevalence of ocular sicca symptoms in general populations tend to level out with age, there seems to be a disease-related increase of ocular symptoms over time in patients with RA. Present pain and sicca symptoms constitute risk factors for future sicca symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Background: It has been suggested that bacterial infections have a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). P gingivalis, a Gram-negative, anaerobic rod, is one of the major pathogens associated with periodontal disease. Objective: To examine P gingivalis infection and its effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis of human articular chondrocytes. Methods: Primary human chondrocytes cultured in monolayers were challenged with P gingivalis. Infection and invasion of P gingivalis into chondrocytes was analysed by scanning electron microscopy, double immunofluorescence and by antibiotic protection and invasion assay. Cell cycle progression of infected chondrocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry. Also, cell apoptosis was visualised by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) of DNA strand breaks and by western blot analysis. Results: Data showed that P gingivalis could adhere and infect primary human chondrocytes. After chondrocyte infection, intracellular localisation of P gingivalis was noted. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated affected cell cycle progression, with an increase of the G1 phase and a significant decrease of the G2 phase after infection. In addition, increased apoptosis of P gingivalis-infected chondrocytes was visualised by TUNEL assay and by upregulation of caspase-3 protein expression. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that P gingivalis infects primary human chondrocytes and affects cellular responses, which might contribute to the tissue damage seen in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing documentation of a link between inflammatory periodontal disease affecting the supporting structure of teeth, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Periodontitis is initiated predominantly by Gram-negative bacteria and progresses as a consequence of the host inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens. Lipopolysaccharide, a cell wall constituent stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines via the activation of signaling pathways perpetuating inflammatory pathogenesis in a cyclical manner in susceptible individuals; with an element of autoimmune stimulation, not dissimilar to the sequential events seen in RA. Periodontitis, also implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, promotes mechanisms for atherosclerosis by enhancing an imbalance in systemic inflammatory mediators; more direct mechanisms attributed to microbial products are also implicated in both RA and atherogenesis. Severe periodontal disease characterized by clinical and radiographic parameters has been associated with ischemic stroke risk, significant levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, amongst others common to both periodontitis and atherosclerosis. Existing data supports the hypothesis that persistent localized infection in periodontitis may influence systemic levels of inflammatory markers and pose a risk for RA and atherosclerosis. A common nucleus of activity in their pathogeneses provides novel paradigms of therapeutic targeting for reciprocal benefit.",

        "abstract": "The host response to bacterial plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces initiates periodontal disease and its progression affecting the supporting structures of teeth. Stressor responses of the host to plaque biofilm result in markers of inflammation that are common to diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease (Pussinen et al 2007). These inflammatory markers are relevant to periodontitis, anxiety states, associated systemic diseases and their sequelae in a bi-directional manner. The extent and clinical significance of these associations have received increasing coverage in the literature. This is largely dependent on the scale of the inflammatory loading based on the severity of periodontal inflammation at the time of examination and the number of sites involved (Norse et al 2008). Response to periodontal treatment with decreased levels of serum markers is indicative of the importance of this source of systemic inflammatory loading. The impact of inflammatory loading from the periodontium as a significant source of systemic inflammation has been an area of debate. The extent and severity of periodontal inflammation in the presenting population determine its significance in this context. It has wider implications in the context of co-morbidities in periodontal patients. In addition to the commoner co-morbidities, coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus and arthritis, other autoimmune conditions and anxiety states also show similar links. This chapter aims to provide such evidence, conflicting at times due to multifactorial presentations of clinical conditions and individual susceptibility. In relevant cases, given a sufficient impetus from inflammatory loading it highlights the importance of controlling periodontal disease in a systemically-ill population. Searches were done over the past 10-15 years, using keywords relevant to the title; subsequently limited to those representing key information focusing on inflammatory markers, their significance and relevance to periodontal, psychosomatic and cardiometabolic diseases with implications on treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background Hormonal contraceptive (HC) use may increase cardiometabolic risk; however, the effect of HC on emerging cardiometabolic and other disease risk factors is not clear. Objectives To determine the association between HC use and plasma proteins involved in established and emerging disease risk pathways. Method Concentrations of 54 high-abundance plasma proteins were measured simultaneously by LC-MRM/MS in 783 women from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured separately. ANCOVA was used to test differences in protein concentrations between users and non-users, and among HC users depending on total hormone dose. Linear regression was used to test the association between duration (years) of HC use and plasma protein concentrations. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify plasma proteomic profiles in users and non-users. Results After Bonferroni correction, 19 proteins involved in inflammation, innate immunity, coagulation and blood pressure regulation were significantly different between users and non-users (P<0.0009). These differences were replicated across three distinct ethnocultural groups. Traditional markers of glucose and lipid metabolism were also significantly higher among HC users. Neither hormone dose nor duration of use affected protein concentrations. PCA identified 4 distinct proteomic profiles in users and 3 in non-users. Conclusion HC use was associated with different concentrations of plasma proteins along various disease-related pathways, and these differences were present across different ethnicities. Aside from the known effect of HC on traditional biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, HC use also affects numerous proteins that may be biomarkers of dysregulation in inflammation, coagulation and blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: The relationship between vitamin D and cardiometabolic disease risk across ethnic groups is unclear, and it is not known whether the use of hormonal contraceptives (HCs), which affect vitamin D metabolism and are also associated with cardiometabolic disease risk, modifies this relationship. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30 nmol/L) to assess seasonal variation in concentrations of 25(OH)D, and to examine whether 25(OH)D is associated with cardiometabolic biomarkers across ethnic groups and across men, female HC nonusers, and female HC users in an ethnically diverse population of young adults living in Canada. Methods: The study population consisted of Caucasian, East Asian, and South Asian individuals (n = 1384, 69% female) aged 20\u201329 years. Participants provided overnight fasting blood samples, from which plasma 25(OH)D and cardiometabolic biomarkers were measured. Vitamin D status distributions were compared using \u03c72 tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine seasonal variations in 25(OH)D, as well as the association between 25(OH)D and cardiometabolic biomarkers, across groups. Results: Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations fluctuated seasonally among Caucasians and East Asians and across men, female HC nonusers, and female HC users, but they remained low year-round in South Asians, half of whom were vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher insulin, homeostasis model assessment\u2013estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-beta among Caucasians and East Asians and among men and female HC nonusers and with higher triglycerides among men only. No biomarkers were associated with 25(OH)D among South Asians and female HC users, although nonsignificant trends were observed for higher markers of glycemic dysregulation in those who were vitamin D deficient in both groups. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency varies between ethnic groups and is particularly high among South Asians, and it is associated with biomarkers of glycemic dysregulation; however, HC use among women may attenuate this association. Given the widespread use of HCs by women throughout the world, a better understanding of the extent to which these medications may modify the relationship between vitamin D and processes related to disease is warranted.",

Objective: We assessed which maternal and environmental characteristics were associated with 25(OH)D after supplementation with cholecalciferol. Design: Within-randomization-group analysis of participants in the Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Setting: Hospital antenatal clinics. Participants: A total of 829 pregnant women (422 placebo, 407 cholecalciferol). At 14 and 34 weeks of gestation, maternal anthropometry, health, and lifestyle were assessed and 25(OH)D measured. Compliance was determined using pill counts at 19 and 34 weeks. Interventions: 1000 IU/d of cholecalciferol or matched placebo from 14 weeks of gestation until delivery. Main Outcome Measure: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks, measured in a single batch (Diasorin Liaison). Results: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation was higher in the women randomized to vitamin D (mean [SD], 67.7 [21.3] nmol/L) compared with placebo (43.1 [22.5] nmol/L; P < .001).

This review focuses on the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)-funded component in which the aim was to (1) generate and collate early-life epigenetic data and (2) investigate early diet and epigenetic marks as predictors of later bone health. The project builds on a wealth of evidence implicating environmental factors, such as maternal diet and body composition, as influences on the long-term health and development of the offspring, and that these relationships might be mediated at least in part through epigenetic signals. Experimental studies in animal models have demonstrated that manipulation of maternal diet during pregnancy leads to altered offspring epigenetic marking and phenotype. Human studies convincingly demonstrate associations between early environment and later health and disease for outcomes across musculoskeletal, respiratory, neurodevelopmental and cardiometabolic health. The priority now is to find ways in which such observations can be translated into improved lifelong health. A key approach is to identify early biomarkers of adverse health outcomes and then to test these, and subsequent interventions, in trials aimed at identifying strategies to optimise health throughout the life course. The ALPHABET project will inform this process for musculoskeletal outcomes, and the project as a whole should help elucidate not only novel mechanisms, but also potential strategies to reduce the burden of musculoskeletal, respiratory, neurodevelopmental and cardiometabolic disease in future generations.",

We undertook an observational analysis of associations between late pregnancy energy\u2010adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E\u2010DII) scores and offspring bone outcomes in childhood. E\u2010DII scores (higher scores indicating pro\u2010inflammatory diets) were derived from food frequency questionnaires in late pregnancy in two prospective mother\u2010offspring cohorts: the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The mean (SD) offspring age at dual\u2010energy X\u2010ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning was 9.2 (0.2) years. Linear regression was used to assess associations between E\u2010DII and bone outcomes, adjusting for offspring sex and age at DXA and maternal age at childbirth, educational level, pre\u2010pregnancy body mass index (BMI), parity, physical activity level, and smoking in pregnancy. Associations were synthesized using fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis. Beta coefficients represent the association per unit E\u2010DII increment. In fully adjusted models (total n =\u20095910) late pregnancy E\u2010DII was negatively associated with offspring whole body minus head bone area (BA: \u03b2 = \u22123.68 [95% confidence interval \u22126.09, \u22121.27] cm2/unit), bone mineral content (BMC: \u03b2 = \u22124.16 [95% CI \u22126.70, \u22121.62] g/unit), and areal bone mineral density (aBMD: \u03b2 = \u22120.0012 [95% CI \u22120.0020, \u22120.0004] g.cm\u22122/unit), but there was only a weak association with BMC adjusted for BA (\u03b2 = \u22120.48 [95% CI \u22121.11, 0.15] g/unit) at 9\u2009years.

The serum level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly different across the tertiles of the DII. Women who had lower DII scores had higher T-scores and Z-scores in the BMD assessment. In the test of trends, after adjusting potential covariates, including educational level, physical activity, body mass index, and calcium, vitamin D, or multivitamin supplements, DII values were determined to be positively related to the maternal BMD lost. Conclusions: DII was positively associated with serum IL-6. Meanwhile, higher DII scores were associated with more bone mass loss in pregnant women. We recommend adhering to a lower-DII diet to preserve BMD during pregnancy.",
