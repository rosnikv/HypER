        "title": "Long-term treatment of alcoholic liver disease with propylthiouracil.",
        "abstract": "Propylthiouracil has been shown experimentally to protect against alcohol-induced hepatocellular necrosis in hypoxic conditions. An earlier, short-term study of patients with alcoholism and liver disease indicated clinical improvement with propylthiouracil, but the effect on mortality could not be assessed. In the present study, we investigated the effect of propylthiouracil on mortality in patients with alcoholic liver disease in a long-term, double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 310 compliant patients who received propylthiouracil (n = 157) or placebo (n = 153) for a maximum of two years. There were no differences between the two groups in demographic and clinical characteristics and biopsy-confirmed diagnoses at randomization, or in daily urinary alcohol levels during the study. The cumulative dropout rate over two years was not significantly different (propylthiouracil group, 0.68; placebo group, 0.60). The group receiving propylthiouracil (300 mg per day) had a cumulative mortality rate half that in the group receiving placebo (0.13 vs. 0.25 [P less than 0.05] in the total sample, and 0.25 vs. 0.55 [P less than 0.03] in a subgroup of severely ill patients [propylthiouracil group, n = 56; placebo group, n = 41]). Proportional-hazards stepwise regression analyses indicated that only propylthiouracil treatment, prothrombin time, hemoglobin levels, and mean daily urinary alcohol levels significantly affected mortality. The hazards ratio for the complete group indicated that mortality in the propylthiouracil group was 0.38 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.83) that of the placebo group. Protection by propylthiouracil was not observed in patients with high morning urinary alcohol levels. No clinically important side effects of propylthiouracil were observed at the dose used. We conclude that the administration of propylthiouracil can reduce mortality due to alcoholic liver disease.",

        "title": "Resting energy expenditure in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.",
        "abstract": "Patients with alcoholic hepatitis are typically malnourished. A hypermetabolic state would explain, at least in part, the muscle wasting observed in these patients. However, data on hypermetabolism in liver disease are limited and conflicting. In this study, we evaluated measured energy expenditure (MEE) vs predicted energy expenditure (PEE), and MEE in relation to urinary creatinine excretion in 20 patients with moderate and severe alcoholic hepatitis, and 20 controls. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had depressed creatinine height index (moderate 66%, severe 78%) demonstrating muscle depletion. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis also had depressed mean serum albumin concentrations, the moderate group 2.6 g/dl and the severe group 2.0 g/dl. The mean values for measured energy expenditure in moderate alcoholic hepatitis patients, severe alcoholic hepatitis patients, and the control group were: 1556 kcal, 1878 kcal, and 1943 kcal, respectively. The mean measured energy expenditures per g of creatinine for the same groups were: 1520 kcal, 1813 kcal, and 1043 kcal, respectively. The mean measured energy expenditure/predicted energy expenditure ratio was not increased in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared to controls. However, when related to urinary creatinine excretion, the alcoholic hepatitis patients had a mean measured energy expenditure that was 55% higher than controls. In conclusion, whereas the measured energy expenditure to predicted energy expenditure ratio was not elevated in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared to controls, the measured energy expenditure per gram of creatinine was significantly increased in alcoholic hepatitis patients, supporting the concept of alcoholic hepatitis as a hypermetabolic state.",

        "title": "Basal energy production rate and substrate use in stable cirrhotic patients",
        "abstract": "The basal energy production rate was measured using indirect calorimetry in 25 stable cirrhotic patients and 10 controls of comparable age. The endogenous substrate oxidation was also calculated by measuring urinary nitrogen excretion. The energy production rate was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls. The origins of liver disease and the degree of liver damage did not seem to influence the energy production rate. On the other hand, in cirrhotic patients, as in controls, a significant correlation was present between the energy production rate and parameters of body size, such as body weight and fat\u2010free mass. As a consequence, cirrhotic patients with poor nutritional status, with a reduced fat\u2010free mass, showed a lower energy production rate. The measured energy production rate was compared with the resting energy expenditure estimated by formulas commonly used in healthy individuals. The good agreement found between the measured energy production rate and calculated energy expenditure suggests that these formulas may be applied to stable cirrhotic patients in clinical practice. In cirrhotic patients, the oxidation of endogenous fat is the main contributor to basal energy production rate. The fat oxidation rate does not appear to be influenced by the hormonal pattern found in the cirrhotic patients. However, a significant correlation was present between fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid levels. This confirms that the prevalent fat use in cirrhotic patients is supported by the greater availability of fat\u2010derived substrates. (HEPATOLOGY 1990;12:106\u2013112).",

        "title": "Glucose Intolerance in Liver Cirrhosis: Role of Hepatic and Non-Hepatic Influences",
        "abstract": "Oral glucose tolerance was tested in a heterogeneous group of 108 patients with liver cirrhosis. Data were compared with those from 181 subjects without liver disease (44% normal, 35% impaired glucose tolerance and 21% type 2 diabetes mellitus). In cirrhosis, 27% of the patients had normal, 36% had impaired glucose tolerance, and 37% were diabetic. There was no association between glucose intolerance or diabetes and the aetiology of cirrhosis, the duration of the disease, the biochemical indicators of hepatocyte damage, cholestasis and/or liver function. Only weak associations were found between the results of quantitative liver functions tests (caffeine, xylocaine, indocyanine green) and basal and post load glucose and insulin concentrations. Cirrhotics with 1st degree relatives with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 16) did not show an increased prevalence of diabetes. Older and/or malnourished patients were more frequently glucose intolerant. Using the plasma glucose concentration 120 minutes after glucose load as the dependent variable, multivariate regression analysis showed that 54% of its variance is associated with the following variables: basal plasma glucose (36%) and free fatty acid concentration (5%), age (3%), basal glucose oxidation rate (3%), muscle mass (3%) and plasma free glycerol at 120 minutes after glucose load (3%). By contrast, the clinical state of the patients (i.e. the CHILD-Pugh score) accounted for only 2% of the variance. We conclude that glucose tolerance is variable in cirrhosis. After manifestation of liver disease, glucose intolerance or diabetes cannot be explained by the clinical, histological or biochemical signs of liver disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Nutritional support is often necessary in chronic liver disease in childhood, and when enteral nutrition is insufficient, parenteral nutrition (PN) can be envisaged as a last resort. Pediatric experience is still limited in this indication. Seven children with severe liver disease received PN for a mean duration of 105\u2003d, with additional enteral nutrition. Clinical tolerance was assessed and anthropometric and biological data were compared at the beginning and at the end of the study by the paired non\u2010parametric test of Wilcoxon. Weight change, expressed as weight\u2010for\u2010age or weight\u2010for\u2010height Z\u2010scores, increased. Conjugated bilirubin increased significantly. This retrospective study suggests that PN is a well\u2010tolerated method for maintaining nutritional status in pediatric chronic liver disease when enteral nutrition has failed.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition leading to growth failure is one of the main problems in maintainig children with chronic liver diseases. The pathogenesis of malnutrition is complex and includes reduced calorie intake, fat malabsorption, impaired protein metabolism and increased energy expenditure. The nutritional status is an important risk factor for survival post liver transplantation. Aggressive nutritional support with careful monitoring is essential, particularly where liver transplantation is considered. When the oral nutrition is inadequate, the enteral feeding with nocturnal intragastric tube should be started. In case of gastrointestinal intolerance, severe malnutrition and gastrointestinal bleeding, parenteral nutrition should be considered.",
