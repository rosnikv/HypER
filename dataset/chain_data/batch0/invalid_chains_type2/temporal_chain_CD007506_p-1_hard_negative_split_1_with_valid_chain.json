        "title": "Low-frequency electroacupuncture and physical exercise decrease high muscle sympathetic nerve activity in polycystic ovary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "We have recently shown that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with high muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Animal studies support the concept that low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and physical exercise, via stimulation of ergoreceptors and somatic afferents in the muscles, may modulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of these interventions on sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. In a randomized controlled trial, 20 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to one of three groups: low-frequency EA (n = 9), physical exercise (n = 5), or untreated control (n = 6) during 16 wk. Direct recordings of multiunit efferent postganglionic MSNA in a muscle fascicle of the peroneal nerve before and following 16 wk of treatment. Biometric, hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic parameters were measured. Low-frequency EA (P = 0.036) and physical exercise (P = 0.030) decreased MSNA burst frequency compared with the untreated control group. The low-frequency EA group reduced sagittal diameter (P = 0.001), while the physical exercise group reduced body weight (P = 0.004) and body mass index (P = 0.004) compared with the untreated control group. Sagittal diameter was related to MSNA burst frequency (Rs = 0.58, P < 0.005) in the EA group. No correlation was found for body mass index and MSNA in the exercise group. There were no differences between the groups in hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic variables. For the first time we demonstrate that low-frequency EA and physical exercise lowers high sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. Thus, treatment with low-frequency EA or physical exercise with the aim to reduce MSNA may be of importance for women with PCOS.",

        "title": "Impact of electro-acupuncture and physical exercise on hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo/amenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries. We aimed to determine whether low-frequency electro-acupuncture (EA) would decrease hyperandrogenism and improve oligo/amenorrhea more effectively than physical exercise or no intervention. We randomized 84 women with PCOS, aged 18-37 yr, to 16 wk of low-frequency EA, physical exercise, or no intervention. The primary outcome measure changes in the concentration of total testosterone (T) at week 16 determined by gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was analyzed by intention to treat. Secondary outcome measures were changes in menstrual frequency; concentrations of androgens, estrogens, androgen precursors, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites; and acne and hirsutism. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 16 wk of intervention, and after a 16-wk follow-up. After 16 wk of intervention, circulating T decreased by -25%, androsterone glucuronide by -30%, and androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol-3-glucuronide by -28% in the EA group (P = 0.038, 0.030, and 0.047, respectively vs. exercise); menstrual frequency increased to 0.69/month from 0.28 at baseline in the EA group (P = 0.018 vs. exercise). After the 16-wk follow-up, the acne score decreased by -32% in the EA group (P = 0.006 vs. exercise). Both EA and exercise improved menstrual frequency and decreased the levels of several sex steroids at week 16 and at the 16-wk follow-up compared with no intervention. Low-frequency EA and physical exercise improved hyperandrogenism and menstrual frequency more effectively than no intervention in women with PCOS. Low-frequency EA was superior to physical exercise and may be useful for treating hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea.",

        "title": "The effects of old, new and emerging medicines on metabolic aberrations in PCOS",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age that is associated with significant adverse short- and long-term health consequences. Multiple metabolic aberrations, such as insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinaemia, high incidence of impaired glucose tolerance, visceral obesity, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and dyslipidemia are associated with the syndrome. Assessing the metabolic aberrations and their long term health impact in women with PCOS is challenging and becomes more important as therapeutic interventions currently available for the management of PCOS are not fully able to deal with all these consequences. Current therapeutic management of PCOS has incorporated new treatments resulting from the better understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of old, new and emerging therapies used in the management of PCOS, on the metabolic aberrations of PCOS",

        "title": "DASH Diet, Insulin Resistance, and Serum hs-CRP in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial",
        "abstract": "Abstract This study was designed to assess the effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP in overweight and obese women with PCOS. This randomized controlled clinical trial was done on 48 women diagnosed with PCOS. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n=24) or the DASH eating pattern (n=24) for 8 weeks. The DASH diet consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. It was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. Sodium content of the DASH diet was designed to be less than 2\u2009400\u2009mg/day. The control diet was also designed to contain 52% carbohydrates, 18% protein, and 30% total fat. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8 weeks intervention to measure insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP levels. Adherence to the DASH eating pattern, compared to the control diet, resulted in a significant reduction of serum insulin levels (\u22121.88 vs. 2.89\u2009\u03bcIU/ml, p=0.03), HOMA-IR score (\u22120.45 vs. 0.80; p=0.01), and serum hs-CRP levels (\u2212763.29 vs. 665.95\u2009ng/ml, p=0.009). Additionally, a significant reduction in waist (\u22125.2 vs. \u22122.1\u2009cm; p=0.003) and hip circumference (\u22125.9 vs. \u22121\u2009cm; p<0.0001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. In conclusion, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 8 weeks in overweight and obese women with PCOS resulted in the improvement of insulin resistance, serum hs-CRP levels, and abdominal fat accumulation.

        "title": "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan: Beyond the Hypertension",
        "abstract": "A B S T R A C T Background and Objectives: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy with a reduced content of sodium, saturated fat, and total fat is introduced as an appropriate diet for hypertension. This eating pattern was basically designed to normalize blood pressure in patients with hypertension, and a large body of data could confirm its beneficial effects on blood pressure level. Here, we are going to discuss about the other aspects of this diet. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant publications up to November 2014. No limitation was considered regarding the language or publication date. Results: Some studies have proposed more useful effects of this dietary approach, other than lowering blood pressure, such as reducing insulin resistance, and controlling the fasting blood sugar and lipid profiles, proposing it as a good dietary pattern to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). There is some evidence in prospective cohorts regarding the effect of DASH-style diet on CVDs or their major subclasses like coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and heart failure (HF). A meta-analysis also showed the effects of this pattern on the indices of the glycemic control. Adherence to the DASH diet was inversely related to central obesity and metabolic syndrome features in observational studies in Iran. Furthermore, DASH is suitable for gestational diabetes mellitus, can have a role in the growth of the fetus, and may affect pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions: It is emphasized that DASH diet is suitable for whole life span. Evidence also confirms the beneficial effects of DASH on obese children. Consumption of DASH diet for 6 weeks could reduce the circulating levels of hs-CRP among adolescents with MetS. Based on the existing facts, we can conclude that DASH is a good dietary pattern for both controlling the metabolic risk factors and being healthy.",
