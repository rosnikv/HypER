        "abstract": "&NA; Various parameters of sexual functioning were assessed in a prospective, crossover investigation of 53 surgically menopausal women. Patients randomly received either an estrogen\u2010androgen combined preparation, an estrogen\u2010alone drug, an androgen\u2010alone drug, or a placebo. Also included were a group of women who had undergone hysterectomy and whose ovaries had been left intact. Two treatment phases, each of 3 months' duration, were separated by an intervening placebo month. Additionally, plasma levels of total estrogens and testosterone were assayed four times during the study concurrent with monitoring of sexual behaviors. It was clear that exogenous androgen enhanced the intensity of sexual desire and arousal and the frequency of sexual fantasies in hysterectomized and oophorectomized women. However, there was no evidence that testosterone affected physiologic response or interpersonal aspects of sexual behavior. These findings suggest that the major impact of androgen in women is on sexual motivation and not on sexual activity per se.",

        "title": "The role of androgen in the maintenance of sexual functioning in oophorectomized women.",
        "abstract": "&NA; Five aspects of sexual behavior were monitored daily in three groups of women who had undergone total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo\u2010oophorectomy approximately 4 years ago for benign disease. One group had been receiving an estrogen\u2010androgen preparation intramuscularly once a month since their surgery (E\u2010A). The second group had been receiving estrogen alone (E) and the third group of women had remained untreated. Plasma estradiol and testosterone were measured at an established baseline and again on days 2, 4, 8, 15, 21, and 28 postinjection. Women who received both sex steroids reported higher rates of sexual desire (p less than 0.01), sexual arousal (p less than 0.01), and numbers of fantasies (p less than 0.01) than those who were either given E or who were untreated. Moreover, changes in these behaviors covaried with plasma testosterone but not with plasma estradiol levels during the treatment month as the drug was being metabolized. Rates of coitus and orgasm were also higher in the E\u2010A group during the first two postinjection weeks (p less than 0.01) coincident with their higher testosterone levels. These findings imply that androgen may be critical for the maintenance of optimal levels of sexual functioning in postmenopausal women.",

For comparison, we evaluated the sexual status of 11 subjects with comparable medical, menopausal, marital, and sexual histories, whose levels of circulating testosterone were within normal limits. The results of this clinical study confirm and extend the observations originally made by Waxenberg and his colleagues in 1959, that testosterone deficiency in women produces a marked decrease in libido and sexual responsiveness. Our findings further indicate that the female androgen deficiency syndrome is often indistinguishable from psychogenic desire disorders on clinical grounds alone.",

        "abstract": "Psychosexual dysfunction is often suggested the cause of the disturbed eating habits associated with hypothalamic secondary amenorrhea.In contrast, we explored the possibility that impaired sexual function may result from reduced levels of testosterone in amenorrheic subjects as a consequence of particular lifestyles. We studied the effects of erotic stimuli in two experiments, one comparing amenorrheic women to normal controls, the other comparing testosterone substitution to a placebo treatment. The amenorrheic women had a higher incidence of lifestyle and bodily conditions identified as risk factors for amenorrhea (i.e., weight loss before the onset of amenorrhea, low body weight, strenuous exercise, and vegetarianism), lower levels of testosterone, and impaired sexual function compared with normally menstruating women. In an experimental session in which amenorrheic women were asked to produce erotic fantasies, they demonstrated a reduced capacity for sexual fantasizing, less subjective sexual excitement, and less vaginal vasocongestion (vaginal pulse amplitude). However, when exposed to the stronger of two erotic film excerpts, the degree of vaginal response of the amenorrheic women was comparable to that of normally menstruating women. Subsequently, we showed that treatment with testosterone increased vaginal vasocongestion in the same amenorrheic women during exposure to the most potent visual stimulus but had no effect on subjective sexual experience. Testosterone substitution influenced physiological aspects of sexual function, but the psychological level remained unaffected.",

        "title": "Hormones and sexuality in postmenopausal women: a psychophysiological study.",
        "abstract": "Sexual function, including vaginal atrophy, and hormonal status, were studied in 42 naturally postmenopausal women. Vaginal pulse amplitude and subjective sexual responses during self-induced erotic fantasy and during erotic films were compared with responses of a small number of premenopausal women. As predicted, vaginal atrophy was related to estrogens but not to complaints of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. No significant relationship was found between hormones and sexual function. Unexpectedly, most of the few correlations that did reach significance involved prolactin. The fact that prolactin was negatively associated with sexual desire, sexual arousal and vaginal lubrication during sexual activity, suggests that psychosocial factors are more important than hormone levels in postmenopausal sexual function. Comparisons with a number of premenopausal women revealed that although postmenopausal women displayed lower vaginal pulse amplitude responses prior to erotic stimulation than the premenopausal women, this difference disappeared during subsequent erotic stimulation. We argued that this finding can be interpreted as being supportive of the notion that complaints of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia should not be attributed to vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. Rather, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia seem to reflect sexual arousal problems.",

        "abstract": "Aims: To compare the effects of 3 months' tibolone treatment with the effects of placebo on sexual function (in particular, vaginal blood flow, and sexual desire and arousability) and climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was conducted in 38 postmenopausal women who received tibolone 2.5 mg/day and placebo. Vaginal blood flow during erotic stimulation by fantasy and film was measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph and subjects completed sexual function questionnaires and daily diaries. Results: Tibolone significantly increased baseline vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) levels compared with placebo. There were significant treatment differences in VPA in favor of tibolone during fantasy periods but not during erotic film stimulation. Tibolone was associated with significant increases in sexual desire, and the frequency of arousability and of sexual fantasies compared with those with placebo. Vaginal lubrication was significantly improved on tibolone. Twenty-five of 38 (66%) subjects correctly guessed when they were on active treatment. Tibolone was well tolerated. Conclusions: Tibolone was associated with significant improvements in sexual function in postmenopausal women, reflecting both its estrogenic and androgenic properties. There were significantly greater increases in vaginal blood flow with tibolone in response to erotic fantasy but not film, suggesting two possible pathways of female sexual response.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\ntibolone at usual doses of 2.5 mg/day in postmenopausal women has been shown to improve climacteric complaints, without affecting endometrial thickness and lipid profile or blood glucose. However, the potentially similar efficacy, but better tolerability, of a low dose of this drug (1.25 mg) has never been established.\n\n\nMETHODS\n162 healthy, non-obese, post-menopausal women, aged 40-65 years, with an intact uterus were enrolled in a national, single centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial. After 1 week of runin, patients were treated for 24 weeks with placebo, tibolone 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg/day. During the study laboratory tests, endometrial ultrasound scans and mammography were performed. Occurrence of menopausal signs and symptoms, including vaginal bleeding, and quality of sexual life were also checked.\n\n\nRESULTS\nin the 120 patients terminating the study without major protocol violations, climacteric symptoms were similarly improved by tibolone 1.25 and 2.5 mg (78% and 90% reduction at week 24 for hot flushes, 36% and 34% for sweating episodes and 44% and 51% for vaginal dryness), but not by placebo. Benefits occurred earlier in the group treated with tibolone 2.5 mg. Quality of sexual life was almost invariably improved by tibolone as compared to placebo, but improvement occurred earlier in the tibolone 1.25 mg group. Severity of vaginal bleeding was not different between placebo and active treatment groups, except at week 12 when was higher. At the end of treatment vaginal bleeding occurred in 15% of patients treated with placebo, 14% treated with tibolone 1.25 mg and 12% treated with tibolone 2.5 mg. Endometrial thickness and breast density were not changed by treatment, as well as FSH, 17-beta-estradiol, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose. Adverse events were reported by 14.7%, 26.7% and 24.4% of patients treated with placebo, tibolone 1.25 mg and tibolone 2.5 mg/day, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\ntibolone at doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg/day given for 24 weeks to postmenopausal women displayed similar efficacy and safety profiles, though were more effective than placebo. Tibolone 1.25 mg induced a more gradual relief from climacteric symptoms and a more prompt improvement of sexual function.",

        "title": "Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods are associated with many symptoms, including sexual complaints.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched for articles in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ISI Web of Knowledge and OpenGrey. The last search was performed in December 2012.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials comparing HT to either placebo or no intervention (control). We considered as HT estrogens alone; estrogens in combination with progestogens; synthetic steroids (for example tibolone); or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (for example raloxifene, bazedoxifene). Studies of other drugs possibly used in the relief of menopausal symptoms were excluded. We included studies that evaluated sexual function using any validated assessment tool. The primary outcome was a composite score for sexual function and the scores for individual domains (arousal and sexual interest, orgasm, and pain) were secondary outcomes. Studies were selected by two authors independently.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were independently extracted by two authors and checked by a third. Risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two authors. We contacted study investigators as required. Data were analysed using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risk (RR). We stratified the analysis by participant characteristics with regard to menopausal symptoms. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThe search retrieved 2351 records from which 27 studies (16,393 women) were included. The 'symptomatic or early post-menopausal' subgroup included nine studies: perimenopausal women (one study), up to 36 months postmenopause (one study), up to five years postmenopause (one study), experiencing vasomotor or other menopausal symptoms (five studies), or experiencing hot flushes and sexual dysfunction (one study). The 'unselected postmenopausal women' subgroup included 18 studies, which included women regardless of menopausal symptoms and permitted the inclusion of women with more than five years since the final menstrual period. No studies were restricted to women with sexual dysfunction. Only five studies evaluated sexual function as a primary outcome. Eighteen studies were deemed at high risk of bias, and the other nine studies were at unclear risk of bias. Twenty studies received commercial funding.Findings for sexual function (measured by composite score):For estrogens alone versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the SMD and 95% CI were compatible with a small to moderate benefit in sexual function for the HT group (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.54, P < 0.00001, 3 studies, 699 women, I\u00b2 = 55%, high-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.34, P = 0.08, 2 studies, 478 women, I\u00b2 = 44%, low-quality evidence). The subgroups were not pooled because of considerable heterogeneity.For estrogens combined with progestogens versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the 95% CI was compatible with a small to moderate benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64, P = 0.0003, 1 study, 335 women, moderate-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.20, P = 0.10, 3 studies, 1314 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The subgroups were not pooled because of considerable heterogeneity.For tibolone versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.26, P = 0.05, 1 study, 883 women, low-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a moderate benefit (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.71, P = 0.03, 2 studies, 142 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). In the combined analysis, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29, P = 0.008, 3 studies, 1025 women, I\u00b2 = 20%).For SERMs versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a moderate benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.50, P = 0.09, 1 study, 215 women, low-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with small harm to a small benefit (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.29, P = 0.72, 1 study, 283 women, low-quality evidence). In the combined analysis, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.31, P = 0.16, 2 studies, 498 women, I\u00b2 = 2%).A comparison of SERMs combined with estrogens versus control was only evaluated in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women. The 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.43, P = 0.05, 1 study, 542 women, moderate-quality evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nHT treatment with estrogens alone or in combination with progestogens was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, when used in women with menopausal symptoms or in early postmenopause (within five years of amenorrhoea), but not in unselected postmenopausal women. Evidence regarding other HTs (synthetic steroids and SERMs) is of low quality and we are uncertain of their effect on sexual function. The current evidence does not suggest an important effect of tibolone or of SERMs alone or combined with estrogens on sexual function. More studies evaluating the effect of synthetic steroids, SERMS and the association of SERM + estrogens would improve the quality of the evidence for the effect of these treatments on sexual function in peri and postmenopausal women. Future studies should also evaluate the effect of HT solely among women with sexual complaints.",
