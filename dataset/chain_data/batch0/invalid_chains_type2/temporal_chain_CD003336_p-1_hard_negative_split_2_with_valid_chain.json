        "abstract": "Summary Many studies suggest a higher incidence of thromboembolic syndromes such as stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with heart failure (HF), particularly those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. As a result, some clinicians have chosen to treat patients with HF with anticoagulants as primary prevention against thromboembolic events. However, this practice is not well-supported by scientific data. Retrospective analyses of large HF trials have yielded contradictory results and randomised trials designed to specifically address this question have been under-populated and under-powered. As a result, there is no general consensus among professional societies in either recommending or advising against anticoagulants in HF. We hope that ongoing clinical trials, WARCEF in particular, will yield results that will guide clinicians in deciding for or against routine use of anticoagulants in HF.",

        "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (HF) with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction is common and remains an extremely serious disorder with a high mortality and morbidity. Many complications related to HF can be related to thrombosis. Epidemiological and pathophysiological data also link HF to an increased risk of thrombosis, leading to the clinical consequences of sudden death, stroke, systemic thrombo\u2010embolism, and/or venous thrombo\u2010embolism. This consensus document of the Heart Failure Association (EHFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis reviews the published evidence and summarizes \u2018best practice\u2019, and puts forward consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and assist management decisions in everyday clinical practice. In HF patients with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation is recommended, and the CHA2DS2\u2010VASc and HAS\u2010BLED scores should be used to determine the likely risk\u2013benefit ratio (thrombo\u2010embolism prevention vs. risk of bleeding) of oral anticoagulation. In HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who are in sinus rhythm there is no evidence of an overall benefit of vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) on mortality, with risk of major bleeding. Despite the potential for a reduction in ischaemic stroke, there is currently no compelling reason to use warfarin routinely for these patients. Risk factors associated with increased risk of thrombo\u2010embolic events should be identified and decisions regarding use of anticoagulation individualized. Patient values and preferences are important determinants when balancing the risk of thrombo\u2010embolism against bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulants that offer a different risk\u2013benefit profile compared with warfarin may appear as an attractive therapeutic option, but this would need to be confirmed in clinical trials.",

The main objective of this study was to determine LXA4 plasma levels in PE women. The correlations among LXA4 levels, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP) levels, and clinical/laboratory parameters of the studied participants were also investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLXA4 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 23 nonpregnant, 26 normotensive pregnant, and 27 PE women (early PE (N = 10) and late PE (N = 17)), according to gestational age (GA) at clinical symptoms onset). The clinical/laboratory parameters included in Spearman's correlation analysis were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, platelet count, proteinuria, and white blood cell count (WBC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nLXA4 levels were higher in PE women than in nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women, and similar between nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women. LXA4 plasma levels were higher in early PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA < 34 weeks) and in late PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA \u2265 34 weeks). No significant differences were detected between early and late PE. LXA4 levels were positively correlated with us-CRP levels, SBP, DBP, and WBC. No significant correlation was detected between LXA4 levels and the other laboratory parameters.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChronic inflammation in PE, in spite of increased levels of LXA4, points to a possible failure in this regulatory pathway. Further studies are necessary to clarify this issue and to evaluate the role of LXA4 and other proresolving mediators of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PE.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: The timely resolution of inflammation is essential to restore tissue homeostasis and to avoid chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution of inflammation is an active process modulated by various proresolving mediators, including annexin A1 (AnxA1) and specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), which counteract excessive inflammatory responses and stimulate proresolving mechanisms. Areas covered: The protective effects of AnxA1 and SPMs have been extensively explored in pre-clinical animal models. However, studies investigating the function of these molecules in human diseases are just emerging. This review highlights recent advances on the role of proresolving mediators, and pharmacological opportunities of promoting resolution pathways in preclinical models and patients with various human diseases. Expert opinion: Dysregulation or \u2018failure\u2019 in proresolving mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Altered levels of proresolving mediators were found in a wide range of human diseases. In some cases, AnxA1 and SPMs are up-regulated in human blood and tissues but fail to engage in proresolving signaling and, hence, to regulate excessive inflammation. Thus, the new concept of \u2018resolution pharmacology\u2019 could be applied to compensate deficiency of endogenous proresolving mediators\u2019 generation and/or possible failures in the engagement of resolution pathways observed in many chronic inflammatory diseases.",

        "title": "Butyrate Modulates Inflammation in Chondrocytes via GPR43 Receptor",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint degenerative biomechanical disorder involving immunity, metabolic alterations, inflammation, and cartilage degradation, where chondrocytes play a pivotal role. OA has not effective pharmacological treatments and new therapeutic targets are needed. Adipokines contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation in OA. Here, we explored novel molecular mechanisms of sodium butyrate (BuNa) in modulating inflammation and chemotaxis in chondrocytes, demonstrating the direct involvement of its G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-43. Methods: ATDC5 murine chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, in the presence or not of BuNa, for 24 h. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory mediators and structural proteins. Results: Butyrate reduced the expression of canonic pro-inflammatory mediators (Nos2, COX-2, IL-6), pro-inflammatory adipokines (lipocalin-2 and nesfatin-1) and adhesion molecule (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes, inhibiting several inflammatory signalling pathways (NF\u03baB, MAPKinase, AMPK-\u03b1, PI3K/Akt). Butyrate also reduced metalloproteinase production and limited the loss of type II collagen in IL-1\u03b2-inflamed chondrocytes. The chemoattractant effect of butyrate, after different inflammatory challenges, was revealed by increased annexin (AnxA)1 levels and chemokines expression. The chemoattractant and anti-inflammatory activities of butyrate were completely blunted by GPR43 silencing using RNA interference. Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest the potential application of sodium butyrate as a novel candidate in a multi-target approach for the treatment of chondrocyte inflammation and cartilage degenerative process.",

        "abstract": "Gut microbes influence tumor development and progression in the intestines and may provide a novel paradigm for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut dysbiosis may be associated with the development and progression of CRC. Identifying the interactions between the colonic tract and gut microbiota may provide novel information relevant to CRC prevention. The present study examined the effects of butyrate-producing Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (B. pullicaecorum) on mice with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced CRC and the microbial metabolite of B. pullicaecorum on CRC cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the mouse colon tissues and reverse transcription PCR of CRC cells were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) transporter solute carrier family 5 member 8 (SLC5A8) and G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43). In CRC-bearing mice fed B. pullicaecorum, DMH-induced CRC regressed, body weight increased and serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels decreased. Notably, SLC5A8 and GPR43 were diffusely and moderately to strongly expressed in the neoplastic epithelial cells and underlying muscularis propria in the colons of the mice. In conclusion, administration of B. pullicaecorum or its metabolites improved the clinical outcome of CRC by activating the SCFA transporter and/or receptor. These results indicated that B. pullicaecorum was a probiotic with anti-CRC potential.",

        "abstract": "This review describes current evidence supporting butyrate impact in the homeostatic regulation of the digestive ecosystem in health and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Butyrate is mainly produced by bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum. It stimulates mature colonocytes and inhibits undifferentiated malignant and stem cells. Butyrate oxidation in mature colonocytes (1) produces 70\u201380% of their energetic requirements, (2) prevents stem cell inhibition by limiting butyrate access to crypts, and (3) consumes oxygen, generating hypoxia and maintaining luminal anaerobiosis favorable to the microbiota. Butyrate stimulates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the GPR41 and GPR109A receptors, and inhibits HDAC in different cell types, thus stabilizing the gut barrier function and decreasing inflammatory processes. However, some studies indicate contrary effects according to butyrate concentrations. IBD patients exhibit a lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and butyrate content. Additionally, colonocyte butyrate oxidation is depressed in these subjects, lowering luminal anaerobiosis and facilitating the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae that contribute to inflammation. Accordingly, gut dysbiosis and decreased barrier function in IBD seems to be secondary to the impaired mitochondrial disturbance in colonic epithelial cells.",

        "abstract": "More and more studies have shown that understanding microbe-disease associations cannot only reveal the pathogenesis of diseases, but also promote the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Because traditional medical experiments are time-consuming and expensive, many computational methods have been proposed in recent years to identify potential microbe-disease associations. In this study, we propose a method based on heterogeneous network and metapath aggregated graph neural network (MAGNN) to predict microbe-disease associations, called MATHNMDA. First, we introduce microbe-drug interactions, drug-disease associations, and microbe-disease associations to construct a microbe-drug-disease heterogeneous network. Then we take the heterogeneous network as input to MAGNN. Second, for each layer of MAGNN, we carry out intra-metapath aggregation with a multi-head attention mechanism to learn the structural and semantic information embedded in the target node context, the metapath-based neighbor nodes, and the context between them, by encoding the metapath instances under the metapath definition mode. We then use inter-metapath aggregation with an attention mechanism to combine the semantic information of all different metapaths. Third, we can get the final embedding of microbe nodes and disease nodes based on the output of the last layer in the MAGNN. Finally, we predict potential microbe-disease associations by reconstructing the microbe-disease association matrix. In addition, we evaluated the performance of MATHNMDA by comparing it with that of its variants, some state-of-the-art methods, and different datasets. The results suggest that MATHNMDA is an effective prediction method. The case studies on asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) further validate the effectiveness of MATHNMDA.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has shown that microbes play significant roles in human health and diseases. Therefore, identifying microbe-disease associations is conducive to disease prevention. In this article, a predictive method called TNRGCN is designed for microbe-disease associations based on Microbe-Drug-Disease Network and Relation Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN). First, considering that indirect links between microbes and diseases will be increased by introducing drug related associations, we construct a Microbe-Drug-Disease tripartite network through data processing from four databases including Human Microbe-Disease Association Database (HMDAD), Disbiome Database, Microbe-Drug Association Database (MDAD) and Comparative Toxicoge-nomics Database (CTD). Second, we construct similarity networks for microbes, diseases and drugs via microbe function similarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, respectively. Based on the similarity networks, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract main features of nodes. These features will be input into the RGCN as initial features. Finally, based on the tripartite network and initial features, we design two-layer RGCN to predict microbe-disease associations. Experimental results indicate that TNRGCN achieves best performance in cross validation compared with other methods. Meanwhile, case studies for Type 2 diabetes (T2D), Bipolar disorder and Autism demonstrate the favorable effectiveness of TNRGCN in association prediction.",

        "abstract": "The growing microbial resistance to traditional medicines necessitates in-depth analysis of medicine-microbe interactions (MMIs) to develop new therapeutic strategies. Widely used artificial intelligence models are limited by sparse observational data and prevalent noise, leading to over-reliance on specific data for feature extraction and reduced generalization ability. To address these limitations, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), independent subspaces, and collaborative decoding techniques into the masked graph autoencoder (Mask GAE) framework, creating an innovative MMI prediction model with enhanced accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. First, we apply Bernoulli distribution to randomly mask parts of the medicine-microbe graph, advancing self-supervised training and reducing noise impact. Additionally, the independent subspace technique enables graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn weights independently across different feature subspaces, enhancing feature expression. Fusing the multi-layer outputs of GNNs effectively reduces information loss caused by masking. Moreover, using KANs for advanced nonlinear mapping enhances the learnability and interpretability of weights, deepening the understanding of complex MMIs. These measures significantly enhanced the accuracy, generalization, and interpretability of our model in MMI prediction tasks. We validated our model on three public datasets with results showing that our model outperformed existing leading models.
