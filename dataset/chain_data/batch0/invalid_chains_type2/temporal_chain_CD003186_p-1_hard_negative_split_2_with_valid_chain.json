        "abstract": "Objective To define the cardiovascular effects of lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease. Design Collaborative prospective meta-analysis of randomised trials. Data sources and eligibility Participating randomised trials of drugs to lower blood pressure compared with placebo or each other or that compare different blood pressure targets, with at least 1000 patient years of follow-up per arm. Main outcome measures Major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) in composite and individually and all cause death. Participants 26 trials (152\u2009290 participants), including 30\u2009295 individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Data extraction Individual participant data were available for 23 trials, with summary data from another three. Meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated with a random effects model. Results Compared with placebo, blood pressure lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced eGFR (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P=1.00 for homogeneity). The results were similar irrespective of whether blood pressure was reduced by regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics/\u03b2 blockers. There was no evidence that the effects of different drug classes on major cardiovascular events varied between patients with different eGFR (all P>0.60 for homogeneity). Conclusions Blood pressure lowering is an effective strategy for preventing cardiovascular events among people with moderately reduced eGFR. There is little evidence from these overviews to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease.",

        "title": "Practical Clinical Trials in Psychopharmacology: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Abstract Practical clinical trials (PCTs) are randomized experiments under typical practice conditions with the aim of testing the \u201creal-life\u201d benefits and risks of therapeutic interventions. Influential PCTs have been conducted in cardiology, oncology, and internal medicine. Psychotropic medications are widely and increasingly used in medical practice. This review examines recent progress in conducting PCTs in psychopharmacology. The January 2000 to October 2014 MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications of PCTs with at least 100 subjects per treatment arm. Most PCTs in psychiatry evaluated mental health services or psychosocial interventions rather than specific pharmacotherapies. Of 157 PCTs in psychiatry, 30 (19%) were in psychopharmacology, with a median of 2 publications per year and no increase during the period of observation. Sample size ranged from 200 to 18,154; only 11 studies randomized 500 patients or more. Psychopharmacology PCTs were equally likely to be funded by industry as by public agencies. There were 10 PCTs of antidepressants, for a total of 4206 patients (in comparison with at least 46 PCTs of antihypertensive medications, for a total of 208,014 patients). Some psychopharmacology PCTs used suicidal behavior, treatment discontinuation, or mortality as primary outcome and produced effectiveness and safety data that have influenced both practice guidelines and regulatory decisions. Practical clinical trials can constitute an important source of information for clinicians, patients, regulators, and policy makers but have been relatively underused in psychopharmacology. Electronic medical records and integrated practice research networks offer promising platforms for a more efficient conduct of PCTs.",

        "title": "Twenty years of progress in paediatric psychopharmacology: accomplishments and unmet needs",
        "abstract": "The systematic assessment of the efficacy and safety of psychiatric medications in children and adolescents started about 20 years ago. Since then, a considerable number of randomised clinical trials have been conducted, including also a series of publicly funded comparative effectiveness studies to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of medications relative to psychosocial interventions, alone or combined with medications. On the whole, these studies have been informative of the paediatric pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of the most commonly used psychotropics. As a consequence, a number of meta-analyses have been conducted that have documented both the benefits and harms of the most common medication groups, such as stimulants, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Evidence-based practice guidelines have been produced, and clinicians can now better estimate the therapeutic value and the risk of treatment, at least at the group mean level. However, most clinical trials have been conducted in research settings, and this limits the generalisability of the results. There is a need for evaluating treatment effects under usual practice conditions, through practical trials. The ongoing debate about the proper role of pharmacotherapy in child mental health can be advanced by comparative effectiveness research to assess the benefit/risk ratio of pharmacotherapy vis-\u00e0-vis alternative treatment modalities. In addition, analyses of large population databases can better inform on the impact of early treatment on important distal outcomes, such as interpersonal functioning, social and occupational status, quality of life and risk for disability or mortality. Thus far, paediatric psychopharmacology has been mostly the application to children of medications that were serendipitously discovered and developed for adults. By focusing on the neurobiological mechanisms of child psychopathology, it may be possible to identify more precise pharmacological targets and arrive at a truly developmental psychopharmacology.",
