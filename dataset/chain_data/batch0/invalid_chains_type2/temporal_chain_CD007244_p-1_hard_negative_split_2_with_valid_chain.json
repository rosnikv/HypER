        "abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the effect of periodized exercise training with and without Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in early postmenopausal women. Methods:A total of 128 women were randomly assigned to three subgroups: exercise (EG, n = 43), exercise and CR supplementation (EGCR, n = 43), and wellness control (control group [CG], n = 42). Both exercise groups performed a periodized exercise program with high-intensity-resistance/high-impact exercise dedicated to bone parameters interspersed by blocks of 10 weeks of training focusing on CHD parameters. In addition to the exercise program, the EGCR was supplemented with 40 mg/day of CR according to the specification of the manufacturer. A low-intensity exercise program of 60 minutes per week for a period of 10 weeks interspersed with 10-week blocks without exercise was performed in the CG. Primary endpoints were BMD and 10-year CHD risk proposed by Wilson. Secondary endpoints were body composition and menopausal symptoms. Results:BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained in both exercise groups (EG, \u22120.1% \u00b1 2.2%, P = 0.74; EGCR, \u22120.4% \u00b1 2.4%, P = 0.40) and significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the CG (2.0% \u00b1 2.0%). Both exercise groups significantly differed from the CG (P = 0.001 and 0.005 for the EG and EGCR, respectively); however, no differences between the exercise groups with and without CR was determined. Although slight increases in femoral neck BMD were determined in both exercise groups (EG, 0.5% \u00b1 3.0%, P = 0.36; EGCR, 0.4% \u00b1 3.1%, P = 0.52), a reduction was assessed in the CG (\u22120.6% \u00b1 2.7%, P = 0.29). No significant differences were determined between the groups. The 10-year CHD risk significantly increased in the EGCR (12.9% \u00b1 25.1%, P = 0.018) and in the CG (16.5% \u00b1 27.8%, P = 0.007). The EG did not show corresponding changes (\u22122.7% \u00b1 21.9%, P = 0.60). However, no significant between-group differences were observed. Conclusions:In conclusion our exercise program favorably affected bone, menopausal symptoms, lean body mass, and, to a smaller extent, 10-year CHD risk in early postmenopausal women. Adjuvant supplementation of CR did not enhance these positive effects.",

        "title": "Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOsteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue. Prevention of osteoporotic-related fractures is dependent on the ability to detect individuals with low bone mass, including those women who are asymptomatic. Treatment of osteoporosis involves the use of either anti-resorptive (e.g. estrogen and bisphosphonate) or bone formation agents (e.g. fluoride and PTH). The value of exercise as an intervention for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss is a controversial subject.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo examine the effectiveness of exercise therapy at preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry up to January 2000 according to the methods suggested by Dickersin et al and Haynes et al and the Cochrane Handbook. We hand searched reference lists and consulted content experts.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nThis review was proceeded by a peer reviewed protocol published in the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which met our predetermined inclusion criteria.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nThe same two reviewers abstracted the data using predetermined forms and assessed trial quality using a validated assessment tool. For dichotomous outcomes (fractures), relative risks were calculated using fixed effects models. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the percentage change from baseline were calculated. Where heterogeneity existed (determined by a chi square test), a random effects model was used.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nEighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. The trials had a mean methodological quality score of 2.53. Aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises were all effective on the BMD of the spine. The WMD for the combined aerobics and weight bearing program on the spine was 1.79 [95%CI (0.58, 3.01)]. The analyzed results showed walking to be effective on both BMD of the spine 1.31[95%CI (-0.03, 2.65) and the hip 0.92[95%CI (0.21, 1.64). Aerobic exercise was effective in increasing BMD of the wrist 1.22[95%CI (0.71, 1.74)].\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nAerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises are all effective in increasing the BMD of the spine in postmenopausal women. Walking is also effective on the hip. The quality of the reporting of the trials in the meta-analysis was low, in particular, in the areas of allocation concealement and blinding.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate at 5 years whether an initial 2 year home based strength training period imposes sustained effects on muscle strength, bone mineral density (BMD), structural joint damage, and on disease activity in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Seventy patients were randomised either to perform home based strength training with loads of 50\u201370% of repetition maximum (EG) or range of motion exercises (CG). Both groups were encouraged to take part in aerobic activities 2\u20133 times a week. Maximal muscle strength of different muscle groups was measured by dynamometers, and BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine by dual x ray densitometry. Disease activity was assessed by the 28 joint disease activity score, and joint damage by x ray findings. Results: 62 patients completed 2 years\u2019 training and 59 patients attended check up at 5 years. Mean (SD) maximum muscle strength indices increased from baseline to 2 years\u2014in EG from 212 (78) kg by a mean (95% CI) of 68 (55 to 80) and in CG from 195 (72) kg by 35 (13 to 60) kg\u2014and remained at that level for the next 3 years. Development of BMD in EG tended to be more favourable than that in CG. Muscle strength training was not detrimental to joint structures or disease activity. Conclusion: The patients\u2019 exercise induced muscle strength gains during a 2 year training period were maintained throughout a subsequent self monitored training period of 3 years. Despite substantial training effects in muscle strength, BMD values remained relatively constant. Radiographic damage remained low even at 5 years.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the effectiveness of 2 Internet-based physical activity interventions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 160 physically inactive patients with RA who had a computer with Internet access were randomly assigned to an Internet-based physical activity program with individual guidance, a bicycle ergometer, and group contacts (individualized training [IT] group; n = 82) or to an Internet-based program providing only general information on exercises and physical activity (general training [GT] group; n = 78). Outcome measures included quantity of physical activity (questionnaire and activity monitor), functional ability, quality of life, and disease activity (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of physically active patients was significantly greater in the IT than in the GT group at 6 (38% versus 22%) and 9 months (35% versus 11%; both P < 0.05) regarding a moderate intensity level for 30 minutes in succession on at least 5 days a week, and at 6 (35% versus 13%), 9 (40% versus 14%), and 12 months (34% versus 10%; all P < 0.005) regarding a vigorous intensity level for 20 minutes in succession on at least 3 days a week. In general, there were no statistically significant differences regarding changes in physical activity as measured with an activity monitor, functional ability, quality of life, or disease activity.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn Internet-based physical activity intervention with individually tailored supervision, exercise equipment, and group contacts is more effective with respect to the proportion of patients who report meeting physical activity recommendations than an Internet-based program without these additional elements in patients with RA.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the engagement in and satisfaction with an Internet-mediated physical activity intervention with individual supervision in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe intervention studied was one of the two strategies aimed at enhancing physical activity in RA patients that were being compared in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 82 patients, all experienced in using Internet and e-mail and registered at three different rheumatology out-patient clinics, were randomly allocated to the Internet-mediated individualized intervention (52 weeks). They had access to personal physical activity schedules and received individual supervision by a physical therapist by means of weekly e-mail feedback. In addition, telephone contacts, an online discussion forum, six face-to-face group meetings and electronic newsletters were offered. Besides registration of returned physical activity schedules, engagement and satisfaction were measured through questionnaires.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median physical activity schedule return rate of the 82 participants was 55%. The mean number of patients logging into the website at least once a week was 53 (70%) over 12 months. Of all patients, 69 returned the questionnaires (response 84%). Telephone contacts were used by 38/67 patients (57%), the mean (SD) number of attended group meetings was 3.1 (1.5) and the discussion forum comprised 15 posted messages. Overall, the proportions of patients being (very) satisfied with the amount of e-mail contacts, telephone contacts, usefulness of website information, physical activity schedules, group meetings and website layout were >/=85%. A smaller proportion of patients were satisfied with the links to other websites (68%), the newsletters (55%) and the online discussion forum (32%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPhysical activity schedules with weekly feedback by e-mail, telephone contacts and a limited number of group meetings were frequently used website tools and modes of communication of an Internet-based physical activity intervention, with high-satisfaction rates from RA patients. Discussion forum and newsletters were less used and appreciated. Caution should be taken when extrapolating the results found to groups of patients who are not experienced Internet and e-mail users or patients with more severe physical disabilities.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: A significant percentage of obese patients suffer from binge eating disorder (BED), with negative consequences on psychological health, quality of life, weight loss treatment and maintenance. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), delivered in traditional or self-help format, is effective in reducing BED symptoms. To improve dissemination, a self-help treatment program composed of eleven CBT based modules was implemented on the Internet and evaluated in a population of adult obese patients with BED. Method: Forty-two obese BED patients wait-listed for a multi-disciplinary obesity treatment took part in the study. Twenty-two patients completing the six-month online guided self-help treatment program were compared to a control group of twenty patients without intervention. Both groups were evaluated before and after six months of Internet self-help treatment or waiting list. A follow-up evaluation was carried out six months later. Results: Participants in the online self-help treatment program showed higher binge eating abstinence rates, lower EDE-Q shape and weight concerns, and improved TFEQ disinhibition of eating and hunger scores compared to the control group. They also scored better on psychological health and quality of life measures after intervention, and gains were maintained at follow-up. No effect was found regarding BMI. The number of modules completed was correlated with a better quality of life improvement at post evaluation. Participants rated the program as useful and easy to use. Conclusion: The Internet seems to be a valuable tool for disseminating CBT for BED obese patients. Acceptance of new technology was good in this population. Further research is needed with a larger sample to corroborate these results.",

        "abstract": "The majority of mental health disorders remain untreated. Many limitations of traditional psychological interventions such as limited availability of evidence-based interventions and clinicians could potentially be overcome by providing Internet- and mobile-based psychological interventions (IMIs). This paper is a report of the Taskforce E-Health of the European Federation of Psychologists\u2019 Association and will provide an introduction to the subject, discusses areas of application, and reviews the current evidence regarding the efficacy of IMIs for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. Meta-analyses based on randomized trials clearly indicate that therapist-guided stand-alone IMIs can result in meaningful benefits for a range of indications including, for example, depression, anxiety, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorders. The clinical significance of results of purely self-guided interventions is for many disorders less clear, especially with regard to effects under routine care conditions. Studies on the prevention of mental health disorders (MHD) are promising. Blended concepts, combining traditional face-to-face approaches with Internet- and mobile-based elements might have the potential of increasing the effects of psychological interventions on the one hand or to reduce costs of mental health treatments on the other hand. We also discuss mechanisms of change and the role of the therapist in such approaches, contraindications, potential limitations, and risk involved with IMIs, briefly review the status of the implementation into routine health care across Europe, and discuss confidentiality as well as ethical aspects that need to be taken into account, when implementing IMIs. Internet- and mobile-based psychological interventions have high potential for improving mental health and should be implemented more widely in routine care.",

        "abstract": "Background: Depression and anxiety have become the most common mental health disorders worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasing interest in telemedicine has led to the innovation of using internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT for depression and anxiety among the global population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ProQuest, Wiley, and Web of Science using the PRISMA framework, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the study. A critical appraisal was also performed using Cochrane\u2019s Risk of Bias (RoB) 2. The meta-analysis used random-effects models to analyze pooled mean difference (MD) and its p-value. Results: Twelve RCTs were included for qualitative analysis and nine RCTs, which yielded 6778 patients with depression and 6556 patients with anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, were included for quantitative analysis. Despite high heterogeneity, all studies had a low risk of bias. Pre- and post-iCBT intervention in the depression forest plot depicts a significant effect (p < 0.00001) with a pooled MD of 4.73 (95% CI: 4.55\u20134.90), while the pre- and post-iCBT intervention depicts a significant effect (p < 0.00001) with a pooled MD of 4.50 (95% CI: 4.34\u20134.67). This demonstrates that iCBT was found to significantly decrease depression and anxiety scores in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, substantial heterogeneity was also found (I2 = 93%; p < 0.00001 and I2 = 90%) for the pre-/post-depression and anxiety forest plots, respectively. Conclusions: This meta-analysis comprises an evidence-based result for iCBT to treat depression and anxiety in the COVID-19 population, as indicated by the significantly lower assessment scores. Delivering iCBT in this situation needs to be considered more extensively, as it has promising results and yields the benefits of technological advancement in psychotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated gender disparities in mental health, particularly impacting women. To address this, Alberta, Canada, launched Text4Hope, a Cognitive Behaviour Therapy-based text messaging intervention, to provide support and resources for psychological challenges during the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Text4Hope in reducing stress, anxiety, depression, sleeping disturbances, and suicidal ideation among female subscribers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study employed both an uncontrolled longitudinal design and a controlled cohort design. The uncontrolled longitudinal study analyzed a one-year dataset (n\u2009=\u20099,545) of clinical outcomes, comparing mean differences in mental health symptoms from baseline to 6 weeks after subscription. The controlled cohort design compared two groups, with (n\u2009=\u20091,763) and without (n\u2009=\u2009567) intervention exposure during the same period. Data were collected through self-administered online surveys completed at baseline and six weeks after subscription. Sociodemographic information and validated scales (e.g., 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)) were used to assess mental health outcomes. Results The results from the longitudinal study indicated a significant reduction in anxiety prevalence and anxiety symptoms, with a 19.63% decrease in GAD-7 mean score and a 32.02% decrease in likely anxiety from baseline to six weeks. Depressive symptoms and perceived stress also showed a significant reduction (p\u2009<\u20090.001), albeit to a lesser extent. In the controlled cohort study, the intervention group had significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) lower PHQ-9 [19.5 (SD 7.05)], GAD-7 [7.5 (SD 5.27)], and CMH [35.53 (SD 18.45)] scores. Additionally, the study found substantial differences (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in suicidal ideation (26.1 vs. 15.7) between groups but no significant differences in sleep disruption. Discussion These findings suggest that Text4Hope could be an effective intervention for reducing stress, depression, suicidal ideation, and particularly anxiety symptoms among women during public emergencies. The study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of text messaging interventions in supporting mental health during crisis situations.",

        "title": "Evaluating the 3-month post-intervention impact of a supportive text message program on mental health outcomes during the 2023 wildfires in Alberta and Nova Scotia, Canada",
        "abstract": "Background Individuals exposed to wildfires are at risk of developing adverse mental health conditions in the months following the event. Receiving supportive text interventions during and after a wildfire event can have a significant impact on reducing mental health conditions over time. Objectives The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a supportive text message intervention service in reducing the severity and prevalence of psychological conditions 3\u202fmonths following the 2023 wildfires in Alberta and Nova Scotia, two regions heavily affected by these natural disasters. Methods In this longitudinal study, participants voluntarily subscribed to the Text4Hope-AB and Text4Hope-NS services, receiving supportive text interventions for 3\u202fmonths. On enrolment and at 3\u202fmonths post-enrolment, participants completed online surveys. The severity and prevalence of mental wellbeing, resilience, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress were measured using the World Health Organization- Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 scale (GAD-7), and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Civilians (PCL-C) respectively. Data analysis involved using McNemar\u2019s chi-square test and paired sample t-tests. Results A total of 150 subscribers partially or fully completed both the baseline and 3-month assessments. The results show a statistically significant change in the mean scores on the WHO-5 Wellbeing Index (+ 24.6%), PHQ-9 (\u221217.0%), GAD-7 scale (\u221217.6%), PCL-C (\u22126.0%), and BRS (+3.2%) from baseline to 3\u202fmonths. Similarly, there was a reduction, although not statistically significant, in the prevalence of low resilience (55.1 vs. 53.4%), poor mental well-being (71.6 vs. 48.3%), likely MDD (71.4 vs. 40.7%), likely GAD (42.1 vs. 33.3%), and likely PTSD (42.0 vs. 38.4%). Conclusion The study\u2019s findings underscore the potential of the supportive text intervention program in effectively aiding individuals who have endured natural disasters such as wildfires. Providing supportive text messages during wildfire events is a promising strategy for mitigating mental health conditions over time.",
