        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of etoricoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor, administered continuously over 52 weeks for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis 2-part, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, 52-week study evaluated 2 doses of etoricoxib (90 and 120 mg) compared with naproxen at 1,000 mg. A 6-week, active-comparator- and placebo-controlled period (part I) was followed by a 46-week active-comparator-controlled period (part II). The primary outcome measures (on 100-mm visual analog scales) were patient's assessment of spine pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 387 patients randomized to receive treatment, 301 (77.8%) completed part I and 284 (75.9%) completed part II. Compared with placebo over 6 weeks, those receiving 90 mg etoricoxib, 120 mg etoricoxib, and naproxen demonstrated significantly (P < 0.001) greater improvement in all primary end points; treatment effects (expressed as the difference in least squares mean change versus placebo) were 21-29 mm for spine pain, 18-25 mm for disease activity, and 11-15 mm for function. Compared with patients receiving naproxen, significantly greater improvement in all primary end points was demonstrated in the combined group receiving either 90 mg etoricoxib or 120 mg etoricoxib over 6 weeks, in each individual etoricoxib treatment group over 6 weeks, and in the combined etoricoxib group over 1 year (all P < 0.05); results for secondary and exploratory end points were generally consistent with those from the primary analysis. Among all groups, there were no significant differences in the incidence of overall clinical, drug-related, or serious adverse experiences (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs. Safety observations during part II were generally consistent with those in part I.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEtoricoxib at doses of 90 mg and 120 mg demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo over 6 weeks, and compared with naproxen over 1 year. These study results demonstrate that etoricoxib is generally safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious for the treatment of AS.",

        "title": "Etoricoxib for arthritis and pain management",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, have come to play an important role in the pharmacologic management of arthritis and pain. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of etoricoxib in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, low back pain, acute postoperative pain, and primary dysmenorrhea. Comparative studies indicate at least similar efficacy with etoricoxib versus traditional NSAIDs. Etoricoxib was generally well tolerated in these studies with no new safety findings during long-term administration. The gastrointestinal, renovascular, and cardiovascular tolerability profiles of etoricoxib have been evaluated in large patient datasets, and further insight into the cardiovascular tolerability of etoricoxib and diclofenac will be gained from a large ongoing cardiovascular outcomes program (MEDAL). The available data suggest that etoricoxib is an efficacious alternative in the management of arthritis and pain, with the potential advantages of convenient once-daily administration and superior gastrointestinal tolerability compared with traditional NSAIDs.",

        "title": "Pharmacokinetic profile of a new diclofenac prodrug without gastroulcerogenic effect.",
        "abstract": "Gastrotoxicity is a major problem for long-term therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). DICCIC (1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2-one) is a new diclofenac prodrug, which has proven anti-inflammatory activity without gastroulcerogenic effect. The aim of this work was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac from DICCIC (7.6 mg/kg equivalent to 8.1 mg/kg diclofenac) and diclofenac (8.1 mg/kg) administration in Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g (n=20). The doses were calculated by interspecific allometric scaling based on the 2 mg/kg from diary human dose of diclofenac. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes via the femoral artery through the implanted catheter. The plasma was separated and quantitation was made in a HPLC system with a UV-Vis detector. The confidence limits of the bioanalytical method were appropriate for its application in a preclinical pharmacokinetic study. The AUC of diclofenac from DICCIC (53.7\u00b1 5.8 ug/mL.min) was significantly less (Mann Whitney test, p<0.05) than that of diclofenac from diclofenac administration (885.9 \u00b1 124,8 ug/mL.min). Terminal half-life of diclofenac from DICCIC (50.1 \u00b1 17.2 min) was significantly less (Mann Whitney test, p<0.05) than that of diclofenac from diclofenac administration (247.4 \u00b1 100.9 min). Still the parameters clearance and distribution volume were calculated for diclofenac from diclofenac, whose results were 9.2 \u00b11.2 mL/min.kg and 3.3 \u00b11.2 L/kg, respectively. The results of DICCIC from DICCIC administration were 108.9 \u00b1 19.6 mL/min.kg and 7.8 \u00b1 2.4 L/kg for clearance and distribution volume, respectively. The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated that there was an increase in diclofenac elimination and a lower exposure to diclofenac with administration of DICCIC compared to diclofenac.",

        "title": "Synthesis, In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of the N-ethoxycarbonylmorpholine Ester of Diclofenac as a Prodrug",
        "abstract": "The N-ethoxycarbonylmorpholine moiety was evaluated as a novel prodrug moiety for carboxylic acid containing drugs represented by diclofenac (1). Compound 2, the N-ethoxycarbonylmorpholine ester of diclofenac was synthesized and evaluated as a potential prodrug. The stability of the synthesized prodrug was evaluated in solutions of pH 1 and 7.4, and in plasma. The ester\u2019s half lives were found to be 8 h, 47 h and 21 min in pH 1, pH 7.4 and plasma, respectively. Equimolar doses of diclofenac sodium and its synthesized prodrug were administered orally to a group of rabbits in a crossover study to evaluate their pharmacokinetic parameters. The prodrug 2 shows a similar rate and extent of absorption as the parent drug (1). The ulcerogenicity of the prepared prodrug was evaluated and compared with the parent drug. The prodrug showed less ulcerogenicity as detected by fewer number and smaller size of ulcers. In conclusion, the newly synthesized N-ethoxycarbonylmorpholine ester of diclofenac prodrug showed appropriate stability properties at different pHs, similar pharmacokinetic profile, and much less ulcerogenecity at the GIT compared to the parent drug diclofenac.",

The paper explores a different prodrug moiety, but the goal of reducing gastroulcerogenic effects is the same. The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it builds upon the idea of creating a prodrug to mitigate the side effects of diclofenac."

        "title": "Rectal Diclofenac Versus Rectal Paracetamol: Comparison of Antipyretic Effectiveness in Children",
        "abstract": "Background Fever is the most common complaint in pediatric medicine and its treatment is recommended in some situations. Paracetamol is the most common antipyretic drug, which has serious side effects such as toxicity along with its positive effects. Diclofenac is one of the strongest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs, which has received little attention as an antipyretic drug. Objectives This study was designed to compare the antipyretic effectiveness of the rectal form of Paracetamol and Diclofenac. Patients and Methods This double-blind controlled clinical trial was conducted on 80 children aged six months to six years old. One group was treated with rectal Paracetamol suppositories at 15 mg/kg dose and the other group received Diclofenac at 1 mg/kg by rectal administration (n = 40). Rectal temperature was measured before and one hour after the intervention. Temperature changes in the two groups were compared. Results The average rectal temperature in the Paracetamol group was 39.6 \u00b1 1.13\u00b0C, and 39.82 \u00b1 1.07\u00b0C in the Diclofenac group (P = 0.37). The average rectal temperature, one hour after the intervention, in the Paracetamol and the Diclofenac group was 38.39 \u00b1 0.89\u00b0C and 38.95 \u00b1 1.09\u00b0C, respectively (P = 0.02). Average temperature changes were 0.65 \u00b1 0.17\u00b0C in the Paracetamol group and 1.73 \u00b1 0.69\u00b0C in the Diclofenac group (P < 0.001). Conclusions In the first one hour, Diclofenac suppository is able to control the fever more efficient than Paracetamol suppositories.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fever is the most common complaint among the children admitted to health care centers. The aim of this study was to compare the anti-pyretic effect of diclofenac and high dose acetaminophen suppository in 1 to 6 years old children. Methods: This double-blind clinical trial study was performed on 1-6-year-old children hospitalized in 17th Shahrivar Teaching Hospital, Rasht, Iran. Children were divided into two groups of 45 using a block randomization design. The first group received a high dose of acetaminophen suppository at a dose of 30 mg/kg and the second group received a diclofenac suppository at a dose of 1 mg/kg. The rectal temperature of the patients was measured using a digital thermometer at the time of drug administration, and one and three hours after that. Results: 90 children were studied in two groups of 45 each. Temperature changes in the diclofenac group were significantly greater than the acetaminophen group, so from zero to 3 hours after administering diclofenac, the temperature decreased to 1.76\u00b10.95\u00b0C. This reduction was lower in acetaminophen group (1.26\u00b10.49\u00b0C, P=0.019). Conclusion: Both acetaminophen and diclofenac suppositories significantly reduced the rectal temperature. However, the effect of rectal diclofenac on reducing temperature is more than rectal acetaminophen.",
