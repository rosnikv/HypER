        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 46 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 48-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of cyclosporine was conducted in 122 patients with active RA. Patients were evaluated by objective and subjective clinical and radiologic measurements at baseline and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStatistically significant improvement and clinically important changes were seen for the number of tender joints, number of swollen joints, pain score, duration of morning stiffness, and Lee's functional index in the cyclosporine-treated group at the end of the study. Radiographic examination showed that cyclosporine was capable of retarding joint destruction. In the cyclosporine-treated group, serum creatinine levels increased by 17.5 mumoles/liter (23%) at week 24 and by 21.8 mumoles/liter (26%) at week 48. There was no significant difference in mean serum creatinine levels in patients treated with cyclosporine alone and those treated with cyclosporine plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Five patients had to be treated with antihypertensive drugs, and 2 patients were withdrawn from the study because of increased serum creatinine.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe study shows that cyclosporine seems to have disease-modifying effects in RA.",

        "title": "Slow progression of joint damage in early rheumatoid arthritis treated with cyclosporin A.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the ability of low-dose cyclosporin A (CsA) to control radiologic disease progression, and to assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of CsA, compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), in patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this long-term, multicenter, prospective, open, blinded end point, randomized trial, 361 consenting patients with early (<4 years since diagnosis) active RA were enrolled. Of the eligible patients, 167 were treated with CsA at 3 mg/kg/day, and 173 with DMARDs. The decision to use conventional antirheumatic drugs as controls was based on the fact that joint erosion could be expected to occur after 1 year regardless of the type of DMARD being used. The possibility of switching therapies in both groups was intended to keep the largest possible number of patients in the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlinded evaluation of hand and foot radiographs after 12 months of treatment showed that CsA led to a significant (P < 0.001) delay in the mean +/- SD progression in the eroded joint count (1.3 +/- 3.1 versus 2.4 +/- 3.0 for the control group) and in the joint damage score (3.6 +/- 8.9 versus 6.9 +/- 9.1 for the control group), both measured by the Larsen-Dale method. When only the patients without erosion at baseline were considered (37 in the CsA-treated group and 54 in the control group), erosion appeared in only 10.8% of the CsA-treated patients, but in 51.8% of the controls (P = 0.00005). Low-dose CsA was as effective as traditional DMARDs in controlling clinical symptoms. Maintenance on the initially prescribed treatment regimen (\"survival on treatment\") was also better at 12 months with CsA than with DMARDs (89.2% versus 77.5%; P = 0.002). The tolerability of CsA was acceptable.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese 12-month results suggest that low-dose CsA decreases the rate of further joint damage in previously involved joints as well as the rate of new joint involvement in previously uninvolved joints, in patients with early RA.",

        "title": "Clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis: methodological suggestions for assessing radiographs arising from the GRISAR* study",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES The three x ray assessors of the GRISAR study (blinded to treatment) gave consensual erosion and damage scores to the baseline and 12 month radiographs of 284 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients using three different methods: single readings (blinded as to patient and chronological sequence of the x rays), paired readings (blinded as to sequence), and chronologically ordered paired readings. The aim was to evaluate which of these reading procedures is the most appropriate for clinical trials. METHODS The progression of the scores obtained using each procedure was compared by means of descriptive statistics, principal components analysis, and intra-patient correlation coefficients of pairs of methods. Bootstrap estimates of the variance of the difference in the means of two equally sized random samples were calculated to evaluate the power of the statistical analysis performed to assess the possible treatment effect for both paired and chronological reading methods. RESULTS (a)The standard deviations of the paired and chronological readings were similar, but that of the single readings was higher. (b) The knowledge that two x rays were of the same patient accounted for a sizeable proportion of the between method variability. (c) Agreement was satisfactory between the paired and chronological methods for both scores but, between them and the single readings, it was modest for erosions and poor for damage. (d) The bootstrap estimate of the variance of the difference was smaller for the paired than the chronological method, possibly giving it greater power to test treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS These results suggested that paired readings were the most suitable for evaluating the progression of joint damage in the GRISAR study.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the influence of reading series of films in chronological order, in pairs with unknown time sequence, or as single films, on precision and sensitivity to change.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo studies were performed with 10 and 12 patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria. In Study 1, two sets of films with a 1 yr interval were scored in chronological order, in pairs, and as single films. In Study 2, four sets of films, with a 1 yr interval each, were scored in chronological order, as single films and as single-pair (right and left together). All films were scored with the Sharp/van der Heijde method by two independent observers. Data were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA using a full mixed effects model. Two generalizability (G) coefficients were constructed for reliability and for change.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStudy 1: the interobserver reliability was similar for the three methods (G(reliability) chronological 0.94, paired 0.88, single 0.93); progression was a mean increase (averaged over patients, observers and methods) from 26 to 37 (P=0.046). The sensitivity for change was greater for the chronological than for the paired and single scoring (G(change) 0.39, 0.22 and 0.24, respectively). Study 2: the interobserver reliability was 0.86 for chronological, 0.76 for single-pair and 0.91 for single readings. Significantly more progression was measured with the chronological compared with the single-paired and single methods (15.9 vs 8.5 and 8.3; P=0.0001). A constant progression was suggested by chronological reading, in contrast to a stabilization in the other two methods after 1 yr.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReading films in chronological order is most sensitive to change in a time period up to 3 yr follow-up; this was already present after 1 yr, but even more pronounced with longer follow-up.",

        "abstract": "The smallest detectable difference (SDD) reflects that component of a measure statistically attributable to error from the measurement process itself. As such it is an irreducible component of the inherent variability in measurements in clinical trials and will affect their design, whether randomized or observational. Even though the application of the SDD concept to assaying radiographs in rheumatoid arthritis is relatively new and not well understood, systematic work on the influences of radiographic SDD can be done. This report describes the effects of a number of clinical aspects of the disease and operational aspects of trials on the values of the SDD of radiographic progression data. We show that if conditions affecting SDD are known and kept constant across datasets, the SDD of radiological progression from one study may be generalizable to other studies. However, if any one condition varies, the SDD is distinctly unrobust and cannot be generalized to other studies.",

        "abstract": "New imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI are likely to play increasing roles in the future management of patients with inflammatory arthritis, particularly those with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies. Ultrasound has a number of distinct advantages including its ability to scan multiple joints, safety, and immediately availability in clinic. MRI, however, is more sensitive and has a greater field of view because of its tomographic nature. Both modalities have the added advantage over radiography in that they can image soft tissue as well as bone. Dual X-ray absorptiometry already has an established role to play in the assessment of osteoporosis, but new techniques such as digital radiogrametry, quantitative CT, and ultrasound potentially will have a more important role to play in the future.",

        "title": "Peripheral Nerves: Not Only Cross-sectional Area in the Era of Radiomics",
        "abstract": "Abstract The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using medical imaging as a complement or in association with electrodiagnostics tests. The application of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allows detailed visualization of the peripheral nervous system. According to the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for nerve evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is further enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to diagnose or to treat peripheral nerve disorders. Standard evaluation of peripheral nerves on US usually relies on cross-sectional area evaluation with different cutoff values in the osteofibrous tunnels and outside them. In several anatomical areas, side-to-side comparison is highly recommended because it helps distinguish subtle variations by using the unaffected limb as an internal control. US is widely used to perform US-guided interventional procedures on peripheral nerves. The recent development of radiomics and machine and deep learning applied to peripheral nerves may reveal new insights beyond the capabilities of the human eye. Radiomics may have a role in expanding the diagnostic capabilities of US and MRI in the study of peripheral nerve pathology, especially when the cross-sectional area is not markedly increased.",
