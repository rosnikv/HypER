        "abstract": "The efficacy, toxicity and possible steroid-sparing properties of auranofin in the treatment of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) were studied in a 2 yr prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty-five patients with onset of arthritis after the age of 60 yr were randomized to either auranofin 3 mg b.i.d. [n = 31, age 70 (61-84) yr, median (range)] or placebo tablets [n = 34, age 72 (60-81) yr]. Oral prednisolone, starting dose 7.5 or 20 mg daily, was used as a rescue drug in patients with intolerable joint pain and stiffness and with C-reactive protein (CRP) > or = 20 mg/l, and was tapered down according to protocol guidelines. Patients receiving auranofin continued therapy for a longer period of time (55% completers) than those on placebo medication (18% completers). The auranofin group consumed significantly less prednisolone, 2.64 (0-11.85) mg/day [median (range)], compared to 5.0 (0-18.33) mg/day in the placebo group (P = 0.006). No group differences at 2 yr follow-up were found for changes in joint pain (P = 0.49), number of swollen joints (P = 0.61), Health Assessment Questionnaire score (P = 0.18) and radiographic damage score (Larsen-Dale index) of the hands (P = 0.84). Within-group changes in radiographic scores were also insignificant. The drop-out rate due to adverse events was surprisingly higher in the placebo group (41%) than in the auranofin group (10%) and, as expected, higher due to lack of effect (29 and 16%). The results indicate that auranofin is safe, superior to placebo and has steroid-sparing capacity in the treatment of EORA. The favourable radiographic outcome in both groups needs confirmation in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To compare three therapeutic strategies using slow acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for their disease modifying properties, toxicity, and lag time until treatment effect. METHODS Patients with recent onset RA from six hospitals were randomly assigned to immediate initiation of one of three treatment strategies: (I) a \u201cmild SAARD with a long lag time\u201d (hydroxychloroquine, if necessary replaced by auranofin); (II) a \u201cpotent SAARD with a long lag time\u201d (intramuscular gold, if necessary replaced byd-penicillamine); (III) a \u201cpotent SAARD with a short lag time\u201d (methotrexate, if necessary replaced by sulfasalazine). Comparisons included two years of follow up. RESULTS All SAARD strategies reduced mean disease activity. A greater percentage of patients improved clinically with strategies II and III than with strategy I: percentages of patients improved on joint score with strategies II and III (79% and 82%, respectively), which was statistically different from strategy I (66%). The same was true for remission percentages: 31% and 24% v 16%, respectively). Longitudinal analysis showed significantly less disability with strategy III, and a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate with strategy II than with strategy I. In addition, radiological damage after one and two years, was significantly lower in strategies II and III (at two years median scores were 11 and 10v 14 in strategy I, p<0.05). Toxicity was increased in strategy II compared with the other strategies. CONCLUSION Strategy III, comprising methotrexate or sulfasalazine, produced the best results weighing effectiveness and toxicity. Strategy I (hydroxychloroquine or auranofin) was slightly less effective, and strategy II (intramuscular gold or d-penicillamine) was associated with increased toxicity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA) trial demonstrated that step-down combination therapy with prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (SSZ) was superior to SSZ monotherapy for suppressing disease activity and radiologic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study was conducted to investigate whether the benefits of COBRA therapy were sustained over time, and to determine which baseline factors could predict outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients had participated in the 56-week COBRA trial. During followup, they were seen by their own rheumatologists and were also assessed regularly by study nurses; no treatment protocol was specified. Disease activity, radiologic damage, and functional ability were the primary outcome domains. Two independent assessors scored radiographs in sequence according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method. Outcomes were analyzed by generalized estimating equations on the basis of intent-to-treat, starting with data obtained at the last visit of the COBRA trial (56 weeks after baseline).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the beginning of followup, patients in the COBRA group had a significantly lower mean time-averaged 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) and a significantly lower median radiologic damage (Sharp) score compared with those in the SSZ monotherapy group. The functional ability score (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) was similar in both groups. During the 4-5 year followup period, the time-averaged DAS28 decreased 0.17 points per year in the SSZ group and 0.07 in the COBRA group. The Sharp progression rate was 8.6 points per year in the SSZ group and 5.6 in the COBRA group. After adjustment for differences in treatment and disease activity during followup, the between-group difference in the rate of radiologic progression was 3.7 points per year. The HAQ score did not change significantly over time. Independent baseline predictors of radiologic progression over time (apart from treatment allocation) were rheumatoid factor positivity, Sharp score, and DAS28.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn initial 6-month cycle of intensive combination treatment that includes high-dose corticosteroids results in sustained suppression of the rate of radiologic progression in patients with early RA, independent of subsequent antirheumatic therapy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the long-term frequency of disease remissions and the progression of joint damage in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were initially randomized to 2 years of treatment with either a combination of 3 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or a single DMARD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter prospective followup study, a cohort of 195 patients with early, clinically active RA was randomly assigned to treatment with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone or with a single DMARD (initially, sulfasalazine) with or without prednisolone. After 2 years, the DMARD and prednisolone treatments became unrestricted, but were still targeted toward remission. The long-term effectiveness was assessed by recording the frequency of remissions and the extent of joint damage seen on radiographs of the hands and feet obtained annually up to 5 years. Radiographs were assessed by the Larsen score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 160 patients (78 in the combination group and 82 in the single group) completed the 5-year extension study. At 2 years, 40% of the patients in the combination-DMARD group and 18% in the single-DMARD group had achieved remission (P < 0.009). At 5 years, the corresponding percentages were 28% and 22% (P not significant). The median Larsen radiologic damage scores at baseline, 2 years, and 5 years in the combination-DMARD and single-DMARD groups were 0 and 2 (P = 0.50), 4 and 12 (P = 0.005), and 11 and 24 (P = 0.001), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAggressive initial treatment of early RA with the combination of 3 DMARDs for the first 2 years limits the peripheral joint damage for at least 5 years. Our results confirm the earlier concept that triple therapy with combinations of DMARDs contributes to an improved long-term radiologic outcome in patients with early and clinically active RA.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the available evidence on the efficacy and feasibility of the new concept of tight control in randomised trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Tight control is a treatment strategy tailored to the individual patient with RA, which aims to achieve a predefined level of low disease activity or remission within a certain period of time. Methods: The literature database PubMed was searched and yielded four trials: the FIN-RACo trial, the TICORA study, the BeSt study and the CAMERA study. Results: Tight control resulted in greater improvement and a higher percentage of patients meeting the preset aim of low disease activity or remission when compared to the control intervention. In the FIN-RACo trial, aimed at DAS28<2.6, 51% of patients in the tight control group achieved remission versus 16% in the contrast group (p<0.001). In the TICORA study, 65% of patients in the tight control group versus 16% of the contrast group achieved remission, based on DAS<1.6 (p<0.0001). In the CAMERA study, 50% of patients in the tight control group using a computer decision model achieved remission, versus 37% in the contrast group (p\u200a=\u200a0.029). The BeSt study consisted of only tight control groups aimed at a DAS<1.6; remission was achieved in 38\u201346% of patients. This is higher than the range of remission in earlier trials of 13\u201336%. Conclusion: Tight control aiming for low disease activity or even better still, remission, seems a promising option in treating patients with RA in clinical trials and probably also in daily practice.",

        "abstract": "Background Joint damage is an important outcome in trials of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), usually assessed by Total Sharp Score (TSS). It is currently unknown how it translates numerically into disability by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Objective To determine the units of HAQ score corresponding to one TSS unit. Methods A short-term observational trial of glucocorticoids in RA (the \u2018BEst LIfe with Rheumatoid Arthritis\u2019 (BELIRA) trial) was evaluated, using randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) data for confirmation. For each trial arm HAQ, TSS and the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) were assessed. Based on the hypothesis that short-term HAQ changes will mostly be due to changes of disease activity, activity HAQ (ACT-HAQ) at end point (EP) was determined and remaining disability defined as damage related (DAM-HAQ). Using TSS at EP, the HAQ units corresponding to a TSS unit were estimated. Results In BELIRA, one TSS unit corresponded to a mean of 0.017 HAQ units; to account for other causes of irreversible disability, the 25th percentile was used: 0.011 HAQ units/TSS unit. In RCT trial arms, the HAQ/TSS were similar (0.013 and 0.015 in established and early RA, respectively; 25th percentile: 0.010). The correlation between DAM-HAQEP and TSS was r=0.829. Over 5 years, damage would amount to an increase of irreversible HAQ of 0.33 on placebo, 0.13 on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and 0.03 on TNF inhibitors+methotrexate (MTX). Conclusion An approach to estimate the numerical relationship between HAQ and damage as 0.01 HAQ points/TSS unit is presented, although the linear relationship may not be generally valid. This allows the assessment of functional correlates of radiographic changes in trials.",

Objective The trial aims to compare the effect of progressive spacing of TNF-blocker injections (S-arm) to their maintenance (M-arm) for established patients with RA in remission. Methods The study was an 18-month equivalence trial which included patients receiving etanercept or adalimumab at stable dose for \u22651\u2005year, patients in remission on 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) for \u22656\u2005months and patients with stable joint damage. Patients were randomised into two arms: maintenance or injections spacing by 50% every 3\u2005months up to complete stop. Spacing was reversed to the previous interval in case of relapse, and eventually reattempted after remission was reachieved. The primary outcome was the standardised difference of DAS28 slopes, based on a linear mixed-effects model (equivalence interval set at \u00b130%). Results 64 and 73 patients were included in the S-arm and M-arm, respectively, which was less than planned. In the S-arm, TNF blockers were stopped for 39.1%, only tapered for 35.9% and maintained full dose for 20.3%. The equivalence was not demonstrated with a standardised difference of 19% (95% CI \u22125% to 46%). Relapse was more common in the S-arm (76.6% vs 46.5%, p=0.0004). However, there was no difference in structural damage progression. Conclusions Tapering was not equivalent to maintenance strategy, resulting in more relapses without impacting structural damage progression. Further studies are needed to identify patients who could benefit from such a strategy associated with substantial cost savings.

Materials and methods A systematic literature analysis was carried out through May 2017 on the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and international congress databases, selecting controlled trials comparing bDMARDs discontinuation/tapering versus continuation in RA patients with remission or LDA. The meta-analysis assessed the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI of losing remission or LDA and the risk of radiographic progression after (1) discontinuing and (2) tapering doses of bDMARDs versus continuing the initial treatment. Results The meta-analysis comparing bDMARDs discontinuation versus continuation performed on nine trials showed an increased risk of losing remission (RR (95%\u2009CI)=1.97(1.43 to 2.73), P<0.0001) or LDA (RR (95%\u2009CI)=2.24(1.52 to 3.30), P<0.0001) and an increased risk of radiographic progression (RR (95%\u2009CI)=1.09(1.02 to 1.17), P=0.01) in case of bDMARD discontinuation. The meta-analysis comparing bDMARDs tapering versus continuation performed on 11 trials showed an increased risk of losing remission (RR (95%\u2009CI)=1.23(1.06 to 1.42), P=0.006) but no increased risk of losing LDA (RR (95%\u2009CI)=1.02 (0.85 to 1.23), P=0.81) nor any increased risk of radiographic progression (RR (95%\u2009CI)=1.09(0.94 to 1.26), P=0.26) in case of bDMARD tapering.

Cox regression analysis was used to identify baseline predictors of flares. Of the 1.717 patients with RA, 566 (33.0%) experienced flares during the 2-year study period. An analysis of baseline characteristics of flare and non-flare groups revealed that more women and non-smokers were present in the flare group than in the non-flare group; the flare group also had higher scores on physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s pain and fatigue visual analogue scales (VAS) and the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). In a multivariate analysis, physician\u2019s VAS score, hemoglobin level, and HAQ score were significant predictors of flares. A high physician\u2019s VAS score, low hemoglobin, and high HAQ score at baseline were significant predictors of flares in patients with RA who exhibited LDA.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates predictors of flares in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is closely related to the topic of flare and radiographic progression after etanercept continuation, tapering, or withdrawal discussed in the source paper. The findings of this paper could be seen as partially dependent on the understanding of flare and its consequences, as discussed in the source paper."

        "title": "An AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System to Predict Flares in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "Treat-to-target (T2T) is a main therapeutic strategy in rheumatology; however, patients and rheumatologists currently have little support in making the best treatment decision. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) could offer this support. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, and acceptance of such a CDSS\u2014Rheuma Care Manager (RCM)\u2014including an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered flare risk prediction tool to support the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Longitudinal clinical routine data of RA patients were used to develop and test the RCM. Based on ten real-world patient vignettes, five physicians were asked to assess patients\u2019 flare risk, provide a treatment decision, and assess their decision confidence without and with access to the RCM for predicting flare risk. RCM usability and acceptance were assessed using the system usability scale (SUS) and net promoter score (NPS). The flare prediction tool reached a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 76%, and an AUROC of 0.80. Perceived flare risk and treatment decisions varied largely between physicians. Having access to the flare risk prediction feature numerically increased decision confidence (3.5/5 to 3.7/5), reduced deviations between physicians and the prediction tool (20% to 12% for half dosage flare prediction), and resulted in more treatment reductions (42% to 50% vs. 20%). RCM usability (SUS) was rated as good (82/100) and was well accepted (mean NPS score 7/10). CDSS usage could support physicians by decreasing assessment deviations and increasing treatment decision confidence.",

        "title": "Artificial intelligence in rheumatology: status quo and quo vadis\u2014results of a national survey among German rheumatologists",
        "abstract": "Background: The development and potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is remarkable. Its application in all medical disciplines, including rheumatology, is attracting attention. To what extent AI is already used in clinical routine in rheumatology is unknown. In addition, the perceived barriers, potentials, and expectations regarding AI by rheumatologists have not yet been studied. Objectives: To examine the current usage and perceived barriers and facilitators of AI, including large language models (LLMs), among rheumatologists. Design: National, observational, non-interventional, and cross-sectional web-based study. Methods: A web-based survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology (AGJR) of the German Society for Rheumatology. The survey was distributed at the Congress of the German Society for Rheumatology and via social media, QR code, and email from August 30 until November 4, 2023. Results: Responses from 172 rheumatologists (55% female; mean age 43\u2009years) were analyzed. The majority stated that they did not previously use AI (73%) in their daily practice. Eighty-eight percent of rheumatologists rated their AI knowledge as low to intermediate and 84% would welcome dedicated training on LLMs. The majority of rheumatologists anticipated AI implementation to improve patient care (60%) and reduce daily workload (62%). Especially for diagnosis (73%), writing medical reports (70%), and data analysis (70%), rheumatologists reported a potential positive benefit of AI. Main AI concerns addressed the responsibility for medical decisions (64%) and data security (58%). Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate that rheumatologists currently have little AI knowledge and make very little use of AI in clinical routine. However, the majority of rheumatologists anticipate positive AI effects and would welcome increased AI implementation and dedicated training programs.",
