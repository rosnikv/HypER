        "title": "Efficacy of symptomatic control of knee osteoarthritis with 0.0125% of capsaicin versus placebo.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent and associated with both pain and functional disability. Current treatments aim to alleviate mild to moderate symptoms by various methods. Topical capsaicin (0.075% and 0.05%) has been evaluated for the treatment of the painful joints. A burning sensation was the most common side effect at these strengths. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 0.0125% capsaicin gel (Capsika gel) compared to a placebo (the vehicle gel) in patients with symptomatic OA knee.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nThis was a cross-over; double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 100 patients with mild to moderate knee OA. All of the patients received either capsaicin gel or placebo gel applied to the affected knee, three times daily for 4 weeks with one week washout period after which the treatment switched to either capsaicin gel or placebo gel for the next 4 weeks. A blinded examiner used the visual analog scale (VAS) and WOMAC score to do weekly assessments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects averaged 61 years of age (range, 44 to 82). During the enrollment phase, only female farmers presented. Mean body weight and height was 62.97 +/- 10.25 kg and 1.54 +/- 0.053 m, respectively The respective baseline VAS and WOMAC score was 6.40 +/- 1.64 and 51.65 +/- 13.3. The severity of OA, according to the KL criteria was: 83 patients with grade 2 and 16 with grade 3. The respective mean difference of VAS and total WOMAC score in the capsaicin group vs. the placebo group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean difference of the WOMAC pain, stiffness and functional subscales in the capsaicin vs. the placebo group was also significant (p < 0.05). The only adverse event reported was a burning sensation. During the 4-week treatment with capsaicin, approximately 67% of patients had a burning sensation but none withdrew for this reason.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n0.0125% capsaicin gel was an effective treatment in mildly to moderately painful OA knees. The burning sensation reported by patients in the capsaicin group was less disturbing than in previous studies and none of the present patients withdrew for this reason.",

        "title": "Diabetic Neuropathy: A Randomized, Double- Blind, Crossover, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "& Abstract Background: Topical therapy may provide additional benefit in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). This study was conducted to study the safety and efficacy of 0.025% capsaicin gel in this condition. Methods: A 20-week, double-blind, crossover, randomized, single-center study enrolled subjects with PDN. They received 0.025% capsaicin gel or placebo for 8 weeks, with a washout period of 4 weeks between the two treatments. Primary efficacy end point was percent change in visual analog scale (0\u2013100 mm) of pain severity. Secondary outcomes were score change in Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS), short-form McGill Pain Questionnaires (SF-MPQ), proportion of patients who had pain score reductions of 30% and 50%, and adverse event. Results: Of the 35 subjects screened, 33 were enrolled and 33 completed at least an 8-week treatment period. Intentionto-treat analysis showed no significant improvement in pain with capsaicin gel, compared with placebo with visual analog scale (VAS) score 28.8 mm vs. 34.6 mm (P = 0.53). No significant difference between the groups was found in SF-MPQ (7.4 vs. 7.71, P = 0.95), NPS (29.4 vs. 31.3, P = 0.81), and proportion of patients who had 30% or 50% pain relief. Capsaicin gel was well tolerated with minor skin reaction. Conclusions: 0.025% capsaicin gel is safe and well tolerated, but does not provide significant pain relief in patients with PDN. &",

        "title": "Reducing CXCR 4-mediated nociceptor hyperexcitability reverses painful diabetic neuropathy",
        "abstract": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is an intractable complication of diabetes that affects 25% of patients. PDN is characterized by neuropathic pain and small-fiber degeneration, accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor hyperexcitability and loss of their axons within the skin. The molecular mechanisms underlying DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability and small-fiber degeneration in PDN are unknown. We hypothesize that chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is central to this mechanism, as we have shown that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is necessary for the development of mechanical allodynia, a pain hypersensitivity behavior common in PDN. Focusing on DRG neurons expressing the sodium channel Nav1.8, we applied transgenic, electrophysiological, imaging, and chemogenetic techniques to test this hypothesis. In the high-fat diet mouse model of PDN, we were able to prevent and reverse mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration by limiting CXCR4 signaling or neuronal excitability. This study reveals that excitatory CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration in a mouse model of PDN. Hence, we propose that targeting CXCR4-mediated DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic approach for disease-modifying treatments for this currently intractable and widespread affliction.

        "title": "Neuroinflammation Involved in Diabetes-Related Pain and Itch",
        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic with increasing incidence, which results in diverse complications, seriously affects the patient quality of life, and brings huge economic burdens to society. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common chronic complication of DM, resulting in neuropathic pain and chronic itch. The precise mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy have not been fully clarified, hindering the exploration of novel therapies for diabetic neuropathy and its terrible symptoms such as diabetic pain and itch. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiologic process of neuropathic pain and chronic itch. Indeed, researchers have currently made significant progress in knowing the role of glial cells and the pro-inflammatory mediators produced from glial cells in the modulation of chronic pain and itch signal processing. Here, we provide an overview of the current understanding of neuroinflammation in contributing to the sensitization of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, we also summarize the inflammation mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic itch, including activation of glial cells, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory factors. Targeting excessive neuroinflammation may provide potential and effective therapies for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and itch in DM.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neuropathy is a prevalent and debilitating complication of poorly managed diabetes, contributing towards poor quality of life, amputation risk, and increased mortality. The available therapies for diabetic neuropathic pain (DPN) have limitations in terms of efficacy, tolerability and patient compliance. Dysfunction in the peripheral and central monoaminergic system has been evidenced in various types of neuropathic and acute pain. The objective of the present study was to investigate 1-methyl 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ), an endogenous amine found in human brain with a known neuroprotective profile, in a model of streptozotocin (STZ) induced neuropathic pain. Methods: Diabetic neuropathy in male BALB/c mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of STZ (200 mg/kg). Upon development of DPN after 4 weeks, mice were investigated for mechanical allodynia (von Frey filament pressure test) and thermal hyperalgesia (tail immersion test). Ondansetron (1.0 mg/kg i.p.), naloxone (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) and yohimbine (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) were used to elucidate the possible mechanism involved. Postmortem frontal cortical, striatal and hippocampal tissues were dissected and evaluated for changes in levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. Results: Acute administration of 1MeTIQ (15\u201345 mg/kg i.p.) reversed streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic static mechanical allodynia (von Frey filament pressure test) and thermal hyperalgesia (tail immersion test), these outcomes being comparable to standard gabapentin. Furthermore, HPLC analysis revealed that STZ-diabetic mice expressed lower concentrations of serotonin in all three brain regions examined, while dopamine was diminished in the striatum and 1MeTIQ reversed all these neurotransmitter modifications. These findings suggest that the antihyperalgesic/antiallodynic activity of 1MeTIQ may be mediated in part via supraspinal opioidergic and monoaminergic modulation since they were naloxone, yohimbine and ondansetron reversible. Conclusion: It was also concluded that acute treatment with 1MeTIQ ameliorated STZ-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia and restored brain regionally altered serotonin and dopamine concentrations which signify a potential for 1MeTIQ in the management of DPN.",

        "title": "Liquiritin ameliorates painful diabetic neuropathy in SD rats by inhibiting NLRP3-MMP-9-mediated reversal of aquaporin-4 polarity in the glymphatic system",
        "abstract": "Background Despite advancements in diabetes treatment, the management of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) remains challenging. Our previous research indicated a significant correlation between the expression and distribution of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the spinal glymphatic system and PDN. However, the potential role and mechanism of liquiritin in PDN treatment remain uncertain. Methods This study established a rat model of PDN using a combination of low-dose Streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Rats were treated with liquiritin and MCC950 (an NLRP3 inhibitor). We monitored fasting blood glucose, body weight, and mechanical allodynia periodically. The glymphatic system\u2019s clearance function was evaluated using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and changes in proteins including NLRP3, MMP-9, and AQP4 were detected through immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques. Results The rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) demonstrated several physiological changes, including heightened mechanical allodynia, compromised clearance function within the spinal glymphatic system, altered distribution of AQP4, increased count of activated astrocytes, elevated expression levels of NLRP3 and MMP-9, and decreased expression of AQP4. However, following treatment with liquiritin and MCC950, these rats exhibited notable improvements. Conclusion Liquiritin may promote the restoration of AQP4 polarity by inhibiting NLRP3 and MMP-9, thereby enhancing the clearance functions of the spinal cord glymphatic system in PDN rats, alleviating the progression of PDN.",
