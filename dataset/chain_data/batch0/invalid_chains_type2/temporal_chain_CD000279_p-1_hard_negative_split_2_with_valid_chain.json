        "title": "Is colonoscopic surveillance reducing colorectal cancer mortality in ulcerative colitis? A population based case control study",
        "abstract": "Background\u2014Colonoscopic surveillance is a standard procedure in many patients with long standing, extensive ulcerative colitis (UC), in order to avoid death from colorectal cancer. No conclusive proof of its benefits has been presented however. Aims\u2014To evaluate the association between colonoscopic surveillance and colorectal cancer mortality in patients with UC. Patients\u2014A population based, nested case control study comprising 142 patients with a definite UC diagnosis, derived from a study population of 4664 patients with UC, was conducted. Methods\u2014Colonoscopic surveillance in all patients with UC who had died from colorectal cancer after 1975 was compared with that in controls matched for age, sex, extent, and duration of the disease. Information on colonoscopic surveillance was obtained from the medical records. Results\u2014Two of 40 patients with UC and 18 of 102 controls had undergone at least one surveillance colonoscopy (relative risk (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 1.31). Twelve controls but only one patient with UC had undergone two or more surveillance colonoscopies (RR 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.74), indicating a protective dose response relation. Conclusion\u2014Colonoscopic surveillance may be associated with a decreased risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients with long standing UC.",

        "title": "Overexpression of 5-Lipoxygenase in Colon Polyps and Cancer and the Effect of 5-LOX Inhibitors In vitro and in a Murine Model",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways modulates cell growth and apoptosis. Many studies have examined the effects of COX inhibitors on human colorectal cancer, but the role of 5-LOX in colonic cancer development has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of 5-LOX in colonic polyps and cancer and the effect of 5-LOX inhibition on colon cancer cell proliferation. Experimental Design: Colonic polyps, cancer, and normal mucosa were evaluated for 5-LOX expression by immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to establish 5-LOX expression in colon cancer cells. Thymidine incorporation and cell counts were used to determine the effect of the nonspecific LOX inhibitor Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid and the 5-LOX inhibitor Rev5901 on DNA synthesis. A heterotopic xenograft model in athymic mice using HT29 and LoVo human colon cancer cells was used to evaluate the effect of the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton on tumor growth. Results: 5-LOX is overexpressed in adenomatous polyps and cancer compared with that of normal colonic mucosa. LOX inhibition and 5-LOX inhibition decreased DNA synthesis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in the Lovo cell line (P < 0.05). Inhibition of 5-LOX in an in vivo colon cancer xenograft model inhibited tumor growth compared with that of controls (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study showed that 5-LOX is up-regulated in adenomatous colon polyps and cancer compared with normal colonic mucosa. The blockade of 5-LOX inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and may prove a beneficial chemopreventive therapy in colon cancer.",

        "title": "Participation of leukotriene C(4) in the regulation of suicidal erythrocyte death.",
        "abstract": "Eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes, is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure at the erythrocyte surface. Eryptosis is triggered by increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration upon energy depletion. The present study explored the involvement of leukotrienes. Western blotting was employed to detect the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor cysLT1, competitive immune assay to determine leukotriene release from erythrocytes, Fluo3 fluorescence to estimate cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, forward scatter to analyse cell volume and annexin V-binding to disclose phosphatidylserine exposure. As a result, erythrocytes expressed the leukotriene receptor CysLT1. Glucose depletion (24 hours) significantly increased the formation of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes C(4)/D(4)/E(4). Leukotriene C(4) (10 nM) increased Ca(2+) entry, decreased forward scatter, activated caspases 3 and 8, and stimulated annexin V-binding. Glucose depletion similarly increased annexin V-binding, an effect significantly blunted in the presence of the leukotriene receptor antagonist cinalukast (1 microM) or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor BW B70C (1 microM). In conclusion, upon energy depletion erythrocytes form leukotrienes, which in turn activate cation channels, leading to Ca(2+) entry, cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes thus participate in the signaling of eryptosis during energy depletion.",

The source paper studied the role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in colon cancer development, and this paper explores the involvement of leukotriene C(4), a product of the 5-LOX pathway, in the regulation of suicidal erythrocyte death.

        "title": "PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF LEUKOTRIENE BIOSYNTHESIS: EFFECTS ON THE HEART CONDUCTANCE",
        "abstract": "Leukotrienes are biologically active lipids, produced via 5lipooxygenase (5-LO) pathway of arachidonic acid (1, 2). Their role in cardiovascular disease has become recently the subject of intense investigations. They are potent proinflammatory autacoids which recruit blood leukocytes into the arterial wall (3) increase its permeability (4), powerfully constrict human atherosclerotic coronary arteries (5) and contribute to thrombosis and vascular remodeling. Atherosclerotic lesions express the entire repertoire of leukotriene biosynthetic proteins and receptors. Levels of 5-LO correlate with severity of atherosclerotic lesion (6) and plaque instability (7). Recent association studies suggest a link between genetic variability of the 5-LO pathway and development of atherosclerotic vascular disease (8-11). The role of leukotrienes has been validated in clinical trials of asthma using agents antagonizing their actions. These included both a 5-LO inhibitor (12, 13) and cysteinylleukotriene receptor-1 antagonists (14, 15). In the animal heart, inhibition of leukotriene synthesis resulted in a significant cardioprotection during experimental ligation of the coronary artery (16). Moreover, experiments on digoxin-induced arrhythmias using isolated guinea pig heart model pointed out the role of leukotrienes biosynthesis in coronary arteries (17). However, only the receptor inhibitor was effectively protective against digoxin-induced cardiotoxity (18). Pharmacological inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis decreased atherosclerosis in a double knockout mice without apolipoprotein E and receptor for low density lipoproteins (19). In humans, cardiac ischemia was associated with increased urinary excretion of leukotriene E4 (uLTE4) (20, 21), an established marker of whole-body synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). In a sporadic patient, pharmacological inhibition of intense CysLTs overproduction led to regression of myocardial ischemia (22). In patients at-risk caused by specific genetic variants in leukotriene pathway, treatment with inhibitor of 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) resulted in suppression of biomarkers associated with hazard of myocardial infarction (8). Coronary angioplasty was reported to trigger the intraluminal release of CysLTs (23). In a preliminary study (24) we confirmed and extended this observation by demonstrating a marked, transient rise in urinary LTE4 following percutaneous coronary interventions. We wondered whether pretreatment of the patients with a 5-LO inhibitor would attenuate this CysLTs response, and if so, whether it would influence heart rhythm. This seemed particularly interesting because of expression of CysLT2R receptor in human conductive system, human endothelial, and coronary smooth muscle cells (4, 25, 26). A prominent function of this receptor in vascular responses was suggested (4), though its precise role has been difficult to establish because of lack of specific antagonists.

        "title": "Leukotrienes biosynthesis in vascular surgery patients during perioperative period.",
        "abstract": "Leukotrienes (LTs), highly bioactive lipid mediators play a major role in inflammation, wound healing and in the development of atherosclerosis. LTs biosynthesis have been suggested to be increased in myocardial infarction (MI) and in surgical patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Among LTs, Cysteinyl-LTs have the most potent biological properties and their production is well reflected by LTE4 concentration in urine (uLTE4). Aim of the study was to evaluate perioperative biosynthesis of uLTE4 in noncardiac vascular surgery patients, and its impact on patients' outcomes. Twenty eight consecutive patients aged 61.5 (59.0-72.5) that undergone an elective surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; n=6) or peripheral artery disease (PAD; n=22) were studied. uLTE4 was measured in urine samples using ELISA: before surgery (LT0), 6 hours postoperatively (LT1), and on three following days (LT2-LT4), and the results were adjusted for the urinary creatinine concentration. Patients were followed-up for 30-days for cardio-vascular complications including myocardial infarction (MI) with active post-surgery troponin T screening. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements and logistic regression tests were used to analyse the data with P<05 considered significant. Excretion of uLTE4 raised in the first two urine sample (LT1 and LT2) after surgery as compared to preoperative baseline value (LT0) (P=0.008) and returned to normal values on the second day (LT3). Patients that suffered MI during postoperative period had increased uLTE4 levels when compared to the no-MI patients (P=0.006). In conclusion we state that uLTE4 biosynthesis is increased shortly after surgery and returns to the preoperative level on the second day. The increase in uLTE4 biosynthesis is higher in patients that suffer MI after surgery, however this warrants further investigations.",
