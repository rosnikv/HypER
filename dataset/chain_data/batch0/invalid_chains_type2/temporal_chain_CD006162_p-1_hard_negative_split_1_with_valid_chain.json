        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nRimonabant, a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker, may reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in patients who are overweight or obese.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of rimonabant with placebo each in conjunction with diet and exercise for sustained changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors over 2 years.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 3045 obese (body mass index > or =30) or overweight (body mass index >27 and treated or untreated hypertension or dyslipidemia) adult patients at 64 US and 8 Canadian clinical research centers from August 2001 to April 2004.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAfter a 4-week single-blind placebo plus diet (600 kcal/d deficit) run-in period, patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg/d of rimonabant, or 20 mg/d of rimonabant for 1 year. Rimonabant-treated patients were rerandomized to receive placebo or continued to receive the same rimonabant dose while the placebo group continued to receive placebo during year 2.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBody weight change over year 1 and prevention of weight regain during year 2. Additional efficacy measures included changes in waist circumference, plasma lipid levels, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt year 1, the completion rate was 309 (51%) patients in the placebo group, 620 (51%) patients in the 5 mg of rimonabant group, and 673 (55%) patients in the 20 mg of rimonabant group. Compared with the placebo group, the 20 mg of rimonabant group produced greater mean (SEM) reductions in weight (-6.3 [0.2] kg vs -1.6 [0.2] kg; P<.001), waist circumference (-6.1 [0.2] cm vs -2.5 [0.3] cm; P<.001), and level of triglycerides (percentage change, -5.3 [1.2] vs 7.9 [2.0]; P<.001) and a greater increase in level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (percentage change, 12.6 [0.5] vs 5.4 [0.7]; P<.001). Patients who were switched from the 20 mg of rimonabant group to the placebo group during year 2 experienced weight regain while those who continued to receive 20 mg of rimonabant maintained their weight loss and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. Use of different imputation methods to account for the high rate of dropouts in all 3 groups yielded similar results. Rimonabant was generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse event was nausea (11.2% for the 20 mg of rimonabant group vs 5.8% for the placebo group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this multicenter trial, treatment with 20 mg/d of rimonabant plus diet for 2 years promoted modest but sustained reductions in weight and waist circumference and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the trial was limited by a high drop-out rate and longer-term effects of the drug require further study. Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00029861.",

However, no obesity management strategy has demonstrated the ability to slow progression of coronary disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether weight loss and metabolic effects of the selective cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist rimonabant reduces progression of coronary disease in patients with abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS\nRandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-group, parallel-group trial (enrollment December 2004-December 2005) comparing rimonabant with placebo in 839 patients at 112 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients received dietary counseling, were randomized to receive rimonabant (20 mg daily) or matching placebo, and underwent coronary intravascular ultrasonography at baseline (n = 839) and study completion (n = 676).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy parameter was change in percent atheroma volume (PAV); the secondary efficacy parameter was change in normalized total atheroma volume (TAV).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the rimonabant vs placebo groups, PAV (95% confidence interval [CI]) increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.54%) vs 0.51% (0.22% to 0.80%) (P = .22), respectively, and TAV decreased 2.2 mm3 (-4.09 to -0.24) vs an increase of 0.88 mm3 (-1.03 to 2.79) (P = .03). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, imputing results based on baseline characteristics for patients not completing the trial, PAV increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.55%) vs 0.57% (0.29% to 0.84%) (P = .13), and TAV decreased 1.95 mm3 (-3.8 to -0.10) vs an increase of 1.19 mm3 (-0.73 to 3.12) (P = .02). Rimonabant-treated patients had a larger reduction in body weight (4.3 kg [-5.1 to -3.5] vs 0.5 kg [-1.3 to 0.3]) and greater decrease in waist circumference (4.5 cm [-5.4 to -3.7] vs 1.0 cm [-1.9 to -0.2]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 5.8 mg/dL (4.9 to 6.8) (22.4%) vs 1.8 mg/dL (0.9 to 2.7) (6.9%) (P < .001), and median triglyceride levels decreased 24.8 mg/dL (-35.4 to -17.3) (20.5%) vs 8.9 mg/dL (-14.2 to -1.8) (6.2%) (P < .001). Rimonabant-treated patients had greater decreases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (1.3 mg/dL [-1.7 to -1.2] [50.3%] vs 0.9 mg/dL [-1.4 to -0.5] [30.9%]) and less increase in glycated hemoglobin levels (0.11% [0.02% to 0.20%] vs 0.40% [0.31% to 0.49%]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). Psychiatric adverse effects were more common in the rimonabant group (43.4% vs 28.4%, P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter 18 months of treatment, the study failed to show an effect for rimonabant on disease progression for the primary end point (PAV) but showed a favorable effect on the secondary end point (TAV).

ADAGIO-Lipids assessed the effect of rimonabant on cardiometabolic risk factors and intraabdominal and liver fat. Methods and Results\u2014803 abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides [TG] or reduced high-density lipoprotein\u2013cholesterol [HDL-C]) were randomized to placebo or rimonabant 20 mg/d for 1 year. HDL-C and TG were coprimary end points. Intraabdominal (visceral) and liver fat were measured by computed tomography in a subgroup of 231 patients. In total, 73% of rimonabant- and 70% of placebo-treated patients completed the study treatment. Rimonabant 20 mg produced significantly greater changes from baseline versus placebo in HDL-C (+7.4%) and TG levels (\u221218%; P<0.0001), as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL particle sizes, apolipoprotein A1 and B, HDL2, HDL3, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels (all P<0.05). Rimonabant decreased abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) cross-sectional area by 5.1% compared to placebo (P<0.005), with a greater reduction in visceral AT (\u221210.1% compared to placebo; P<0.0005), thereby reducing the ratio of visceral/subcutaneous AT (P<0.05). Rimonabant significantly reduced liver fat content (liver/spleen attenuation ratio; P<0.005). Systolic (\u22123.3 mm Hg) and diastolic (\u22122.4 mm Hg) blood pressure were significantly reduced with rimonabant versus placebo (P<0.0001). The safety profile of rimonabant was consistent with previous studies; gastrointestinal, nervous system, psychiatric, and general adverse events were more common with rimonabant 20 mg. Conclusions\u2014In abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia, rimonabant 20 mg significantly improved multiple cardiometabolic risk markers and induced significant reductions in both intraabdominal and liver fat.",

        "abstract": "Endocannabinoids and cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors have been implicated in cardiac dysfunction, inflammation, and cell death associated with various forms of shock, heart failure, and atherosclerosis, in addition to their recognized role in the development of various cardiovascular risk factors in obesity/metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In this study, we explored the role of CB1 receptors in myocardial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative/nitrative stress, cell death, and interrelated signaling pathways, using a mouse model of type 1 diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was characterized by increased myocardial endocannabinoid anandamide levels, oxidative/nitrative stress, activation of p38/Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), enhanced inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, cyclooxygenase 2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), increased expression of CB1, advanced glycation end product (AGE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end product [RAGE], angiotensin II receptor type 1 [AT1R]), p47(phox) NADPH oxidase subunit, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain isozyme switch, accumulation of AGE, fibrosis, and decreased expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of CB1 receptors attenuated the diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and the above-mentioned pathological alterations. Activation of CB1 receptors by endocannabinoids may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy by facilitating MAPK activation, AT1R expression/signaling, AGE accumulation, oxidative/nitrative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Conversely, CB1 receptor inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of diabetic cardiovascular complications.",

        "abstract": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been implicated in cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy associated with heart failure, and atherosclerosis, in addition to its recognized role in metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Numerous studies have presented contradictory findings about the role of HO-1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, we explored the role of HO-1 in myocardial dysfunction, myofibril structure, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model in mice systemically overexpressing HO-1 (Tg-HO-1) or mutant HO-1 (Tg-mutHO-1). The diabetic mouse model was induced by multiple peritoneal injections of STZ. Two months after injection, left ventricular (LV) function was measured by echocardiography. In addition, molecular biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated using classical molecular biological/biochemical techniques. Mice with DCM exhibited severe LV dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, aberrant cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and increased levels of HO-1. In addition, we determined that systemic overexpression of HO-1 ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in DCM mice. Furthermore, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation is normally inhibited in DCM, but overexpression of the HO-1 gene restored the phosphorylation of these kinases to normal levels. In contrast, the functions of HO-1 in DCM were significantly reversed by overexpression of mutant HO-1. This study underlines the unique roles of HO-1, including the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and the enhancement of autophagy, in the pathogenesis of DCM.",

        "abstract": "Heart failure is associated with generalized insulin resistance. Moreover, insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity increases the risk of heart failure even after adjusting for traditional risk factors. Insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus alters the systemic and neurohumoral milieu, leading to changes in metabolism and signaling pathways in the heart that may contribute to myocardial dysfunction. In addition, changes in insulin signaling within cardiomyocytes develop in the failing heart. The changes range from activation of proximal insulin signaling pathways that may contribute to adverse left ventricular remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction to repression of distal elements of insulin signaling pathways such as forkhead box O transcriptional signaling or glucose transport, which may also impair cardiac metabolism, structure, and function. This article will review the complexities of insulin signaling within the myocardium and ways in which these pathways are altered in heart failure or in conditions associated with generalized insulin resistance.

        "title": "Insulin receptor substrate signaling controls cardiac energy metabolism and heart failure.",
        "abstract": "The heart is an insulin-dependent and energy-consuming organ in which insulin and nutritional signaling integrates to the regulation of cardiac metabolism, growth and survival. Heart failure is highly associated with insulin resistance, and heart failure patients suffer from the cardiac energy deficiency and structural and functional dysfunction. Chronic pathological conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, involve various mechanisms in promoting heart failure by remodeling metabolic pathways, modulating cardiac energetics and impairing cardiac contractility. Recent studies demonstrated that insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1,-2) are major mediators of both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling responsible for myocardial energetics, structure, function and organismal survival. Importantly, the insulin receptor substrates (IRS) play an important role in the activation of the phosphatidylinositide-3-dependent kinase (PI-3K) that controls Akt and Foxo1 signaling cascade, regulating the mitochondrial function, cardiac energy metabolism and the renin-angiotensin system. Dysregulation of this branch in signaling cascades by insulin resistance in the heart through the endocrine system promotes heart failure, providing a novel mechanism for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, targeting this branch of IRS\u2192PI-3K\u2192Foxo1 signaling cascade and associated pathways may provide a fundamental strategy for the therapeutic and nutritional development in control of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focus on insulin signaling and resistance in the heart and the role energetics play in cardiac metabolism, structure and function.",

        "abstract": "Heart failure and related morbidity and mortality are increasing at an alarming rate, in large part, because of increases in aging, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

        "title": "Mitophagy Is Essential for Maintaining Cardiac Function During High Fat Diet-Induced Diabetic Cardiomyopathy",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Diabetic patients develop cardiomyopathy characterized by hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and intracellular lipid accumulation, termed lipotoxicity. Diabetic hearts utilize fatty acids as a major energy source, which produces high levels of oxidative stress, thereby inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Objective: To elucidate how mitochondrial function is regulated in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results: Mice were fed either a normal diet or high-fat diet (HFD, 60 kcal % fat). Although autophagic flux was activated by HFD consumption, peaking at 6 weeks (P<0.05), it was attenuated thereafter. Mitophagy, evaluated with Mito-Keima, was increased after 3 weeks of HFD feeding (mitophagy area: 8.3% per cell with normal diet and 12.4% with HFD) and continued to increase even after 2 months (P<0.05). By isolating adult cardiomyocytes from GFP-LC3 mice fed HFD, we confirmed that mitochondria were sequestrated by LC3-positive autophagosomes during mitophagy. In wild-type mice, cardiac hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction (end diastolic pressure-volume relationship =0.051\u00b10.009 in normal diet and 0.11\u00b10.004 in HFD) and lipid accumulation occurred within 2 months of HFD feeding (P<0.05). Deletion of atg7 impaired mitophagy, increased lipid accumulation, exacerbated diastolic dysfunction (end diastolic pressure-volume relationship =0.11\u00b10.004 in wild type and 0.152\u00b10.019 in atg7 cKO; P<0.05) and induced systolic dysfunction (end systolic pressure-volume relationship =24.86\u00b12.46 in wild type and 15.93\u00b11.76 in atg7 cKO; P<0.05) during HFD feeding. Deletion of Parkin partially inhibited mitophagy, increased lipid accumulation and exacerbated diastolic dysfunction (end diastolic pressure-volume relationship =0.124\u00b10.005 in wild type and 0.176\u00b10.018 in Parkin KO, P<0.05) in response to HFD feeding. Injection of TB1 (Tat-Beclin1) activated mitophagy, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased lipid accumulation, and protected against cardiac diastolic dysfunction (end diastolic pressure-volume relationship =0.110\u00b10.009 in Control peptide and 0.078\u00b10.015 in TB1, P<0.05) during HFD feeding. Conclusions: Mitophagy serves as an essential quality control mechanism for mitochondria in the heart during HFD consumption. Impairment of mitophagy induces mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid accumulation, thereby exacerbating diabetic cardiomyopathy. Conversely, activation of mitophagy protects against HFD-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "Targeting mitochondrial quality control with melatonin has been found promising for attenuating diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), although the underlying mechanisms remain largely undefined. Activation of SIRT6 and melatonin membrane receptors exerts cardioprotective effects while little is known about their roles during DCM. Using high\u2010fat diet\u2010streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic rat model, we found that prolonged diabetes significantly decreased nocturnal circulatory melatonin and heart melatonin levels, reduced the expressions of cardiac melatonin membrane receptors, and decreased myocardial SIRT6 and AMPK\u2010PGC\u20101\u03b1\u2010AKT signaling. 16 weeks of melatonin treatment inhibited the progression of DCM and the following myocardial ischemia\u2010reperfusion (MI/R) injury by reducing mitochondrial fission, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy via re\u2010activating SIRT6 and AMPK\u2010PGC\u20101\u03b1\u2010AKT signaling. After the induction of diabetes, adeno\u2010associated virus carrying SIRT6\u2010specific small hairpin RNA or luzindole was delivered to the animals. We showed that SIRT6 knockdown or antagonizing melatonin receptors abolished the protective effects of melatonin against mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by aggravated mitochondrial fission and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Additionally, SIRT6 shRNA or luzindole inhibited melatonin\u2010induced AMPK\u2010PGC\u20101\u03b1\u2010AKT activation as well as its cardioprotective actions. Collectively, we demonstrated that long\u2010term melatonin treatment attenuated the progression of DCM and reduced myocardial vulnerability to MI/R injury through preserving mitochondrial quality control. Melatonin membrane receptor\u2010mediated SIRT6\u2010AMPK\u2010PGC\u20101\u03b1\u2010AKT axis played a key role in this process. Targeting SIRT6 with melatonin treatment may be a promising strategy for attenuating DCM and reducing myocardial vulnerability to ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury in diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic brains are more vulnerable to ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury. Previous studies have proved that melatonin could protect against cerebral ischemia\u2010reperfusion (CIR) injury in non\u2010diabetic stroke models; however, its roles and the underlying mechanisms against CIR injury in diabetic mice remain unknown. Streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic mice and high\u2010glucose\u2010cultured HT22 cells were exposed to melatonin, with or without administration of the autophagy inhibitor 3\u2010methyladenine (3\u2010MA) and the specifically silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor EX527, and then subjected to CIR or oxygen\u2010glucose deprivation/reperfusion operation. We found that diabetic mice showed aggravated brain damage, increased apoptosis and oxidative stress, and deficient autophagy following CIR compared with non\u2010diabetic counterparts. Melatonin treatment exhibited improved histological damage, neurological outcomes, and cerebral infarct size. Intriguingly, melatonin markedly increased cell survival, anti\u2010oxidative and anti\u2010apoptosis effects, and significantly enhanced autophagy. However, these effects were largely attenuated by 3\u2010MA or EX527. Additionally, our cellular experiments demonstrated that melatonin increased the SIRT1\u2010BMAL1 pathway\u2010related proteins' expression in a dose\u2010dependent manner. In conclusion, these results indicate that melatonin treatment can protect against CIR\u2010induced brain damage in diabetic mice, which may be achieved by the autophagy enhancement mediated by the SIRT1\u2010BMAL1 pathway.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the protective effects of melatonin on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic mice, which is related to the source paper's topic. Although it focuses on a different pathway (SIRT1-BMAL1) and context (cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury), it shares some similarities with the source paper (melatonin and diabetic mice). The hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it also investigates the role of melatonin in protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury."

        "title": "The Role of Pyroptosis and Autophagy in Ischemia Reperfusion Injury",
        "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a process of programmed cell death mediated by gasdermin (GSDM) found in recent years. In the process of pyroptosis, caspase-1 or caspase-11/4/5 is activated, which cleaves gasdermin D and separates its N-terminal pore-forming domain (PFD). The oligomers of PFD bind to the cell membrane and form macropores on the membrane, resulting in cell swelling and membrane rupture. Increasing evidence indicates that pyroptosis is involved in many diseases, including ischemia reperfusion injury. Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process in eukaryotic cells. It plays an important role in the survival and maintenance of cells by degrading organelles, proteins, and macromolecules in the cytoplasm and recycling degradation products. Increasing evidence shows that dysfunctional autophagy participates in many diseases. Recently, autophagy and pyroptosis have been reported to play a vital role in the process of ischemia/reperfusion injury, but the related mechanisms are not completely clear. Therefore, this article reviews the role of autophagy and pyroptosis in ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury and analyzes the related mechanisms to provide a basis for future research.",

        "title": "Synthesis of Formononetin Derivatives and Cardioprotective Effects.",
        "abstract": "This study aims to design and synthesize a series of novel formononetin (FMN) derivatives and explore their protective effects on oxygen glucose deprivation/relapse (OGD/R) damage to H9C2 cells, along with their molecular regulatory mechanisms. The OGD/R model was established to simulate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. The protective effects of these novel compounds on H9C2 cells were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, while the apoptosis rate, myocardial enzyme activity, and autophagy reaction post-compound treatment were assessed using kit-based methods. The formation of autophagosomes in H9C2 cells was observed via transmission electron microscopy, and the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, Beclin-1, and P62 were determined using Western blotting. The experimental findings demonstrated that compounds 1-6 (C1-6) exhibited varying degrees of protective effects on damaged H9C2 cells, generally outperforming the parent compound FMN. Among these compounds, C4 demonstrated the most significant activity, even surpassing the positive control drug diltiazem. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that C4 could mitigate apoptosis rates, reduce the activity of myocardial enzyme (such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CK), diminish the number of autophagic vesicles, and restore excessive autophagy. Additionally, C4 exerted its protective effects by downregulating the expression of autophagic proteins PI3K, Akt, Beclin-1, P62, LC3 and ATG12. These results indicated that C4 regulates autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/Beclin-1 signaling pathway, thereby exerting a protective effect on cardiomyocytes. Therefore, C4 emerges as a potential myocardial protective drug, offering a new research direction and strategy for the treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
